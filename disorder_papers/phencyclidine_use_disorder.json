      "title": "Storage and shelf-life of drugs: when is it important?",
      "abstract": "Drugs may deteriorate on storage through chemical or physical changes, especially in conditions of damp, extremes of temperature or direct sunlight. The result of treating patients with partly degraded drugs is probably a lessening of therapeutic response which may be difficult to recognise or quantify, but if degradation is significant it can nevertheless have serious consequences, e. g. the use of inactive glyceryl trinitrate tablets, adrenaline injection or aminophylline suppositories. Positive harm has also been caused by degraded drugs. Examples are Fanconi-like syndrome from the ingestion of degraded tetracycline (made up with an acid excipient that is no longer used) 1 and rectal ulceration produced by the use of partially oxidised paraldehyde with a high acetic acid content. 2 Bacterial contamination of infusion solutions has led to infections in patients.",

      "title": "The various liquid preparations of penicillin-V",
      "abstract": "Liquid preparations of penicillin V (phenoxymethylpenicillin) come in several different strengths, ranging from Phenoxymethylpenicillin Mixture BNF, which contains 62.5 mg in 5 ml, to Penicals 333 (Leo), which has 333 mg in 5 ml (see table). It is worth noting that some preparations with the same brand name are marketed in more than one strength. Children over the age of one year require a dose of 125 mg or more six-hourly and most of the proprietary preparations provide this amount in 5 ml. Failure to realise that the BNF mixture contains only 62.5 mg/5 ml can inadvertently lead to inadequate treatment, if phenoxymethylpenicillin mixture is prescribed in terms of volume only (one teaspoonful, or 5 ml, six-hourly). The dose should therefore always be stated in mg of penicillin. The pharmacist who checks with the prescriber in any instance of apparent urderdosage (e.g. ‘Penicillin V mixture 5 ml, six-hourly’ for a two-year-old, i.e. only 62.5 mg in the present BNF formulation) deserves thanks.",

      "abstract": "Ketamine is a rapid-acting anesthetic commonly used during surgical procedures in both animals and humans, as an experimental drug in the treatment of chronic pain, and as a probe for the study of the cause of schizophrenia. When used medically as an anesthetic it is administered as an intravenous (IV) solution, but when diverted to the illicit market it can be injected, snorted, smoked, or consumed in drinks. Ketamine produces effects similar in some respects to phencyclidine (PCP) and lysergic acid (LSD), but of shorter duration. Psychedelic effects are produced quickly by low doses of the drug, although larger doses are frequently used in an attempt to produce \"near-death\" experiences. Convulsions and death can be caused by higher doses, although most deaths in which ketamine is detected are the result of poly-drug use or trauma. Reports of ketamine use at rave parties attended by young adults appear to be on the rise. The effects from ketamine last from 1-5 hours, and ketamine can be detected in the urine for a period of 1-2 days following use.",

      "title": "Lisdexamfetamine for ADHD: Extended-Action Psychostimulant Offers Daylong Coverage and Has Comparatively Low Abuse Potential",
      "abstract": "Lisdexamfetamine--FDA-approved to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children ages 6 to 12 (Table 1)--reduces ADHD symptoms during and after school and may be less likely to be abused than other psycho-stimulants, particularly immediate-release preparations, clinical data suggest. Clinical implications Because it is effective for about 12 hours, lisdexamfetamine might improve the child's ability to complete homework and participate in extracurricular activities, which in turn might enhance academic performance and/or socialization skills. Lisdexamfetamine could help the child with ADHD who shows no contraindications to the drug (page 105)--particularly if he or she needs daylong coverage. How it works Lisdexamfetamine--a dextroamphetamine derivative--is rapidly absorbed and converted to dextroamphetamine, which is believed to exert therapeutic effect by: * blocking norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake into presynaptic neurons * increasing the neurotransmitters' release into the extraneuronal space. The medication's amphetamine release is highly predictable, which contributes to its therapeutic benefit in ADHD. Amphetamine is released through GI metabolism of lisdexamfetamine, which produces the active d-amphetamine moiety that reaches the bloodstream. The medication is derived from d-amphetamine, with negligible amounts of lysine cleaved. Lisdexamfetamine requires in vivo metabolism (in the GI tract) to its active constituent d-amphetamine. As a result, the medication will not produce high d-amphetamine blood levels--and should not cause euphoria or other reinforcing effects--if injected or snorted. Its abuse potential is lower overall compared with immediate-release psychostimulant formulations. Pharmacokinetics Dextroamphetamine's plasma elimination half-life is approximately 9 1/2 hours--which accounts for lisdexamfetamine's extended action. The drug reaches steady-state concentrations in 2 to 3 days. Food does not affect absorption and delays maximum concentration by 1 hour or less, so taking lisdexamfetamine during breakfast should not slow its therapeutic effect. Because dextroamphetamine reaches maximum concentration in approximately 3 1/2 hours, the medication should take effect by the time the child gets to school. In one randomized, phase-2 trial, children with ADHD who received lisdexamfetamine, 30 to 70 mg/d, showed overall improvement within 2 hours after dosing. (1) Efficacy Lisdexamfetamine reduced ADHD symptoms in 2 double-blind studies: a phase-2 crossover study and a phase-3 random-dose trial. Phase-2 crossover study. (2) Fifty-two children ages 6 to 12 with combined or hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD received extended-release mixed amphetamine salts (MAS) for 3 weeks. Subjects received 10 mg/d or dosages titrated to 20 or 30 mg/d based on response to medication. The youths then were divided into 3 groups based on optimal MAS dosage and received 3 treatments for 1 week each: * group 1: placebo; MAS, 10 mg/d; lisdexamfetamine, 30 mg/d * group 2: placebo; MAS, 20 mg/d; lisdexamfetamine, 50 mg/d * group 3: placebo; MAS, 30 mg/d; lisdexamfetamine, 70 mg/d. While taking lisdexamfetamine or MAS, subjects showed similar improvement in behavior, based on Swanson, Kotkin, Agler, M-Flynn, and Pelham (SKAMP) scores, and inattention, based on SKAMP and Permanent Product Measure of Performance scores. Both psychostimulants outperformed placebo in both measures, and both improved behavior more decisively than inattention. Based on post-hoc analysis, improvement 12 hours after dosing was more substantial with lisdexamfetamine than with MAS. Phase-3 random-dose trial. (3) A total of 290 children ages 6 to 12 with combined or hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD were washed out from prior medications over 1 week, then received lisdexamfetamine or placebo for 4 weeks. …",

      "title": "Benzodiazepine dependence and its treatment with low dose flumazenil",
      "abstract": "Globally benzodiazepines remain one of the most prescribed medication groups, especially in the primary care setting. With such high levels of prescribing it is not surprising that benzodiazepine dependence is common, cutting across all socioeconomic levels. Despite recognition of the potential for the development of iatrogenic dependence and the lack of any effective treatment, benzodiazepines continue to be widely prescribed in general practice. Conventional dependence management, benzodiazepine tapering, is commonly a protracted process over several weeks or months. It is often associated with significant withdrawal symptoms and craving leading to patient drop out and return to use. Accordingly, there is a worldwide need to find effective pharmacotherapeutic interventions for benzodiazepine dependence. One drug of increasing interest is the GABAA benzodiazepine receptor antagonist/partial agonist, flumazenil. Multiple bolus intravenous infusions of low dose flumazenil used either with or without benzodiazepine tapering can reduce withdrawal sequelae, and/or longer term symptoms in the months following withdrawal. Preliminary data suggest that continuous intravenous or subcutaneous flumazenil infusion for 4 days significantly reduces acute benzodiazepine withdrawal sequelae. The subcutaneous infusion was shown to be tissue compatible so the development of a longer acting (i.e. several weeks) depot flumazenil formulation has been explored. This could be capable of managing both acute and longer term benzodiazepine withdrawal sequelae. Preliminary in vitro water bath and in vivo biocompatibility data in sheep show that such an implant is feasible and so is likely to be used in clinical trials in the near future.",

As therapeutic use increases, the risk increases of unintentional overdoses, medication errors, and intentional overdoses caused by abuse, misuse, or suicide gestures and attempts.

Clinical manifestations of overdoses include agitation, hallucinations, psychosis, lethargy, seizures, tachycardia, dysrhythmias, hypertension, and hyperthermia.

Paraphenylenediamine (< 4%), resorcinol, propylene glycol, liquid paraffin, cetostearyl alcohol, sodium lauryl sulfate, EDTA sodium, herbal extracts, preservatives, and perfumes. Paraphenylene diamine and resorcinol are known toxicants with multi-organ effects, while the toxicity profiles of others are not known. It causes systemic toxicity, manifested by severe edema of neck and face and laryngeal edema with respiratory distress frequently requiring emergency tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation. It also causes rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, culminating in death if not treated aggressively. The controlled supervision over trading of hair dye is necessary to stop Paraphenylenediamine poisoning.  We recommend that the selling of hair dye containing PPD should be controlled and public education programme should be initiated in this regard.",

A 20-year-old male with no psychiatric medical history presented to the emergency department (ED) with visual hallucinations, limited ability to communicate, and the inability to move his right lower extremity. In addition, the patient experienced multiple apneic incidents in the ED. His delirium was determined to be secondary to taking a single 5-325 mg hydrocodone tablet. Administration of naloxone reversed the patient's symptoms. Cases reporting the development of delirium in patients who have taken opioid-based medications have been published, but these cases involved combinations of medications, higher doses of opioids than our patient ingested, and presentations after multiple days of drug use. Our case is unique given the patient's acute onset of symptoms 4 hours after hydrocodone ingestion, as well as the low dose that triggered his symptoms.",

During this time he gradually becomes more paranoid and disorganized. He then desists for a day or two and falls into a prolonged semicomatose state.

      "abstract": "1 Activity of short- and long-acting benzodiazepines is reviewed with reference to pharmacokinetics and residual sequelae, and to efficacy and adverse effects. 2 Some benzodiazepines may not lead to obvious effects on performance, such as nordiazepam and clobazam, and the persistence of residual sequelae may not relate obviously to elimination half-lives (as with diazepam and possibly flunitrazepam). However, benzodiazepines with mean half-lives less than 8 h may have residual sequelae, whereas hypnotics with mean half-lives greater than 16 h are likely to lead to impared performance and/or anxiolytic effects the next day. 3 Potassium chlorazepate 15 mg, with its long-acting metabolite nordiazepam, would seem to be the drug of choice for insomnia secondary to anxiety. For the insomniac without significant psychopathology, temazepam 10-20 mg, triazolam 0.125-0.25 mg and for occasional use, diazepam 5-10 mg, provide the initial approach. Flurazepam hydrochloride 15-30 mg, nitrazepam 5-10 mg and flunitrazepam 1 mg and above, have persistent residual effects and should be reserved for refractory patients, and for those in whom some impairment of performance the next day would be acceptable. 4 There is little or no evidence to suggest that the proper use of the short-acting hypnotics, triazolam and temazepam, leads to a worsening of sleep on withdrawal. However, some benzodiazepines may lead to disturbances of sleep and/or rebound insomnia, and nitrazepam and flunitrazepam may be implicated.",

      "abstract": "Duloxetine is the first relatively balanced serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor to be widely available for three indications including: major depressive disorder, peripheral diabetic neuropathic pain and female stress urinary incontinence, although it is not currently approved for all indications in all countries. Generally, duloxetine is safe and well-tolerated across indications, with few reported serious side effects. Common adverse events are consistent with the pharmacology of the molecule and are mainly referable to the gastrointestinal and the nervous systems. The studied dose range is up to 400 mg/day (administered 200 mg b.i.d) but the maximum dose approved for marketing is 120 mg/day (administered 60 mg b.i.d). Duloxetine is eliminated (half-life = 12.1 hours) primarily in the urine after extensive hepatic metabolism by multiple oxidative pathways, methylation and conjugation. Duloxetine would not be expected to cause clinically significant inhibition of the metabolic clearance of drugs metabolised by P450 (CYP)3A, (CYP)1A2, (CYP)2C9, or (CYP)2C19, but would be expected to cause some inhibition of CYP 2D6. Duloxetine should not be used in combination CYP 1A2 inhibitors or nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of some of the most important information related to safety and tolerability of duloxetine.",

The decanoate preparation is not only slightly longer-acting but also has a smaller incidence of side-effects that the enanthate. The major adverse effect of these medications is the high frequency of extrapyramidal system disturbance. Since the 50% rate of failure of schizophrenic outpatients to take prescribed oral medications decreases treatment failure to about 20% with the use of long-acting injectable phenothiazines, this route of administration offers an advantage in patient management particularly applicable to community mental health systems. Moreover, parenteral administration of long-acting fluphenazine may be useful for patients who do not attain effective serum levels with medication taken orally because of metabolic or absorption difficulties.",

Adverse effects and overdose of opioidsAnesthesiologists may be frequently involved in the care of patients with acute drug-overdose or with chronic opioid addiction, presenting either for elective or emergency surgery or critical care.Not only do these drugs cause physiological damage to vital organs, but also permanent damage to immune system and brain areas responsible for memory and pain mediation.The lungs, heart and kidneys are at significant risk from the use of injected or inhaled illicit drugs.There increased incidence of pulmonary infections, granulomatous diseases, barotrauma, aspiration pneumonitis and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema [4].Heroin inhalation can produce severe and life-threatening exacerbations of asthma.There can be excessive sympathetic stimulation during drug-induced withdrawal from opioids, precipitating myocardial ischemia in susceptible population.In view of their central nervous system (CNS) depression, overdose can cause stuporous states, especially when abused with alcohol or sedatives.Coma can lead to pressureinduced muscle damage and rhabdomyolysis.Clinically, opioid overdose can be diagnosed by slow respiratory rate, increased tidal volume and miotic pupils [5].It is treated with intravenous opioidantagonist, Naloxone (0.4-0.8 mg, upto a maximum of 2 mg) for reversal of respiratory and CNS depression.Sometimes, endotracheal intubation with short-term mechanical ventilation is required to tide",

      "abstract": "Background: Phenytoin, a commonly prescribed antiepileptic drug, causes side effects like ataxia, tremor, hirsutism, gum hyperplasia, insomnia, confusion, headache and vertigo when used for longer duration. However, chorea is a rarely reported side effect of phenytoin and is completely reversible on stopping treatment.  Case presentation: A twenty-one-year-old Indian male patient, who had generalized epilepsy and had been on sodium valproate for 2 years, presented with acute onset chorea four days after starting phenytoin sodium. He had normal serum phenytoin levels. A thorough evaluation was done, which suggested phenytoin as a possible cause of chorea. Phenytoin was withdrawn, resulting in a dramatic subsiding of chorea. A rechallenge with the drug resulted in reappearance of choreiform movements. These disappeared again after drug withdrawal, implicating phenytoin as the possible etiological agent for chorea. Conclusion: Phenytoin rarely induces involuntary movements as an adverse effect. During phenytoin therapy, if a patient develops involuntary movements, phenytoin toxicity should be suspected even with normal drug levels. This is important as drug withdrawal leads to complete symptomatic improvement thereby avoiding extensive workup for other secondary causes.",

      "abstract": "Benzydamine hydrochloride is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic and antipyretic effects. In those who use medicines containing this agent at high doses (500–3000 mg), some adverse effects such as hallucinosis, stimulant effects in the central nervous system, paranoia, and convulsions can be seen. The drug is vulnerable to abuse because of the stimulant effects on the central nervous system. In this paper, we present a young male patient with symptoms of psychosis due to benzydamine hydrochloride abuse. He was admitted to the psychiatry outpatient clinic with visual hallucinations, fear, and insomnia. His symptoms started after taking 10 tablets of benzydamine hydrochloride (500 mg) 6 months ago, which continued for 1–2 days and spontaneously resolved. The patient used high doses of the drug 3–4 times over a period of 3 months. Although his last drug intake was 3 months ago, his symptoms continued at the time of admission to the clinic. A neurologic examination and detailed laboratory tests of the patient revealed no evidence of a cause for psychotic symptoms. The patient was scheduled to undergo oral antipsychotic therapy. Although similar cases have been reported in the literature, this is the only case in which psychosis was still present despite discontinuation of the drug. Our aim was to contribute to the literature on the use of BH in causing chronic psychosis and to draw attention to the growing number of BH abuse cases.",

      "abstract": "Gama hexacholorocyclohexane ( γ HCH; lindane), Gammallin is an organochlorine chemical that has been used as an agricultural insecticide as well as a pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies. It is reported to be neurotoxic, interfering with GABA neurotransmitter functions and other biological functions from brain to endocrine and cardiovascular systems. Despite being a banned persistent organic pollutant, it's still in use and can leach and contaminate our foods and water. We have investigated the effects and the mechanism(s) of lindane‐induced vascular dysfunctions in rat aorta. Rats treated with low dose of single pesticide Lindane (100 or 300 μmol/kg;1/5LD50; SP) or multiple pesticides (MP) (aldrin, endosulfan, lindane, 4,4‐DDT, and endrin: 1/100, 1/50, and 1/25 of the LD 50 , MP) orally or dermal application for 2 or 4 weeks showed significantly attenuated vascular relaxation (57 ± 5% to 36 ± 0.8%; ACh 10 −3 M), MP attenuated relaxation (57 ± 5% to 19.8 ±5.8% and 19.0 ±4.0% respectively for 1/100 and 1/25 LD50). Paradoxically, 4 weeks SP enhanced relaxation to ACh (60.5 ± 4.6% to 83.5 ± 8.8%). In aorta from dermal group (SP), relaxation to ACh was significantly attenuated (59.4 ± 5.0 to 23.7 ± 6.0%). Vasoconstriction to PE (10 −8 ‐10 −3 M) were significantly attenuated by 4 weeks' treatment with oral SP or dermal MP reducing the contraction (0.64±0.06 to 0.15 ± 0.02gm or 0.49±0.01 gm; 10 −3 M), but not for 2 weeks oral MP for PE‐induced contraction. Further investigation into the mechanism behind the observed vascular dysfunction reveals that in CHO cell line stably expressing M 1 ‐ACh receptors, Lindane diminishes carbachol (10 −8 to 10 −3 M)‐induced increases in [Ca 2+ ] i mediated by M 1 ‐ACh receptor. Lindane diminishes Carbachol effects only at Carbachol's maximum activation and these results indicate that the vascular dysfunction by the pesticides could be due to disruption of intracellular Ca 2+ regulation. Thus, 24‐hour Lindane exposure facilitates IP 3 ‐mediated [Ca 2+] i signaling. Month‐long Lindane exposure induces vascular dysfunction possibly via disruption of IP 3 ‐mediated in [Ca 2+ ] i signaling leading to dysregulated vasoresponsiveness to hormones/neurotransmitters contributing to cardiovascular dysfunctions.

      "abstract": "The advent of benzodiazepines in the 1960s provided their wide use in neurology and psychiatry. They proved to be myorelaxant and anticonvulsive therapy in neurology; their anxiolytic and hypnotic properties have made them the treatment of choice for insomnia and anxiety problems; they have also been used in alcohol withdrawal and in anesthesia, and for a wide range of treatments in other clinical branches. However, reports giving rise to a prescription controversy including abuse, harmful effects, intoxication and dependence toward addiction appeared soon. On the other hand, the revolutionary appearance of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) overshadowed benzodiazepines. According to recommendations of many scientific and professional institutions, the use of benzodiazepines has been gradually excluded or reduced or limited to short-term use. However, clinical experience showed that benzodiazepines are frequently used for long-term treatment, and there are many reasons for this, e.g., prescribing tradition, patient preference, difficulties associated with benzodiazepine withdrawal (even in patients taking low doses) because they have a rapid clinical onset of action, and good efficacy with few initial adverse effects. Moreover, SSRIs as alternative drugs are associated with incomplete therapeutic response and more uncomfortable adverse effects. Some authors therefore point out that the rationale for the shift from benzodiazepines to SSRIs is inappropriate.",

The abuse potential of these drugs when taken by the intravenous route is greater than when taken orally and is comparable to that of heroin or cocaine. Tolerance builds rapidly and an abstinence syndrome develops which leads to a typical pattern in which the user takes the drug continuously and in immense doses for about five days during which he does not sleep. During this time he gradually becomes more paranoid and disorganized. He then desists for a day or two and falls into a prolonged semicomatose state. Upon awakening he is still lethargic and feels the need to resume his drug for a new round.",

      "title": "The Continuing Search for a Succinylcholine Replacement",
      "abstract": "Department of Anesthesia and Perio-perative Care, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California. caldwell@anesthesia.ucsf.eduTHE introduction of succinylcholine into clinical practice in 1951 was a seminal development in the history of anesthesia. Since that time, anesthesiologists have had access to a neuromuscular blocking drug (muscle relaxant) with a very rapid onset and a duration of action of approximately 10 min. The clinical utility of succinylcholine has been counterbalanced by its many undesirable effects, ranging from the relatively benign (fasciculations) to life-threatening events (hyperkalemia or malignant hyperthermia). 1The adverse effects of succinylcholine are almost all related to its depolarizing mechanism of action. Consequently, there has been a continual search for a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant that can replicate both the rapid onset and short duration of succinylcholine. In this issue of the Journal, three articles report on preclinical and preliminary clinical investigations of such a drug, GW280430A. 2–4Structurally, GW280430A is an asymmetric mixed-tetrahydroisoquinolinium chlorofumarate. 5Of the drugs in clinical practice, the one to which it bears the closest structural resemblance is mivacurium. The exact mechanism underlying its short duration is not fully elucidated; it appears to undergo rapid degradation in the plasma by chemical (nonenzymatic) mechanisms. 6GW280430A has been studied in a variety of animal species—cat, dog, and rhesus monkey—with promising results for onset and duration and a good safety profile with regard to histamine-releasing potential. 3,4In assessing the possible clinical utility of this drug, its apparent strengths must be weighed against its potential for adverse effects.In humans, the onset of GW280430A over the range of 1.8–4.0xED95 doses is 1.5–1.7 min and it has a very narrow range (1.1–2.0 min). 2This narrow range of onset times is remarkable for a nondepolarizing relaxant and resembles more the tight distribution of onset time seen with succinylcholine. 7However, this result may be an artifact due to the small number and physiologic homogeneity of the volunteer subjects studied; it is unlikely to represent the true distribution in patients. Regardless, the onset, although perhaps not as rapid as that of succinylcholine, may be sufficient to facilitate rapid-sequence intubation in most clinical situations. 8Of some interest is that onset time did not diminish with doses greater than 1.9xED95. This may again be due to the small number of subjects, or it might be an example of the diminishing return observed as onset times approach the limit determined by circulation time and diffusion of drug into the neuromuscular junction.This Editorial View accompanies the following articles: Belmont MR, Lien CA, Tjan J, Bradley E, Stein B, Patel SS, Savarese JJ: Clinical pharmacology of GW280430A in humans. Anesthesiology 2004; 100:768–73; Savarese JJ, Belmont MR, Hashim MA, Mook RA Jr, Boros EE, Samano V, Patel SS, Feldman PL, Schultz J-AI, McNulty M, Spitzer T, Cohn DL, Morgan P, Wastila WB: Preclinical pharmacology of GW280430A (AV430A) in the rhesus monkey and in the cat: A comparison with mivacurium. Anesthesiology 2004; 100:835–45; Heerdt PM, Kang R, The’ A, Hashim M, Mook RJ Jr, Savarese JJ: Cardiopulmonary effects of the novel neuromuscular blocking drug GW280430A (AV430A) in dogs. Anesthesiology 2004; 100:846–51.In addition to its rapid onset, GW280430A has a very short duration of action. In a dose of 0.4 mg/kg (2.2xED95), recovery to a train-of-four ratio of 0.9 took only 14 min. This may be regarded as essentially complete recovery for a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. 9,10An equivalent degree of recovery for succinylcholine would be represented by the single twitch recovering to between 90% and 100% of predrug level. For a standard intubating dose of 1.0 mg/kg, this time interval is between 8 and 12 min. 7,11It appears that in respect to its duration of action, GW280430A resembles succinylcholine more closely than does any previous nondepolarizing muscle relaxant. Of particular interest, pharmacologic antagonism with edrophonium 0.5 mg/kg can decrease significantly the already short recovery time of GW280430A. 2The possibility exists, therefore, that edrophonium-accelerated recovery from GW280430A might have a time course that replicates that of succinylcholine.Increasing the dose of GW280430A does not seem to carry a great penalty in respect to the increase in duration of action. 2The numbers in each dose group are too small to make definitive conclusions, but, for example, increasing the dose from 0.36 to 0.72 mg/kg increases recovery time to a train-of-four ratio of 0.9, from 11.9 to only 15.1 min. The other notable aspect of the drug is a lack of cumulative effect. The recovery slopes, as represented by the 5–95% or 25–75% intervals, are unaffected by the dose or duration of administration. 2In summary, the time course of action of GW280430A more closely resembles succinylcholine than does any other nondepolarizing muscle relaxant to date.In addition to its positive characteristics, there are some potential problems with GW280430A. 2The structural group to which GW280430A belongs has the propensity to release histamine, 12and GW280430A appears to share this. In doses of 3xED95 and above, histamine release with consequent hypotension, tachycardia, and flushing were noted. What does this mean for the clinical potential of the drug? In all likelihood, clinicians would accept a low risk of histamine-related effects if the drug could truly replace succinylcholine. It appears however, that histamine release may be an actual clinical problem.One of the principal uses for a drug such as GW280430A is to facilitate rapid tracheal intubation. The onset of GW280430A is slightly slower than that of succinylcholine, so clinicians will tend to increase doses to promote good conditions for tracheal intubation. This phenomenon has been documented with mivacurium, 13,14rocuronium, 13and cisatracurium, 15in which doses in the range of 2.5–5.0xED95 are used to speed onset of paralysis prior to tracheal intubation. This experience suggests that clinicians push doses of muscle relaxants upward to improve conditions for tracheal intubation. It is likely that should GW280430A enter clinical use, doses of 3xED95 or greater would be administered. In this dose range, it seems that significant histamine release with consequent adverse effects would occur.The recent experience with rapacuronium is relevant to consideration of GW280430A and its clinical potential. 16To summarize, rapacuronium is a steroidal muscle relaxant with a rapid onset and short duration. 17In clinical trials, there was an incidence of bronchospasm of approximately 9%. 18This was not thought to be of sufficient clinical importance to prevent the general release of the drug. Under the realities of widespread clinical use, there occurred several cases of life-threatening bronchospasm with rapacuronium, particularly in children. 16As a result, 19 months after its release rapacuronium was withdrawn by the manufacturer. Is there evidence of such a potential problem with GW280430A? The answer, unfortunately, is yes . GW280430A clearly can stimulate release of histamine. In the study of Belmont et al. , clinically significant histamine release occurred in one of four subjects who received 0.54 mg/kg (3.0xED95) and in three of four volunteers receiving 0.72 mg/kg (4xED95). These doses might conceivably be used clinically. 2What can we conclude from these articles? They demonstrate that developing a nondepolarizing replacement for succinylcholine is a realistic possibility. GW280430A has a time course of action very close to that of succinylcholine. There is, however, a large question mark over its histamine-releasing potential. GW280340A may never be released into clinical practice, but it is quite conceivable that a drug closely related to it will be.",

These symptoms were dramatically reduced by administration of cimetidine or ranitidine, and reappeared with a new suspension of the therapy. The withdrawal syndrome from H2-receptor antagonists was reversed by treatment with domperidone (10 mg three times per day), a potent hyperprolactinaemic drug which does not cross the blood brain barrier. These results suggest that the drop in prolactin levels that occurs when cimetidine or ranitidine are suspended may contribute to the development of the withdrawal syndrome.",

This is probably due both to a peripheral mechanism, at the injured site level, which is particularly widespread, and goes from prostaglandin inhibition to suppression of the synthesis of different algesiogenic substances (oxygen free radicals, lytic enzymes), and to a direct non endorphin-mediated action at central level. The data base considered in this review, concerning piroxicam in extra-rheumatic analgesia, is of about 2,500 patients, in 26 clinical studies, mostly with an experimental double-blind placebo-controlled design or vs other NSAIDs. The doses ranged from 5 to 40 mg in a single administration: the doses of 20 and 40 mg showed an immediate analgesic effect, with the onset of analgesia within 30 min./1 hour from the administration. Analgesic activity was intense, comparable or superior to that of other drugs (aspirin, codeine, other NSAIDs) and more prolonged, often lasting as long as 24 hours. Tolerability of this data base was very satisfactory and comparable to that of the placebo, incidence of side effects being negligible.",

      "abstract": "A 12-year-old boy on a dextroamphetamine-clonidine-trazodone treatment regimen had a recurrence of insomnia, and his bedtime trazodone dose was doubled from 50 mg to 100 mg. Within 45 mins after taking the first 100-mg trazodone dose on an empty stomach, the patient had a syncopal episode associated with hypotension, bradycardia, and sedation. The drug reaction could have resulted from either trazodone or clonidine, but it is more likely to have resulted from a pharmacodynamic clonidine-trazodone interaction, presumably aggravated by rapid absorption (on an empty stomach) of a recently increased dose of trazodone. It is conceivable but less likely that the psychostimulant was a clinically significant factor. However, a drug interaction between clonidine and D-amphetamine does not need to be postulated to explain this child's syncopal reaction. The authors advise that (1) if trazodone and clonidine are used concurrently, the doses of both agents should be changed slowly, (2) blood pressure and pulse should be carefully monitored at baseline and then periodically during treatment, and (3) administration of trazodone on an empty stomach, and especially dose increases on an empty stomach, should be avoided. Physicians should remain aware that trazodone has the potential to produce hypotension and sedation, especially when combined with other agents (such as clonidine) that might produce the same adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "The tooth color, which is primarily determined by the dentin tissue, is also influenced by the color, transparency, and thickness of the enamel. Color changes in teeth that occur over time due to intrinsic or extrinsic factors are a significant aesthetic issue that requires treatment. Discoloration, especially in the front teeth, leads to a loss of self-confidence in patients, and as a result, they are unable to smile comfortably. It is usually possible to remove extrinsic stains, which are associated with poor oral hygiene and the consumption of certain foods and beverages throughout the day, using mechanical cleaning methods. In the removal of intrinsic stains, vital whitening (bleaching) is preferred over more invasive treatment methods. Vital tooth whitening, which is considered a minimally invasive approach, includes procedures performed by the dentist in the office (in-office) or at home by the patient under the dentist's guidance. In both applications, the active ingredient in the materials used is hydrogen peroxide( H²O²) or carbamide peroxide. These agents can be used alone or in combination with activation methods such as heat or light. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of in-office whitening treatments in various discoloration cases.",

The usual adult dose for treatment of an established urinary tract infection is 750 mg twice daily. After oral administration, oxolinic acid is absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak serum concentrations of the unconjugated drug are reached in two to four hours. A two-phase elimination pattern has been observed in humans after repeated dosing. Adverse reactions are experienced by 10 to 45% of patients receiving oxolinic acid. Most common adverse reactions are central nervous system toxicity (restlessness, dizziness, headache, drowsiness and visual disturbances) and gastrointestinal reactions (nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and diarrhea). Oxolinic acid is an alternative form of therapy for the penicillin-sensitive, cephalosporinsensitive, or sulfonamide-sensitive adult with recurrent urinary tract infection caused by susceptible Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis that is not complicated by bacteremia. Oxolinic acid should not be prescribed for patients with acute symptomatic urinary tract infection, patierits experiencing bacteremia, pregnant women or children.",

Moreover, no stereospecific inversion of d-indoprofen to the inactive enantiomer occurs after either single or repeated (one week) administration. The pharmacokinetic behaviour of d-indoprofen in the human organism appears to be the same after administration of the racemic form or of the dextro-enantiomer, when the latter is given at half the dose.",

A knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of these agents may help to distinguish between them and may also be important for rational patient prescribing. Encainide and lorcainide both undergo predominantly hepatic elimination: both appear to form metabolites which have antiarrhythmic activity of their own and which have longer elimination half-lives than the parent compounds, resulting in accumulation with chronic administration. Flecainide and tocainide are cleared mainly by the kidneys, do not have active metabolites and have long elimination half-lives. All of the drugs have significant antiarrhythmic activity and this is proportionate to the plasma concentration of either the drug alone or combined with the active metabolites. Comparative effectiveness between the drugs has not been established. In general, all four drugs have only minor adverse effects, principally gastrointestinal or neurological, which may disappear with small dose reductions. However, cardiac effects can also occur and rarely pro-arrhythmic effects have been described, particularly with encainide and flecainide. All four drugs are suitable for long-term administration on a twice-daily basis.",

This is probably due both to a peripheral mechanism, at the injured site level, which is particularly widespread, and goes from prostaglandin inhibition to suppression of the synthesis of different algesiogenic substances (oxygen free radicals, lytic enzymes), and to a direct non endorphin-mediated action at central level. The data base considered in this review, concerning piroxicam in extra-rheumatic analgesia, is of about 2,500 patients, in 26 clinical studies, mostly with an experimental double-blind placebo-controlled design or vs other NSAIDs. The doses ranged from 5 to 40 mg in a single administration: the doses of 20 and 40 mg showed an immediate analgesic effect, with the onset of analgesia within 30 min./1 hour from the administration. Analgesic activity was intense, comparable or superior to that of other drugs (aspirin, codeine, other NSAIDs) and more prolonged, often lasting as long as 24 hours. Tolerability of this data base was very satisfactory and comparable to that of the placebo, incidence of side effects being negligible.",

What if you started a dopamine agonist rather than carbidopa/levodopa after you were first diagnosed? Will the problems be the same? Will it go as smoothly? Will the dose need to be changed? Will carbidopa/levodopa be necessary and if so, when? In this chapter we will focus on these and other questions that arise when your only drug for PD is pramipexole, ropinirole, or pergolide. Parkinsonism tends to slowly worsen over months to years. This is never rapid but insidious. The dopamine agonist drugs are not as effective as carbidopa/ levodopa and they may become inadequate after one to a few years. Sometimes a dosage change is sufficient to overcome the problem, whereas in other cases, the addition of carbidopa/levodopa may be necessary.",

      "title": "Blue breath‐holding spells caused by an alcoholic vitamin D<sub>3</sub> preparation in infancy",
      "abstract": "A frightening or emotionally upsetting event or a painful experience may induce a blue breath-holding spell. Typically, the child cries out, breathes out, and then stops breathing. Shortly afterward, the skin begins to turn blue, and the child becomes unconscious. After a few seconds, breathing resumes and normal skin color and consciousness returns (1). Breath-holding spells, which occur in up to 5% of otherwise healthy children, are quite rare before 6 months of age, peak as children enter the twos, and usually disappear by about age five (1). Since a tendency towards vitamin D deficiency in early infancy remains prevalent also in industrialized countries (2), Swiss infants are prescribed 7.5–12.5 μg of vitamin D3 per day during the first 12 months of life. For this purpose liquid preparations are used, which contain vitamin D3 dissolved either in ethanol 65% (Vi-Dé 3 Wild®) or in medium-chain triglycerides (Vitamin D3 Wild oil®). Presently, the oily vitamin D3 preparation is unavailable in Switzerland owing to preparation difficulties: hence, this widely prescribed preparation has been replaced by the alcoholic preparation. Three families with a negative history of breath-holding spells recently noted that their infants (two girls and one boy aged 5, 8 and 10 weeks), who had been initially given the oily vitamin D3 preparation, stopped breathing, lost consciousness for a short period and the skin began to turn blue immediately after administering the alcoholic vitamin D3 preparation. We suspected the diagnosis of blue breath-holding spells caused by burning sensation in the throat induced by ethanol 65% and confirmed the hypothesis by observing characteristic blue breath-holding spells after the administration of the medicine in the office. No breath-holding spells were noted when the medicine was administered diluted with little milk to render it palatable. In children appreciating the preference for drug preparations is crucial. This communication, which represents the first report on breath-holding spells precipitated by unpleasant gustatory sensations, confirms that, from the perspective of infants, the taste of oily vitamin D3 preparations is considerably better than that of alcoholic vitamin D3 preparations (3).",

      "abstract": "In Europe, about 10% of road traffic victims are under the influence of a psychotropic substance, including illicit drugs and medications, at the time of the accident. Among these drugs, benzodiazepines are often implicated in the occurrence of accidents in both young and elderly users (1, 2). Notably, benzodiazepines and related drugs can lead to drowsiness due to their residual effects, which may persist the day after a bedtime dose. Obviously, these symptoms depend on the duration of action of the molecule, explaining why drivers who have taken long half-life benzodiazepines are over-represented in road accidents (3). Although half-life is not the only determinant of a drug's duration of action and residual effects, the choice of hypnotic molecules with the shortest half-lives and the fewest residual effects on behavioural efficiency has become a challenge in the context of road safety. Zopiclone and zolpidem have thus rapidly become very frequently prescribed hypnotics and are among the five most frequently used in Europe (4).",

      "title": "Sodium oxybate: new drug. Fewer attacks of cataplexy in some patients.",
      "abstract": "(1) Narcolepsy is characterised by sudden, overwhelming daytime drowsiness, sometimes associated with cataplexy (more or less complete loss of muscle tone during an emotional reaction). (2) Modafinil moderately reduces daytime drowsiness but has no effect on cataplexy. Methylphenidate, an amphetamine psychostimulant, seems to act on both drowsiness and cataplexy, although its clinical evaluation is limited to observational series. (3) Oxybic acid, long used in general anaesthesia, but also misused for recreational and criminal purposes (chemical or drug-induced submission), has been approved to treat adults with both narcolepsy and cataplexy, in the form of an oral solution of sodium oxybate. (4) The rationale behind the use of sodium oxybate is to re-establish a near-normal pattern of the different phases of sleep. Because of its short-lasting action, sodium oxybate has to be taken once at bedtime and then again 2.5 to 4 hours later. (5) Clinical evaluation mainly consists of 4 double-blind placebo-controlled trials of sodium oxybate. Three short-term trials, involving 136 patients treated for 4 weeks and 228 and 270 patients treated for 8 weeks, showed that sodium oxybate at a dose of 4.5 g to 9 g a day reduced the number of cataplexy attacks but that a dose of at least 6 g was needed to reduce daytime drowsiness. A trial involving 56 patients who had been taking sodium oxybate for nearly 2 years, assessed the effects of stopping versus continuing treatment. The results suggest that sodium oxybate is effective in the long term. (6) During clinical trials, 61% of patients had adverse effects attributed to sodium oxybate. These included gastrointestinal disorders (nausea (18%)), neurological disorders (dizziness (15%), headache (6%)), confusion (3%), and enuresis (7%). (7) Altered consciousness and respiratory depression occurred after a single intake of a dose two or three times higher than the recommended dose. (8) Misuse, especially to obtain chemical or drug-induced submission (i.e. as a 'date rape' drug), is facilitated by the odourless and colourless nature of the oral solution. (9) In practice, for some patients who are seriously affected by persistent episodes of cataplexy or drowsiness, despite treatment of narcolepsy, sodium oxybate is preferable to methylphenidate, which has been less thoroughly evaluated. However, the risks of misuse and overdose mean that this drug should only be proposed to patients in whom the benefits are likely to outweigh the risks.",

      "title": "In Vitro Permeability, Irritability, and Release Evaluation of Commonly Used Topical Diclofenac Gel Preparations (1%, 5%, and 10%).",
      "abstract": "Recently, there has been an increase in the use of compounded topical pain preparations, raising concerns that clinicians and patients may not be aware of the potential safety risks. Topical diclofenac is one of the most widely used pain medications, often used for joint ailments such as osteoarthritis and other musculoskeletal pain. Systemic exposure to diclofenac has a dose-related risk for gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal adverse events, particularly in elderly patients. Topical diclofenac preparations are frequently compounded in pharmacies at the concentrations of 1% to 10% (or higher) with or without other active ingredients such as camphor. Considering the significantly higher strengths of the compounded preparations as compared to the commercially available products (1% to 3%) and the frequency of application (sometimes up to six times a day), concerns arise as to the levels of absorption with these formulations and their potential toxicity. The objective of this initial study was formulated in an attempt to shed light on safety concerns of topical diclofenac preparations. A study was designed to evaluate the in vitro release, irritability, and permeability of three different concentrations of compounded diclofenac gels (1%, 5%, and 10%) in PLO GEL MEDIFLO and VersaPro Gel bases. Using MatTek's EpiDerm system, skin irritability and the in vitro permeation of compounded diclofenac gels were evaluated. Additionally, the in vitro release profile, drug content, content uniformity, and physical properties of the compounded gels (pH, homogeneity) were assessed. In all cases, the drug content, content uniformity, physical properties, and preparation stability during the recommended beyond-use dating (90 days) were acceptable. The release profiles of all tested preparations followed the Higuchi model. The in vitro skin irritation evaluation of the tested formulations indicated no irritant preparation. The permeability assessment of the formulated gels revealed that there is a correlation between drug release and percutaneous absorption. VersaPro Gelbased preparations, which showed a lower percentage of drug release over the experiment time, showed a significantly lower average flux at steady-state and the average percentage of absorbed dose after 24 hours. The percentage absorption (%abs) from different formulations ranged from 11.18% to 19.6% depending on the gel base. The permeability coefficient, kp, (cm/hr) ranged from 0.019 to 0.037, and the average flux (µg/cm2/hr) ranged from 8.7 to 103 depending on the gel base and the diclofenac concentration. Based on our findings and previously reported data, the possibility exists that higher diclofenac concentrations in compounded topical preparations may lead to significantly higher blood concentrations as compared to commercially available products, which in turn may also lead to serious side effects. Accordingly, there is a need for clinical studies to evaluate the safety of compounded diclofenac preparations with higher diclofenac contents than United States Food and Drug Administrationapproved formulations.",

      "title": "Quinine toxicity.",
      "abstract": "The currently recognized toxic effects of quinine in humans are identified and the problems of management of overdosage of quinine are discussed. Quinine, available therapeutically as sulphate or hydrochloride salts, also is widely used in tonic water, and there are several case reports of allergic reactions to the drug when a patient has consumed the drug in this way. Another unintentional source of poisoning is its use as an adulterant in heroin for \"street\" use. This appears to be a problem in the US. Quinine, termed a \"general protoplasmic poison\" is toxic to many bacteria, yeasts, and trypanosomes, as well as to malarial plasmodia. Quinine has local anesthetic action but also is an irritant. The irritant effects may be responsible in part for the nausea associated with its clinical use. In addition it has a mild antipyretic effect. Several features are common to both an acute single overdose in self-poisoning and accumulation of quinine during therapy for malaria: together they are termed cinchonism. Auditory symptoms, gastrointestinal disturbances, vasodilatation, sweating, and headache occur with moderately elevated plasma quinine concentration. As these rise, increasingly severe visual disturbances and then cardiac and neurologic features occur. Mild nausea may be the only symptom, but with large overdoses profuse vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea may occur. These result from a combination of the local irritant effect of quinine on the gut and the central effects of quinine on the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Vasodilatation and sweating are well recognized, and tinnitus is common. Visual symptoms usually are delayed, and blindness may not be discovered for a day or more. Aspirin-sensitive patients, and others, may develop angioedema by nonimmunological mechanisms in response to drugs, and quinine has been reported to produce pseudo-allergic reactions in aspirin-sensitive patients. Quinine also can cause drug-induced thrombocytopenia and purpura. In patients suffering with malaria due to \"Plasmodium falciparum,\" anemia and acute intravascular hemolysis with renal failure are recognized complications. There appears to be little evidence in the literature in support of the folk tradition of quinine as an inducer of abortion. Quinine is known to cause deterioration in patients with myasthenia gravis and erythema multiforme, to stimulate insulin release in patients receiving treatment for falicparum malaria, and to be responsible at times for ataxia following moderate overdosage. Clinically, quinine poisoning is observed in 3 situations: self-poisoning; accidentally; and following use of quinine in excessive doses in the hope of achieving abortion. Treatment courses are reviewed.",

A 28 year-old man administered after 5-years of medical prescription of the recommended dosage of 12.5 mg 2 times daily of oral tianeptine for an anxiety disorder. The patient spontaneously increased the dosage which after two months reached 120 tablets per day. No severe toxic effects were observed. As adverse effects, the patient, in the beginning of this high treatment period suffered from nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, anorexia with weight loss, constipation. These side effects progressively disappeared. The biological tolerance was excellent, and hepatic parameters were not affected. The patient experienced and seek a psychostimulant effect for five-years but after his family realized that he was using 2 boxes of drug every day he was hospitalized for treatment. Tianeptine is an antidepressant agent like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants. The anxiolytic efficacy of tianeptine is similar to that of tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants. But in contrast to SSRIs and tricyclic agents, systemic administration of tianeptine modestly enhanced the mesolimbic release of dopamine (DA). It is told that abuse or dependence of tianeptine is an important issue in patients who have histories of alcohol or substance abuse. However, as in our case, the use of tianeptine in patients without a history of substance abuse might be also a risk for addiction.",

      "abstract": "Almost a half century following attempts to ban its use, cocaine remains at the pinnacle of topical anesthesia in otolaryngology. To understand how nonaddicting synthetic substitutes such as procaine, dibucaine, tetracaine and lidocaine have not totally supplanted cocaine, requires an in-depth analysis of its unique pharmacological properties, untoward effects and potential substitutes. Almost all of the reported cocaine deaths occurred after subcutaneous injection; when used topically, cocaine's toxicity has been confined to an occasional reaction. Certain variables under physician control may be manipulated to reduce the chance of reaction to a minimum. For example, intermittent application of a particular dosage results in lower blood levels, and allowing sufficient time between doses reduces the amount necessary to obtain the desired anesthesia. If total dosage is kept below 200 mg there are few reactions. A singular advantage of cocaine over other topical anesthetics is its inherent ability to cause vasoconstriction, thus retarding its own absorption. The addition of a topical vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine is thus redundant, and may actually be harmful as cocaine sensitizes the patient to exogenous epinephrine. Finally, the usual preoperative dosages of barbiturates are entirely inadequate to prevent or treat cocaine reactions. Why, then, have synthetic local anesthetics not replaced cocaine? Inherent differences in topical effectiveness, duration of anesthesia and toxicity provide the answer. Of other local anesthetics possessing topical effectiveness tetracaine is about six times more toxic than cocaine. Dibucaine is as toxic as tetracaine, and lidocaine, while relatively nontoxic, provides only a 15 minute duration of topical anesthesia. A review of cocaine and its potential substitutes thus leads to the conclusion that cocaine is still a vital and necessary instrument in the otolaryngologist's armamentarium, singularly providing excellent topical anesthesia of usable duration, vasoconstriction, and shrinkage of mucous membranes, all with a quite acceptable margin of safety.",

      "title": "Clinical Pharmacology of Fentanyl in Infants and Children",
      "abstract": "Fentanyl is a systemic opioid related to the phenylpiperidines, it is used in anaesthetic practice and in analgesia and the analgesic effect is about 100 times higher than that of morphine. Fentanyl is highly lipid soluble, rapidly crosses the blood-brain-barrier, and fentanyl concentrations rapidly decline in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Fentanyl causes respiratory depression and decreases the heart rate through vagal activation. Fentanyl may be administered intravenously, orally, by transdermal, intranasal or by buccal application and the oral bioavailability is poor. In infants, fentanyl is given for short term use, sustained use, and during therapeutic hypothermia. In children, fentanyl is given intravenously, by transdermal application, or by buccal administration and the fentanyl dose varies with the child age and body-weight. Fentanyl has been found efficacy and safe in infants and children but it may induce adverse-effects and fentanyl causes different effects in infants and children. Following intravenous administration of fentanyl to infants and children, the fentanyl elimination half-life ranges from 208 to 1,266 min and the distribution volume ranges from 1.92 to 15.2 L/kg. Such variability is due to the wide variation of subject’s demographic characteristics. Fentanyl interacts with drugs, the treatment and trials with fentanyl have been studied in infants and children. Fentanyl freely crosses the human placenta and poorly migrates into the breast-milk. The aim of this study is to review fentanyl dosing, efficacy, safety, effects, adverse-effects, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, drug interaction, treatment, and trials in infants and children, and fentanyl placental transfer and migration into the breast-milk.",

      "abstract": "Tumescent anesthesia with highly diluted lidocaine and epinephrine has transformed lipoplasty from bloody hospital surgery to a painless and virtually bloodless office-based procedure. The 10-fold or greater dilution of bottled commercial lidocaine has unearthed a latent subdermal drug storage reservoir, postulated to buffer up to 1 mg of lidocaine per gram of tissue. Tissue-bound lidocaine trapped in this safety net is released slowly but steadily into the systemic circulation for eventual disposition, much like a sustained-release preparation. Because epinephrine profoundly reduces perfusion through the buffer compartment, systemic drug uptake is slowed to the extent that lidocaine release stays apace with the liver's maximum lidocaine clearance capacity of 250 mg/h. Hence, provided the lidocaine is diluted properly, the blood level remains below the 5 μg/ml toxic threshold, despite the administration of many times the conventional upper dose limit of undiluted full-strength lidocaine. Certain caveats apply when using high-dose lidocaine for tumescent anesthesia. Proper dilution of lidocaine to 0.1% or less (500 to 1000 mg lidocaine per liter solvent), and adding 1 mg fresh epinephrine to each liter, are of the essence. Any decrease in the liver's clearance capacity - as by cytochrome P450 inhibition, functional impairment or chemotherapy - demands a corresponding reduction in the total lidocaine dose. When combining tumescent (diluted) lidocaine with full-strength (undiluted) lidocaine to anesthetize more densely innervated structures such as breast or face, drug dosing must be conservative because of the heightened potential for systemic toxicity from overlapping lidocaine disposition kinetics.",

It is estimated that one in three patients will become dependent after taking benzodiazepines daily, for 3-4 months. It is difficult to predict which patients will become dependent, so all patients must be considered at risk. GPs should review patients' diagnosis and therapy if they have been taking benzodiazepines for 2 months or more. Benzodiazepines should be reduced or ceased over a minimum of 6-8 weeks. Conversion to a long half-life benzodiazepide such as diazepam can be helpful, especially when short half-life drugs have been used during the day. The rate of reduction should be titrated to the patient's symptoms. The patient needs regular reassurance and support as necessary. Where the dosage has been high, or if multiple drugs are being used, referral for patient detoxification may be necessary. (author abstract)",

      "abstract": "Tablets are often manufactured with a score line in the center to assist in splitting into smaller portions to meet individual needs and to better adjust dosage. Splitting tablets is now being used to save on medication costs. The weight variability in split tablets is well documented.1,–4 However, there is no available literature documenting the influence of the tablet score line, the hardness, and the formulation components (e.g., filler, binder, disintegrating agent) on the weight variability of split tablets. We assessed these influences on verapamil hydrochloride tablets prepared under identical conditions with and without a score line. A 25 full-factorial design was used to evaluate the influence of five variables of verapamil tablets: (1) filler (lactose monohydratea or dibasic calcium phosphateb; 600 mg/tablet), (2) binder (hydroxypropylmethyl cellulosec or polyvinyl pyrollidoned; 32 mg/tablet), (3) disintegrating agent (sodium carboxymethyl cellulosee or microcrystalline cellulosef; 80 mg/tablet), (4) tablet hardness (low or high), and (5) tablet surface (with or without score line). We studied the effect of these variables on the weight variation of split tablets and on tablet weight resulting from splitting. The verapamil hydrochlorideg content was kept constant at 80 mg/tablet.",

      "abstract": "Presentation: Synthetic exenatide solution for injection in a prefilled pen.Each dose contains 5 micrograms (μg) in 20 microlitres, or 10μg in 40 microlitres.Also contains metacresol.Uses: BYETTA is indicated for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in combination with metformin, and/or sulphonylureas in patients who have not achieved adequate glycaemic control on maximally tolerated doses of these oral therapies.Dosage and Administration: Initiate at 5μg exenatide per dose administered twice daily (BD) for at least one month.The dose can then be increased to 10μg BD.Doses higher than 10μg BD are not recommended.BYETTA can be administered at any time within the 60 minute period before the morning and evening meal (or two main meals of the day, approximately 6 hours or more apart).BYETTA should not be administered after a meal.If an injection is missed, the treatment should be continued with the next scheduled dose.Each dose should be administered as a subcutaneous injection in the thigh, abdomen, or upper arm.When BYETTA is added to existing metformin therapy, the current dose of metformin can be continued as no increased risk of hypoglycaemia is anticipated.When BYETTA is added to sulphonylurea therapy, a reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia.The dose of BYETTA does not need to be adjusted depending on daily self-monitored glycaemia.Blood glucose self-monitoring may be necessary to adjust the dose of sulphonylureas.Elderly: BYETTA should be used with caution, and dose escalation from 5μg to 10μg should proceed conservatively in patients >70 years.Renal or hepatic impairment: No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 50-80 ml/min) or hepatic impairment.In patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance: 30-50 ml/min), dose escalation from 5μg to 10μg should proceed conservatively.Not recommended for use in patients with end stage renal disease or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).Children and adolescents: There is no experience in children and adolescents below 18 years.Contra-indications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.Warnings and Special Precautions:Do not use in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis or type 2 diabetes patients who require insulin therapy due to beta cell failure.Intravenous or intramuscular injection is not recommended.Not recommended for use in patients with end stage renal disease or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min).Clinical experience in patients with moderate renal impairment is very limited.Not recommended in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease.The concurrent use of BYETTA with insulin, D-phenylalanine derivatives, meglitinides, or alpha-glucosidase inhibitors has not been studied and cannot be recommended.Experience in patients with BMI 25 is limited.When BYETTA was used in combination with a sulphonylurea, the incidence of hypoglycaemia was increased over that of placebo in combination with a sulphonylurea.To reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia associated with the use of a sulphonylurea, reduction in the dose of sulphonylurea should be considered.Interactions: Patients receiving orally administered medicinal products of either a narrow therapeutic ratio or that require careful clinical monitoring should be followed closely.If such medicinal products are to be administered with food, they should be taken with a meal when BYETTA is not administered.Oral medicinal products that are dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy should be taken at least 1 hour before BYETTA injection.Gastroresistant formulations containing substances sensitive for degradation in the stomach, such as proton pump inhibitors, should be taken at least 1 hour before or more than 4 hours after BYETTA injection.HMG CoA reductase inhibitor: Lovastatin AUC and C max were decreased and T max was delayed when BYETTA (10μg BID) was administered concomitantly with a single dose of lovastatin (40mg).Concomitant use of BYETTA and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors was not associated with consistent changes in lipid profiles.Lipid profiles should be monitored regularly.Digoxin, lisinopril and warfarin: A delay in T max of about 2h was observed when digoxin, lisinopril or warfarin was administered 30 min after exenatide.No clinically relevant effects on C max or AUC were observed.Increased INR has been reported during concomitant use of warfarin and BYETTA.INR should be closely monitored during initiation and dose increase of BYETTA therapy in patients on warfarin and/or cumarol derivatives.Pregnancy and Lactation: BYETTA should not be used during pregnancy and the use of insulin is recommended.BYETTA should not be used if breast feeding.Driving, etc: No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.When BYETTA is used in combination with a sulphonylurea, avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines.Undesirable Effects: Adverse reactions reported from Phase 3 studies: Very Common: Hypoglycaemia (with metformin and a sulphonylurea), hypoglycaemia (with a sulphonylurea), nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting.Common: Decreased appetite, headache, dizziness, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, abdominal distension, hyperhidrosis, feeling jittery, asthenia.Injection site reactions have been reported.Patients may develop antiexenatide antibodies following treatment with BYETTA.Spontaneously reported adverse reactions (frequency not known): Anaphylactic reaction (very rarely), dehydration, generally associated with nausea, vomiting and/or diarrhoea, (some reports associated with elevation of serum creatinine), dysgeusia, somnolence, eructation, constipation, flatulence, pancreatitis, macular rash, papular rash, pruritis, urticaria, angioneurotic oedema, INR ratio increased with concomitant warfarin (some reports associated with bleeding).For full details of these and other side-effects, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics, which is available at http://emc.medicines.org.",

The most commonly used ones are procaine hydrochloride, lidocaine (Xylocaine), and hexylcaine (Cyclaine). All are used in strengths of 1% to 2%. Some men have used these anesthetics with epinephrine hydrochloride added as a vasoconstrictor for hemostasis. Epinephrine has some undesirable side-effects, however, and because of these it is not frequently used. I have used the three anesthetics mentioned above and have found objections to all. Subcutaneous injections of procaine do not give immediate anesthesia, and I have been frequently forced to wait up to five minutes for a complete anesthesia. Lidocaine and hexylcaine are excellent agents, but cause discomfort and pain to the patient when injected. Patients complain quite frequently of burning and",

      "title": "Drug Interactions with Oral Contraceptives",
      "abstract": "In the very rare cases where a pregnancy occurs during oral contraceptive use, the blame is usually laid against the patient for having forgotten to take the pill. Evidence has started to accumulate to suggest that neither the patient nor the pill is at fault in some contraceptive failures. It may be because the patient is taking other medicines and these may be preventing the pill from suppressing ovulation. Most drug interactions reducing or negating contraceptive activity are due to concomitant use of drugs having microsomal enzyme-inducing activity (e.g., some antibiotics, especially rifampicin, and anticonvulsants, including phenobarbital, Phenytoin, and primidone. Other antibiotics (e.g., tetracycline) may also interact by interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of contraceptive steroids. Less well appreciated, oral contraceptive steroids may themselves modify the metabolism and pharmacological activity of various other drugs (e.g., anticoagulants, benzodiazepines, β-blockers, caffeine, corticosteroids, and tricyclic antidepressants); in this respect the oral contraceptives are acting as enzyme inhibitors. Contraceptive steroids may also interact with drugs that cause enzyme inhibition and this delays the metabolism of the hormonal agents. Interactions of this type would be expected to potentiate the action of the contraceptive steroids. It is suggested that the effects of such interaction might be presented in terms of increased incidence of side effects, including water retention, diabetogenic effects, hypertension, and an increased risk of thromboembolic disorders. The spectrum of interactions with oral contraceptives is presented in three tables.",

Examples are Deteclo (Lederle), Kelfizine W (Pharmitalia), and Vibramycin (Pfizer). The advantage claimed for these preparations is that adequate blood levels can be maintained with infrequent dosage. A prolonged action may be achieved in various ways - for example, by using a mixture of antibiotics which are absorbed and excreted at different rates, as in Deteclo; 1 by giving high doses of a well absorbed preparation which is slowly excreted, e. g. doxycycline (Vibramycin), 2 by administration in a slow-release form, e. g. procaine penicillin; or by giving probenecid to lessen renal excretion. Where prolongation of action depends on increased binding to plasma proteins, the drug may be more likely to act as a hapten and so to induce allergic reactions.",

Although the sale of oral and parenteral preparations is controlled under schedule 4, inhalers con taining 325 and 330 mg. of base or 250 mg. of methylamphetamine can still be bought without restriction for unauthorized use.* In spite of this ready supply only eight cases of acute with amphet amine or its compounds have been described in this country. All these drugs appear to have similar effects when taken in excess, and the term amphetamine poisoning in this account refers to the clinical picture which can be produced by overdosage with any of the group. The purpose of this paper is to report three further examples of acute poisoning. The case reports illustrate the difficulties which may arise when such patients are admitted to the wards of general hos pitals, the necessity for adequate sedation in treatment, and the danger of excessive or improper use of a benzedrine inhaler.",

      "title": "Flumazenil; a Medication Considered for Reversal of Benzodiazepine Overdose in Rapid Tranquillisation, but Could Administering It Be Hazardous for Both Patient and Doctor? A Rapid Review Required",
      "abstract": "Aims: Flumazenil is a benzodiazepine antagonist and competitively inhibits binding at the benzodiazepine receptor. In Northern Ireland (NI) mental health hospitals, and across other UK mental health hospitals, flumazenil is documented as the reversal agent for use in iatrogenic benzodiazepine overdose (usually lorazepam), as part of the rapid tranquillisation protocol. The indications for its use, contraindications and risks of use need to be considered carefully for safe and appropriate prescribing. Methods: Case report (or lack thereof): Within the recent past, flumazenil has not been prescribed or administered to any patient receiving rapid tranquillisation within the Northern Trust mental health service in NI. The following is a hypothetical but common situation for consideration: A detained patient (under The Mental Health Order Northern Ireland 1986) presents with acute aggression/distress due to first episode drug-induced psychosis. They have no past medical or psychiatric history and are not on regular medication. They have not responded to other less restrictive interventions and the decision has been made to prescribe first-line rapid tranquillisation, lorazepam 1mg IM. Following this, the patient is noted to become sedated with a respiratory rate of 10 and oxygen saturations of 94%. The current policy suggests prescribing flumazenil. Results: On review of multiple resources, including British Association for Psychopharmacology Guidelines, The Maudsley Prescribing Guidelines in Psychiatry 14th Edition, British National Formulary, Electronic Medicines Compendium, Toxbase and local rapid tranquillisation policies throughout the UK, there appears to be a discrepancy in the advice given on the circumstances in which it would be safe to prescribe flumazenil. Some resources document that flumazenil can be considered in iatrogenic benzodiazepine overdose in patients who do not have long term benzodiazepine use or mixed intoxications, with others noting that it should be given by an “experienced” doctor. When flumazenil is used in a physical health setting its use is mostly limited to intensive care/post surgery, and should be given by a doctor with experience in anaesthesiology. Convulsions and cardiac arrhythmias are serious adverse effects of flumazenil use. Conclusion: The use of flumazenil following iatrogenic benzodiazepine overdose is rare in the Northern Trust, NI, however, as it is available on all mental health wards it is paramount to highlight the importance of careful selection of patients, in which it may be indicated and beneficial, and the risks surroundings its use. The limited experience of most psychiatric doctors in using this drug would suggest it should not be administered in a stand-alone mental health unit.",

Its maximal plasma concentration is achieved within 90-190 min following intramuscular administration with bioavailability being complete after intravenous injection. The main indications for fosphenytoin are the treatment of convulsive status epilepticus and the prevention/management of seizures during neurosurgery. Adverse effects of fosphenytoin may include: cardiovascular events (hypotension, arrhythmias), paresthesias or pruritus or some central events - somnolence, headache, dizziness, nystagmus and ataxia. The incidence of purple glove syndrome (edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of intravenous administration) is less frequent than after phenytoin.

      "title": "Acute phenol poisoning",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Phenol (carbolic acid) is one of the oldest antiseptic agents. Currently it is used as a disinfectant, chemical intermediate and nail cauterizer. Phenol is a general protoplasmic poison (denatured protein) with corrosive local effects. Phenol derivates are less toxic than pure phenol. The lethal dose is between 3 to 30 g, but may be as little as 1 g. Phenol is well absorbed by inhalation, dermal application, and ingestion. MANIFESTATIONS OF ACUTE POISONING: Local manifestations. Dermal exposure produces lesions which are initially painless white patches and later turn erythematous and finally brown. Phenol produces mucosal burns and coagulum. They cause eye irritation and corneal damage. When ingested, it causes extensive local corrosions, pain, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and diarrhea. Severe gastrointestinal burns are uncommon and strictures are rare. Inhalation produces respiratory tract irritation and pneumonia. Systemic manifestations develop after 5 to 30 minutes postingestion or post dermal application, and may produce nausea, vomiting, lethargy or coma, hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia, dysrhythmias, seizures, acidosis, hemolysis, methemoglobinemia, and shock. MANAGEMENT: Phenol poisoning requires immediate medical evaluation, in cases of significant phenol ingestion (more than 1 g for adults or 50 mg for infants) or symptomatic intoxication. It is necessary to establish and maintain vital functions and establish vascular access. Treatment includes the following: shock (fluids and dopamine), arrhythmias (lidocaine) and convulsions (diazepam). Health personnel should use gowns and rubber gloves. Inhalation of 100% oxygen is recommended. Intubate and assisted ventilation might be necessary. Metabolic acidosis should be managed by 1 to 2 mEq/kg of sodium bicarbonate. Methemoglobinemia should be treated if greater than 30%, or in cases of respiratory distress, with methylene blue 1 to 2 mg/kg of 1% solution, slowly i.v. If phenol is ingested, avoid emesis, alcohol and oral mineral oil and dilution, because they may increase absorption. Gastric lavage is usually not recommended. Immediate administration of olive oil and activated charcoal by small bore nasogastric tube is necessary. CONCLUSION: Apart from the abovementioned, immediately decontaminate the skin with copious amounts of water followed by undiluted polyethylene glycol. Wash the area thoroughly with soap and water after treatment. Immediately decontaminate the eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes. Follow up examination using fluorescein stain of eyes for corneal abrasion is recommended Language: sr",

Other antibiotics (e.g. ciprofloxacin, amphotericinB, rifampicin and teicoplanin) or other drugs that stimulate histamine release can result in red man syndrome.

      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> For several years sympatholytic drugs have been tried for treatment of various types of glaucoma. The substance mostly used is Dibenamine,* introduced in ophthalmology by Christensen and Swan in 1949. Dibenamine is generally given intravenously in doses of 4-5 mg. per kilogram body weight diluted in 300-500 cc. saline. Slow infusion during 60-90 minutes is necessary, since toxic effects occur more frequently when the drug is administered rapidly. After the infusion the vein is flushed with saline to prevent local phlebothrombosis. When Dibenamine is taken orally in doses of 300-400 mg. daily its hypotensive effect is either very slight and transient or absent. Moreover, gastric disturbances restrict the value of oral application. Local application of Dibenamine in the conjunctival sac is ineffective as well as irritating because, being a nitrogen mustard derivative, it causes a chemical inflammation. The hypotensive effect of Dibenamine begins 1-2 hours after infusion, reaching its",

In spite of the absence of any established clinical indication for phenylalanine, it is widely available in health-food stores in the USA. Such sales have recently been prohibited in Canada, but this regulation is at the moment being challenged legally. Books available to the general public make many unsupported claims about the use of phenylalanine, for example, that it can relieve or prevent depressions, is effective in many types of severe pain, is useful in restoring energy and vitality after stressful activities, and improves memory, and aids in weight loss.",

She developed circulatory failure and tachypnea. Decontamination, calcium, glucagon, and dual vasopressors were started, however, persistent hypotension led to the initiation of hyperinsulinemiceuglycemia therapy.

However, withdrawal is difficult and often accompanied by withdrawal symptoms and renewed cravings. These symptoms are driven mostly by signaling in the locus coeruleus and the mesolimbic system and a rebound increase in noradrenaline, producing symptoms such as anxiety, gastrointestinal upset, and tension.

The author is currently undertaking a study aimed at evaluating the effects of antiinflammatory drug-containing IUDs on the reproductive cycles of rats and mice. IUDs made from an inert silastic mixture are mixed with pure forms of indomethacin or naproxen. The IUDs are in the shape of cylinders which are easily sutured into a part of the uterus. In vitro studies of the IUDs revealed a marked difference in the speed at which the 2 drugs come out of the IUD. Naproxen takes about 5 days to be completely released compared to about 20 days for indomethacin. To deliver the drugs over a longer period (eg, 3-6 months), the cylinder was covered with a vinyl sleeve so that the drugs are released from the ends of the IUD only. So far, the rats have not shown any adverse side effects or abnormal behavior. Further research should be done to determine the long-term effects of local drug application, reversibility of the IUD, and whether the drugs are teratogenic (causing effects on developing embryo/fetus).",

There are, however, substantial pharmacokinetic differences between individual benzodiazepine agonists. During short-term use of benzodiazepines, the elimination half-life is no measure of duration of action. Benzodiazepine lipophilicity determines the speed of action. If a rapid effect is desired, for instance in acute anxiety or agitation, then regarding oral medication the use of a lipophilic benzodiazepine such as diazepam is a rational choice. An accumulation factor can be used to estimate benzodiazepine accumulation during chronic use. In theory, accumulation does not occur with once-daily dosage of benzodiazepines that have an elimination half-life markedly shorter than 24 h, such as oxazepam, temazepam, and lorazepam.",

Imipramine was found to have a specific effect in dispelling depression. In 1957 Kuhn published the first paper on the treatment of depressive states with imipramine. Its exact mode of action is as yet not clearly defined. Its most useful action has been in periodic endogenous depressive states, in which it often eliminates the need for electroconvulsive therapy or markedly reduces the number of shock treatments needed.

      "abstract": "The new platinum compound oxaliplatin (Eloxatin) appears to have activity, either alone or in combination, as both first- and second-line therapy for advanced colorectal cancer. Unlike other platinum derivatives, it is not associated with significant nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity. The addition of oxaliplatin at 85 mg/m2 to a fluorouracil/leucovorin-based regimen administered every 2 weeks is well tolerated. The incidence of diarrhea and stomatitis increases with the addition of oxaliplatin, but can be managed by adjusting the dose. There is also a significantly higher incidence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia with oxaliplatin. Neutropenic febrile complications are rare. The occurrence of other hematologic, hepatic, or renal toxicities does not increase when oxaliplatin is added to fluorouracil-based regimens. Unlike other agents used for the treatment of colorectal cancer, oxaliplatin causes acute and chronic neurosensory symptoms. These acute symptoms are managed by taking precautions (e.g., avoid cold drinks/food for a few days following treatment). Cumulative neurotoxicity is the dose-limiting toxicity associated with oxaliplatin treatment. This toxicity appears reversible with discontinuation of the drug and typically occurs well after the onset of tumor response.",

      "title": "“I Am in Pain!”—A Case Report of Illicit Use of Transdermal Fentanyl Patches",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: About 86 million Americans suffer from pain, which costs $100 billion yearly in work loss and medical expenses.1,2 Fentanyl is a synthetic analgesic acting as a strong agonist at the μ-opioid receptors and is 100 times more potent than morphine.3 Transdermal fentanyl patches contain an inert alcohol gel infused with select fentanyl doses; the patches are worn to provide constant analgesic over 48 to 72 hours.4,5 Fentanyl patches are used widely for pain especially in palliative treatment for cancer patients who (1) have swallowing problems and cannot tolerate other parental routes, (2) have renal failure, and (3) have adverse effects from taking morphine, hydromorphone, or oxycodone.6\r\n\r\nDocumented methods of abusing fentanyl patches include application of more patches,7 changing patches more frequently (this case), injecting extracted fentanyl intravenously,8 chewing (this case) or swallowing patches,9 inserting patches into rectum,10 inhaling fentanyl gel,11 and diluting fentanyl in tea.12 The biological effects of fentanyl are similar to those of street heroin but hundreds of times more potent. It is extremely difficult to stop its absorption because fentanyl is highly lipophilic and penetrates the central nervous system easily.13 Therefore, the illicit use of fentanyl is very dangerous and causes numerous opioid overdose deaths.14\r\n\r\nPain is common in psychiatric patients, especially in those with depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance abuse, and personality disorders.15 Here, the case of a patient with depression, PTSD, substance abuse, and chronic back pain who abused his transdermal fentanyl patches by changing patches more frequently and chewing his used patches is presented.\r\n\r\nCase report. Mr A, a 62-year-old white man and a Vietnam War veteran, had a past medical history of DSM-IV-TR16 major depressive disorder (MDD), PTSD, and polysubstance dependence (alcohol, cocaine, heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and prescribed pills). He was diagnosed with chronic low back pain and had been treated with various oral narcotic analgesics by his private pain management physician. Recently, Mr A overdosed on his prescribed oral narcotic analgesics, developed respiratory depression, and was hospitalized and treated with mechanical ventilation. To avoid possible future abuse or overdose on his prescribed oral narcotic analgesics, Mr A's pain specialist physician discontinued his oral narcotic analgesics and started him on transdermal fentanyl patches that release 25 μg/h over 72 hours for his chronic low back pain.\r\n\r\nApproximately 2 months after he was started on the fentanyl patches, Mr A presented to the psychiatry clinic for follow-up treatment of his MDD and PTSD. He was still depressed and could not fall asleep mainly secondary to his severe low back pain. Also, Mr A reported that he had started abusing his fentanyl patches by changing them every 48 hours instead of every 72 hours as prescribed. After educating Mr A about medication compliance, side effects, and the fatal risk of abusing the fentanyl patches, we instructed Mr A to apply his fentanyl patches every 72 hours as prescribed. In addition, we referred Mr A to an addiction therapist to receive weekly psychotherapy immediately.\r\n\r\nDuring his first psychotherapy session, Mr A appeared to be very sedated and kept chewing on something with constant mouth movement. Because Mr A had been taking aripiprazole and duloxetine for his depression, side effects of tardive dyskinesia or extrapyramidal symptoms from these medications should be considered. However, when Mr A was asked what he was chewing on, he reluctantly admitted that he had been chewing on his used fentanyl patches after cutting them into small pieces because he stated, “I am in pain!” Again, we educated Mr A about the danger of abusing fentanyl. In addition, we instructed Mr A's wife to keep all of his fentanyl patches (both new and used) away from him and to destroy all his used fentanyl patches as the manufacturer instructed by cutting the fentanyl patches into small pieces and then flushing them down the toilet.4 After Mr A's private pain specialist was informed about his illicit use of the fentanyl patches, he stopped prescribing them and started Mr A on low-dose hydrocodone/acetaminophen, which Mr A's wife keeps and distributes to him as prescribed. Since then, Mr A has become more alert and oriented and has felt physically better.\r\n\r\nIn clinical practice, psychiatrists should be aware that chronic pain is closely associated with a variety of psychiatric diseases15 and should be vigilant to the high risks of the illicit use of pain medications in psychiatric patients. The early diagnosis and treatment of illicit use of pain medications will be beneficial or even life-saving for many psychiatric patients.",

      "abstract": "To report a case of early-decompensated liver cirrhosis secondary to discontinuation of penicillamine therapy in a patient with Wilson's disease.A 33-year-old Chinese female patient was diagnosed with Wilson's disease, for which penicillamine 250 mg p.o. once daily was prescribed. However, the patient developed intolerance and penicillamine was discontinued without alternative treatment. Five months later, she developed decompensated liver cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy. Eventually, the patient died because of the complications of sepsis and decompensated liver failure.Chelating agent is the mainstay of treatment in Wilson's disease, which is an inherited disorder of hepatic copper metabolism. Therapy must be instituted and continued for life once diagnosis is confirmed. Interruption of therapy can be fatal or cause irreversible relapse. Penicillamine given orally is the chelating agent of first choice. However, its unfavourable side-effects profile leads to discontinuation of therapy in 20-30% of patients. In most case reports, cessation of penicillamine without replacement treatment causes rapid progression to fulminant hepatitis, which is fatal unless liver transplantation is performed.In this, we highlight a case of discontinuation of penicillamine in a patient with Wilson's disease without substitution with alternative regimen. This was caused by unavailability of the alternative agents such as trientine in our country. Consequently, the patient progressed to decompensated liver cirrhosis with encephalopathy and eventually passed-away within 5 months. One recent study supports a combination of trientine and zinc in treating patient with decompensated liver cirrhosis. This combination is capable of reversing liver failure and prevents the need of liver transplantation. Both trientine and zinc are not registered in Malaysia. Therefore, liver transplantation was probably the only treatment option for this patient. Hence, non-availability of orphan drugs in clinical practice is certainly a subject of serious concern. Systems for better management of patients with rare diseases need to be instituted by all the institutions concerned.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article reviews the evidence regarding the use of phenytoin in adult and paediatric patients experiencing seizures in the ED in Australasia, including relevant pharmacokinetics, dosage, therapeutic drug monitoring and methods of administration. It summarizes current evidence regarding the use of phenytoin in a number of seizure types commonly seen in ED. A search of Medline, Embase and Cochrane was performed using appropriate keyword and MeSH headings. A loading dose of phenytoin should be given to phenytoin naïve patients for the emergency treatment of seizures; parenteral administration results in therapeutic concentration sooner than oral administration but is associated with more frequent and significant adverse effects. Diluting phenytoin is safe but there is limited evidence regarding adverse effects of diluted phenytoin; a filter is probably not needed. Free phenytoin concentrations correlate best with antiseizure efficacy. Phenytoin is used in the treatment of status epilepticus although evidence here is limited; it may also be given to prevent early post‐traumatic seizures. It should not be given to treat or prevent eclamptic or alcohol‐related seizures. There is insufficient evidence regarding its use in preventing febrile convulsions, treating or preventing seizures due to space occupying lesions or intracerebral haemorrhage and thrombosis. In conclusion, phenytoin is appropriate for treatment of some seizures seen in the ED; it is associated with significant adverse effects; trials are ongoing regarding the use of other anticonvulsants in the treatment of status epilepticus.",

      "title": "Retrospective Demonstration of 25I-NBOMe Acute Poisoning Using Hair Analysis",
      "abstract": "The abuse of new psychoactive substances or NPS has been dramatically increasing all around the world since the last half of the year 2000 and has become a serious public health problem. NPS are a challenge for the worldwide forensic community due to the difficulties to accurately document the cases. The N-benzylmethoxy (NBOMe) group is a new class of hallucinogenic designer drugs and has gained importance in recent years. 25I-NBOMe (2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)- methyl]ethanamine) is an analog of the 2C series of psychedelic phenethylamine drugs that contain an N-methoxybenzyl substituent, which significantly affects their pharmacological activities. It is a potent agonist of 5-HTA receptors and a severe hallucinogenic drug, with numerous irreversible psychedelic effects which can last from 5 to 10 hours. It is consumed most often in the form of drops or blotters by the transmucosal, sublingual or intranasal routes. The active dosage is very low, supposed to be less than 100 µg. The literature is poor in reporting cases where 25I-NBOMe was identified. Only very few clinical cases of over dosages were published, suggesting a low prevalence of this compound.We present a retrospective demonstration of 25I-NBOMe acute poisoning with dramatic outcome, using hair analysis. Two hair strands, measuring 9.5 cm, were collected 6.5 months after drug consumption during a forensic clinical evaluation of brain dysfunctions after cardiorespiratory arrest and were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography system coupled to a tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and using two specific transitions: m/z 428.1 > 121.2 (quantification) and 428.1 > 90.6 (confirmation). Hair strands were segmented to determine the historic pattern of drug use and differentiate a single exposure from a chronic exposure. The hair test result for 25I-NBOMe was the following: not detected (0-2 cm), not detected (2-4 cm), 1.0 pg/mg (4-6 cm), 4.9 pg/mg (6-8 cm) and not detected (8-9.5 cm).The result of the segment 6-8 cm coincides with the date of consumption (calculated with a hair growth rate at 1 cm/month) and the low concentration detected in the segment 4-6 cm probably corresponds to the contribution of dormant hair. The toxicological significance of the measured concentrations is difficult to determine because this is the first case dealing with hair analysis for 25I-NBOMe.The use of hair analysis for NPS is still at the initial stages. In particular, little is known about the incorporation into the keratin matrix after intake and the correlation between dosage frequency of use, and hair concentrations. Under these circumstances, NPS hair analysis should be cautiously interpreted by experienced forensic toxicologist.",

      "abstract": "Zolpidem is a widely used hypnotic. Dependence on zolpidem due to the induction of euphoria is a rare condition, while intranasal misuse of zolpidem is a rather new phenomenon. We present the first case of a patient who developed zolpidem dependence, which was associated with the prompt onset of euphoria exclusively following intranasal use. Mr. A was a 51-year-old polydrug abuser with antisocial personality disorder and a physical dependence on zolpidem. Over several years, he consumed 500 mg of the drug daily, usually divided into 30 mg doses, exclusively via the nasal route because unlike the oral administration of the same dose of the drug, intranasal administration induced euphoria. Euphoric effects manifested 3-5 minutes after taking the drug, and pronounced withdrawal symptoms (i.e., profuse sweating, tremors, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and inability to drink and eat), present 7-8 hours after the use could disappear within 3-5 minutes upon drug re-administration. The dependence was managed through a slow tapering of the zolpidem use. Clinicians should be aware that intranasal use of zolpidem could be associated with euphoric effects and the development of addiction. The potential for misuse of zolpidem via the nasal route may be of interest for future research.",

      "abstract": "There is a discrepancy between the recommendation for caution and daily practice in the prescription of benzodiazepines. Although there is heterogeneity in the registered indications, all benzodiazepine agonists have almost the same mechanism of action. There are, however, substantial pharmacokinetic differences between individual benzodiazepine agonists. During short-term use of benzodiazepines, the elimination half-life is no measure of duration of action. Benzodiazepine lipophilicity determines the speed of action. If a rapid effect is desired, for instance in acute anxiety or agitation, then regarding oral medication the use of a lipophilic benzodiazepine such as diazepam is a rational choice. An accumulation factor can be used to estimate benzodiazepine accumulation during chronic use. In theory, accumulation does not occur with once-daily dosage of benzodiazepines that have an elimination half-life markedly shorter than 24 h, such as oxazepam, temazepam, and lorazepam.",

Fentanyl induces a very intense analgesia which develops during the hour following the administration. The intensity and the duration of the effect are dose related. Compared to that of morphine chlorhydrate, in the same conditions, the analgesia induced by fentanyl citrate is much less intense than expected: fentanyl seems to be only 25 times more potent than morphine. Furthermore, the observed duration of action of fentanyl makes it impossible to be still classified with the short time acting analgesics: with equianalgesic doses, morphine and fentanyl have the same time of initiation and the same duration of action. As observed, the time of the clinically useful analgesia is longer than 3 hours after injection of 0.006 mg/kg of fentanyl or of 0.150 mg/kg of morphine.",

      "abstract": "Three drug dosing strategies can be employed to address dose-dependent drug adverse effects. The usual strategy is to continue the drug but at a lower dose; it would then take 5 half-lives of the drug for the new steady state to be attained and for a dose-dependent adverse effect to correspondingly attenuate. Such slow offset of the adverse effect could be disadvantageous for drugs such as fluoxetine, penfluridol, and cariprazine that have long half-lives. A second strategy is to stop the drug and to resume it at a lower dose when the adverse effect attenuates as the drug blood level falls. This strategy introduces subjectivity in timing the reintroduction of the drug, requires closer patient monitoring, and risks nonadherence and relapse. The third strategy is to stop the drug for a prespecified number of days and to then reintroduce it at a lower dose. From a knowledge of pharmacokinetics, it can be shown that stopping a drug for just 1 half-life and then resuming it at half the dose results in the immediate achievement of steady state; that is, there is no need to wait for 4 additional half-lives as with the usual strategy of dose reduction without dosing interruption. A limitation of this pharmacokinetically driven dosing strategy, however, is that it would work well in the average patient but not in those with outlying pharmacokinetic parameters.",

      "abstract": "Opioid dependence leads to physical dependence and addiction which finally results in profound medical, psychological and social dysfunction. One of the useful medications for opioid dependence is buprenorphine, the partial opioid agonist, which is used alone or in combination with naloxone. However, buprenorphine is the victim of its own success due to its illicit use and accidental poisoning in children. Also, buprenorphine typically requires daily self-administration and its effectiveness heavily depends on patient adherence. So, poor treatment adherence results in ineffective treatment manifesting as craving and withdrawal symptoms. Short-term use of buprenorphine in opioid dependence is also often followed by relapse. Buprenorphine when used sublingually often results in inadequate or fluctuating blood concentrations and poorer treatment retention compared with methadone. All of these led to the development of Probuphine®, a polymeric matrix composed of ethylene vinyl acetate and buprenorphine in the form of implants, that are implanted subdermally in office practice and deliver the active drug over 6 months. Buprenorphine release from such implant is fairly consistent, avoiding plasma peaks and troughs, and the implant is also reported to be safe. In this review article, we have highlighted these aspects of treatment of opioid addiction, stressing on the pharmacology of buprenorphine and Probuphine®, and relevant clinical trials addressing the efficacy and safety of Probuphine®. This sustained-release implantable formulation of buprenorphine has the potential to be a suitable alternative to daily or alternate day sublingual buprenorphine which can thereby eliminate the need for daily supervision, minimizing fluctuations in plasma concentrations, and allowing these patients to reduce clinic or pharmacy visits.",

However, clonidine significantly prolonged tetracaine spinal blockade. These results are not surprising because clonidine prolongs the effects of other local anesthetics administered as spinal blocks. Unfortunately, the authors did not report the length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit. Such extensively long spinal blockades undoubtedly delay discharge, especially compared with much shorter acting (yet equally effective) lidocaine epidurals. Clonidine also has significant disadvantages because it is associated with a high incidence of bradycardia and hypotension. Although intrathecal fentanyl did not alter onset and offset of tetracaine spinal blockade, other studies have demonstrated that it improves the quality of spinal blockade for bupivacaine.",

The half-life is increased in the presence of renal dysfunction and decreased in children. The exact mechanism of the presystemic first-pass elimination and the effects of dose levels on the process presently are unclear. Biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic studies after single or multiple doses in humans reveal wide interindividual variations in pharmacokinetics. Age, dialysis, urinary pH and flow influence the elimination kinetics of chlorpheniramine. Attention is brought to major issues that need further clarification to optimize drug therapy with this antihistamine.

      "abstract": "Poor oral hygiene is a major risk factor for oral diseases. Regular home-based care is essential to maintain good oral hygiene. In particular, mouthrinses can support conventional tooth brushing in reducing accumulation of oral plaque. Areas covered: The most common molecules contained in mouthrinses (chlorhexidine, essential oils, cetyl pyridinium chloride, triclosan, octeneidine, delmopinol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hyaluronic acid, natural compounds) are discussed, together with relevant clinical and in vitro studies, focusing on their effects on periodontal health. Currently, chlorhexidine is the most efficacious compound, with both antiplaque and antibacterial activities. Similar results are reported for essential oils and cetyl pyridinium chloride, although with a somewhat reduced efficacy. Considering the adverse effects of chlorhexidine and its time-related characteristics, this molecule may best be indicated for acute/short-term use, while essential oils and cetyl pyridinium chloride may be appropriate for long-term, maintenance treatment. Expert opinion: The literature has not clearly demonstrated which compound is the best for mouthrinses that combine good efficacy and acceptable side effects. Research should focus on substances with progressive antibacterial activity, prompting a gradual change in the composition of oral biofilm and mouthrinses that combine two or more molecules acting synergistically in the mouth.",

      "abstract": "Remifentanil is a potent mu-opioid receptor agonist and has some unique pharmacokinetic characteristics compared to other anilidopiperidine opioids (e.g. fentanyl, alfentanil, and sufentanil). As remifentanil is metabolised rapidly by nonspecific esterases that are widespread throughout the plasma and tissuses, its duration of action is very short. It is cleared very rapidly, and its clearance is not affected by renal and hepatic function. The context-sensitive half-time of remifentanil remains consistently short, even after administration for a long time. Consequently, emergence is quick even after anesthesia of long duration. As other piperidine opioids, remifentnil has some adverse effects such as respiratory depression, muscle rigidity, bradycardia, and nausea as well as vomiting. Because of the rapid dissipation of analgesic effect following remifentanil discontinuation, postoperative analgesia should be provided before or soon after anesthesia using longer-acting opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics, or local as well as regional anesthesia.",

Both antibiotics have been associated with a wide variety of hepatotoxic reactions, from a slight rise of transaminases to fulminant hepatitis. Once hepatotoxicity secondary to a drug appears, the first step is to discontinue the drug. Physicians may opt to administer an alternative treatment with a different chemical structure. It should be borne in mind, however, that different chemical structures may also cause recurrent drug-induced liver injuries (DILI).

      "abstract": "Introduction Oxaliplatin is a third generation anti-neoplastic platinum compound (organo-platinum complex) used in the treatment of several solid tumours either as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs. Hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin are uncommon, with most reports indicating an incidence of 1–5%. The severity of reactions may vary from grade 1 side effect in line of skin flushing and/or rashes to very severe, life-threatening systemic anaphylaxis (grade 3/4). Following mild to moderate hypersensitivity reactions, steroids and/or antihistamines could be administered, after which the patient can be re-exposed to the drug. In severe hypersensitivity reactions however, oxaliplatin must be discontinued while alternative chemotherapeutic regimen or even other forms of therapy should be considered. Case report A 56 year old woman with colorectal cancer who was commenced on adjuvant oxaliplatin therapy developed Hypersensitivity reaction about 2 hours of the first oxaliplatin administration, for which the drug was discontinued and the symptoms improved. She had similar reactions in 2 subsequent attempts at administering same drug, after which the drug was changed. A placebo infusion was administered twice with no untoward reactions. Management and outcome: With each reaction, the drug was immediately discontinued and she was promptly given intranasal oxygen and corticosteroids. She was premedicated with anti-histamines and corticosteroids prior to subsequent cycles. Oxaliplatin was consequently discontinued and she experienced no further hypersensitivity reaction to the subsequent drug regimen. Discussion Hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin, though a rare occurrence, are more likely idiosyncratic; with more cases being reported in recent times.",

Insulin, which first became available for patients with diabetes mellitus in 1922 (3,4), was originally extracted from porcine and bovine pancreases and differed in structure from human insulin by one and three amino acids, respectively. The early preparations were dilute (1 unit/ml), of crude purity, and short-acting. Patients had to inject themselves four to six times a day with relatively large volumes, which made the injections painful. Local cutaneous reactions at injection sites (inflammation, lipoatrophy, and lipohypertrophy) were common due to contaminants. Moreover, because the preparations were antigenic, most patients developed insulin antibodies, which delayed the onset and prolonged the duration of insulin action. Development of antibodies sometimes caused severe immune insulin resistance that necessitated desensitization and the use of corticosteroids or specifically modified insulins (e.g., sulfated insulins).",

A major anxiety is the development of bacterial resistance in the child with repeated or persistent infection. This develops sooner or later in all these children and makes the continued prophylactic use of antibiotics unwise. An antibiotic free from this drawback would be of the greatest value: in about 12 children with cystic fibrosis treated for up to one year with daily fucidin I have as yet had no case of drug resistance.

Ondansetron has marked activity against emesis associated with cisplatin and other highly emetogenic drugs. Compared with high doses of metoclopramide, the antiemetic “gold standard.” it demonstrates equal or superior efficacy. Although ondansetron is moderately well absorbed after oral administration, only a parenteral formulation will initially be available. Ondansetron is eliminated almost entirely by hepatic metabolism: less than five percent of an intravenously administered dose is recovered intact in urine. The half-life of ondansetron is approximately 3.5 hours: slightly shorter in children and prolonged in the elderly. Neither clinical efficacy nor adverse effects have correlated with serum concentrations. Ondansetron is generally well tolerated. Clinically relevant adverse effects include headache, diarrhea or constipation, sedation, and transient minor elevations of liver function tests. It is not associated with extrapyramidal reactions. Ondansetron is indicated as prophylaxis for nausea and vomiting associated with emetogenic chemotherapy. Studies to further evaluate and define its use are ongoing.",

Single doses of 500 mg of methylprednisolone and 100 mg of dexamethasone are both considered equivalent to 625 mg of prednisone. These very high doses, sometimes termed megadoses, are usually given as intravenous infusions over 30 minutes to 1 hour daily or every other day for a total of 1 to 5 administrations.

The disease has a tendency to flare up in immediate postpartum stage and sometimes also during pregnancy. Hence, planning of pregnancy should be deferred to the stage when the rheumatic diseases are quiescent for six to twelve months. Drugs with teratogenic effects like methotrexate and leflunomide must be stopped three to six months prior to conception. Lower dosage of corticosteroid is advocated with a limit upto 10 mg /day. In third trimester NSAIDs must be avoided. The safer drugs during pregnancy are sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine and azathioprine. Cholestyramine wash or use of charcoal for leflunomide is must if this drug has been taken within two years of planned conception. With lack of evidence regarding teratogenic potentials of biologics, they are to be withheld prior to conception, with the exception of TNF inhibitors, may be allowed to continue. During lactation, NSAIDs preferably short acting Ibuprofen should be given just after feeding. In lactation, the drugs considered safe are the same as used during pregnancy - low dose corticosteroids, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and azathioprine. Similarly, anti TNF agents are also considered safe during lactation. Evidence-based recommendations regarding use of DMARDs and biologics is a powerful tool / guide for rheumatologists in pregnant and lactating women with rheumatic diseases.

      "abstract": "The fears expressed by some careful observers in the early period of the use of sulfonamide compounds in regard to toxic effects have been substantiated. Because of the increasing number of persons who have been sensitized to these drugs, reactions due to them have become a common occurrence; many of them have been serious, and some have been fatal. Some persons have been sensitized by ingestion of these drugs properly administered for a serious illness. Most of the sensitized persons, however, have been given or have taken the drug injudiciously. This means that they have taken it (1) for a trivial disease or (2) for a chronic infection like sinusitis which is known to be benefited only slightly or temporarily. Last, and of particular interest to dermatologists, the drugs have been used (3) externally in the form of ointments, powders or lotions against pyogenic and other dermatologic diseases for",

      "title": "[Acute phenol poisoning].",
      "abstract": "Phenol (carbolic acid) is one of the oldest antiseptic agents. Currently it is used as a disinfectant, chemical intermediate and nail cauterizer. Phenol is a general protoplasmic poison (denatured protein) with corrosive local effects. Phenol derivates are less toxic than pure phenol. The lethal dose is between 3 to 30 g, but may be as little as 1 g. Phenol is well absorbed by inhalation, dermal application, and ingestion. MANIFESTATIONS OF ACUTE POISONING: Local manifestations. Dermal exposure produces lesions which are initially painless white patches and later turn erythematous and finally brown. Phenol produces mucosal burns and coagulum. They cause eye irritation and corneal damage. When ingested, it causes extensive local corrosions, pain, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and diarrhea. Severe gastrointestinal burns are uncommon and strictures are rare. Inhalation produces respiratory tract irritation and pneumonia. Systemic manifestations develop after 5 to 30 minutes postingestion or post dermal application, and may produce nausea, vomiting, lethargy or coma, hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia, dysrhythmias, seizures, acidosis, hemolysis, methemoglobinemia, and shock.Phenol poisoning requires immediate medical evaluation, in cases of significant phenol ingestion (more than 1 g for adults or 50 mg for infants) or symptomatic intoxication. It is necessary to establish and maintain vital functions and establish vascular access. Treatment includes the following: shock (fluids and dopamine), arrhythmias (lidocaine) and convulsions (diazepam). Health personnel should use gowns and rubber gloves. Inhalation of 100% oxygen is recommended. Intubate and assisted ventilation might be necessary. Metabolic acidosis should be managed by 1 to 2 mEq/kg of sodium bicarbonate. Methemoglobinemia should be treated if greater than 30%, or in cases of respiratory distress, with methylene blue 1 to 2 mg/kg of 1% solution, slowly i.v. If phenol is ingested, avoid emesis, alcohol and oral mineral oil and dilution, because they may increase absorption. Gastric lavage is usually not recommended. Immediate administration of olive oil and activated charcoal by small bore nasogastric tube is necessary.Apart from the abovementioned, immediately decontaminate the skin with copious amounts of water followed by undiluted polyethylene glycol. Wash the area thoroughly with soap and water after treatment. Immediately decontaminate the eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes. Follow up examination using fluorescein stain of eyes for corneal abrasion is recommended",

      "abstract": "Sir, Superficial transient discoloration of the dorsum of the tongue and other soft tissues and teeth may be of various colours, typically yellowish or brown and may be caused by certain foods and beverages (such as coffee and tea), habits (such as tobacco and betel)1 and drugs (such as iron salts, chlorhexidine or antibiotics),2–4 especially if these also induce xerostomia (such as psychotropic agents).5 When such discoloration noticeably affects the posterior dorsum of the tongue and the filiform papillae are excessively long and stained dark brown or black, the term black hairy tongue is used, but this is less common than other discolorations. We report a 40‐year‐old caucasian male, who suffered from gastro‐oesophageal reflux only and who had an otherwise clear medical history and no regular drug use or habits such as tobacco use, who presented complaining of a discoloured tongue. The only recent change was a history of use of lansoprazole 15 mg capsules daily for the previous month. Examination revealed no extraoral abnormalities and the only detectable oral abnormality was a yellowish discoloured somewhat hairy tongue mainly on the dorsum bilaterally and posteriorly. Unstimulated whole saliva sialometry revealed a normal salivary flow rate. The discoloration was therefore attributed to the lansoprazole and, by 2 weeks after the end of his 8‐week course of lansoprazole, his tongue had returned to a normal appearance.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT We report a chronic case of nodular vasculitis that responded to oral clofazimine 300 mg daily. The condition had previously responded to moderate dose oral prednisolone, 50 mg daily, but would recur with weaning. Multiple corticosteroid‐sparing agents were trialled, however these were either ineffective or poorly tolerated. The introduction of clofazimine enabled prednisolone dose reduction, not achieved with other agents, to 22.5 mg daily, and was associated with complete suppression of disease activity. Unfortunately the patient developed a clofazimine‐induced enteropathy and the treatment was ceased after almost 2 years of therapy. Cessation of clofazimine was associated with a flare of the condition. Clofazimine should be considered as a corticosteroid‐sparing agent in resistant cases of nodular vasculitis. Clinicians should be aware of clofazimine‐induced enteropathy as a potentially serious complication of the therapy.",

      "title": "Potential Hepatotoxicity of Penicillamine Treatment in Three Patients with Wilson's Disease",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Wilson's disease is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism resulting in a failure of biliary copper excretion. The accumulating copper causes cell damage, primarily in the liver and brain. The basis for the treatment of patients with Wilson's disease is to eliminate the copper burden. Initially, British anti-Lewisite (BAL) was used to increase urinary copper excretion but was impractical for long-term use because of necessary painful injections and side effects (1). In 1956 Walshe introduced penicillamine as an effective treatment of Wilson's disease. Penicillamine causes highly effective urinary copper excretion by reductive chelation (2). Well-known side effects include initial worsening of neurologic symptoms, which are irreversible in some cases, and symptoms of hypersensitivity, such as fever, rash, hives, and adenopathy after penicillamine treatment are described. There is also a risk of bone marrow depression, proteinuria, or other idiosyncratic reactions in the first few weeks of penicillamine administration. Long-term adverse effects such as autoimmune disorders and abnormalities in collagen metabolism have also been described (3,4). Despite these side effects, penicillamine still represents the drug of first choice for the treatment of Wilson's disease. Alternative treatments are triethylene tetramine (trientine) and zinc, which causes a competitive inhibition of copper absorption resulting in a mild negative copper balance. Reports of penicillamine hepatotoxicity in therapy of Wilson's disease are rare. Menara et al. (5) reported penicillamine hepatotoxicity in 2 of 10 patients with Wilson's disease. We report 3 of 50 patients with Wilson's disease treated with penicillamine at our institution, in whom liver enzyme serum levels became elevated during penicillamine treatment. Two of the patients were 7-year-old twins. After diagnosis of Wilson's disease in September 1995, penicillamine was the initial treatment. Penicillamine therapy was discontinued when liver enzyme serum levels increased after 6 weeks of therapy, and only a slight and incomplete normalization of the initially enlarged liver size was noted. After an interval of 4 months without therapy, a second attempt with penicillamine was undertaken, starting with a low dosage of only 2.5 mg/kg, which was increased stepwise to a maximum of 6.5 mg/kg. Liver enzyme serum levels increased again from alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 4.73 μmol/l (normal range, 0.16-0.70 μmol/l), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 2.28 μmol/l (normal range 0.17-0.73 μmol/l), γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT) 1.26 μmol/l (normal range, 0.08-0.55 μmol/l) without therapy, to ALT 9.14 μmol/l, AST 6.88 μmol/l, and GGT 1.76 μmol/l in the first patient after treatment with penicillamine, and from ALT 4.01 μmol/l, AST 2.32 μmol/l, GGT 0.96 μmol/l in the second patient to ALT 8.34 μmol/l, AST 3.93 μmol/l, GGT 2.02 μmol/l during penicillamine administration. The treatment of these two patients was changed to zinc sulfate and later to zinc orotate, which resulted in reduction and, finally, normalization in liver enzyme serum levels during a period of 6 months. Other adverse effects apart from elevated serum transaminases were not observed. The third patient was treated initially with penicillamine after the diagnosis had been established in November 1994. In spite of treatment with an adequate dosage of penicillamine for 3 years, elevated liver enzyme serum levels slightly decreased but remained moderately elevated. Other reasons for increased liver enzyme serum levels, such as infections, were excluded. After the treatment was changed to zinc, the serum levels for ALT, AST, and GGT declined to levels within the normal range during a period of 7 months. In conclusion, elevated liver enzyme serum levels in three patients with Wilson's disease, during treatment with penicillamine, could reflect hepatotoxicity of penicillamine. If the hepatotoxicity to the penicillamine treatment were based on a genetic disorder, as in the case of the twins, it would not have been cleared to date. Hepatotoxic changes seem to be reversible on cessation of penicillamine treatment.

This drug has the unique chemical structure and mode of action properties distinguishing it from anthracyclines and anthracenediones. Pixantrone is one of the treatment option for heavily pretreated patients which to receive their living with doxorubicin and the further application from anthracyclines potentially can lead anthracycline-induced congestive heart failure. The benefit of pixantrone treatment has not been established in patients when used as V line or greater chemotherapy in patients who are refractory to last therapy. In general, pixantrone seems to be safe and manageable. In various trials, there were no unexpected side effects reported and no trials were closed prematurely because of side effects. In an evaluation of 12 clinical trials with pixantrone, the most common side effect (all grades) was hematological toxicity, mainly neutropenia (50% of patients; grade third/fourth: 41%), leukopenia (25%), anemia (31%), and thrombocytopenia (21%). Hematological toxicity was the main reason for a delayed start of subsequent cycles or for omitting the day-15 dose of pixantrone. In the outpatient setting, it is worth considering the use of hematopoietic growth factors. Other side effects included asthenia (23%), pyrexia (23%), and nausea, most patients experienced reversible skin discoloration.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: Use of hallucinogens among school-age children (grades 8, 10, and 12) has been declining.1 However, because hallucinogen use has a lifetime prevalence of 5% in this age group, hallucinogens continue to be a serious public health concern.1 Within the class of hallucinogens, the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) has declined compared to the other agents such as psilocybin.1 Even though the perceived risk of LSD has declined in recent years, the decline in its use may be partially attributable to its reduced availability.1 As with other drugs of abuse, reduced availability of LSD has prompted introduction of more potent, more dangerous, and cheaper alternatives. We report a suspected case of one such alternative, phenethylamine derivative 25I-NBOMe (2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine), commonly known as N-Bomb. To the dismay of public health advocates, 25I-NBOMe is reported to be gaining traction with adolescents and young adults.2 Although in this case the use of 25I-NBOMe was not confirmed with laboratory testing, the clinical presentation and an otherwise negative serum drug profile were highly suggestive of the use of this novel agent.\r\n\r\nCase report. Seventeen-year-old Mr A presented to the emergency department after ingesting “acid.” He described ingesting a blotter paper stained with the psychoactive agent after keeping it on his tongue “for a while.” After ingestion, he became acutely combative toward his friend, who called police, and the patient had to be restrained. The use of drugs prompted a call to emergency medical services, and emergency medical personnel found him to be diaphoretic, flushed, mydriatic, and combative. In the emergency department, he required multiple staff to restrain him for safety concerns. He continued to be diaphoretic and aggressive, screamed incoherently, reported active hallucinations, and thrashed his limbs. Baseline laboratory testing revealed an elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level of 2,064 U/L; results of the rest of the tests were within normal limits. A urine drug screen was negative for the use of alcohol, amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiate, salicylates, and tetrahydrocannabinol. In the emergency department, the patient received a bolus of normal saline, haloperidol 5 mg, and lorazepam 2 mg intramuscularly. While on the medical floor, the patient received continuous intravenous hydration and tolerated oral intake. By second day of hospitalization, his serum CPK level dropped to 1,099 U/L, and the patient did not develop signs of acute renal failure. The clinical presentation was deemed to be inconsistent with the use of LSD, and, after a consultation with the toxicology service, it was determined that the patient ingested a synthetic phenethylamine, most likely 25I-NBOMe.\r\n\r\nIntoxication with synthetic phenethylamine derivatives such as 25I-NBOMe leads to mixed adrenergic and serotonergic symptoms. It is suggested that 25I-NBOMe may be a more potent serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) agonist than many of the previously available phenethylamine derivatives.3 Patients may present with anxiety, agitation, aggression, hallucinations, mydriasis, diaphoresis, hypertension, tachycardia, and serotonin syndrome.3 Patients have to be monitored for development of more serious effects such as tonic-clonic seizures and rhabdomyolysis leading to renal failure.3\r\n\r\nAs in this case, a high index of suspicion for newer, more dangerous synthetic hallucinogens is necessary to manage patients who present with atypical presentation of reported LSD use. Treatment options such as aggressive hydration to manage metabolic acidosis and developing renal failure, benzodiazepines, and external cooling for nonresponsive pyrexia may be considered depending upon unique clinical presentation. Serotonergic agents such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors should be prevented and withheld during the toxidrome, as these patients are at an elevated risk of developing serotonin syndrome due to the excessive serotonergic activity of synthetic phenethylamine derivatives. In cases of suspected toxicity, a clinical consultation from the toxicology service should be requested. Specific laboratory testing may also be considered for analytical confirmation.2,3 Finally, patients, families, first responders, and providers should be educated about the dangers of these novel compounds that may carry a risk of severe morbidity and mortality within a short time span after exposure.",

      "abstract": "Phencyclidine (1-[1-phenylcyclohexyl]piperidine, PCP, hog, sheets, angel dust, Sernylan, and many other common names) is a primate anesthetic that has emerged as a common drug of abuse and as a medical emergency problem during the past few years. Phencyclidine abuse is primarily a youthful activity. It is associated with multiple clinical states, an unusual amount of aggressive behavior, and a variety of problems in management.1 Thirty years ago phencyclidine was developed as an intravenous anesthetic for humans, but the frequency and intensity of emergence deliriums made it unsuitable. It is currently used as a veterinary anesthetic. Because of the availability of its precursors, its ease of manufacture, and its relative inexpensiveness, it became a common street drug during the late 1960s. At that time it was sold when mescaline, psilocybin, or tetrahydrocannabinol was requested, and it served as a virtually universal adulterant for hallucinogens. Not highly regarded among users of psychedelics, it was only infrequently purchased under its own name. During the past few years the picture has changed. Now it is a preferred substance, the most widely available and used hallucinogen. It usually is consumed as part of a polydrug abuse pattern along with alcohol, sedatives, and marihuana. PREVALENCE The extent of its usage is not easily assessed, the wide variety of names and of dosage forms make surveys imprecise.",

It is important especially among patients treated concurrently with antibiotics and other drugs in high doses for a long time. The most significant clinically are pharmacokinetic interactions of antibiotics that are inhibitors of microsomal enzymes (makrolide or quinolones antibiotics, metronidazole or imidazole antifungal agents). Clinical caution is indicated when these antibiotics are combined with drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index such as warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin or digitalis glicosides. Moreover toxic reactions may be observed among patients receiving simultaneously antibiotics and the agents blocking neuromuscular transmission, oral hypoglycaemics, loop diuretics or digoxin.

      "title": "Olanzapine‐induced hyperglycaemic, hyperchloraemic, hyperosmolar state",
      "abstract": "Olanzapine is a widely used newer atypical antipsychotic drug. It is effective in treating both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It has the advantage of causing less extrapyramidal side effects compared to conventional antipsychotics; however, its use can be associated with various metabolic side effects, such as weight gain and alterations in glucose metabolism—hypergly-caemia/new-onset diabetes. These side effects are also seen with other newer antipsychotic agents such as clozapine and quetiapine. We report the case of a patient who developed hyperosmolar, hyperchloraemic, hyperglycaemic state having taken olanzapine therapy for several years. A 44-year-old African man presented with a one-week history of increasing tiredness, lethargy, marked polydipsia and polyuria. For at least the last five years he was taking olanzapine 10 mg daily for psychotic disorder and three months previously he was started on vitamin B12 replacement therapy. He was on no other medication. He had no prior history of diabetes or risk factors for diabetes apart from his ethnicity and the presence of schizophrenic illness. He rarely consumed alcohol and had no family history of diabetes. On examination he was clinically dehydrated and had altered mental status. His pulse was 130/ min, respiratory rate 26/ min, and BP 120/70mmHg. His body mass index was 24 kg/m2. His urine analysis revealed 3+ glucose (55 mmol/L) and 2+ ketones (4 mmol/L). Initial investigation showed serum sodium 180 mmol/L, potassium 3.8 mmol/L, urea 11.5 mmol/L and creatinine 122µmol/L, bicarbonate 29 mmol/L, chloride 143 mmol/L, and glucose 62.5 mmol/L. Serum osmolarity was 440mOsm/L. His liver function test was normal. Urine and blood cultures were negative. HbA1c was 15.7% and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase and islet cell antibodies were negative. After initial intravenous fluid and insulin, he was switched to sub-cutaneous insulin. Olanzapine was discontinued. At follow-up visit, insulin stopped and metformin started. About five months after ini-tial presentation HbA1c was 6.2%. Olanzapine is reported to cause hyperglycaemia and/or diabetic ketoacidosis in obese patients. Several mechanisms are postulated for olanzapine-induced hyperglycaemia such as drug-induced weight gain leading to decreased insulin sensitivity, altered sympathetic nervous system regula-tion of glucose control and insulin release, and drug-induced damage to pancreatic islet cells causing impaired beta-cell function. It appears to be an acute regulatory effect suggesting the possibility of GLUT inhibition, inhibition of insulin signalling and/or impaired translocation.1-3 However, the exact mechanism causing hyperglycaemia and hyperosmolar state is unknown. Since our patient was not obese and did not gain weight during treatment with olanzapine, insulin resistance related to weight gain is unlikely to be the causative mecha-nism in him. Younger age of presentation suggests other aetio-logical contributors. We postulate that factors related to his mental illness and olanzapine might have interfered with his ability to respond to thirst of hyperglycaemia leading to a hyperosmolar state. Further research is needed to describe the underlying mechanism and determine which patients are predisposed to hyperglycaemia. Meanwhile, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of hypergly-caemic, hyperosmolar state with olanzapine in younger patients, and continue to look for warning signs even after several years of therapy. The United Kingdom Schizophrenia and Diabetes Expert Consensus Meeting in Dublin in October 2003 made the following recommendations for the manage-ment of patients to be started on atypical antipsychotics.4 Baseline random (or fasting) plasma glucose and HbA1c test. Repeat tests four months after initiating or changing an antipsychotic. If normal, repeat random (or fasting) glucose annually. If abnormal, refer the patient to general practitioner/diabetes specialist services for proper diagnosis and management. Communicate results between services. There are no conflicts of interest.

      "abstract": "Introduction Quetiapine has been the subject of case reports documenting its abuse. In Morocco, no study has been done showing the prevalence of this misuse. The methods of administration are diverse: oral or nasal, injection, inhalation, consumption with cannabis (smoked) or alcohol, combination with other drugs. The abuse is associated in 75% of cases with another product. Objectives The objective of this work is to describe the management of quetiapine dependence, through a clinical vignette. Methods Through a clinical vignette, and by reviewing the literature, we will describe the management of quetiapine addiction. Results Treatment consists of reducing the consumption of this substance until stopping. When possible, it is recommended to change this antipsychotic to another with low abuse potential and low antihistamine properties such as haloperidol, risperidone or aripiprazole. If, however, this solution was inapplicable, then limit the quantity of tablets by prescribing smaller amounts of antipsychotics and increase the frequency of visits. Cope and relieve: Sometimes other medicines can be used to relieve potential withdrawal symptoms, including benzodiazepines or hypnotics to manage insomnia. Warnings : Ideally, the drug should be reduced gradually with a gradual and planned decrease in the dose taken over the months. There should also be periodic evaluations. Long term treatment: Management must be biopsychosocial. Treating comorbidities is a fundamental step in preventing relapse. Conclusions It is a “prescription” use disorder! Each prescription should be carefully weighed and time bound. It seems important to be vigilant with regard to the dosages administered and the treatment regimens offered to the patients.

      "abstract": "The \"atypical\" antipsychotics are grouped together by what they are not (i.e., not dopamine-2 selective antagonists like haloperidol). While sharing that characteristic, these agents differ substantially in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. This column, the first in a series on these agents, reviews the bioavailability and half-life of the 10 newer \"atypical\" antipsychotics, including the most recently marketed members of this class (asenapine, iloperidone, and lurasidone). Drugs with high oral bioavailability are generally less susceptible to diet or drug-drug interactions affecting first pass metabolism. The converse is true for drugs with lower oral bioavailability (e.g., they may have a food effect in which oral bioavailability is decreased in the fasted versus fed state). The half-life of an antipsychotic agent in large measure determines whether it can be safely and effectively administered once a day, at least in an immediate release formulation. Pharmacokinetic differences among atypical antipsychotics can explain why some individuals may not respond to the usually effective dose of a drug, while others may be especially sensitive to its dose-dependent adverse effects. An understanding of pharmacokinetic differences among the atypical antipsychotics can help clinicians optimize drug selection and dose for specific patients under specific treatment conditions. Subsequent columns in this series on atypical antipsychotics will discuss their metabolism, including the principal enzyme(s) mediating each drug's clearance, effects of co-administration of substantial CYP enzyme inhibitors, effect of hepatic and renal impairment, and the substantial and clinically important pharmacodynamic differences among these agents.",

      "abstract": "Background: Phenibut is a drug similar in structure to gabapentin and pregabalin. It is available online without prescription, often marketed as a dietary supplement or amino acid derivative. Little is known about phenibut use despite its increased popularity in the United States over the last decade.Objective: To clarify reasons for taking phenibut, circumstances, and effects of use.Methods: Reports of phenibut, gabapentin, and pregabalin use were downloaded from a publicly-available database, Erowid.org. A mixed methods approach utilizing qualitative content analysis was used.Results: Of 229 reports, 211 were from male authors. People usually purchased phenibut online and reportedly used it for recreation, to manage a medical or psychiatric problem (primarily insomnia, anxiety), as a substitute for other drugs (especially benzodiazepines), to manage withdrawal from another substance (including benzodiazepines, opioids), and/or for performance enhancement. While it shared many reported effects with pregabalin and gabapentin such as anxiolysis, increased talkativeness, and impaired motor coordination, reports of gastrointestinal distress and sedation were more commonly attributed to phenibut. Several people reported difficulty in restricting their use and managing withdrawal.Conclusions: Phenibut reports suggest that phenibut may have some benefits for some people. Use also, however, carries risks of adverse effects, a potentially dangerous withdrawal syndrome, and addiction. Not dissimilar to unprescribed gabapentin or pregabalin, self-medication is a common motive for phenibut use.

      "title": "Ulipristal acetate. A new emergency contraceptive. Ethical aspects of its use",
      "abstract": "Così come si presenta la pillola del giorno dopo può essere utilizzata in modo efficace fino a 72 ore dopo il rapporto sessuale non protetto. Tuttavia, in alcuni casi, questo periodo può essere troppo breve. Per tale motivo, è stata commercializzata per la prima volta una pillola, l’acetato ulipristal (Ellaone), per la contraccezione d’emergenza post-coitale fino a 120 ore (5 giorni) dopo i rapporti sessuali non protetti o nel caso di insuccesso del contraccettivo. Un aspetto importante da considerare nella valutazione etica di un farmaco usato per la contraccezione d’emergenza è il suo meccanismo d’azione, in quanto tale valutazione sarà molto diversa se il farmaco agisce inibendo o ritardando l’ovulazione o impedendo l’impianto della blastocisti nell’utero materno, dal momento che in quest’ultimo caso eserciterebbe la sua azione portando a termine la vita di un embrione in vita, secondo dunque un meccanismo abortivo. In relazione al meccanismo d’azione dell’Ellaone, quando la pillola è assunta cinque giorni prima dell’ovulazione la sua azione sarà fondamentalmente anticoncezionale, e lo stesso se è assunta quattro giorni prima. Se assunta tre giorni prima dell’ovulazione, può essere anticoncezionale o anti-impiantatorio, ma da allora in poi, il meccanismo attraverso cui l’Ellaone è in grado di prevenire le gravidanze indesiderate sarà anti-impiantatorio o, in altre parole, abortivo. In sintesi, tra il 50% e il 70% del tempo, Ellaone agirà secondo un meccanismo abortivo. Ci sembra che questa sia la realtà oggettiva circa il meccanismo d’azione dell’acetato ulipristal (Ellaone), e quindi il suo effetto anti-impiantatorio dovrà essere preso in considerazione per l’elaborazione di un giudizio etico sul suo uso. ---------- Current presentations of the morning-after pill can be used effectively for up to 72 hours after unprotected sexual intercourse. However in some cases, this period can be short. For that reason, a pill, ulipristal acetate (Ellaone), which is licensed for post-coital emergency contraception up to 120 hours (5 days) following unprotected sexual intercourse or contraceptive failure, has now been marketed for the first time. An important aspect to consider in the ethical assessment of any drug used in emergency contraception is its mechanism of action, as this assessment will be very different if the drug acts by inhibition or delaying the ovulation or by preventing the implantation of the blastocyst in the maternal uterus, since in the latter case it would exert its action by terminating the life of an already living embryo, i.e. by an abortive mechanism. In relation to the Ellaone’s mechanism of action, when the pill is taken five days before ovulation its action will be basically anticonceptive, and the same if it is taken four days beforehand. When it is taken three days before ovulation, it may be anticonceptive or by prenventing implantation, but from then on, the mechanism by which Ellaone may prevent unwanted pregnancies will be by an anti-implantation mechanism, in other words, abortive. In summary, between 50% and 70% of the time, Ellaone will act by an abortive mechanism. It seems to us that this is the objective reality about the mechanism of action of ulipristal acetate (Ellaone), and therefore its anti-implantation effect will have to be taken into consideration when issuing an ethical judgement on its use.",

      "abstract": "In the six years since it was added to the antidepressant agents, tranylcypromine has attracted wide attention because of toxic side reactions and disputed efficacy. It was the first clinically important nonhydrazine monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and it remains Widely used. This review attempts fully to present the history, pharmacology, clinical toxicology, and evidence for the degree of clinical value of the drug in the treatment of depression. The hypertensive syndrome most notable among the drug's adverse reactions probably occurs very infrequently but is largely an unpredictable phenomenon. Fifty‐four of the fifty‐six published clinical trials have been assessed. Many were uncontrolled, encumbered by other concurrent treatments and heterogeneous patient samples, or inadequately reported. Assessment of trials indicated that the drug alone was beneficial in reactive and psychoneurotic depressions, while it tended not to influence agitated, psychotic, or endogenous depressions. Where the drug was compared to other treatments for depreSsion, it was found equivalent or superior to other monoamine oxidase inhibitors in several trials, while it was generally inferior to iminodibenzyl compounds and to electroshock treatment. The findings support a view that tranylcypromine is not the treatment of choice for depression but that it may be indicated where other drugs or ECT have failed.",

      "abstract": "Over the last decade, several advances have been made in the pharmacological treatment of ADHD. Novel medications, longer acting preparations and results from recent clinical trials have broadened the landscape of ADHD management in Canada. Atomoxetine, a novel non-stimulant medication, was approved for use in Canada in December 2004. Unlike methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine, which act primarily by blocking the reuptake of dopamine, atomoxetine selectively inhibits the presynaptic reuptake of norepinephrine (Banaschewski T, et al., 2004). It has been approved for use and indicated in children (6 years of age and older), adolescents, and adults with ADHD. Atomoxetine is not habit forming and is not a controlled substance. Its efficacy and tolerability in children (aged 6 years and older), adolescents, and adults with ADHD has been studied in several RCTs (Banaschewski T, et al., 2004; Biederman J et al., 2002; Kelsey DK et al., 2004; Kratochvil CJ et al., 2002; Michelson D et al., 2003; Michelson D et al., 2002; Michelson D et al., 2001; Spencer T et al., 2002; Weiss M et al., 2005).",

Trimethyloxazolidine dione (tridione) used alone has proved wonderfully effective in controlling seizures of the petit mal triad; petit mal (pykno-epilepsy), myoclonic jerks and akinetic seizures. In contrast, grand mal convulsions were not helped or were made worse. Psychomotor seizures were occasionally aided by tridione combined with an anticonvulsant drug. Methyl phenyl ethyl hydantoin (mesantoin) used in 35 patients, did not help petit mal, but in approximately one-third of patients subject to frequent major seizures it has replaced diphenyl hydantoin (dilantin) with profit, the benefit resulted either from a reduction in the frequency of convulsions or from an absence of the unpleasant side effects of either muscular incoordination or gum hypertrophy. Generalized rash or somnolence were side effects which limited the usefulness of the drug in many patients.",

      "abstract": "Long term corticosteroid therapy has multiple effects on the endocrine system. These include adrenocortical suppression in high doses, alteration of gonadotropic and gonadal secretion, slowing down of long bone growth and bone maturation in children, osteoporosis in adults, alteration of the thyrotropic function and changes in thyroxine peripheral metabolism, diabetogenic effect. The list is not exhaustive, and there are more complex effects on the secretion of prolactin, pancreatic peptides, VIP, etc. Because of these various effects, the pros and cons of long term corticosteroid therapy must be carefully weighted, and if it is necessary steroids should be prescribed in such a way as to limit their side-effects: at best one dose taken in the morning every other day, together with the prescription of calcium, of a salt-free diet and, in some cases, of androgens or oestrogens. Weaning must be carried out with caution, to avoid rebound of the disease treated, and with substitution of hydrocortisone when the corticosteroid dosage reaches 5 mg per day of prednisone or equivalent and can be interrupted. The functional soundness or alteration of the corticotropic and adrenal functions must then be evaluated by testing corticotropic and adrenal functions must then be evaluated by testing the adrenocortical response to tetracosactrin, or even better by measuring early morning concentrations of blood cortisol. Depending on the results obtained, hydrocortisone can be withdrawn and limited to episodes of stress, or continued until ACTH and endogenous cortisol levels have returned to normal values.",

It is generally well tolerated; gastric upset is the most common adverse effect. However very few cases of fixed drug eruptions were reported. Here we present a case of Diclofenac Induced Fixed Drug Eruption. A 62 year old male patient developed fixed drug eruptions with plaques on left thigh two days after receiving diclofenac for osteoarthritic pain. Other etiologies including insect bite, infections were ruled out. One week later after stopping the drug, the lesions were subsided. Diclofenac was strongly suspected as the casual drug. CD8+ effector T-cells have shown to play an important role. However it seems to be a reversible and drug related event. Although it is not life-threatening, fixed drug eruption can have significant effect on the quality of life of patients.Conclusion: Diclofenac is one of the most commonly prescribed NSAIDs by the Physicians. It is usually well tolerated, gastric upset is the most common adverse effect noted with this drug. This case is being reported to highlight a drug as safe as Diclofenac may also be associated with Fixed Drug Eruptions.",

Side effects typical of the benzodiazepines, including sedation, ataxia, muscle relaxation, increased appetite, paradoxical excitation, and increased friendliness, may occur. Alprazolam is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to benzodiazepines, glaucoma, or severe liver or kidney disease. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, can be used to completely or partially reverse the effects of an overdose. Flurazepam may be a preferred benzodiazepine for pets that wake during the night due to its long half-life. Lacking good clinical guidelines as to the specific aggression situations in which benzodiazepines might be helpful or risky, they should be avoided or used with extreme caution in cases involving aggressive animals.",

      "abstract": "More than 50 years ago, methylphenidate immediate-release (MPH-IR) was found to be effective in relieving symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Although the exact mechanism of the action is unknown, the efficacy of MPH is thought to be mediated by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into the presynaptic neuron and increasing the release of these neurotransmitters into the extraneuronal space. Because of its short duration of effect, MPH-IR had to be dosed multiple times daily. In recent years, several methyphenidate extended-release (MPH-ER) formulations have been developed. Methylphenidate hydrochloride for extended-release oral suspension (MEROS or QuillivantTM XR) is the first long-acting MPH-ER oral suspension developed to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. It offers advantages when compared with other MPH-ER preparations for patients who cannot or prefer not to swallow or manipulate capsules or wear a transdermal patch, while maintaining comparable efficacy and duration of effect. The pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety profiles of this controlled substance are reviewed.",

      "abstract": "In 2019, intranasal esketamine gained approval as a promising therapy for those individuals grappling with treatment-resistant depression. Both clinical trials and real-world studies have underscored its efficacy in alleviating and remitting depressive symptoms, with sustained benefits observed for nearly 4.5 years. As the S-enantiomer of ketamine, esketamine's dosing guidelines and strict medical supervision stem from prior research on ketamine's use in depression and history as a recreational drug. Despite initial concerns, long-term clinical studies have not documented instances of abuse, misuse, addiction or withdrawal, and the same was found in case reports or subsamples of high-risk populations with comorbidities such as substance use disorder or alcohol use disorder. Esketamine has proven to be safe and well tolerated without fostering new-onset substance use in vulnerable groups. Real-world studies reinforced these observations, reporting no adverse events (AEs) related to pharmacological interactions of esketamine with any other substance, and no new-onset drug or alcohol misuse, craving, misuse or diversion of use. Reports of esketamine craving remain rare, with only one case report documented in 2022. Most drug-related AEs reported in pharmacovigilance databases are those identified in the product's technical data sheet and with known reported frequency. More importantly, no register of illicit acquisition of esketamine or its tampering for obtaining ketamine or other altered products was found in our search. Overall, our review confirms esketamine's safety across diverse patient populations, reassuring its responsible use and the scarcity of reports of abuse or misuse since its introduction to the market.",

The usual adult dosage of nalidixic acid is 1 g four times daily; the pediatric dosage is 60 mg/ kg/day, divided into four equal doses. The drug is absorbed rapidly after oral administration and reaches peak blood concentrations in twd to four hours. The daily urinary recovery of administered drug is approximately 80% at steady state. Adverse reactions to nalidixic acid develop frequently, occur more readily with prolonged administration and have potentially serious consequences. Common reactions include gastrointestinal disturbances, skin lesions and neurological events such as tremulousness, confusion, drowsiness, headache and dizziness. Nalidixic acid is an alternative form of therapy for the penicillin-sensitive, cephalosporinsensitive or sulfonamide-sehsitive adult who has a recurrent urinary tract infection caused by susceptible Escherichia coli, Proteus sp and Enterobacter sp, uncomplicated by bacteremia. The drug should not be prescribed for patients with acute symptomatic urinary tract infections. Insufficient data are available to justify use of nalidixic acid as a prophylactic agent.

      "title": "Tramadol‐associated pica",
      "abstract": "Pica has been defined as consumption of non-nutritive substances in a manner that is not sanctioned culturally.1 Pica has often been associated with micronutrient deficiency, but the strength of the relation remains unclear.2 Case reports/series have been published on pica associated with various psychotropic medications, such as risperidone and olanzapine.1, 3 The underlying mechanism is not yet clear, but different postulations have been made.4 We report an adolescent who was heroin-dependent and developed pica on being treated with tramadol. A 17-year-old boy presented to a national-level drug-dependence treatment center in northern India with a history of heroin use, consuming street heroin worth Rs 500/day, in a dependent pattern for 2 years, along with smokable-tobacco dependence for 3 years with significant socio-occupational dysfunction. There was no history of any medical/surgical/psychiatric comorbidity. He was started on tab tramadol (300 mg) in divided doses to combat withdrawals on an outpatient basis. The usual recommended safe dose range for individuals older than 16 years is from 25 mg to a maximum of 400 mg/day.5 After starting tramadol, although the patient could abstain from opioids and did not complain of opioid withdrawals, he started eating dry sand. He reported an intense urge to consume sand and he would consume about a handful, 8–10 times/day. No other medication was being consumed simultaneously. Pica did not lead to any new gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting/diarrhea, or to the need for any consultation from a physician/surgeon. This symptom started within 3 days of starting tramadol and resolved completely within a day after stopping it. He was returned after 2 months into treatment, when he was restarted on tramadol (up to 300 mg), after which pica reappeared within 2 days. There was improvement noted in terms of abstinence from the street heroin after 2 weeks of continuing tramadol in the same dose. There had been no similar past history except for these two instances. Blood investigations (including complete hemogram, liver, and kidney function tests) were within normal limits, and no signs of nutritional deficiency were noted. The patient's hemoglobin level was 13 g/dL. The Naranjo score for estimating probability of drug reaction6 was 7, indicating the drug to be a ‘probable’ cause of the reaction. As the patient and his family members considered pica to be problematic, even with his abstinence from heroin, tramadol was replaced with tapering doses of buprenorphine, with the plan to start naltrexone in the long term. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient and his mother. Tramadol is commonly used in outpatient settings in our country for combatting opioid withdrawal. Drug-associated pica has not been reported with tramadol or any other opioid medication in humans. However, a study done on rats who were administered oxycodone (semi-synthetic mu-agonist), showed development of pica, which was attenuated by administering mu-receptor antagonist. The authors postulated the mu-receptor as mediating pica response in rats after administration of oxycodone.7 Tramadol acts as an agonist on mu-receptors apart from blocking reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.5 One postulation for the index case is mediation of pica by mu-agonistic activity. Another postulation made in the literature for pica is the hypodopaminergic state,8 which might have been produced by sudden substitution of heroin (strong mu-agonist) with tramadol (weak mu-agonist). In the index case, pica was noticed in the absence of abnormal blood reports, nutritional deficiency, or similar past history. The symptoms reappeared on re-challenging with tramadol, thus increasing the probability of drug-associated side-effect. Clinicians should be aware of such side-effects for their timely management and better compliance. Further studies are warranted to gain some insight into the possible neurobiological and molecular mechanisms for pica. The authors report no conflicts of interest.",

      "title": "CURRENT EUROPEAN REGULATION PERSPECTIVE ON PEDIATRIC CLINICAL TRIALS",
      "abstract": "Efficacy of the pediatric drug is generally determined by the extrapolation of the adult’s clinical trial data and that drugs are consider as a off labelled drugs. Until recently it was considered that it is difficult to perform clinical trials in pediatric patient because of the ethical consideration. Doses for the pediatric population are often determined from adult dosage. Pharmacokinetic differences are there in children and adult. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the drugs are different in pediatric population as compare to the adult. Many inadequately documented drugs are used in pediatric population. There has been a lack of pediatric trials and this will leads to the limited documentation with respect to many approved drugs. Paracetamol is one of the example of off label drug use (age/weight) in a premature infant, other examples are diclofenac sodium used for abdominal pain (indication) in pediatric population. Adrenaline (rout of administration) given to the pediatric population through inhalational rout rather than intravenous route, pediatric specific information is not available on morphine, lack of pediatric data’s are there on codeine and this codeine is used as a analgesic in pediatric patient. sometimes children also received drugs that do not have approval of drugs regulatory authority and pediatricians prescribed non approved drugs because of there is no available approved drugs or drug strength or formulation suitable for children. In many children hospital the majority of pediatric patient in hospital receiving at least one drug which is off label or unapproved drug. Many risks and adverse drug reaction are also associated with use of the off label drugs and unapproved drugs. Children have same rights as adults to receive effective and safe drugs, i.e. well tested, appropriate route of administration, correct dose, right indication, right period of time, with adequate and correct information and medical surveillance. Critically ill neonates and infants have higher exposure to the off labelled drugs and hence they require clinical trial. Use of these off labelled drugs in pediatric patient is major public health concern. Hence Clinical trials for such drugs is essentially required and should meet every aspects of drug treatment in pediatric patient i.e. occurrences of ADR and all other drug related problem should be documented in clinical practice. Pediatric clinical trial in older drugs is also needed particularly for most commonly used drugs in pediatric population, i.e. analgesic and cardiovascular drugs. EXTRAPOLATION FROM THE ADULT’S CLINICAL TRIAL [2] US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) put a proposal in 1994, based on extrapolation of efficacy determine from adults clinical trial to the Pediatric Evidence based medicine and healthcare constitutes the pillars of optimal medical care. However there are deficits in understanding the quality and efficacy of pediatric therapies, as prime criteria study of regulation required for conducting pediatric clinical trials. Many efficacy data’s are anecdotal. It is evident that over 50% of medicines used in children are not licensed for use in pediatric population. The extrapolation of adults data on medicinal products for pediatric population is basically considered inappropriate. Evidently it was considered that it is difficult to conduct clinical trials in pediatric population taking ethical consideration and recruitment issues, the present study focuses on the regulation of pediatric clinical trial in UK.",

      "title": "LOCAL ANESTHESIA IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY A RE-EVALUATION",
      "abstract": "Almost a half century following attempts to ban its use, cocaine remains at the pinnacle of topical anesthesia in otolaryngology. To understand how nonaddicting synthetic substitutes such as procaine, dibucaine, tetracaine and lidocaine have not totally supplanted cocaine, requires an in-depth analysis of its unique pharmological properties, untoward effects and potential substitutes. Almost all of the reported cocaine deaths occurred after subcutaneous injection; when used topically, cocaine's toxicity has been confined to an occasional reaction. Certain variables under physician control may be manipulated to reduce the chance of reaction to a minimum. For example, intermittent application of a particular dosage results in lower blood levels, and allowing sufficient time between doses reduces the amount necessary to obtain the desired anesthesia. If total dosage is kept below 200 mg there are few reactions. A singular advantage of cocaine over other topical anesthetics is its inherent ability to cause vasoconstriction, thus retarding its own absorption. The addition of a topical vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine is thus redundant, and may actually be harmful as cocaine sensitizes the patient to exogenous epinephrine. Finally, the usual preoperative dosages of barbiturates are entirely inadequate to prevent or treat cocaine reactions. Why, then, have synthetic local anesthetics not replaced cocaine? Inherent differences in topical effectiveness, duration of anesthesia and toxicity provide the answer. Of other local anesthetics possessing topical effectiveness tetracaine is about six times more toxic than cocaine. Dibucaine is as toxic as tetracaine, and lidocaine, while relatively nontoxic, provides only a 15 minute duration of topical anesthesia. A review of cocaine and its potential substitutes thus leads to the conclusion that cocaine is still a vital and necessary instrument in the otolaryngologist's armamentarium, singularly providing excellent topical anesthesia of usable duration, vasoconstriction, and shrinkage of mucous membranes, all with a quite acceptable margin of safety.",

      "abstract": "Background: Children undergoing anaesthesia and surgery can experience significant anxiety and distress during the peri-operative period, but whether routine premedication is necessary is currently debated. Benzodiazepines are the most frequently used drugs as premedication in paediatric anaesthesia. In the US, 50% of young children undergoing surgery receive premedication and midazolam is the most frequently used drug in this context (1). Nishina and coworkers (2) concluded in a review article in 1999 that clonidine, administered via an oral, rectal, or caudal route, is a promising adjunct to anaesthetics and analgesics to enhance quality of peri-operative management in infants and children. Later publications also support the use of clonidine for premedication (3–6). The aim of this communication is to review the use of clonidine in paediatric anaesthesia and to propose clonidine as a promising alternative to midazolam. Clonidine is associated with a number of beneficial effects in the context ofanaesthesia both in adults and children. Why clonidine is not routinely use in clinical practice despite the massive publication list is to a large extent due to the lack of marketing efforts from the pharmaceutical industry since multiplegeneric preparations are now readily available on most markets. Midazolam is also associated with a number of beneficial effects, but is far from an ideal premedicant in children, especially with regards to the amnesia, confusion and long term behavioural disturbances. Clonidine has contrary to midazolam no effect on respiration. We believe that clonidine is a good alternative to midazolam as premedication in infants and children.",

      "title": "FAILURE MODES OF PEO BASED ABUSE DETERRENT OPIOIDS AND PROMETHAZINE HYDROCHLORIDE TABLETS",
      "abstract": "Opioid addiction\nhas become a global epidemic and a national health crisis in recent years. In\n2016, approximately 64,000 Americans under 50 years old were killed because of\nopioid overdoses. The aim of developing an abuse deterrent opioid is to render\nany form of manipulation that encourages abuse challenging and therefore,\nnon-profitable. With this goal, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is\nextensively supporting research into the development of abuse deterrent\ntechnologies and prioritizing their production as a public health\nnecessity. Abuse deterrent approaches include but are not limited to the\nfollowing: (1) using a physical\nbarrier (e.g., Polyethylene oxide PEO) that basically limit the release\nof the drugs in the blood or the digestive tract and prevent mechanical\nalteration of the drugs by crushing, grating, grinding, chewing etc, (2) using\nchemical barriers that employ gelling agents that prevent the aqueous or organic\nextraction of the drugs, and (3) combining\nthe drug with an antagonist that blocks\nthe post-abuse euphoria.\n\nPEO is a popular\npolymer used as a matrix in these complex opioid products. The polymer is\nresponsible for the abuse deterrent properties as well as extended release\nbehavior of opioid drugs. PEO hinders the extraction of Opioid drugs from Abuse\nDeterrent Formulations (ADF), makes it challenging to be injected, and resists\nmechanical stress and pulverization when crushed. PEO can be subjected to thermal processing such as thermal curing,\ncompression molding, melt extrusion, and injection molding owing to its\nthermoplasticity.\n\nAssessment of the\nimpact of using various manufacturing processes to develop ADFs and the effect\nof using various grades of this polymer is essential to improve upon the next\ngeneration of ADFs. There are three main\ncategories of premarket studies: Category 1 – laboratory based (in-vitro\nmanipulations and drug extractions), category 2 – pharmacokinetic and category\n3 –clinical. These studies are required by the FDA to demonstrate that a given\nformulation exhibit abuse deterrent properties before a drug product is\nreleased to the market. In vitro laboratory based manipulation and\nextraction studies which are used to assess AD properties of these\nproducts are challenging, but essential for product development and\ngeneric abuse deterrent product approvals. It is important to realize\nthat there is a great correlation between the laboratory based in vitro\nmanipulation and extraction studies and the expectations of potential abuse and\nmisuse of opioid drugs. The ability of these studies to mimic the manipulation\ntechniques applied by abusers to defeat the abuse deterrent properties of a given\nformulation optimizes predictions on post-market abuse and misuse potential of\nADFs. These studies should also correlate well with in-vivo studies since there is a direct correlation with the\nconcentration (mg/mL in water) and the “high” obtained by an abuser. \n\nThis research aimed\nto conduct laboratory based in vitro manipulation and extraction studies to investigate\nfailure modes of PEO-based\nprescription opioids and Promethazine Hydrochloride PMZ HCl tablets. It\nhighlighted the formulation\ncomponents and the manufacturing parameters that might affect the dose dumping of\nActive Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs). Furthermore, this research identified\nmodel compounds that can be used as surrogates for Oxycodone and the best\nexperimental setup that can be used to conduct smoking simulation experiments.\nMoreover, it provided an overview of the societal impacts of the opioid crisis\nin the state of Indiana.\n\nInvestigations of the\nfailure modes of the PEO-based prescription opioids and PMZ HCL tablets showed\nthat physical manipulation techniques via chopping or grinding are much more\neffective in the destruction of the PEO matrix than thermal manipulation via\nthe application of heat thus promoting the fast release. The factor with the most\nsignificant effect on the failure modes of PMZ HCL tablets was the application\nof physical manipulation, while the one with the lowest impact was the polymer\ngrade. Moreover, producing PEO-based matrix tablets\nvia Direct Compression DC significantly affected dose dumping behavior of the\nAPI from the drug products. The production of the PEO-based matrix tablets via DC\nwas found to be favored over the usage of the melt extrusion method and molding\ntechniques. It was clear that DC kept the integrity of the polymer, allowed for\nslow and controlled release fashion of the API, and rendered the extraction\nprocess relatively hard compared to the Hot Melt Extrusion HME and Molding\ntechniques.\n\nFurthermore, the\nrelease profile of the investigated PMZ HCL products consisted of various phases\nof polymer swelling and API release. Thermal manipulations via the application\nof heat were found to accelerate the dose dumping\nbehavior (90% release) of the APIs from the compressed, extruded, and molded\nPEO-based matrix formulations similarly. On the other hand, heating was\nmuch more effective in the extraction of APIs than chopping or grinding thus\npromoting the ability to draw a\nsolution containing the API into a syringe for injection relatively easy and\nfacilitate higher % API recovery.\n\nAmong the formulation components that might have an\nimpact on the AD properties of the PEO-based drug products are; the choice of\nthe antioxidant, the use of complexing agents, chelating agents, and\nplasticizers. On the other hand, manufacturing process variables that might\nhave a critical impact on AD properties of the PEO-based drug products include\nbut are not limited to; processing temperature compared to the melting point of\nthe polymer and time of exposure\n\nPMZ HCl was used\nas a model drug for Oxycodone in dissolution and extractability studies, while\nCaffeine and L-Nicotine were used as model drugs in smoking simulation\nexperiments. The combination of the propane torch and Kugelrohr apparatus mimic\nthe real-world scenario for smoking Opioids; however, this experimental setup\ncaused thermal degradation rather than vaporization of some model drugs.\n\nAccording to the National\nCenter for Health Statistics; a statistically significant increase in drug\noverdose death rates was reported in 2016 in the state of Indiana among other\nstates. The number of deaths related to opioid pain relievers increased by 3732\nfolds in 2017 compared to the number of deaths in 2014. Moreover, Males were\nmore affected by the opioid crisis than females. On the other hand, the age\ngroup 25-44 years, and white people were the most affected by the opioid crisis\nin Indiana.",

While the wet and dry weights of granulomata are not influenced, D-penicillamine causes a retardation of the healing process in standardised burns. Mechanical properties of connective tissue such as the resistance of cut wounds, the tearing strength of excised dorsal skin strips or of the capsule of the knee-joint show after long-term treatment with D-penicillamine a dose-dependent change in the sense of a decrease of the data obtained.

In addition to the phenothiazines, five other classes of neuroleptic medications are now in use: butyrophenones, thioxanthenes, dihydroindolones, diphenylbutylpiperidines, and dibenzoxazepines. Besides their use in the treatment of psychosis, these drugs have been used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, nausea, alcoholic withdrawal, and pain, and are often administered in combination with other medications. Through the use of these drugs, many psychotic patients have been able to move back into the community, and the family physician is coming into contact with more patients on maintenance dosages of neuroleptics. He/she may wish to prescribe these drugs or may, in the treatment of a medical problem, need to prescribe other medication to an individual already receiving neuroleptics. It is important, therefore, for the family physician to be aware of the side effects of these drugs and of complications which can arise when neuroleptics are given in combination with other families of drugs.",

Tonic-clonic seizures and partial seizures are all suppressed to some extent by phenobarbitone, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and sodium valproate. Of all of the drugs used, none has been shown to be free of teratogenic effects. The long half-lives of phenobarbitone of 72-120 hours, ethosuximide of 30-40 hours in children, and phenytoin of over 20 hours in adults mean that they may be taken as a single daily dose. Interactions between anticonvulsants are common and numerous interactions with other drugs are reported, some of which are important, such as the enhancement of the metabolism of oral contraceptives and warfarin by carbamazepine and phenytoin. No anticonvulsant is free from drug interactions. The advantages and disadvantages of the various drugs are presented. Recommendations are: 1) where only absence attacks occur, use ethosuximide; 2) if there are absence attacks together with other types of attacks use valproate; 3) for partial and secondary tonic-clonic seizures in children and young adults, use carbamazepine; 4) for primary tonic-clonic seizures in young adults, use valproate as a frist choice and carmamazepine as the 2nd; 5) for older patients phenytoin is satisfactory; and 6) for mycoclonus, valproate is chosen.",

Despite their nonbarbiturate chemical structure and regardless of designations other than “sedative‐hypnotic,” at least six of the newer depressant drugs can cause states of intoxication and physical dependence that are clinically similar to those induced by barbiturates. These drugs are meprobamate (Miltown, Equanil), glutethimide (Doriden), ethinamate (Valmid), ethchlorvynol (Placidyl), methyprylon (Noludar), and chlordiazepoxide (Librium). The behavioral effects of these drugs and their combination with ethanol may become an increasingly important public hazard. The abstinence syndromes that can result from the abrupt withdrawal of excess dosages of these drugs include convulsions and psychotic behavior. Death has been attributed to withdrawal of meprobamate and methyprylon. Office or ambulatory withdrawal of any of these drugs after use in large dosage is not recommended. Gradual dosage reduction or barbiturate substitution prior to its gradual withdrawal during hospitalization is suggested. Substitution of diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin) or any of the phenothiazines as the sole means of support during sedative‐hypnotic drug withdrawal is a questionable practice.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor:—While searching the literature for other reasons, I came across a number of articles concerning the use of amantadine for treatment of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. Amantadine, which has been used around the world for almost 25 years for both short- and long-term treatment of influenza A and Parkinson's Disease, has been tried with encouraging results on a short-term basis on persons with advanced Alzheimer's disease,1,2 Creutzfeld-Jacob disease,3 and other types of cerebral dysfunction.4–6 In addition, amantadine has been reported to have a beneficial effect on depression,7 fatigue,8 and inactivity,9 which are common problems in people with Alzheimer's Disease. The pharmacological properties of amantadine are well known.10 It has been so widely used for so long that its real and possible adverse effects in multiple situations, including its use in the elderly,11 are well known. The side effects are quite uncommon when low doses are used (eg, 200 mg daily),12 and if low doses are ineffective, a stimulant such as Pemoline (20 mg/day) can be added to increase the efficacy without increasing side effects.12 It is unfortunate that clinical trials to assess the effects of amantadine in Alzheimer's Disease are unlikely since the patent has expired, although its relatively low toxicity translates into a potentially favorable benefit/risk ratio. Because of the limited number of treatment options available for Alzheimer's and related diseases, individual physicians might consider a trial of this drug in specific patients with early disease in which improvement can be objectively measured. If there is no observable improvement in a month, the drug can be discontinued with no damage done to the patient, whereas if there are any adverse effects, the drug can be withdrawn immediately with complete reversal of any such effects. At the very least, it could replace the need for Influenza A vaccination in the elderly11 while treating Alzheimer's disease. To date, I have had very encouraging results in using amantadine in patients with early dementia, and I would recommend other physicians trying and reporting the effects of amantadine in their patients.",

The pharmacokinetic parameters of meloxicam are linear over the dose range 7.5–30 mg and bioequivalence has been shown for a number of different formulations. No interactions were observed following the concomitant administration of food, cimetidine, antacid, aspirin, β-acetyldigoxin, methotrexate, warfarin or furosemide. Neither hepatic insufficiency nor moderate renal dysfunction have any relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of meloxicam and dosage adjustments in the elderly are not required.",

      "title": "Zoledronate: Efficacy and Safety",
      "abstract": "The bisphosphonates have revolutionized the management of Paget's disease. Their potent anti-osteoclastic action brings about substantial reductions in biochemical indices of bone turnover, often returning them to normal.1-3 They have also been shown to reduce scintigraphic indices of disease activity4, 5 and to promote the healing of lytic pagetic lesions.2 However, currently available regimens are not optimal. Because of the low gastrointestinal absorption of bisphosphonates, oral regimens use relatively high doses and require administration over periods of some months. They sometimes cause significant gastrointestinal side effects and need to be taken fasting, at least one-half hour before food. These regimens are effective but involve significant inconvenience to patients and sometimes are not tolerated. Intravenous regimens have been in use for >20 years, principally with pamidronate.6, 7 This agent also produces good disease control, but the milligram doses required are high, so the agent is usually given as a series of 2-hour infusions. This is time-consuming and requires multiple patient visits. The advent of more potent bisphosphonates that are available as intravenous preparations raises the possibility of single dose therapy for Paget's disease. The potential for this has already been shown in a small study of ibandronate.5 Zoledronic acid (also known as zoledronate) is the most potent bisphosphonate currently available for clinical use, so it is a logical agent to assess in this condition. It is administered as a single 15-minute infusion and produces comparable effects on turnover markers and BMD in postmenopausal women as 12 months of oral bisphosphonate therapy.8 Zoledronate has been studied previously in two small trials in Paget's disease. In one, doses of 24–400 μg were administered, and biochemical endpoints were followed over the following 2 weeks.9 The highest of these doses caused reductions in hydroxyproline of almost 50%, although, as expected, there was no effect on serum alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) over this short time-course. A second study10, 11 showed a halving of turnover markers at 90 days after an infusion of 400 μg, with lesser responses to lower doses. We have recently reported a pooled analysis of two independent randomized controlled trials that followed identical protocols involving comparison of a single infusion of zoledronate 5 mg over 15 minutes followed by placebo tablets or a saline infusion followed by an active oral comparator, risedronate 30 mg daily, for a period of 60 days.12 The core study was of 6-month duration, and poststudy follow-up is still ongoing. A total of 357 patients with radiologically confirmed Paget's disease were studied at 45 centers in 10 countries. Entry criteria included an ALP ≥2 times the upper limit of normal, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D > 15 ng/ml (37 nM), and no evidence of other conditions impacting on bone metabolism. All patients were provided with supplemental calcium (1000 mg/day in divided doses) and calciferol (400–1000 U/day). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a therapeutic response, defined as normalization of ALP or a reduction of at least 75% from baseline in ALP excess (the difference between the measured level and the midpoint to the reference range) at 6 months. One hundred eighty-two patients were enrolled in the zoledronate group and 175 in the risedronate group, of which 177 and 172 patients, respectively, received the study drug. At baseline, subjects were 70 years of age, 45% were treatment naive, and mean serum ALP was 430 U/liter. Sixty-eight percent were men. Greater than 90% compliance with tablets was achieved in 98% of patients allocated to risedronate and in 93% allocated to zoledronate. ALP levels showed a more rapid and profound reduction in the patients treated with zoledronate (Fig. 1). Rates of therapeutic response were higher in zoledronate at all time-points after 10 days, reaching 96% for zoledronate and 74% for risedronate at 6 months. Response rates were similar in the two individual studies. The median time to a first therapeutic response was 64 days in the zoledronate patients and 89 days with risedronate (p < 0.001). The greater response rates with zoledronate were independent of age, sex, baseline ALP, and previous therapy for Paget's disease (Table 1). ALP normalization rates also showed differences between groups (p < 0.001) at all time-points from 1 month onward. Serum N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP) another marker of osteoblast activity, showed a similar pattern to ALP, but the P1NP response tended to be greater, probably because P1NP is a more specific index of osteoblast activity (data not shown). Median percent change from baseline of serum ALP activity, serum β-CTX, and urine α-CTX during the core studies. The significance of the between-group differences are shown. The response of bone resorption to these interventions was assessed with measurement of serum β C-telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) and urine α-CTX (Fig. 1). Zoledronate produced a more rapid effect, which was greater than that associated with the use of risedronate at all follow-up visits. The pattern of response of these markers is different from that seen for the formation markers. The nadir for the resorption markers for zoledronate is reached at the first follow-up assessment at day 10, whereas that for risedronate is reached at 2 months. In contrast, the nadirs for formation markers are reached at 3–6 months for both agents. There were small decreases in mean serum calcium in both study groups at day 10 (−0.20 ± 0.01 mM for zoledronate, −0.08 ± 0.01 mM for risedronate) that were significantly different between groups (p < 0.0001; (Fig. 2). Serum calcium returned to baseline in both groups by 6 months. Serum phosphate showed similar changes. The calcium changes were reflected in elevations of PTH in both groups (3 months: zoledronate +1.7 ± 0.3 pM, risedronate +1.1 ± 0.2 pM; 6 months: zoledronate +0.7 ± 0.1 pM, risedronate +0.2 ± 0.1 pM), which were significantly greater at 6 months for zoledronate (p = 0.002). Eight patients assigned to zoledronate developed hypocalcemia, six of whom were asymptomatic. The two patients who were mildly symptomatic had not taken calcium and vitamin D tablets. One risedronate patient had severe symptomatic hypocalcemia despite taking calcium/vitamin D as prescribed, requiring hospitalization, and was treated with intravenous calcium. All these events occurred in study days 3–13. Mean (SD) serum concentrations of various analytes during the core studies. Serum creatinine decreased slightly but significantly (−4.4 ± 0.7 μM) in the zoledronate group at day 10 compared with the risedronate group (−0.1 ± 0.7 μM). At subsequent visits, values were comparable between the two groups. In the zoledronate group, mean scores for each of the eight components of the SF-36 tended to increase above baseline at both 3 and 6 months, indicating improvement. The increases were statistically significant for physical functioning at 3 months, bodily pain at 3 and 6 months, general health at 6 months, vitality at 6 months, and role limitations caused by emotional problems at 3 and 6 months. The pattern of responses was more mixed for risedronate, and the only significant improvement was for bodily pain at 3 months. When comparisons were made between groups, the changes were significantly more positive in the zoledronate group in comparison with the risedronate group for the components shown in Fig. 3. The composite score, physical component summary, showed significant positive changes at both 3 and 6 months in the zoledronate group, and these changes were significantly greater than those in the risedronate group at 3 months. Multivariate testing (Wilks'λ multivariate F-test) across all the domains suggested the superiority of zoledronate (p = 0.05), as did testing across the two summary scores (p = 0.04). Quality of life as assessed by mean (±SE) changes from baseline in the some of the items of the SF-36. *Differences within groups analyzed by one-sample t-test, p < 0.05. †Differences between groups analyzed by two-sample t-test, p < 0.05. A five-point improvement is generally considered to be clinically significant, and such an increase was found more commonly in the zoledronate group for bodily pain, p < 0.05. Transiliac bone biopsies were carried out in 22 patients: 12 taking zoledronate and 10 taking risedronate. Eleven biopsies were not satisfactory for quantitative analysis, but these were examined qualitatively and showed no evidence of abnormality. Of the evaluable biopsies, two came from sites of Paget's disease (one in the zoledronate group and one in the risedronate group). The risedronate-treated biopsy showed a supranormal mineralizing surface (16.7%), but both biopsies were otherwise normal apart from the presence of the woven bone characteristic of Paget's disease. A further biopsy from a zoledronate subject included only remnants of iliac epiphysis and was left out of the general analysis, but this showed no evidence of a mineralization defect or other abnormalities. The data from the remaining eight biopsies show comparability between the groups, except for mineralizing surface, which was >10-fold higher in the risedronate-treated patients (Table 2). This is consistent with a lesser antiresorptive effect at month 6 in the risedronate group. There was no evidence of adynamic bone or qualitative abnormalities of bone formation in any biopsy. Adverse events occurred in 54% of zoledronate patients in the first 3 days after study drug infusion compared with 25% of those assigned to risedronate (p < 0.01). Musculoskeletal pain, fever, and flu-like illness accounted for most of these events, consistent with the well-recognized acute phase reaction after intravenous aminobisphosphonates. Subsequently, adverse event rates were similar in the two groups. The substantial efficacy of zoledronate raises the important question as to where this drug fits into clinical practice in the management of Paget's disease. It is quite clear from the direct comparison with risedronate that when these agents are given in the doses and durations used in the phase 3 studies, zoledronate is more effective and its effects are more long-lasting. This does not rule out the possibility that larger doses or longer durations of administration of risedronate could achieve greater efficacy, but this remains unexplored. The time that an individual remains in remission is clearly related to the nadir in turnover markers achieved, so the short duration of benefit from risedronate is explicable simply in terms of its less marked suppression of turnover markers. However, this does not rule out a possible contribution from risedronate's lower affinity for bone mineral to its apparently shorter duration of action.13 There are no other studies directly comparing the commonly used bisphosphonates with one another. The efficacy data with zoledronate may be slightly superior to those with alendronate,1, 2 particularly with respect to the number of subjects normalizing ALP, but there is abundant anecdotal evidence that longer durations of alendronate therapy produce very high rates of biochemical remission. The same is likely to be true of other available agents. Equally well, repeated doses of zoledronate are likely to produce even greater efficacy. Therefore, these data should not be interpreted as definitively establishing zoledronate as the most effective therapy for Paget's disease. However, they do show its capacity to achieve efficacy that is at least as good as that with any other agent from a single intravenous infusion. This was possible with minimal side effects. The demonstrable ease of treatment of Paget's disease with this agent suggests that a reappraisal of our whole approach to the treatment of this condition is appropriate. There are several philosophical approaches to how Paget's disease should be managed, none of which are strictly evidence based. There is general agreement that patients with symptoms likely to be caused by Paget's disease should receive treatment.3, 14-16 This is clear-cut in individuals who have pain at the site of a pagetic lesion. It can be less straightforward in individuals with joint pain adjacent to a pagetic lesion, but it is a common observation that anti-pagetic drugs can produce variable degrees of improvement in such symptoms.14-16 Patients with neurological complications from spinal cord or other nerve entrapment also improve with anti-pagetic therapy.14-17 Expert opinion supports the use of anti-pagetic therapy before elective surgery on pagetic bone, because this reduces the vascularity of pagetic bone and results in less perioperative blood loss.15, 16 There is a variable endorsement of treatment aimed to prevent complications of Paget's disease, because there is no clinical trial evidence that anti-pagetic therapy can prevent the progression of deformity, the development of pagetic symptoms, or fracture. However, it is clear that treating Paget's disease leads to a restoration of normal bone histology,2 that it can lead to healing of lytic lesions on radiographs,2 and that, in the absence of such intervention, both bone lysis and deformity progress. In the absence of clinical trial data that address these important questions (and the unlikelihood of such data becoming available), it seems unreasonable to withhold safe therapies that are able to halt histological and radiological disease progression. Therefore, many experienced physicians endorse the provision of anti-pagetic therapy for individuals with lytic lesions in long bones, lesions at sites that are likely to lead to neurological complications, arthritis, or deformity, and in individuals with involvement of the skull that could compromise hearing.15, 16 This is not an endorsement of providing treatment for every individual with abnormal biochemistry irrespective of their likelihood of ever becoming symptomatic from their pagetic lesion(s). When providing treatment targeted at these goals, it is important to consider how adequacy of therapy can be judged. In the case of individuals with pain, this can be judged by maximal relief of pain. Lytic radiographic lesions can be followed with sequential radiographs, and treatment continued until healing is apparent. Activity at other sites can be assessed indirectly with biochemical markers, although these are much less sensitive in individuals with monostotic disease. In this context, there can be considerable residual activity at a single affected site, without systemic markers being abnormal. Bone scintigrams provide the most sensitive way of assessing local disease activity. I believe that it is important to have specific indications for the therapy of Paget's disease and specific endpoints that define adequacy of therapy. These data pose the question of how the choice should be made between oral and intravenous bisphosphonates in treating Paget's disease. The key issue is that, whatever potent bisphosphonate is being used, it should be given with a clear therapeutic endpoint in mind and in a dose and duration adequate to achieve that endpoint. Whether an oral or intravenous agent is used, is largely a question of the personal preference of the patient. Those with a history of upper gastrointestinal problems or who find difficulties with the restrictions imposed by daily dosing with oral bisphosphonates will favor an intravenous agent. On the other hand, those who have experienced severe acute phase reactions with parenteral bisphosphonates or who are unwilling to accept the discomfort of intravenous injections will opt for longer-term oral dosing. As long as the supervising physician has a clear therapeutic endpoint in mind at the outset, an adequate outcome should be achieved with either class of agent. The relative durations of these remissions with the variety of available agents is not clear at present, other than for the single comparison carried out in the recent zoledronate studies. In conclusion, zoledronate provides another safe and effective way of helping patients with Paget's disease achieve the state of clinical, biochemical, or radiological remission that is considered necessary for their continued good health. I am grateful to my co-authors from the original description of the phase 3 trials(12) and co-investigators from the phase 3 study program for access to data from those trials.",

      "abstract": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical use, adverse effects, drug interactions, and dosage of felbamate are discussed. Felbamate (2-phenyl-1,3-propanediol dicarbamate) is chemically unrelated to any of the other currently marketed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). It appears that felbamate, like phenobarbital and valproic acid, decreases the frequency of seizures by decreasing seizure spread and increasing seizure threshold. Oral felbamate is at least 90% absorbed, and peak concentrations are reached in one to six hours. The half-life is a little less than one day. A therapeutic range of plasma concentrations has not been determined. Felbamate has been used effectively as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in patients with partial seizures with or without secondary generalization and as adjunctive therapy in children with partial or generalized seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Felbamate may also be safe and effective in patients with generalized, absence, atypical absence, juvenile myoclonic, infantile, and gelastic seizures. The most frequently reported adverse effects of felbamate include nausea, anorexia, vomiting, headache, fatigue, somnolence, insomnia, and increased serum aspartate aminotransferase levels. The frequency of adverse effects is greater in patients receiving other AEDs in addition to felbamate. Felbamate affects the pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, and methsuximide; other AEDs also affect the pharmacokinetics of felbamate. The dosage of felbamate should begin at 400 mg orally three times daily and then increase by 600 mg/day every two weeks to up to 3600 mg/day. If the patient is receiving other AEDs concurrently, their dosage should be decreased as the dosage of felbamate is increased. If the goal is to switch to felbamate, the dosage should be increased weekly as the dosages of other AEDs are reduced. Felbamate offers a safe and effective alternative to other AEDs in the treatment of partial and secondarily generalized seizures; partial and generalized seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome; and atypical absence seizures, gelastic seizures, and other difficult to control seizures.",

It has been used extensively in the UK1 for over 40 years and appeared effective.2 It was listed in the WHO as the second step on the Analgesic Ladder for the treatment of cancer pain. Adult data suggest the combination paracetamol 1000 mg/codeine 60 mg provides better analgesia (number needed to treat, (NNT) 1.9) than codeine 60 mg (NNT 17), or paracetamol 1000 mg (NNT 4.6), illustrating the synergistic effect of analgesic combinations.3 The addition of codeine to paracetamol increased duration of analgesia by about 1 hour, and reduced the need for rescue medication.4 Consequently, many clinicians have expressed surprise at moves by regulatory bodies (US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency) to impose restrictions on its use in children, particularly after adenotonsillectomy.\n\nChildren suffer considerable pain with severe functional limitation for at least 7 days after this common procedure.5 Although part of the problem may be inadequate parent education and information concerning analgesia,6 there are also gaps in our pharmacologic armamentarium. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) have been frowned upon because of fears concerning their effects on platelet function and subsequent postoperative bleeding despite studies demonstrating that NSAIDs did not cause any increase in bleeding requiring a return to operating room.7 Paracetamol dosing recommendations have been lowered in recent years; these recommendations are not based on pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic knowledge,8 but rather on fears of potential hepatotoxicity due to paracetamol's oxidative metabolite (N -acetyl- p -benzoquinone imine).9 This adverse effect is rare but devastating when the drug is routinely given, and the reason why some children are so afflicted remains unknown.

      "abstract": "Clozapine is often referred to as the gold standard for the treatment of schizophrenia and yet has also been described as the most underutilized treatment for schizophrenia supported by solid evidence-based medicine. In 2008, it was used to treat only 4.4% of patients with schizophrenia in the U.S., which is ~10-20% of those with approved indications for clozapine for which there is no alternative of equal efficacy. Its use is much higher in Scandinavian countries and China. The primary indications for clozapine are: 1) treatment-resistant schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, defined as persistent moderate to severe delusions or hallucinations despite two or more clinical trials with other antipsychotic drugs; and, 2) patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are at high risk for suicide. Concerns over a number of safety considerations are responsible for much of the underutilization of clozapine: 1) agranulocytosis; 2) metabolic side effects; and, 3) myocarditis. These side effects can be detected, prevented, minimized and treated, but there will be a very small number of fatalities. Nevertheless, clozapine has been found in two large epidemiologic studies to have the lowest mortality of any antipsychotic drug, mainly due to its very large effect to reduce the risk for suicide. Other reasons for limited use of clozapine include the extra effort entailed in monitoring white blood cell counts to detect granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis and, possibly, minimal efforts to market it now that it is largely generic. Awareness of the benefits and risks of clozapine is essential for increasing the use of this lifesaving agent.",

Long-term management of affected dogs in New Zealand involves treatment with oral fludrocortisone acetate (Florinef tablets; Bristol-Myers Squibb (NZ) Ltd, Auckland, NZ), which is a relatively expensive synthetic adrenocortical steroid. Table salt may be added to the food, in an attempt to reduce the amount of fludrocortisone required. Despite fludrocortisone therapy, many Addisonian dogs remain hyponatraemic and hyperkalaemic and the required dose of fludrocortisone may need to be increased during the first year of treatment. Increasing the dose of fludrocortisone is not only expensive, but may also have undesirable effects through its potent glucocorticoid action.",

      "title": "A New Anticonvulsant, 1‐Methyl‐5:5‐Phenylethylhydantoin. Its Use in Pediatrics",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The hydantoins, particularly diphenylhydantoin (Dilantin) and phenylethylmethyl‐hydantoin (Mesantoin), have been two of the major drugs used in the control of epilepsy for the past ten years. Each of these have given some evidence of toxicity, although this has been within acceptable limits for the syndrome treated. Dilantin has produced gum hypertrophy and hirsutism, with occasional damage to the liver and bone‐marrow. The primary toxic effect of phenylethylmethylhydantoin has been on the blood‐forming organs and the liver, although severe skin manifestations have been reported. For these reasons a hydantoin as effective or more effective than those mentioned, with fewer toxic effects, would be of value in the control of epilepsy. The new compound, 1‐methyl‐5:5‐phenylethylhydantoin, has had a limited clinical trial. This paper reports results obtained over 3 years in 109 epileptic children who had previously proved resistant to the usual anticonvulsants. In this drug‐resistant group 16 were completely controlled and 23 were improved, giving an improvement‐rate of 37 per cent. This would not be satisfactory in the usual type of epileptic patients, but in this group it was considered significant. There were no major toxic symptoms, though 16 patients had minor side‐effects. A further extension of the study is warranted. This should include epileptics not previously treated with other drugs, and children suffering from behavior disorders without seizures. RÉSUMÉ Un anticonvulsif nouveau, 1‐méthyl‐5: 5‐phényléthylhydantoine: son usage en pédiatrie Les hydantoines, en particulier la diphénylhydantoine (Dilantine) et la phényléthylhydantoine (Mésantoine) ont été deux des médicaments les plus employés pour le contrôle de l'épilepsie pendant les dix dernières années. Chacune d'elles a donné des preuves de sa toxicité, mais cette toxicité reste dans les limites acceptables pour le traitement de ce syndrome. La Dilantine a provoqué l'hypertrophie des gencives et de l'hirsutisme, des atteintes du foie et de la moelle osseuse ont été parfois signalées. L'action toxique primordiale de la phényléthylméthylhydantoine est dirigée sur les organes hématopoiétiques et le foie, bien que des manifestations cutanées sévères aient été signalées. Pour ces raisons, une hydantoine aussi qu plus efficace que celles mentionnées ici et avec moins d'effets toxiques serait appréciée du corps médical pour le contrôle de l'épilepsie. La 1‐méthyl 5: 5‐phényléthylhydantoine est une hydantoine nouvelle qui n'a subi qu'un essai clinique limité. Cet article donne les résultats de trois ans d'étude chez 109 patients enfants qui s'étaient déja révélés résistants aux médicaments anticonvulsifs habituels. Dans ce groupe de patients résistant aux médicaments, 16 ont été contrôlés complètement et 23 ont été améliorés, soit un taux d'amélioration de 37 pour cent; ceci ne constituerait pas un taux d'amélioration satisfaisant pour le type habituel d'épileptiques, mais dans ce groupe on l'a considéré comme significatif. Il n'y a eu aucun problème majeur de toxicité, bien que 16 des patients aient eu de faibles reactions secondaires. De plus amples recherches sont justifiées. Elles devront comprendre des épileptiques non traités auparavant par d'autres médicaments et des enfants souffrant principalement de désordres du comportement sans crises. RESUMEN 1‐metilo‐5: 5‐feniletilhidantoína, un anticonvulsivante nuevo: su empleo en la pediatria Desde hace diez anos, las hidantoínas, sobre todo la difenilhidantoína (Dilantina) y la feniletilmetilhidantoína (Mesantoína) son dos de los medicamentos principales que se emplean en el gobierno de la epilepsia. Los dos medicamentos han dado algunos signos de toxicidad, pero éstos no han excedido los límites aceptables para el síndrome que se trataba. La Dilantina ha producido la hipertrofia gingival y el hirsutismo, y a veces daños del higado y de la medula ósea. Los mayores efectos tóxicos de la feniletilmetilhidantoína han sido en los órganos que producen sangre, y en el higado; además se han notado manifestaciones severas en la piel. Por consiguiente, una hidantoína tan eficaz o mas eficaz que las sobredichas, con menos efectos tóxicos, valdría mucho en el gobierno de la epilepsia. El nuevo compuesto químico, 1‐metilo‐5: 5‐feniletilhidantoína, ha tenido una prueba clínica limitada. Se presentan en este papel los resultados obtenidos durante 3 años en 109 niños epilépticos que antes de eso se mostraban resistentes a los anticonvulsivantes ordinarios. En este grupo de niños resistentes a las drogas, la epilepsia se gobernó completamente en 16 niños, y otros 23 mejoraron. Hubo un mejoramiento del 37 por ciento, el cual no habría sido aceptable en el tipo común de pacientes epilépticos, pero en este grupo se juzgó que era importante. No había ningunos síntomas tóxicos importantes, pero en 16 de los pacientes se vieron efectos colaterales de poca importancia. Este trabajo vale extenderse. Debería incluir epilépticos que no han tomado de antemano otros medicamentos, y niños que padecen principalmente de disturbios del comportamiento, sin crisis.",

      "title": "Colchicine toxicity in patients with chronic renal failure",
      "abstract": "The therapeutic virtues of colchicine have been known since the 6th century AD, and it has been used since the 19th century for the treatment of gouty arthritis (for historical review see [1]). More recently colchicine became the only efficient treatment for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) [2] and the rare Muckle-Wells syndrome [3]. This drug, a highly lipophilic alkaloid extracted from Colchicum autumnale (meadow saffron) (Fig. 1), diffuses into all cells, irreversibly impairing microtubule organization and function and arresting the cell cycle at metaphasis. It blocks intracellular protein trafficking, membrane turnover and exocytosis, thereby hampering leukocyte functions, intestinal water and solute reabsorption, bone marrow cytogenesis, muscle contractility and nerve axonal viability [1]. Colchicine is a powerful poison with a narrow margin between efficacy and toxicity. Doses of 1-3 mg/day are usually followed by diarrhoea within a few days [4], and more than 3 mg/day for several days induces profuse diarrhoea, acidosis, dehydration, bone marrow aplasia and cardiac failure. Rapid death may ensue, due to hypovolaemic, cardiogenic and septic shock [5]. Chronic toxicity is rare in patients with no visceral compromise because diarrhoea usually leads to stopping treatment. Conversely, toxic effects appear early in circumstances that impair colchicine excretion [6], such as hepatocellular insufficiency, chronic renal failure and cyclosporin A treatment [7,8]. Chronic toxicity is marked by a particular form of neuromyopathy [9] and often myocardial failure, which entails a dismal prognosis. Despite its hazards in chronic renal patients, colchicine is still used in gouty arthritis and in pseudogout following metastatic calcification.",

About fifty per cent of patients with mild levodopa-induced fluctuations are improved by the addition of 10 mg a day of selegiline and there may be associated relief of nocturnal and early morning disabilities. This effect is usually apparent within a week of starting treatment and is sustained in the majority of responders for at least one year, after that oscillations progressively return. Compared with other anti-parkinsonian drugs this medication is relatively easy to use and has few adverse side-effects. Unlike conventional monoamine oxidase inhibitors, dietary restrictions of tyramine are unnecessary and rises in blood pressure do not occur when it is used together with L-dopa. Selegiline also has mild L-dopa sparing effects (100-200 mg per day) and it may also increase alertness, drive and motivation (Lees et al., 1977). Some of the more controversial issues relating to selegiline will be discussed in this article.",

We describe a case of convulsions resulting from a single dose of nalidixic acid in a previously healthy two-month-old child in Northern Iraq who was being treated for a diarrhoeal illness. The child presented to us with new onset seizures, irritability, and acidaemia. Nalidixic acid was thought to be responsible after the exclusion of other potential causes of seizures. Symptoms resolved by treatment with intravenous (IV) diazepam, and cessation of nalidixic acid, and the child recovered fully and was discharged home neurologically intact after two days of observation. In regions where it is commonly prescribed, such as Northern Iraq, nalidixic acid should be considered as a cause of convulsions in any seizing child who has been exposed to the drug. Furthermore, quinolones such as nalidixic acid are contraindicated in children &amp;lt; 3 months of age.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews the recreational use of ketamine (\"Special K\"; KET) and explores the recent diffusion of its new derivative methoxetamine (\"Special M\"; MXE). The literature search on the nonclinical/recreational use of KET and MXE was carried out in a range of medical databases. Considering the limitations of peer-reviewed information, data were integrated with a qualitative assessment of a range of websites, drug fora, and other online resources including e-newsgroups, chat rooms, mailing lists, e-newsletters, and bulletin boards. The recreational use of KET has started since its discovery in 1962. This was due to its rapid onset, short duration of action, and peculiar psychotropic effects (\"K-hole\"). The latter effect ranges from confusion to dissociation and depersonalization (near-death experience). However, KET abuse is often associated with physical and psychological side effects, of which the worst is urological/bladder toxicity. Recently, MXE has emerged as a legal and \"bladder-friendly\" KET alternative. MXE presents with the same dissociative effect of KET, but with slower onset and longer duration of action. However, MXE seems to be associated with worse side effects than KET, ranging from mood disturbances/suicidal attempts to acute cerebellar toxicity. After 50 years of its discovery, KET has led to the emergence of MXE. However, this latter derivative does not appear to be a safer alternative to KET itself.",

Quinidine is contraindicated in patients who are known to be allergic to it or who have developed thrombocytopenic purpura during prior therapy with quinidine or quinine. In the absence of a functioning artificial pacemaker, quinidine is also contraindicated in any patient whose cardiac rhythm is dependent upon a junctional or idioventricular pacemaker, including patients in complete atrioventricular block. Quinidine levels may be increased by drugs that alkalinize the urine (carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate, thiazide diuretics), amiodarone or cimetidine, ketaconazole, and diltiazem. Quinidine levels may be decreased by nifedipine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, and verapamil.",

Discussion of the topic prompted us to review the literature and disseminate 'lessons learned'. <h3>Methods</h3> <b>L</b>iterature review <h3>Results</h3> A 25 microgram/hour fentanyl patch is equivalent to an oral morphine dose of 60–90 mg in 24 hours Patches worn for 3 days and discarded may still contain 50% of original drug - enough to cause serious harm/death Infants, children and pets are at higher risk from accidental exposure while exploring their surroundings touching, tasting and chewing things Patches may be ingested - there is more than a 30-fold increase in absorption from the buccal mucosa if chewed compared with the transdermal route. Swallowing an intact patch results in less rapid drug release compared with chewing, but systemic absorption is still significant Patches may accidentally stick to a child's skin - patients should be informed that co-sleeping with their children is risky as patches may transfer from adult to child Children enjoy applying stickers, plasters and 'tattoos' and may deliberately stick on patches if found Used patches should be disposed of carefully and not be put in a wastepaper bin where children may find them Patches may be poorly adherent if skin is wet, sweaty, hairy or oily – check regularly that patch has not fallen off. May cover the patch with adhesive film to ensure it stays on Discarded patches should be folded putting the sticky sides of each patch together so that it sticks to itself. They should then be wrapped in paper or plastic before disposal Identifying early signs of fentanyl exposure is challenging as many are non-specific in children eg lethargy may be confused with tiredness Pharmacists should dispense patches in child-resistant packages <h3>Conclusion</h3> It is crucial to educate patients about appropriate use of fentanyl patches, including careful application, storage and disposal. Education should be provided face-to-face. Action is required by individual practitioners, health care and professional organizations, public policy agencies, pharmaceutical companies and advocacy groups to try to ensure that further deaths do not occur due to accidental exposure to transdermal fentanyl",

Second, all forms of the drugs should be initiated at low dose with gradual increments to achieve a serum uric acid level between 5 and 6 mg/dL. There are no data to support the widely presumed notion that dropping the uric acid level to a very low range (1 to 3 mg/dL) hastens resorption of tophi or improves joint function. Third, the uricosuric agents probenecid (Benemid) and sulfinpyrazone (Anturane) interact with a number of drugs, and both the patient and physician should be aware of this. Finally, and most important, careful and frequent monitoring is needed during the first several months of therapy with these drugs.",

Drug treatment may be needed as an adjunct to the regimen in children with gross detrusor instability. There is no evidence from properly controlled studies that tricyclic antidepressants or anticholinergic drugs are of value for the child with daytime wetting. Terodiline is a new drug combining anticholinergic and calcium-blocking effects. In two randomized, double-blind studies of terodiline compared with placebo in children with urge incontinence (i.e. functional day wetting), continence improved significantly over placebo in the terodiline group. Only a few mild adverse reactions were noted. Children with symptomatic urinary tract infection and day wetting should receive chemotherapy, but covert bacteriuria should best be left untreated. There is no evidence that eradication of the bacteriuria improves continence. Instead, there is a great risk of symptomatic recurrence of the urinary tract infection after antibacterial treatment.",

Most of them had a history of dependence on various other psychotropic drugs. Withdrawal symptoms, including tremor, anxiety, and aggression, have been reported in 3 patients. A woman who was taking no other drugs died of bronchial aspiration following mephenesin overdose. Painful muscle spasm is sometimes relieved by a short rest period, or paracetamol. Repeated requests for mephenesin should alert health professionals to the possibility of abuse.

      "abstract": "Although there has been concern about the use of psychoactive drugs in children, evidence is accumulating that these drugs are beneficial. The various groups of currently available drugs are reviewed with their pharmacological characteristics, adverse effects, dosages, and uses in children. Benzodiazepines, both widely used and severely criticized, are effective when used correctly, in particular for the shortest possible length of time. Antidepressants are indicated in many conditions including depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and anxiety; some of their indications are specific to children, such as separation anxiety, enuresis, and school phobia. Neuroleptics have a less well defined role and are usually given as symptomatic treatment, although their use is limited by their side effects. This is also true of lithium, despite fairly good tolerability in children. Carbamazepine was introduced in psychiatry too recently to allow valid evaluation. Psychostimulants are viewed with fear in France despite their documented efficacy in hyperkinetic children. A few other drugs used in other fields of medicine are currently being investigated in psychiatry (beta-blockers, clonidine, naloxone). A debate on drugs used in child psychiatry is much needed in particular to overcome the methodological and ethical problems raised by controlled trials of which few have been conducted to date. Drug therapy should be combined with psychotherapy to place the target symptoms in perspective with regard to the child's overall make-up.",

      "title": "Triple-Bead Mixed Amphetamine Salt for ADHD",
      "abstract": "Stimulants are first-line psychopharmacologic interventions for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and their efficacy is supported by clinical trials and meta-analyses in children and adolescents (1) as well as adults. (2) Despite decades of tolerability and efficacy data supporting their use, a major drawback of stimulants is that their salutary therapeutic effects wane once the medication is cleared or metabolized. Both mixed amphetamine- and methylphenidate-based preparations have short half-lives, necessitating multiple doses per day (eg, 3 or 4 times a day) when short-acting preparations are used. Over the past 15 years, nearly a dozen formulations were developed that extend the duration of action through delayed release, delayed absorption, or utilizing prodrugs. In June 2017, long-acting, triple-bead mixed amphetamine salt (MAS) was FDA-approved under the brand name Mydayis for the once-daily treatment of ADHD in adolescents (age [greater than or equal to]13) and adults (Table l).3 This formulation utilizes a unique triple-bead technology to extend its duration of action. When this technology was developed-nearly a decade ago--it was hoped that the duration of action of the stimulant would be significantly increased, beyond the 10- to 12-hour duration of action of available stimulants at that time. This newly approved formulation provides 16 hours of coverage, and patients may experience an onset of action within 2 to 4 hours following administration. (3) The encapsulated preparation contains 3 MAS beads: an immediate-release amphetamine salt bead, a pulsed-delayed release bead, and an extended-release bead (Figure 1, page 34), which give rise to a unique pharmacokinetic profile (Figure 2, page 35). (3) Mechanism of action Like all MAS, this formulation blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, increasing synaptic concentrations of these monoamine neurotransmitters. Additionally, amphetamine salts may inhibit the activity of monoamine oxidase (MAO), further increasing synaptic levels of monoamines. (4) Enhancing noradrenergic, dopaminergic neurotransmission, particularly within the prefrontal cortex, increases attention, working memory, and processing speed in patients with ADHD. (4) Pharmacokinetics Cmax occurs approximately 7 to 10 hours and 8 hours following administration in adolescent and adult patients, respectively (Figure 2, page 35)? In adolescents who were administered a single dose of long-acting, triple-bead MAS, Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) for d- and l-amphetamine were both 21% to 31% higher compared with adults (3) and did not appear to be affected by sex or race. (3) Half-life is 10 to 11 hours for d-amphetamine and 10 to 13 hours for 1-amphetamine and does not statistically differ between pediatric and adult studies. (3) Metabolism and elimination. Amphetamines are partially metabolized through cytochrome 450 (CYP) 2D6-dependent mechanisms, and thus in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers medication exposure may be increased, while decreased exposure may occur in ultra-rapid metabolizers; however, there are no guidelines from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium regarding alternate dosing strategies for patients based on CYP2D6 genotype or activity phenotype. (5) Because amphetamines are renally excreted, dosages should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment. Drug interactions. Medications that affect gastrointestinal and urinary pH may affect serum concentrations of amphetamine. Specifically, agents that increase gastric pH (eg, proton pump inhibitors) as well as urinary alkalinizing agents (eg, acetazolamide, some thiazide diuretics) increase serum amphetamine concentrations. (3) Because amphetamine is a weak MAOI, there is a theoretical risk of serotonin syndrome when amphetamine-based preparations are used concurrently with SSRIs, TCAs, and MAOIs. However, the concurrent use of MAS and SSRIs generally is considered safe and common practice in patients with ADHD and co-occurring anxiety (6,7) or depressive disorders. …",

There is general agreement that the treatment of PCP intoxication includes support of vital functions and acidification of the urine [13]. However, there is no known specific antidote for PCP toxicity. Although diazepam [13], haloperidol [14, 15], and chlorpromazine [16] have been reported to improve the agitation and psychotic symptoms caused by PCP, the therapeutic efficacy of these agents has rarely been documented with objective clinical measures.

      "title": "PCP (Phencyclidine): An Update",
      "abstract": "The steady rise in the promiscuous use of phencyclidine (PCP) as a \"recreational\" drug has recently gained nationwide attention because of the numerous violent and/or bizarre incidents caused by the use of this drug. Because the media often exaggerate reports of bizarre and violent behavior to make a \"good\" story, the potential PCP user may be tempted to ignore the media warnings. In the case of PCP, however exaggerated the story, a real danger does exist. So, despite numerous newspaper, radio and television warnings about the possible consequences of PCP use and abuse, the incidence of toxic reactions continues to climb. In many cases PCP is sold as other drugs, particularly THC, and in various colored capsules, tablets, liquids and crystals which may explain the increased usage despite the numerous warnings against its use. The advances in laboratory techniques and chemical processess have enabled the clandestine chemist to prepare relatively pure PCP and thus eliminate many of the toxic side effects due to impurities in the drug. In addition, 30 or more psychoactive PCP analogues have been developed and are starting to make an appearance on the street. PCP is perhaps the most potent psychotomimetic compound known at the present time and is capable of inducing a psychosis which is clinically indistinguishable from schizophrenia. The psychosis-producing effects of PCP are the most common toxic effects seen in hospital emergency rooms; but as the amount of PCP taken and/or the simultaneous involvement of other drugs, particularly barbiturates, occurs, severe medical problems (e.g., coma, seizures, respiratory arrest) begin to appear. Death from high doses of PCP or PCP plus other drugs does occur, but the principal cause of death from PCP abuse is due to trauma, homicide or suicide (usually of the bizarre or violent form). Young adult males, persons predisposed to mental illness and naive drug users appear to be the most susceptible to the adverse effects of PCP. The fact that chronic PCP users are starting to increase in number is mute testimony that not all users experience \"bad trips\" with PCP. Unfortunately for the user, however, this does not guarantee that the next trip will not be a bad one. The effects of chronic use seem to be twofold: severe depression with suicidal thoughts and numerous violent, agitated behavioral patterns. Neither seems to be a suitable alternative. At the present time there is not specific antidote for toxic PCP reactions and the prolonged psychosis induced in some cases does not appear to respond to the standard antipsychotic medications as quickly as do the functional psychoses. The major improvement from a medical standpoint is the development of more sensitive laboratory techniques to confirm the presence of PCP in body fluids. This advance has undoubtedly led to the apparent increase in the number of PCP cases reported by hospitals and to the accuracy of clinical diagnosis by medical, drug or law enforcement communities...",

      "title": "Unstable Responses and Dyskinesias: Later Motor Problems",
      "abstract": "Chapter 6 outlined the symptoms that should benefit from carbidopa/levodopa treatment and how to initiate it. Once the optimum dosing scheme has been established there usually is not much medication adjustment required for the initial few years. However, this situation changes with longer durations of DLB or Parkinson’s disease. During the first several years of DLB or Parkinson’s disease, treatment with carbidopa/levodopa is straightforward—the responses are stable and unchanging over the course of the day. Thus, the exact time a person takes the doses is not important as long as they are administered on an empty stomach (at least 1 hour before and 2 hours after meals). If the dosage is changed, it takes about a week for the response to fully develop. This pattern of a stable levodopa response that slowly accumulates over a week is termed the long-duration response. For this response to fully develop and capture the maximum benefit, about six to eight tablets of the regular (immediate-release) carbidopa/levodopa 25/100 tablets per day are necessary. While this has not been well studied in clinical trials, experience in the clinic suggests that this is approximately correct. After a few years of having DLB or Parkinson’s disease, the person’s response to levodopa tends to change. The long-duration effect persists, but part of the benefit becomes time-locked to each dose. This response does not reflect how long the person has been taking carbidopa/levodopa but how long he or she has had DLB or Parkinson’s disease. As these conditions progress, the capacity to maintain a stable, around-the-clock effect from levodopa diminishes, as if the effect could no longer be stored-up. This is not simply a brain levodopa storage problem, but it behaves that way. People with this time-locked benefit from levodopa will note that their gait, stiffness, tremor, and slowness will improve an hour or so after taking a carbidopa/levodopa dose. In other words, it takes about an hour (sometimes less) for the regular carbidopa/levodopa to “kick in.” Initially, this benefit may last 4 to 5 hours, but after many years it may diminish to 2 hours or less.",

These gastrointestinal motility actions are useful in the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis and severe gastroesophageal reflux and in postoperative situations involving visceral atony. Metoclopramide is a useful adjunctive drug for intestinal intubation and radiologic examination. It has also been used intravenously to control the nausea and vomiting of intensive cancer chemotherapy, such as with cisplatin. Metoclopramide is a powerful antiemetic because of its combined actions on the chemoreceptor trigger zone and intestinal motility. This agent is generally not intended for long-term use. The oral preparations are recommended for four to 12 weeks of therapy. Use of parenteral metoclopramide should be limited to one or two days. The most common adverse reactions are restlessness, drowsiness, fatigue and lassitude. Extrapyramidal symptoms occur rarely and only with high dosage or prolonged use.",

      "title": "Gut Wall Metabolism",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Most drugs are taken orally. For those intended to act systemically, this route is not always the most efficient due to the numerous anatomic and physiologic barriers that drugs can encounter from the time of ingestion until the time of entry into the general circulation. As a consequence, before the drug enters the circulation and elicits its effects in the target tissue(s), significant loss of the original dose can occur as drug passes, sequentially, through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, the liver, and the cardiopulmonary system. For some drugs, these barriers can even preclude their use as oral agents. Isoproterenol, dihydroergotamine, lidocaine, nitroglycerin, fentanyl, and naloxone are examples of drugs that suffer from a high first-pass effect, which refers to the loss of drug as the dose passes, for the first time, through organs of elimination during transit from the site of administration to the systemic circulation (1). Processes known to cause significant loss of active drug during first pass include incomplete release from the dosage form, degradation in the GI lumen, poor permeation through the GI wall, active export into the GI lumen, biliary excretion, and metabolism. Of these processes, only metabolism can take place in all of the aforementioned organs.",

      "abstract": "The World Health Organization currently recommends quinine+clindamycin for use against malaria in the first trimester. This may soon change to recommending artemisinin‐based combination therapies (standard duration of dosing = 3 days). The non‐artemisinin partner drugs include amodiaquine, lumefantrine, mefloquine, piperaquine, sulfadoxine+pyrimethamine, and pyronaridine. For quinine, clindamycin, and mefloquine and the combinations of sulfadoxine+pyrimethamine and artemether+lumefantrine, there are reports (including studies without internal comparison groups) that combined describe 304 to &gt;1100 exposures of women in the first trimester for each drug with no conclusive evidence of adverse effects on pregnancy at therapeutic doses. This is despite the fact that all of these drugs or drug combinations caused embryo deaths and/or malformations in at least one animal species and all except lumefantrine had at least one exposure ratio &lt;1. It now seems that these animal studies overestimated the risk of developmental toxicity in women with malaria. Three other non‐artemisinins (amodiaquine, piperaquine, and pyronaridine) have few or no reported exposures in women in the first trimester and have exposure ratios ≤2 based on studies in pregnant rats and rabbits with dosing throughout organogenesis. However, none of these drugs caused embryo deaths or malformations in pregnant rats and rabbits with the exception of pyronaridine, which caused embryo deaths only at a dose that was excessively toxic to the mothers. Thus, for amodiaquine, piperaquine, and pyronaridine, the testing in animals did not reveal findings of concern and the exposure ratios were in the range of the other non‐artemisinin antimalarials described above.

There is a burning sensation in affected skin, and a well delineated erythema; sensitization does not occur. Solution entering the mouth causes a short-lived burning sensation, excessive salivation, sore throat, and rhinorrhoea. The general acute discomfort causes a transient increase in blood-pressure.

      "abstract": "Amiodarone, classified as a class III antiarrhythmic agent, has been widely used for decades in clinical practice in patients with rapid erratic heartbeat (tachycardia). Its mode of action is complex, with effects thought to be on multiple ion channels, which ultimately prolong the third phase (QT interval) of the action potential in cardiac muscle 1. It is a challenging drug to use in the clinic due to its high lipophilicity contributing to some unusual pharmacokinetic properties, including a long half-life (~60 days; ranging up to ~140 days), large volume of distribution and absorption being variable depending on food consumption 2. The drug is extensively metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 to the more polar metabolite desethylamiodarone (DEA), which is also active 1. Oral therapy may take days to weeks before showing benefits; hence in more urgent cases, therapy is often initiated intravenously in hospital 2. Amiodarone has significant adverse reactions; some of them are life-threatening. Gastrointestinal side effects are frequently reported (in up to 30% of patients). More serious side effects increase in frequency with prolonged use, such as pulmonary toxicity (2–17% frequency), thyroid dysfunction (~8%) and liver toxicity (~1%) 2. A new study highlights an interesting potential side effect of amiodarone that so far has not been reported. Simonen and colleagues 3 measured a panel of biochemical and lipid-related parameters in serum from 56 patients with myocardial inflammatory disease. This study population was well chosen as these patients often require treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs but without the complications of other metabolic conditions such as lipid abnormalities. A subset of patients (n = 20) had used amiodarone long-term, with maintenance doses ranging from 100 to 200 mg day−1. Compared to a group of nonusing patients (n = 36) and a random control group (n = 124), amiodarone use was associated with a striking 12-fold increase in circulating levels of the immediate cholesterol precursor, desmosterol. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their cross-sectional study design, but further strengthen the argument for causation by showing that the effect was dose-dependent and temporal, in that one patient for whom a before-amiodarone sample was also available displayed a huge increase in serum desmosterol after administration of the drug. This new finding raises two questions: First, how does amiodarone increase circulating desmosterol levels? And secondly, what might this mean clinically in terms of the actions and side effects of this drug? The increase in circulating desmosterol is consistent with inhibition of the enzyme 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ24-reductase (DHCR24) that converts this sterol precursor to cholesterol (Fig. 1a). Altered DHCR24 expression is implicated in a number of diseases, notably cardiovascular and Alzheimer's diseases, although the later has been disputed (reviewed in 4). The extra double bond in the side chain of desmosterol confers some distinct properties relative to cholesterol itself, including an impaired ability to form lipid rafts in membranes which can influence the activity of integral membrane proteins such as ion channels. In addition, desmosterol serves as an activating ligand for the nuclear liver X receptor, which is involved in various aspects of lipid metabolism 4. Although the simplest explanation for the increase in circulating desmosterol is direct inhibition of the enzyme DHCR24 that converts desmosterol to cholesterol, there are other possibilities. One potential mechanism whereby amiodarone could decrease DHCR24 is via its effects on the thyroid. Owing to its di-iodinated benzene ring, amiodarone contains ~40% of iodine per weight and with regular dosing can quickly result in iodine excess. It is also chemically similar to the thyroid hormone, thyroxine. Amiodarone is mostly associated with hypothyroidism (~6% frequency) but also is linked to hyperthyroidism (~2%) 2. As the DHCR24 gene has a thyroid hormone receptor-binding element in its promoter 4, DHCR24 gene expression may therefore be downregulated in hypothyroidism. Indeed, serum desmosterol levels are elevated (~2-fold) in this condition 5 but not to the extent (~12-fold) observed in patients treated with amiodarone 3. Therefore, it is unlikely that amiodarone so consistently increases serum desmosterol by perturbing thyroid function. Arguably, the most likely mechanism whereby amiodarone increases circulating desmosterol is through direct inhibition of DHCR24, as seems to be the case for a chemically analogous (Fig. 1b) but infamous drug, triparanol. The story of triparanol is a cautionary tale in pharmaceutical history – touted as a cholesterol-lowering agent, its launch coincided with the emerging coronary epidemic in 1960. However, it was pulled from the market after only 2 years due to side effects; notably cataracts and dermatological problems which it turned out the company were aware of from preclinical studies. The triparanol saga paved the way for the development of the statins, as it steered researchers’ efforts away from the distal end of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway to an earlier step (HMGCR, the target of the statins), where the precursor was water-soluble and hence less likely to accumulate 4. There is some overlap in the spectrum of adverse reactions between the two drugs, with both amiodarone and triparanol affecting the liver, skin and eyes. Triparanol is assumed to be a direct inhibitor of DHCR24, but the precise mechanism of inhibition remains to be determined as the three-dimensional structure of this enzyme is yet to be solved 4. Triparanol use resulted in much higher levels of desmosterol 6 than observed by Simonen and colleagues 3 in patients treated with amiodarone (7–49% vs. 1% of sterols), suggesting that amiodarone may be a less potent inhibitor of DHCR24. Interestingly, agents that are known to inhibit DHCR24 activity also perturb cholesterol trafficking in the cell (Fig. 1c), phenocopying the lysosomal storage disease, Niemann–Pick type C (NPC) disease. Besides triparanol, these agents include progesterone and U18666A, and of particular relevance here, amiodarone 7. Does this perhaps indicate that desmosterol requires a transport step to be converted to cholesterol by DHCR24? Probably not, as serum desmosterol was not noted to be elevated in NPC patients 5, and fibroblasts from a murine NPC model can readily convert desmosterol to cholesterol 8. Therefore, rather than pointing to any fundamental biological phenomenon, the shared effects of these agents may simply suggest that structural features of chemicals that interfere with cellular cholesterol trafficking overlap with those required to inhibit DHCR24. Other drugs that phenocopy NPC in terms of disrupting cholesterol trafficking also tend to inhibit cholesterol synthesis 9. Besides inhibiting DHCR24, amiodarone may additionally interrupt other steps of the pathway. Of note, amiodarone has been proposed as a fungicide and antiprotozoal and can inhibit earlier steps in the corresponding sterol synthesis pathways in both yeast and protozoan parasites, notably squalene monooxygenase and oxidosqualene cyclase (Fig. 1a) 10. Partial inhibition of oxidosqualene cyclase stimulates production of 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol, an oxysterol with an epoxide group on the sterol side chain, which serves to competitively inhibit DHCR24 4, and this could theoretically contribute to elevated desmosterol levels. However, Simonen and colleagues 3 found similar serum concentrations of squalene and lanosterol in patients treated with or without amiodarone. In contrast, serum levels of ∆8-cholestanol were elevated, indicating sterol ∆8–∆7 isomerase (which shifts the ∆8-bond in the B-ring of sterols to C7–8) may also be inhibited by amiodarone (Fig. 1a). Indeed, the ratio of substrate (∆8-cholestanol) to product (lathosterol) was ~8-fold higher in the amiodarone-treated patients compared to the control subjects. Moreover, amiodarone has been reported to directly inhibit the activity of human sterol ∆8–∆7 isomerase 11. Could amiodarone's effects on cell cholesterol metabolism contribute to its action? Quite possibly. One of the principle ion channels blocked by amiodarone is the hERG potassium channel, which is crucial for repolarization of cardiac action potentials. hERG is the human homolog of Drosophila ether-a-go-go, quaintly named after the Whisky-a-Go-Go, the legendary Hollywood nightspot famed for popularizing a style of dancing in the 1960s – which was reminiscent of the twitching legs seen in the mutant flies when etherized. Importantly, disrupting intracellular cholesterol homoeostasis (using progesterone) impaired hERG trafficking and activity (Fig. 1c) 12. Disruption of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts by desmosterol 4 may also contribute to the action of amiodarone, considering that lipid rafts are important for the function of ion channels such as hERG 13. Could the increased serum desmosterol somehow be associated with the liver toxicity sometimes observed as an adverse reaction to amiodarone? Circulating desmosterol levels are elevated in nonalcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and sometimes in insulin resistance, which can be a contributing factor to NAFLD 4. Desmosterol is also a major sterol formed in cholesterol-laden macrophage-foam cells, which as Kupffer cells in the liver play a significant role in NAFLD (reviewed in 14). However, Simonen and colleagues 3 found that serum desmosterol levels were unrelated to the liver enzyme, ALT, and hence are unlikely to relate to the liver toxicity observed in ~1% of amiodarone users. Therefore, Simonen and colleagues 3 have discovered a remarkable elevation of circulating desmosterol levels associated with amiodarone use, suggesting that this drug disrupts the last step of cholesterol synthesis in addition to its other documented effects on cholesterol metabolism. Collectively, these cholesterol-related effects could contribute to both the actions of and the adverse reactions to this common antiarrhythmic drug, but the precise clinical ramifications require further clarification. The authors have no conflict of interests to declare.",

      "title": "The use of long acting sulfonamides, alone or with pyrimethamine, in malaria (with special reference to sulformetoxine)",
      "abstract": "Review of the early literature as well as more recent results show that sulfonamides possess a distinct antimalarial activity. However, when give alone, their action is less marked and slower than that of the antimalarials commonly used in the treatment of the acute attack. Combinations with pyrimethamine provide better results, even in cases of pyrimethamine and chloroquine resistance. This warrants further investigations in an attempt to develop a therapeutic agent suitable for the treatment of such resistant cases. It may also be possible with an appropriate combination of pyrimethamine with a sulfonamide to achieve a satisfactory method for suppressive treatment both in areas with and without pyrimethamine resistance. Three main points must still be carefully studied: 1) the risk of developing malaria resistance against one or both of the components of the combination. 2) The risk of developing bacterial resistance to sulfonamides if these substances are used on a large scale in too low doses. It seems indeed that antimalarial effect with the combination of sufonamides + pyrimethamine can be obtained with doses of sulfonamides which are below those usually employed in bacterial diseases. Since the range of the ratios providing potentiation is rather large, only ratios of the combination sulfonamides: pyrimethamine should be chosen in which an antfbacterial sulfonamidemia is guaranteed. 3) It goes without sayinq that, although both pyrimethamine and modem sulfonamides, when given by themselves, have proved tc possess a large margin of safety, long term administration of their combination should be careful studied from the point of view of possible side effects. Substantial evidence has already been produced to show that the long acting sulfonamide Fanasil (Ro 4-4393) given once or once weekly possesses marked schizonticidal activity against P. falciparum. Although its action is slower than that of 4-aminoquinolines, it may be useful as a second choice drug in semi-immune subjects for the therapy of falciparum malaria. Preliminary results show that, when combined with pyrimethamine, Fanasil is highly effective in suppressing fever and asexual parasitemia due to P. falciparum. Single doses of 1 g Fanasil together with 50 mg pyrimethamine seem to be adequate for the treatment of acute falciparum malaria in semi-immune patients. The onset of action of the combination is much more rapid than that of the single components. Weekly doses of 500 mg Fanasil and 25 mg pyrimeihamine appear to provide satisfactory suppressive effects against P. falciparum at least in East Africa. This combination is active on strains which do not respond satisfactorily to the standard doses of pyrimethamine and/or chloroquine and seems to have a satisfactory sporontocidal effect. Preliminary results indicate that Fanasil alone cannot be recommended for use against the other human malaria parasites. The combination with pyrimethamine appears to be much more effective. East African strains of P. malariae seem to respond better to the combination than do Malayan strains of P. vivax but further trials are required before definite assessment can be made. Fanasil by itself has no gametocytoddal or sporontocidal action but seems to potentiate the effect of pyrimethamine at least on sporogony of P. falciparum.",

With the upcoming interest in bipolar depression the discussion started, whether the use of antidepressants is off label in this indication or supported by the general indication major depression. The use of antidepressant in personality disorders is off label, but has a long clinical tradition, although the cost – benefit – relation is unclear (induction of outbursts, induction of suicidality).

      "abstract": "Phencyclidine (1-[1-phenylcyclohexyl]piperidine, PCP, hog, sheets, angel dust, Sernylan, and many other common names) is a primate anesthetic that has emerged as a common drug of abuse and as a medical emergency problem during the past few years. Phencyclidine abuse is primarily a youthful activity. It is associated with multiple clinical states, an unusual amount of aggressive behavior, and a variety of problems in management.1Thirty years ago phencyclidine was developed as an intravenous anesthetic for humans, but the frequency and intensity of emergence deliriums made it unsuitable. It is currently used as a veterinary anesthetic. Because of the availability of its precursors, its ease of manufacture, and its relative inexpensiveness, it became a common street drug during the late 1960s. At that time it was sold when mescaline, psilocybin, or tetrahydrocannabinol was requested, and it served as a virtually universal adulterant for hallucinogens. Not highly regarded among users of psychedelics, it was only infrequently purchased under its own name. During the past few years the picture has changed. Now it is a preferred substance, the most widely available and used hallucinogen. It usually is consumed as part of a polydrug abuse pattern along with alcohol, sedatives, and marihuana.PREVALENCEThe extent of its usage is not easily assessed, the wide variety of names and of dosage forms make surveys imprecise.",

      "title": "Anxiety and depression in opiate addicts treated with methadone and buprenorphine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONPsychoactive substances represent a problem dating from the fifties and starting to threaten the usual standards of life. People who get addicted to psychoactive substances become slaves of their problem and try to focus all their abilities towards providing a certain amount of psychoactive substance, weakening their integrity even further. The average age when the substance is taken for the first time is about 15 years, first injection happens about 21 (18 in the age group 18-24), while the time of the first addiction treatment ranges between 22-25 years of age.It is a rule that an addict takes more substances at the same time, usually starting with alcohol and marijuana and then quickly turning to opiates.1 Opiates include psychoactive substances of herbal origin, first of all opium, the dried milky juice from the not yet ripe fruits of white poppies, from which the morphine is later extracted. By means of twice-acetallizing the morphine, heroin (half-synthetic drug) is produced. This group also includes synthetic derivates of morphine, codeine and methadone, with similar effect.2 Addiction to heroin is in most cases very difficult to cure. So nowadays, it is usual to try to help the individuals and their families by means of replacing the expensive illegal psychoactive drug with narcotics heptanone (methadone) and buprenorphine. Patients receive these substances directly from their doctors.3 Methadone is widely used in treating the addiction throughout the world since 1960, while it was introduced to Croatia in 1990. The effects of methadone differ from the effects of other narcotics, because they last longer and there is no initial euphoria. The effect of methadone lasts up to 24 hours, thus enabling the patients to take it just once a day.4 The main effects of methadone are alleviating the craving, suppressing the withdrawal symptoms and blocking the euphoric effect of opiates. It is a paradox that the use of methadone has resulted in greater number of fatalities due to the drug overdose.5 Buprenorphine is used as a substitution therapy in treating the opiate addiction. It is used also as a substitution for methadone therapy if and when a patient decides to stop taking methadone. As opposed to methadone, buprenorphine may be given 3 times a week, enabling the users to have a better professional and social rehabilitation and generally, better quality of life. Higher doses of buprenorphine are better tolerated than high doses of methadone, seldom lead to the development of tolerance and is less addictive than methadone.6AnxietyAnxiety is a painful state of helplessness and vulnerability. It is a state of being tense, worried and expecting something terrible to happen. The feeling of anxiety, along with accompanying organic and physiological disturbances, or more precisely, with secretory and motoric discharge, overwhelms the person and in the most severe cases, represents an unbearable state and an incomparable experience.7 Anxiety is a constitutive part of life and we all feel it from time to time. We consider it a disease only when the anxiety is always present (general anxiety disorder), happening in particular situations which are usually not frightening, i.e. entering an elevator or taking a tram ride, leaving the house, social situations (phobias) or when it appears abruptly as an attack of particularly strong feeling of anxiety, called panic (panic disorder) and when that anxiety significantly limits the individual in achieving her/his personal, professional and other goals in life, thus reducing the quality of life. Not all anxiety should be feared, because it is common and informs the individual if he was in an alarming situation.8Anxiety is manifested with a variety of symptoms, such as heart thumping, sweating, tremor of hands and body, dry mouth, breathing difficulties, nausea, feeling warm or hot, muscle tension, feeling that we are unable to relax and feeling of having a globe in the throat. …",

      "abstract": "We wish to express our concern on the repeated outbreak of diethylene glycol poisoning in Nigeria which had led to the untimely death of some children. The first outbreak was in June 1990 when 47 children died from ingestion of paracetamol syrup adulterated with diethylene glycol instead of propylene glycol, a solvent for paracetamol preparation. The second outbreak occurred recently leaving 25 children dead after ingesting a teething mixture called My Pikin Teething Mixture that had been inadvertently tainted with diethylene glycol. Among the countries that had experienced similar outbreak of diethylene glycol poisoning, Nigeria remains the only country that had ever experienced a repeat episode. Therefore, we wonder if this menace would ever end without any public opinion. The aim of this letter is to suggest possible ways of averting future occurrences of childhood paracetamol poisoning in Nigeria. Generally, medicine is an agent used to treat diseases. An appropriate use of a medicine may produce desired effects, adverse effects or both. An adverse effect of a medicine may be idiosyncratic or has pharmacological explanations. The use of paracetamol has been associated with mild to severe adverse effects in children such as angioedema, dyspnoea and rhinitis but none has ever resulted into death. Paracetamol is an over the counter (OTC) medicine. When it is contaminated or adulterated with diethylene glycol, it is no longer a medicine but poison. A majority of the children who were victims of paracetamol poisoning in Nigeria were self-medicated by their parents with the intent of treating them for fever. Fever is often perceived by --- Language: en",

We report five cases of high-dose triazolam abuse in which the daily dosage ranged from 5 to 15 mg (100–300 mg diazepam equivalent) and the duration of use ranged from 3 months to 5 years. Physical dependence usually occurs in the context of a history of alcohol or other drug abuse, a history of panic attacks or anxiety disorder, substitution of triazolam for a longer-acting benzodiazepine, or inappropriate use of triazolam as an anxiolytic agent given as multiple daily doses. A rational approach to the pharmacotherapy of triazolam withdrawal is described. Treatment to replace the triazolam with a long half-life CNS depressant and strategies for this pharmacologic therapy are discussed. The abuse liability of triazolam may be no greater and is most likely less than that of some other benzodiazepines.",

      "abstract": "Click to increase image sizeClick to decrease image size Notes In some areas of the country, OxyContin abuse is a greater problem than heroin abuse (Cicero, Inciardi, & Munoz, Citation2005). OxyContin is a semi-synthetic opioid prescribed for long-lasting pain (Gahlinger, Citation2001). The medication's active ingredient is called oxycodone. OxyContin is called “Oxy,” “O.C.,” and “killer” on the street. It is prescribed as a timed-release tablet and can provide as many as 12 hours of relief from chronic pain. It is often prescribed for cancer and arthritis patients, or those suffering from long-term back pain (Kalso, Citation2005). OxyContin abusers either crush the tablet and ingest or snort it, or dilute it in water and inject it. Crushing or diluting the tablet removes the timed-release action of the medication and causes a quick, powerful high. Abusers have compared this feeling to the euphoria they experience when taking heroin. Addiction to OxyContin is so strong that people will go to great lengths to get the drug, including robbing pharmacies and forging prescriptions. Other drugs in the opiate family that are abused include codeine, hydrocodone, morphine, thebaine, tilidine, anileridine, etorphine, and fentanyl (Gahlinger, Citation2001).

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy affect up to 90% of all pregnancies. Diclectin and Diclegis (delayed-release 10 mg doxylamine–10 mg pyridoxine combination) is the only antiemetic approved in the United States and Canada for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy at a maximum dose of 4 tablets per day. However, some women receive off-label higher doses, up to 12 tablets per day. The objective of this study was to assess long-term neurodevelopmental fetal safety of this drug combination. METHODS: We compared the neurocognitive development of children from four mother–child groups: 1) nausea and vomiting of pregnancy treated with more than four tablets of Diclectin (n=41); 2) nausea and vomiting of pregnancy treated with up to four tablets per day of Diclectin (n=84); 3) nausea and vomiting of pregnancy and no treatment (n=63); and 4) no nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (n=49). Children received a full age-appropriate psychological assessment at 3–7 years of age. RESULTS: Children of all four groups scored in the normal range for IQ, language, temperament, and behavior. The children whose mothers experienced nausea and vomiting of pregnancy achieved significantly higher scores on some subscales of cognition, language, and behavior, correlating with the severity of the nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. The Diclectin-exposed groups scored significantly higher on a small number of subtests, but none of the differences could be considered clinically significant and no dose-dependent effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Diclectin does not appear to harm neurodevelopment even at off-label supradoses and should be considered safe for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. The severity of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy correlates positively with neurodevelopmental achievements.",

      "abstract": "Acute behavioral disturbances in psychosis, including agitation, comprise a heterogeneous group of manifestations varying in intensity and duration they last for. They require rapid, non-coercive treatments ranging from verbal de-escalation to the calming effect of pharmacological agents. The treatment goals are reduction of patient suffering and prevention of disease deterioration. Stabilizing rather than sedating is preferred to ensure improved compliance and a stronger therapeutic alliance. Furthermore, animal pharmacology and clinical studies on agitation reveal the robust calming and anxiolytic properties of loxapine.This review covers the pharmacological and clinical history of loxapine along with research developments. It emphasizes the advantages of its multiple formulations ranging from injectable forms and tablets to orally inhaled forms to attain rapid and fine-tuned tranquilization.Rapid tranquillization is achieved within 2-6 hours using liquid orally-consumed loxapine, and within an hour or less with its IM or orally inhaled forms. Loxapine has been adopted in the management of a wide range of acute disturbances, such as agitation in psychosis. In the context of personalized medicine, key cellular and molecular elements of the schizophrenia phenotype were recently shown to be improved with loxapine.",

Increasing age and comorbidities are likely to increase the number of men who are initially refractory or become refractory to phosphodiesterase (PDE)-5 inhibitors, the most popular oral therapy. Combination therapy, a concept well proved in other areas of medicine, is therefore of increasing importance. Combination oral and non-oral (intracavernosal injection and intraurethral application) therapies have been shown to salvage monotherapy. The early introduction of combination therapy has been shown to expedite both the return of natural function and PDE-5 inhibitor responsiveness in post-prostatectomy patients with no reports of serious adverse events.

Antihistamine containing cough syrups, cough suppressants, pheniramine maleate (Avil) tablets and injections are available easily as over-the-counter (OTC) medications. Psychological tolerance to the sedation and physical withdrawal symptoms following pheniramine abuse have been documented but surveying literature on pheniramine dependence yielded limited case reports on the same. Hereby, we present a unique case of pheniramine dependence, which is first of its kind ever reported of such mega doses of pheniramine abuse. Case report- A 29 years old Indian male presented to the psychiatry outpatient with history of abuse of heavy doses of pheniramine with opioids parenterally subsequently developing dependence, and injecting pheniramine up to 1700 mg daily. To obtain such high doses he purchased pheniramine meant for veterinary use (Panavil). He was started on tapentadol 300 mg, pregabalin 150 mg and quetiapine 50 mg. Tapentadol was down-tapered. Clinical opiate withdrawal scale (COWS) decreased from 13 on the day of admission to 4 on discharge. The patient was started on relapse prevention therapy and was discharged on tapentadol 50 mg, pregabalin 75 mg and quetiapine 25 mg with plan to continue psychotherapy sessions on follow up. Conclusion- Our case concludes that pheniramine has a dependence potential. OTC medication abuse seem to be under-reported and could be an emerging medical concern in the ensuing years. We enunciate the need of formulation of specific rules and regulations to supervise the availability of both human and veterinary drugs.",

It seems therefore that any therapeutic effect is most likely due to this drug's anticholinergic action. Side effects such as dryness of the mouth, constipation, and a lessening in bladder activity are commonly seen with this medication. In reported studies on enuresis, the drug was compared to an inactive placebo. Quite understandably, it showed a better effect than the placebo in controlling nocturnal bedwetting. I should think a more significant evaluation would have been a comparison of imipramine hydrochloride with other and less harmful anticholinergic agents such as belladonna, atropine, or possibly propantheline bromide.

      "title": "Sugammadex Vial Wastage: Implications for the Cost of Anesthesia Care in Children: Research Letter",
      "abstract": "Although pharmaceutical costs account for approximately 15% of the overall cost of anesthetic care, these expenses are frequently assumed to be due to the choice of anesthetic technique (general vs. regional) or the choice of medications used for anesthetic care.1 Seldom addressed in measures to control care-related expenditures is the issue of medication wastage that occurs when a medication vial is opened but not used.1 This waste represents a potential cost saving if the drug was not discarded, because unadministered drugs account for more than 25% of the anesthesia medication budget.1One of the more expensive medications used in anesthetic care is sugammadex, which is currently supplied in 200 mg/2 ml or 500 mg/5 ml vials. Because sugammadex vials are labeled single-dose or single-use only, the standard of care is that partially used or unadministered opened vials are discarded.2 Medication vial wastage is particularly common in pediatric anesthesia because of the variability in patient weights and the fact that medications are administered on a milligram per kilogram body weight basis.1The present study had two objectives. First, we examined the longitudinal trends in sugammadex administration in a national pediatric surgical population, and second, we estimated the proportion of drug wastage and its economic implications based on the minimum sugammadex vial size of 200 mg/2 ml. After institutional review board approval from the Nationwide Children's Hospital (Columbus, Ohio), we identified 1,550,894 administrations of either rocuronium or vecuronium during induction of anesthesia among children 18 yr or younger across 49 children's hospitals reporting to the Pediatric Health Information System between January 1, 2017, and September 31, 2022. We then examined the longitudinal trends in sugammadex administration for reversal of neuromuscular blockade across all study centers. We finally performed a budget impact analysis of the amount of wasted drug based on the minimum sugammadex vial size of 200 mg/2 ml. We defined drug wastage as documented less than 100 mg administration because such instances signify partial vial use, consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia) recommendation.2 We calculated the 2022 inflation-adjusted cost saving, if a sugammadex vial size of 100 mg/1 ml were available, by multiplying the frequency of 100 mg or less administered to $49.87 (half of the acquisition cost of 200 mg/2 ml sugammadex).We identified 400,838 sugammadex administrations during the study period between January 1, 2017, through the third quarter of 2022. Sugammadex administration increased by 43% by the end of the study period. Drug wastage occurred in almost 3 of 5 administered doses (59.2%, n = 237,092). If sugammadex vial size of 100 mg/ml were available and it cost roughly half that of a 200-mg vial, or if vials were split, then an estimated $14,000,000 worth of drug would not have been discarded during the study period. By the third quarter of 2022, the quarterly average cost saving in the absence of medication wastage was $40,235 (fig. 1).Sugammadex is one of many expensive medications where the minimum vial contains quantities larger than the amount needed for pediatric patients. Two other commonly used medications with similar concerns are acetaminophen (1,000 mg/100 ml) and dexmedetomidine (100 mcg/2 ml). Previous research has proposed cost-saving solutions to reduce or eliminate the cost associated with drug wastage.3 These solutions include regulations to require manufacturers to identify vials that match doses commonly used in the pediatric population (e.g., 50-mg or 100-mg vials). Another solution would be the adoption of certified disposal and a virtual return system that would require manufacturers to refund the cost of leftover drugs. Finally, there is the option of not using sugammadex for neuromuscular blockade reversal given the recent findings that its use is not associated with reduced incidence of perioperative respiratory adverse events.4 Studies in adults have shown mixed results about the cost-effectiveness of neostigmine in comparison with sugammadex.5 Given the unique dosage requirements in children, further research is needed to determine whether using neostigmine is associated with cost reductions compared with sugammadex, given currently available vial sizes.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published formal guidelines regarding vial repackaging that should be performed under USP Pharmaceutical Compounding Compendium, as well as the manufacturer's recommendations about the safe storage of medications outside their original containers. Vial repackaging should be performed by a trained pharmacist or pharmacy technician under a sterile hood. The new vial or syringe must be labeled with pertinent information regarding the medication, including its name, medication concentration, total volume, and expiration date.2 Research is needed to describe current vial-splitting practices and explore any missed opportunity to maximize their safety (e.g., medication contamination).Certain limitations of this report must be acknowledged. Some pharmacies may report the total cost of vials instead of the administered dose. However, if this were to happen, it would only underestimate the magnitude of the total potential cost saving. In conclusion, we observed increasing trends of sugammadex administration, most of which were associated with drug wastage. The financial implications of such drug wastage underline an urgent need for pharmaceutical companies to produce vials appropriate for pediatric anesthesia and for hospitals to consider repackaging strategies in the short term.The authors declare no competing interests.",

The period is frequently shortened by the use of larger doses. The average full dose of digitalis given at one time is rarely recommended except when the condition is desperate, the reason being that it is too large for the more sensitive patients and results in toxic symptoms. The extent of the variation from the average response to an average full dose would theoretically be reduced by a preparation of digitalis which would be more quicklyand more regularly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. With such a preparation, single dose digitalization might prove to be a safe and satisfactory routine.

It combines superb anesthesia with constriction of nasal vasculature and patient euphoria, which facilitates surgery and enhances its tolerability to the patient. Dosages of 200 mg (2 ml of 10% solution) are considered safe and effective for surgical anesthesia. Central nervous system excitability is the predominant toxic reaction followed by convulsions and apnea, which require respiratory support. Intravenous diazepam effectively averts this reaction. Cardiovascular toxicity appears at higher dosages (such as with ingestion for concealment during smuggling) or when epinephrine is concurrently used with cocaine. Cocaine is also damaging to nasal membranes and the nasal septal cartilage, due to its vasoconstrictive effect and the irritative effects of its diluting contaminants. Its major psychological effect is stimulation similar to that of the amphetamines. Prolonged recreational use may lead to paranoia and violent, antisocial behavior, including homicide and suicide.",

      "title": "Ketamine cystitis: Its urological impact and management",
      "abstract": "Ketamine, an n-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor complex antagonist, has been used as an anesthetic and/or analgesic. However, in the past decade, ketamine has been illegally available as a recreational drug in Asian countries and Taiwan. Due to the characteristic of being short-acting, youngsters widely assume that ketamine is not as harmful as other drugs, such as heroin. Consequently, many young patients used this drug for a longer duration before they presented with severe urinary frequency and urgency symptoms. Subsequently, other cases have been reported in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Europe. Ketamine abuse is increasing, with rates of 0.30% in 2006 to 0.40% in 2007 among those in the 16–59 year age group. In general, affected patients tend to be young with a peak age range of 16–35 years. The incidence of lower urinary tract symptoms in ketamine abuse patients is around 30%. The actual underlying pathomechanism of ketamine cystitis (KC) and associated pelvic pain remains unclear. It is speculated that chronic contact and stimulation to the bladder or ureteral mucosa due to metabolites of ketamine will result in submucosal edema, vascular ectasia, fibrosis, detrusor muscle inflammation, and fibrosis. Presentations of KC include remarkable dysuria, urinary frequency/urgency, urge incontinence, and bladder pain. Urine culture usually fails to yield any microbiology in KC with bladder pain alone. The majority of patients can enjoy clinical improvement after cessation of ketamine and urological treatment similar to interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). However, patients who are still abusing ketamine and/or who have a longer duration of ketamine abuse might suffer from severe bladder pain, which does not respond to empirical oral or intravesical treatments such as hyaluronic acid. Among these patients, most have a remarkably impaired quality of life and are at risk of developing upper urinary tract damage, including hydronephrosis and kidney injury. To reduce bladder pain, improve quality of life, and avoid further deterioration of renal function, surgical intervention might be indicated.",

      "abstract": "Oxycodone, OxyContin, opioids, substance use disorder: Oxycodone (right) is available from a number of manufacturers and in multiple doses. Some formulations are combined with acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. To obtain a more rapid and intense euphoria, these immediate-release pills can be crushed, chewed, inhaled, or mixed with water or solvents for injection. OxyContin (left) is designed to release medication over eight to 12 hours, and breakthrough pain can be treated with immediate-release oxycodone. OxyContin, however, is also easily misused, and efforts to alter the formulation in 2010 to make it more difficult to crush the pills to deter IV or inhalation misuse were minimally successful. Although not usually prescribed long-term from the ED, the FDA recommends that physicians discuss naloxone with all patients when prescribing opioids.FigureThe nonmedical misuse of prescription opioids has reached epidemic levels, with morbidity and mortality increasing every year. Certain formulations and specific opioids are more likely than other drugs to be used in ways other than prescribed. The euphoria, relaxation, and other pleasurable effects beyond those intended by a physician can give rise to misuse. Opioid use disorder is the most common form of inappropriate prescription use, with medications obtained from clinicians, friends, relatives, and illegal sources. Likability and Abuse Liability of Commonly Prescribed Opioids Wightman R, et al. J Med Toxicol. 2012;8(4):335 http://bit.ly/3kUGiVB This study examined the medical literature about the potential for prescription medication misuse based on whether the person liked the effects obtained by taking the drug. Opioids are potent analgesics, but many individuals consume them recreationally. All opioid receptor agonists have some euphorigenic properties, but certain opioids are often preferred among those with substance use disorders. The authors infer misuse liability based on street use and price, pharmacy thefts, and overdose mortality data. The incidence of ED visits to attempt to get a prescription medication for nonmedical use is also an indication that a drug is being sought for recreational purposes. To assess misuse potential, these authors examined likability studies of the opioids hydrocodone, oxycodone, and morphine. The authors reviewed nine articles in the medical literature that attempted to assess the subjective and objective effects of these three drugs. Subjects included recreational opioid users, healthy volunteers with a history of drug misuse, and chronic pain patients. Questions were aimed at ferreting out positive ratings of a drug and lack of negative effects. Subjects had variable responses to different doses of medications, but oxycodone was clearly preferred overall. More patients said they liked or enjoyed the drug's effects, wanted to take the drug again, and experienced few to no unpleasant side effects. Oxycodone had no reports of dry mouth as seen with other opioids. The authors included positive feelings voiced by the subjects, using such terms as euphoria; feeling good, high, carefree, coasting, dreamy, or mellow; and having pleasant thoughts and bodily sensations. Negative effects included dysphoria, irritability, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, headaches, dry mouth, gastrointestinal distress (nausea and vomiting), feeling heavy and sluggish, and having unpleasant thoughts and bodily sensations. Subjects were also asked about their desire to take the drug again and their willingness to pay a specific amount of money for the drug from other users or from the street. Overall, oxycodone demonstrated the highest attractiveness ratings and a paucity of negative reviews by a majority of subjects. The desire to take the drug again was also highest for oxycodone. Interestingly, morphine, a drug classically associated with good feelings, was less likely to be wanted to be taken again. These authors' review of the literature demonstrated that oxycodone had an elevated misuse liability profile due to a high likability score and minimal or no negative or unpleasant effects. Oxycodone was preferred by individuals with a history of misuse of another drug. These authors concluded that likability of a drug is clearly equated with increased misuse potential. The conclusion was that oxycodone had a substantially elevated misuse liability profile compared with morphine or hydrocodone due to a high likability score and relative lack of negative feelings or other unpleasant effects. Comment: This is a fascinating study and is unlike others I have reviewed. It is a bit difficult to assess the results of many of the studies reviewed, but all had a similar conclusion: Those who misuse drugs liked the effects of oxycodone and strongly preferred them over other opioids, even morphine. Note that morphine is the main metabolite of heroin. I have had many patients say morphine didn't make them feel particularly good or that they didn't like the side effects, particularly nausea. Association of Opioids Prescribed to Family Members with Opioid Overdose Among Adolescents and Young Adults Nguyen AP, et al. JAMA Netw Open. 2020;3(3):e201018 http://bit.ly/3qAXGQ9 There is concern that opioids prescribed to family members seen in the ED may lead to drug misuse by other family members. These authors found this to be true in a report of 14 fatal and 103 nonfatal overdoses of opioids by adolescents and young adults aged 11 to 26 from medication prescribed to family members. A total of 545,000 adult prescriptions given over five years were analyzed. The drugs were usually hydrocodone or short-acting oxycodone, and primarily included prescriptions for the highest total dosage of opioids. An underlying drug use disorder, mainly anxiety and depression, was present in six percent of the young people who overdosed. The authors concluded that exposure to and a desire to obtain prescription opioids among family members was common. The opioids prescribed to family members were associated with an increased risk of opioid overdose. Further intervention or efforts targeting youth and family members are needed, especially counseling young patients or those with prior opioid experience, about the risks of opioid misuse using medications given to other family members. Comment: Opioids are obtained not only by prescriptions but by medications prescribed to family members or friends, drugs bought on the street or stolen from pharmacies, and multiple other sources. It might not be obvious that a physician should warn a bona fide ED pain patient about ways that someone, even a family member, could take pills, but that might be required if prescribing opioids Oxycodone Compound SummaryFigure“Oxycodone is a semi-synthetic, morphine-like opioid alkaloid with potent analgesic activity. It is available as an immediate release and sustained release preparation. The sustained release formulation, OxyContin, is available in pills containing as much as 160 mg oxycodone. Oxycodone exerts its analgesic activity by binding to the mu-receptors in the central nervous system (CNS), thereby mimicking the action of endogenous opioids. Binding of the opiate receptor stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein and inhibits adenylate cyclase, thereby preventing cAMP production and the release of neurotransmitters. Oxycodone also inhibits the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin, and glucagon. In addition, oxycodone closes N-type voltage-gated calcium channels and opens G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels, resulting in hyperpolarization and reduction of neuronal excitability. “Oxycodone is a Schedule II DEA controlled drug with a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. Oxycodone is widely used for acute or chronic management of moderate or moderately severe pain either alone or in combination with acetaminophen. This drug is highly euphoric and often abused as a pill, crushed and snorted, or diluted for IV injection. Death is from respiratory arrest followed by cardiac arrest.” Source: PubChem.

      "abstract": "Until relatively recently, the choices of stimulant medications for children were limited. Amphetamines and immediate-release methylphenidate (MPH) have been used for several decades, but in their native “immediate release” (IR) formulations, both have rapid onsets and short durations of action, and must therefore be given at least twice daily for optimal clinical efficacy throughout the day. The challenge to the clinician using short-acting preparations was to find the optimum dosing regimen for each child—and dosing requirements could vary as much as sixfold between individual children.\r\n\r\nAfter a morning dose of MPH, peak concentration (Cmax) is reached about 2 hours after dosing, and concentrations have declined by half approximately 2 hours later (T1/2). Higher doses will produce higher Cmax values, but do not affect the time of the peak (Tmax) or onset or T1/2. For several decades, it was assumed that the clinician merely had to find the Cmax that would produce the optimal clinical response 1 to 2 hours after dosing, and keep this constant throughout the day. Smaller doses were therefore used toward the end of the day; these were the “sculpted” dosing regimens of the early 1990s. For example, children in the MTA study who were treated with an average MPH dose received MPH 10 mg in the morning, 10 mg at noon, and 5 mg in the afternoon. However, after the 14-month treatment phase, compliance with drug treatment worsened considerably, in part because medicated children suffered teasing at the hands of their peers when called to the principal’s office to take noontime medication doses. The longer formulations then available included Ritalin SR® and Dexedrine® spansules. Neither medication provided coverage for the whole day, and the reasons for this were a mystery. Several manufacturers therefore embarked on the development of more effective once-daily medications in collaboration with investigators at the University of California at Irvine laboratory school (analogue classroom) using surrogate measures of drug efficacy.",

      "title": "Is Chronic Use of Stimulant Laxatives Harmful to the Colon?",
      "abstract": "Although stimulant laxatives cause structural damage to surface epithelial cells that is of uncertain functional significance, there is no convincing evidence that their chronic use causes structural or functional impairment of enteric nerves or intestinal smooth muscle. Nor are there reliable data to link chronic use of stimulant laxatives to colorectal cancer and other tumors. The risks of laxative abuse have been overemphasized, and this has minimized their rational use by physicians. Stimulant laxatives may be used chronically when patients fail to respond adequately to bulk or osmotic laxatives alone. These can be combined with bulk or osmotic laxatives in sufficient amounts to soften the stool, or they can be used alone, according to clinical circumstances. The dose of such agents should be titrated to effect. Bisacodyl may be used if anthraquinone laxatives are unsatisfactory.",

This new use of an old drug in significantly greater dosage has brought with it a previously unrecognized serious complication: chloroquine retinopathy. The occurrence of chloroquine retinopathy, despite 20 years of experience with the drug, raises several questions. Is the retinopathy an idiosyncratic reaction which has become more apparent because of more widespread use of the drug or is it a predictable toxic manifestation resulting from the employment of much larger amounts of the medication? What is known about the pharmacology of chloroquine phosphate when taken for long periods in large amounts? Is chloroquine deposited in the ocular tissues and how does it produce the retinal lesions? Some evidence is available which may answer, at least in part, several of these questions. The original studies on chloroquine metabolism were limited to dosage",

      "abstract": "Wilson’s disease is an inherited defect in biliary copper excretion, causing a buildup of copper and copper toxicity, primarily in liver and brain. Presentation with liver disease and/or neurological disease usually occurs in the second and third decades of life. Recognition of the disease is often delayed, which is unfortunate, because once appropriate treatment is started, progression of the disease can be halted, and further damage avoided. Regarding current treatment, many physicians are only aware of penicillamine, because it was the first orally effective drug developed. However, penicillamine has outlived its usefulness, being more toxic than more recently developed drugs. For the hepatic presentation, a combination of trientine and zinc should be used for 4-6 months, then trientine stopped and zinc used for lifelong maintenance therapy. For the neurological presentation, tetrathiomolybdate should be used if available for 8-16 weeks, then zinc for maintenance. If tetrathiomolybdate is not available, zinc should be used. For presymptomatic patients, zinc should be used from the beginning. Zinc should also be used for pregnant and pediatric patients, with a reduced dose for the latter. Zinc causes gastric intolerance in some patients, so in all cases where zinc is the favored therapy, if it is not tolerated, then trientine should be used as second choice. In too many cases, patients are put on zinc, compliance not monitored, and then papers are written about “zinc failures”. There are no zinc failures, just noncompliance problems.",

With 2.5 fold ED95, tracheal intubation can be accomplished within 2-3 min following injection. The ensuing DUR 25% (i.e. time from injection to 25% recovery of control twitch tension) is three times as long as with succinylcholine and about half as long as with equipotent doses of atracurium and vecuronium. The principal side effects of mivacurium are facial flushing and a transient fall in blood pressure due to a moderate histamine release following doses of 3-4 times the ED95. In patients with end stage liver or renal disease as well as in patients with atypical plasma cholinesterase the duration of action of mivacurium is prolonged. Rocuronium is a steroidal non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agent chemically related to vecuronium. Compared with the latter, rocuronium is less potent, has a shorter onset of action, and no cumulative effects. Adequate intubating conditions are achieved within 60 to 90 s after i.v. injection of twice the ED95. Its elimination from the blood occurs primarily via liver uptake, while renal elimination is about 10 to 30%. Slight vagolytic effects are reported following injection of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium, while histamine release is unlikely to occur. Atracurium is a mixture of ten stereoisomers. One of them, cis-atracurium, is five times as potent as the chiral mixture while having a similar pharmacodynamic and kinetic profile. It does not cause significant histamine release or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects at doses up to 8 times the ED95. Laudanosine release seems to be less with cis-atracurium than with atracurium.",

      "abstract": "• Clinical trials first began in 1960 with methylprednisolone acetate (Depo-Medrol) administered intrathecally, in an attempt to treat both disk disease and multiple sclerosis. After a few reports of salubrious results, there began an out-pouring of contradictory data, which continues in 1988. During this time span, researchers who cautiously tested the different theses of improvement began to publish serious warnings of many complications. For ten years prior to the intraspinal use of methylprednisolone acetate, basic scientists in anesthesiology and neurochemistry had published the following facts: (1) Methylprednisolone acetate's content of polyethylene glycol raises the risks of using it near the central nervous system. (2) Deleterious effects follow the use of glycols when they are placed into or near the neuraxis. (3) Methylprednisolone acetate contains approximately 30 mg of polyethylene glycol per milliliter. (4) When that glycol, which is both alcohol and detergent, is injected intraspinally, sterile meningitis, arachnoiditis, or pachymeningitis will occur. It has also been recognized since the 1960s that the epidural space is not wholly separate from the subdural and/or subarachnoid space. Many thousands of arachnoid villi subtend all the membranes from the intrathecal space, and many of these end in the large epidural veins. Therefore, the various spaces and membranes are not only contiguous, but continuous. It follows that an injection of methylprednisolone acetate into the epidural space does not guarantee that it will remain isolated there. Finally, the inadvertency of injections by the epidural route occurs with the following frequency: 40% of injections can be inadvertently made into interspinous ligaments, and 2.5% into the subarachnoid space.",

      "abstract": "To report on the first case of ziconotide-induced dyskinesia. Ziconotide, a synthetic peptide analogue of the ω-conotoxin MVIIA that blocks selectively N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, has been used in intrathecal administration for 30 years. Ziconotide is a drug of choice for chronic pain because of its efficacy and flexibility because it can substitute or complement other intrathecal therapies including morphine or baclofen. Whereas substantial information is available regarding its efficacy, systematic data regarding the safety of ziconotide remain scant. The adverse reactions to ziconotide described so far regard only the coordination and execution of intentional movements.A 15-year-old male patient developed dyskinesia affecting the head and upper limbs 2 days after administration of ziconotide as an add-on therapy to an established regimen of treatment with baclofen. The strict temporal relationship between ziconotide administration and dyskinesia, together with the absence of any other clinical alteration, led to the hypothesis of a possible adverse drug reaction. Ziconotide was thus withdrawn, and the symptoms disappeared within 2 days.An analysis of the signaling pathways of baclofen and ziconotide revealed a possible drug interaction that allowed ziconotide to trigger dyskinesia.",

      "title": "Topical therapies for melasma and disorders of hyperpigmentation",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Facial hyperpigmentation is usually a reflection of an increased amount of melanin either within the epidermis, the dermis, or both (mixed pattern). The increase in melanin content is due to an increased number of functioning melanocytes (melanocytosis), an increased amount of melanin production without a numerical alteration of melanocytes (melanosis), or both. Topical hypo/depigmenting agents are most effective in those disorders where the increased melanin pigment (secondary to melanocytosis or melanosis) is within the epidermis. In patients with melasma, one of the more common causes of facial hyperpigmentation, two major groups of hypo/depigmenting agents have been used: phenolic derivatives and nonphenolic compounds. Hydroquinone, a phenolic derivative, has been used most extensively. It is applied to areas of involvement, either alone or in combination with one or two of the following: tretinoin, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or corticosteroid. Phenolic thioethers are a new class of phenolic derivatives, and they exhibit both cytocidal and cytostatic effects selectively on melanocytes. Nonphenolic depigmenting agents include azelaic acid and kojic acid. If the facial hyperpigmentation is not improved by first-line topical therapies, chemical peels may be used in combination. The precise cause of melasma is not known, and multiple factors have been implicated. However, a genetic predisposition and exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light are very important factors. Avoidance of direct exposure to sunlight and application of broad-spectrum sunscreens are required during and after the period of active treatment. In addition to melasma, other causes of facial hyperpigmentation include Riehl's melanosis, photocontact dermatitis, the sequelae of inflammatory diseases such as acne vulgaris and cutaneous lupus, and nevus of Ota.",

Efficacy in sleep maintenance has not been consistently demonstrated with previous hypnotics, and long-term efficacy and safety data are lacking for these agents. In clinical trials, eszopiclone 3 mg significantly improved objective and subjective sleep measures in transient and chronic insomnia in adults. Nightly treatment with eszopiclone 1 mg effectively induced sleep in elderly patients and the 2-mg dose effectively induced and maintained sleep. The ability of eszopiclone 2 mg to significantly improve next-day functioning and daytime alertness (as demonstrated by a reduction in the number and duration of naps) in the elderly is an important finding in clinical trials, and is unique to the class of hypnotic agents for the treatment of insomnia. Eszopiclone was well tolerated in clinical trials ≤ 12 months duration, with no clinically significant evidence of pharmacological tolerance, rebound insomnia or dependence. The most frequently reported adverse event was unpleasant taste. Eszopiclone is the only non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic (in the Schedule IV class under the Controlled Substances Act) to be evaluated as a long-term treatment for chronic insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Mephedrone is a semisynthetic derivative of cathinone used as a drug of abuse. Similar to amphetamine, both in chemical structure and associated signs and symptoms, has gained popularity since 2007 and it is currently the sixth most abused drug in United Kingdom. It can be easily purchased by the internet or smart shops where it is advertised as a fertilizer for plants or bath salts, although such efficacy was never proved. This article aims to review the state-of-the-art literature of mephedrone, particularly its chemical structure, forms of presentation, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, acute intoxications, diagnosis and therapy of intoxications. Mephedrone is mainly sought for the following symptoms: euphoria, social disinhibition, empathy, and increased libido. However, its use is associated with several adverse effects on cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, psychiatric and genitourinary systems, among others. There are also reported cases of consumers who have developed tolerance and dependence after a regular abuse of mephedrone. Several deaths in the United Kingdom have been confirmed as being directly related to the consumption of mephedrone. Currently this drug is legally controlled in many countries, but little is known about its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Most data comes only from users and health professional's reports and internet surveys. Recently, the Portuguese Law 13/2012, 26 of March, included mephedrone in the list of controlled substances, and therefore it is important to better understand this xenobiotic.",

      "title": "Antipsychotic use in under 25’s - think carefully!",
      "abstract": "Introduction Antipsychotic use for adolescents (defined here as under 25 year olds) must be done with caution, giving due thought to advantages and potential side effects. Antipsychotics are extremely useful and effective drugs, but have side effects and many of these are problematic. It has been noted that Risperidone is often used for this age group, despite the UK guidance being cautious about its use. Objectives To assess the extent of Risperidone prescribing in Norfolk/Suffolk for this patient group and to consider the monitoring of this. Given that bone mass density is set down in teens – mid 20’s, this is a particularly concerning issue when given to this age group. Additionally, distressing side effects and issues with fertility shoudl be considered. If risperidone is used, Maudsley is very clear that this must be monitored: baseline/annual prolactin levels done, and action should be taken if these are elevated and/or the patient symptomatic. Methods 1) Evaluate numbers of adolescents, under 2ndry care Mental health service who have been prescribed Risperidone 2) Consider who prescibed it and the indication 3) to consider if routine monitoring had been completed (specifically, baseline prolactin and then annual prolactin levels) 4) to consider if these patients had developed side effects Results Almost 20% of 18-25 years olds, due to be seen in Youth Community Service had been prescribed Risperidone. Of these, only 44% had had prolactin levels done, despite the guidance. This equates to the over half not having prolactin checked. 60% of patients reveiwed had symptoms of hyperprolactinemia. Indications for use included emotional dysregulation/EUPD, psychosis, ADHD, OCD/ASD and depression Conclusions Risperidone should be used with extreme caution in this patient group. Medication can be very useful for some young people experiencing distressing symptoms but, as Hippocrates advises, “do no harm” and seek not to cause iatrogenic harm. Given that many of the young people seen by mental health services are experiencing emotional dysregulation (not necessarily an abnormal state in adolescent, when much is in flux), it is tempting to consider medication as one means of trying to alleviate distress. There is no clear treatment for dysregulated feelings, and most would accept that psychological support is more appropriate. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

Despite proven efficacy of existing treatments, recent focus has been on the development of newer, once-daily medications. Lisdexamfetamine (LDX) was first released in 2007 and is approved for the treatment of ADHD in ages 6 and above. LDX is a uniquely formulated stimulant, a prodrug which requires an enzymatic hydrolytic reaction to be converted to active dextroamphetamine. LDX has a longer duration of action compared to other stimulants and has less potential to be misused or abused. LDX has repeatedly demonstrated improvement in ADHD symptoms compared to placebo, and seems to be at least as effective as other stimulants. LDX still carries the risks and disadvantages of other stimulants and may be more expensive than other stimulants. LDX can be expected to be increasingly used as a first-line agent for the treatment of ADHD.",

Efficacy of fluoxetine has been shown not only in major depressive disorder, but also in obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, bulimia nervosa, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, obesity, premature ejaculation, pain syndrome and other medical/psychiatric diseases. Fluoxetine is known to have more activating or stimulating effect than other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which might be beneficial in treating the atypical feature of depression. It is also effective in diminishing appetite and carbohydrate craving. However, this effect is belived to be transient. Regarding the adverse effects, fluoxetine has the lower risk of discontinuation syndrome in comparison with other antidepressants, due to its long half-life. However, long half-life can be problematic when adverse effects become intolerable. Caution should be made when there is a possibility of drug interaction especially in the elderly. When it is prescribed to children and adolescents, monitoring for suicidal intent should be made.",

      "abstract": "Currently there are three methods of treating patients with intractable tinnitus, a physical one using masking (Vernon, 1977), a psychosomatic method using biofeedback (House et al., 1977), and a chemical treatment using intravenous lidocaine and the oral anticonvulsants--carbamazepine, primidone and lidocaine amine. The latter seems to be the most promising, being easier to use, less time-consuming, more accurate to assess, and relying less on the patient's active participation and intelligence. The only disadvantages of the chemical method are the serious side-effects of the drugs in use. This can be managed by careful administration of these drugs and monitoring of the patient. In the future, new anticonvulsants with fewer side-effects will certainly be produced. It may be that chemical treatment can be combined with the masking and/or the biofeedback methods with a synergistic result. Another possible use of carbamazepine is in the treatment of palatal myoclonus and other similar disorders. Further clinical studies are needed to corroborate this application of the treatment.",

The responses were choices of verbal descriptors from randomized lists of either sensory intensity (that is, weak, mild, intense) or unpleasantness (annoying, unpleasant, distressing) descriptors. The fentanyl significantly reduced the sensory intensity without reducing the unpleasantness of the tooth pulp stimuli, indicating that the mechanisms of narcotic analgesia may include a significant attenuation in pain sensation in addition to effects on pain reaction.

The pharmacokinetics of these compounds are discussed in this review, with particular emphasis on the fetal exposure and its relationship to adverse effects on the fetus. 2-Chloroprocaine is rapidly hydrolyzed by esterases, and only traces of this compound reach the fetus, even following multiple injections, suggesting safety for the fetus. The main disadvantage of this compound is the short duration of action (0.5-1 h). The amide-type agents are active for longer time periods (up to several hours). The fetal/matemal total concentration ratios were approximately 0.3 for bupivacaine and etidocaine, 0.5 for lidocaine, 0.7 for mepivacaine, and 1 for prilocaine. The low ratios of bupivacaine and etidocaine result from extensive binding (90%) of these drugs to maternal a(1)-acid glycoprotein which exceeds corresponding fetal protein binding (50%). These low fetal/matemal total concentration ratios cannot be equated with fetal safety, because fetal side effects are better related to the free drug levels. Since the amide- type anaesthetics are weak bases, fetal acidosis will increase the matemal/fetal pH gradient and will result in accumulation of free drug in the fetus and possible fetal side effects. Addition of epinephrine to the injection solution reduces the maternal blood levels of the amide-type compounds, but apparently not the fetal levels to the same extent. Because of possible unwanted effects of epinephrine (decreased uterine blood flow), the addition of this compound is not generally accepted to be of advantage. Paracervical blockade may result in elevated fetal blood levels (possibly by transarterial diffusion into uterine arteries) and possibly fetal bradycardia.",

      "abstract": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, dosage, clinical efficacy, and adverse effects of milrinone are reviewed. Milrinone, which is structurally similar to amrinone, is an oral agent under investigation for the treatment of congestive heart failure. The drug produces positive inotropic and vasodilating effects through unknown mechanisms. Milrinone is well absorbed orally and has a duration of action of three to six hours. The major route of elimination is through the kidneys. The usual initial dosage of milrinone is 2.5-5 mg every six hours; patients whose condition is deteriorating may require 50 mg of the drug per day. Although most patients report that early in therapy the drug relieves the symptoms of congestive heart failure, these benefits are not always sustained. Milrinone does not check the natural progression of disease. Complaints of side effects are rare, although diarrhea, hyperthyroidism, aggravation of angina pectoris, worsening of muscle weakness, and increased fluid retention have been reported. There is evidence to suggest that milrinone may cause or aggravate arrhythmias, worsen congestive heart failure, and shorten the length of survival. Experience with milrinone indicates that the drug may be of limited usefulness in the treatment of congestive heart failure.",

      "title": "Minoxidil-induced hypertrichosis in a child with alopecia areata",
      "abstract": "Sir, Here, we are reporting development of severe hypertrichosis in a 3-year-old child with alopecia areata secondary to topical minoxidil, a commonly used off-label topical therapy for the same. A 3-year-old male child developed acute onset multiple bald patches diffusely distributed over the scalp (30% scalp area), along with loss of eyebrows. Parents started twice daily application of 5% minoxidil lotion on suggestion of a chemist and continued the same for more than 2 months without any dermatological consultation. No standard method of application of minoxidil was followed and it was applied as ordinary hair oil (2 times a day in liberal amount, 3 bottles of 60 ml were used in 2 months). There was no significant improvement in bald patches; however, slowly the boy developed hypertrichosis over forehead, cheek and neck [Figures 1 and 2]. No other cutaneous or systemic side-effects were noticed by parents during minoxidil use. No other topical or systemic medications (such as steroids) were used before or during minoxidil use. General physical and cutaneous examination of the child was within normal limit, excluding any other systemic cause for hypertrichosis. No serum hormonal investigations were performed due to lack of clinical indication. Parents were counselled regarding the cause of excessive hair growth and advised to discontinue minoxidil use.Figure 1: Hypertrichosis over forehead with lack of eyebrows due to alopecia areataFigure 2: Hypertrichosis with ophiasis pattern of alopecia areataPharmacologically, minoxidil, originally manufactured as an antihypertensive drug, is mainly used for alopecia. It affects hair growth through various plausible mechanisms such as increased duration of the anagen growth phase, agonistic effects on adenosine-triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channels, and prostaglandin stimulation in the dermal papillae. Though it is primarily approved for androgenetic alopecia of both sexes, its off-label uses include topical application in alopecia areata. There have been several reports of systemic administration of minoxidil either by oral administration to the mother during pregnancy or by oral ingestion by the child, leading to diffuse hypertrichosis of the newborn and children.[12] Hypertrichosis is also a common side effect of topical minoxidil use more commonly seen in women. Systemic absorption of the drug is <2% with topical therapy. It is usually localized to the head and neck; it may occasionally involve other body areas.[345] Severe affection by topical use, as in our case, is uncommonly reported.[6] Hypertrichosis caused by topical minoxidil depends on various factors such as higher amount or concentration of application, excessive systemic absorption, and high sensitivity of the follicular apparatus to minoxidil. In our patient, the high dose and unsupervised application (both in terms of concentration and daily quantity) in combination with the patient's low body weight and age favored the development of hypertrichosis. The efficacy of topical minoxidil in alopecia areata has never been definitively proven. Because of higher chances of adverse effects, use of topical minoxidil should be discouraged in the pediatric age group. If required, lower concentration (2%) of minoxidil in gel-based formulation should be used in pediatric age group because of relative safety. Over the counter sale of minoxidil should be restricted completely or to a minimum concentration of preparation. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "title": "Performance Enhancing, Non-Prescription Use of Ritalin",
      "abstract": "Abstract Ritalin™ known under chemical name methylphenidate (MPH), is a psychostimulant prescribed to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other conditions. Psychotropic effects and pharmacological pathways evoked by MPH are similar, but not identical to those produced by amphetamines and cocaine. Although not completely understood in detail, MPH psychostimulation is mediated by the increase of central dopamine (DA) and possibly norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (ST) due to decrease of their reuptake via binding to and inhibition of DA, NE, and ST transporters. Despite similarity in psychopharmacological effects, the rewarding/reinforcing ability of MPH appears to be significantly lower than amphetamines and especially cocaine. MPH and similar medications have been widely used on College campuses and by students preparing for exams. Nicknamed ‘steroids for SATs,’ MPH and related medications are purchased without prescription and their use may even be encouraged by parents and tutors. However, while widely and safely used and administered for over forty years, Ritalin generated significant controversy including MPH abuse and addiction, and adverse reactions. It is now clear that treatment of ADD/ADHD with psychostimulants prevents drug abuse and addictions. Use by those without any medical or psychiatric diagnosis is increasing. In this minireview, we discuss psychopharmacological and behavioral aspects, and outline neurochemical mechanisms that may provoke Ritalin abuse, addiction and adverse effects compared to amphetamines and cocaine.

      "abstract": "Maternally administered opiate analgesics may cause a respiratory depression of the newborn. Such respiratory depression is often not diagnosed with purely clinical methods such as the APGAR score. However, laboratory and clinical — experimental methods may demonstrate a neonatal depression more clearly [2,3,13]. It has been well documented that the maximal effect of meperidine occurs within 30—60 minutes after administration to the mother but that a neonatal depression may be recognized as late as 2-4 hours after administration of meperidine [2,9,12]. Opiate antagonists have frequently been recommended for the prophylaxis of postpartum adaption disturbances caused by Opiates. Basically two kinds of antagonists exist [9]: Agonistantagonists such as nalorphine and levallorphan on the one hand and pure antagonists such as naloxone on the other hand. Agonist-antagonists may cause a respiratory depression if they are over-dosed or if there is no opiate present on the receptor site. This effect is not present with naloxone. If naloxone is given to the mother 5—15 minutes before birth or is injected immediately postpartum into the umbilical vein, the agent wul prevent a postpartum neonatal respiratory depression [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14], Various doses have been re-",

      "abstract": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical use, adverse effects, dosage, and administration of the short-acting synthetic narcotic analgesic alfentanil hydrochloride are reviewed. Alfentanil is a tertiary amine with an ionization constant of 6.5, resulting in approximately 10% ionization at physiologic pH. When compared with fentanyl, alfentanil has a faster onset and one third the duration of action, one fourth to one tenth the potency, less lipid solubility, greater protein binding, and a much greater unionized fraction at physiologic pH. Alfentanil is approximately 20-40 times less potent than sufentanil on a weight basis, but it has a faster onset and shorter duration of action. After i.v. injection, alfentanil is distributed in the body according to a two- or three-compartment model. When given to young and middle-aged patients for various surgical procedures, alfentanil has an elimination half-life of 70-99 minutes independent of the dose or route of administration. Clinical studies comparing alfentanil with fentanyl in short surgical procedures are reported; alfentanil produces earlier peak analgesic effect, faster recovery of consciousness, and a more pronounced narcotic effect without increased adverse effects. When alfentanil was given in high doses for anesthesia induction, chest-wall rigidity occurred frequently. Like fentanyl, alfentanil was found to produce a high incidence of nausea and vomiting. It was more effective when administered by infusion than by bolus. Alfentanil is useful for supplementation of analgesia for outpatient surgical procedures, as an infusion for maintenance of anesthesia during surgery, and perhaps as an induction agent.",

      "title": "REMEDIES FOR THE SIDE EFFECTS OF NARCOTIC DRUGS",
      "abstract": "Narcotic drugs, or opioids, are widely used for their potent analgesic effects, particularly in the management of severe pain. However, their use is frequently accompanied by a range of side effects that can impact patient quality of life and complicate treatment. These side effects include constipation, nausea, drowsiness, confusion, respiratory depression, itching, and urinary retention. Addressing these adverse effects is crucial for improving patient outcomes and adherence to opioid therapy. This review explores various remedies and treatments available for managing the side effects of narcotic drugs. For constipation, options include polyethylene glycol, lactulose, docusate sodium, methylnaltrexone, and naloxegol, which help alleviate bowel irregularity. Nausea and vomiting can be managed with medications such as ondansetron, promethazine, and metoclopramide. Drowsiness and sedation may be mitigated with stimulants like modafinil and methylphenidate, while confusion and mental cloudiness might be addressed with donepezil. Respiratory depression, a potentially severe side effect, can be countered with naloxone. Itching and rash are often treated with diphenhydramine and topical corticosteroids, and urinary retention may be managed with tamsulosin. Additionally, this review examines complementary approaches, including herbal remedies and lifestyle modifications, that may offer supportive benefits in alleviating these side effects. The integration of these remedies with conventional treatments provides a holistic approach to managing opioid therapy-related complications, ultimately aiming to enhance patient comfort and adherence to pain management regimens.",

There is well documented intentional misuse and addiction to tianeptine in Europe, and this is increasingly being seen in the United States. We presented a case of buprenorphine/naloxone successfully being used to aid in cessation and subsequent abstinence from tianeptine after years of use. An additional consideration with tianeptine use is the potential for the development or re-emergence of depression and anxiety on cessation. Chronic daily use of tianeptine may represent tianeptine use disorder, which can have a clinical course consistent with opioid use disorder, including the development of impaired control, functional impairment, tolerance, and withdrawal. It is appropriate to consider medications for opioid use disorder for the management of tianeptine use disorder.",

      "abstract": "The appearance of adverse drug reactions may depend on the category of used drugs as well as on the coexistence of a pathological stage. Clinically important are: interactions of digitalis glycoside drugs leading to the occurrence or intensification of toxic symptoms characteristic for those drugs; interactions of antiarrhythmic drugs which may cause proarrhythmic effects and hypotension, and also interactions of nitrates resulting in lowering of the blood pressure. Quinidine, verapamil, nitrendipine, amiodaron, propafenone, captopril, spironolactone decrease renal clearance of digoxin, and amilorid/triamteren lower the extrarenal clearance of this drug. Thus the outcome of those concommitant therapies is the increase of digoxin serum concentration and appearance of toxic symptoms. Clinically dangerous, in the course of the antiarrhythmic therapy, is the increased risk of the arrhythmia appearance when two or more antiarrhythmic drugs are applied concomitantly. Antiarrhythmic drugs class IA (quinidine, disopyramide), class III (sotalol, amiodarone), class IV (calcium channel blockers) used at the same time with potassium depleters diuretics or beta-blocking agents result in the inhibition of repolarization and the increased duration of activation potential with the risk of developing arrhythmia of the torsade de pointes types. Nitrates interactions are mainly of the pharmacodynamic character. Most common adverse drug reaction, observed during the concomitant nitrates and another circulatory drug therapy, is excessive lowering of the blood pressure. These may lead to the decrease in the therapeutic efficacy of these combinations. Interactions of circulatory drugs are numerous, sometimes difficult to predict and they may lead to the intensification of the adverse drug reaction and lowering of their therapeutic efficacy.",

      "title": "The need for publicly funded research on therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs",
      "abstract": "A psychedelic drug is one that \"produces thought, mood and perceptual changes otherwise rarely experienced except in dreams, contemplative and religious exaltation, flashes of vivid involuntary memory, and acute psychosis\"1. It does so \"without causing physical addiction, craving, major physiological disturbances, delirium, disorientation or amnesia\"1. The \"classic psychedelics\" include mescaline, psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and plant-based substances such as ibogaine and ayahuasca. Their chemical structures differ, but they all act on the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor1. 3,4-methylenedioxy​methamphetamine (MDMA) is also included, although it does not produce the perceptual effects of the classic psychedelics2. Over the past two decades, there has been a revival of clinical research on the therapeutic use of psilocybin and MDMA2, 3. This research has been encouraged by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because in phase 2 trials these drugs have produced substantial benefits, respectively, in patients with treatment-resistant depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)3. Funding for psychedelic research has largely been philanthropic, because the pharmaceutical industry is not interested in drugs that are off patent. The new psychedelic research that is being done in leading universities in the US and Europe includes randomized controlled trials conducted to the standard required for FDA approval3. Psilocybin has been chosen rather than LSD, because it has a shorter period of action (4-6 hours vs. 8-12 hours), its pharmacology is better understood, it is less likely to produce \"bad trips\", and it does not carry the cultural baggage of LSD3. Clinical trials have also been done on MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in PTSD. If phase 3 trials confirm the results of phase 1 and 2 studies, psilocybin is likely to be approved for treatment-resistant depression, and for depression and anxiety in patients with terminal cancer. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy may also be approved to treat PTSD. A major challenge in conducting randomized placebo-controlled trials of psychedelics is that it is impossible for patients and therapists not to be aware of who has been given a psychedelic drug4. Recent trials have used an \"active placebo\", such as methylphenidate or dextroamphetamine, or used low, moderate and high doses of the psychedelic drug to see if treatment effects are related to dose5. It has been argued6 that psilocybin has a low abuse potential, because it does not produce euphoria in humans or self-administration in animals, and there are much lower rates of regular use of this drug in population surveys than for cannabis, cocaine and opioids. Furthermore, users rapidly develop tolerance to its effects and so do not persist in using it. Studerus et al4 reported very few acute, subacute and long-term effects of psilocybin in 110 participants in laboratory studies followed up for 8-16 months. This was a select group in that persons with a family or personal history of psychiatric disorders were excluded and 40% had used a psychedelic drug at least once. The short-term adverse effects were minor: fatigue, headache, lack of energy, and difficulty concentrating the day after. Eleven individuals reported \"negative changes in psychological well-being and/or mental functions\" after the psilocybin session. One reported \"persistent emotional instability, anxiety and depressive feelings\" that he \"attributed to suppressed memories\" released by the drug. He recovered after receiving psychotherapy. Psilocybin has been described as a \"disruptive\" treatment because a single dose produces an immediate clinical response – unlike selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that require two weeks of treatment – and its benefits are sustained for six months in a substantial proportion of patients2, 3. It also appears to act by different mechanisms than SSRIs and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)2. The major limitations of the current evidence for psychedelic drugs are interconnected. In the absence of pharmaceutical industry interest, limited support from philanthropic sources has funded the research, restricting trials to relatively small samples of patients because of the cost of doing larger studies. The persons who have done the research believe in the therapeutic value of psychedelic drugs. This is to be expected, given the history of psychedelics and the reputational challenges in conducting clinical research on them. If psychedelic drugs are introduced in clinical practice, there is a risk that their use will get ahead of the evidence on their safety and efficacy, in much the same way that \"medical cannabis\" has done7. If psilocybin is approved for treatment-resistant depression, patients and prescribers are likely to demand its use as a first-line treatment for severe depression rather than requiring that patients first fail to respond to SSRIs and other antidepressants. It is unclear whether the FDA and other drug regulators will require trials of psilocybin as a first-line treatment. There may also be demands to use psilocybin off-label to treat anxiety disorders. If MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is approved to treat PTSD, there may be demands to use MDMA off-label to treat other anxiety and depressive disorders. If the criteria for who is a qualified therapist are relaxed, MDMA may be used to treat unhappiness, anxiety and existential angst. The evidence may be used to argue for compassionate access to other psychedelic drugs, such as LSD, mescaline and DMT. It is uncertain if the use of psychedelics will remain under medical supervision for approved disorders, or whether their use will be advocated for spiritual and other nonmedical purposes. A combination of libertarian and utilitarian arguments may be used to justify the legalization of adult use of these drugs for any purpose, because they cause little harm to users and have a low abuse potential8. There may also be demands for compassionate access to plant-based psychedelic drugs in advance of any research evidence. US states may pass citizen-initiated referenda to legalize the medical use of psychedelic mushrooms and plants, such as ibogaine and ayahuasca, by appealing to the putative \"entourage\" effects of whole plants and the misconception that medicines derived from plants are safer than \"synthetic\" pharmaceuticals9. For all these reasons, we need public funding of independent evaluations of the efficacy of psychedelic drugs. Trials should involve larger numbers of patients who are representative of those clinical disorders for which these drugs may be used, and should include longer-term follow-up evaluations of safety and sustainability of favorable outcomes.",

Over and over we have heard that these are useful drugs in the practice of medicine but should be used only under medical supervision. In recent years a remarkable change has occurred in the pattern of usage of amphetamines. Gradually the list of legitimate medical indications for them has shrunk either because better drugs are available (as in parkinsonism, epilepsy, and depressive reactions), or because no drugs are as safe and rational as other methods of treatment (such as artificial ventilation and circulation support in barbiturate intoxication), or because their use is unsafe and ineffective (as in the case of obesity).

      "title": "The role of corticosteroids in the management of childhood asthma",
      "abstract": "Preventive treatment Inhaled corticosteroids are indicated in children with asthma who have more than mild persistent asthma or are unresponsive to non-steroidal medications after 2–4 weeks. Initial administration of 400 µg/day of chlorofluorocarbon-beclomethasone dipropionate, or budesonide, or 200 µg/day of fluticasone propionate or hydrofluoroalkane-beclomethasone dipropionate, is suggested, with subsequent titration of the dose to achieve ongoing control with the lowest dose possible. In situations where asthma control cannot be achieved with the above doses of inhaled corticosteroids, the addition of a long-acting β2-agonist, theophylline or a leukotriene antagonist should be considered. Specialist referral is recommended in children requiring high doses of inhaled steroids, regular oral steroids or in whom there is concern about possible steroid side effects. Treatment of acute asthma Systemic corticosteroid therapy is recommended for children with moderate to severe acute asthma or if there is incomplete response to β2-agonists. Initial administration of 1 mg/kg prednisolone (maximum, 50 mg) orally is suggested, and this may be repeated every 12–24 hours, depending on response. While a course of up to three days is generally sufficient, in more severe cases a prolonged course (with tapering) may occasionally be indicated. The need for recurrent systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute episodes is an indication for reassessment of the child's interval therapy.",

Though it resembles amphetamine chemically, the risk of developing dependence to it is much less; but research on its dependence-liability is still needed. Fenfluramine is effective and the anorectic effect may not fall off much with continued use for up to three months; 2 tolerance to the anorectic effect of other amphetamine derivatives seems to develop more quickly. However, even if this is confirmed, strict adherence to diet and regular supervision remain essential to the long-term success of slimming regimens.",

Dextromethorphan (DXM) has overtaken codeine as the most widely used cough suppressant due to its availability, efficacy, and safety profile at directed doses. However, DXM is subject to abuse. When consumed at inappropriately high doses (over 1500 mg/day), DXM can induce a state of psychosis characterized by Phencyclidine (PCP)-like psychological symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, and paranoia. We report a noteworthy case of severe dextromethorphan use disorder with dextromethorphan-induced psychotic disorder in a 40-year-old Caucasian female, whose symptoms remitted only following treatment with a combination of an antipsychotic and mood stabilizer. While some states have begun to limit the quantity of DXM sold or restrict sales to individuals over 18-years of age, there is currently no federal ban or restriction on DXM. Abuse of DXM, a readily available and typically inexpensive agent that is not detected on a standard urine drug screen, may be an under-recognized cause of substance-induced psychosis. It is imperative that clinicians are aware of the potential psychiatric sequelae of recreational DXM use.",

This potentiation has the following characteristics: 1) Potentiation of low doses of epinephrine (10-l0-10-9 M) develops after pretreatment with high doses of epinephrine (10-7-10-5 M). 2) Time (120 min) is required between the first and second application of epinephrine for full development of this potentiation. 3) Potentiation to low concentrations of epinephrine or norepinephrine is not observed in strips pretreated with high doses of norepinephrine. 4) Potentiation can be abolished by treating sensitized strips with high doses of norepinephrine but not other contractile agents such as isoproterenol, angiotensin or tyramine. 5) Reserpine-pretreated preparations do not develop potentiation to epinephrine unless pretreated with high doses of norepinephrine. 6) Potentiation to low concentrations of epinephrine can also be produced by repeated exposures to tyramine in normal preparations but not in reserpine-pretreated preparations. Although the mechanism of this effect is not clear, the possibility is suggested that it is related to a displacement or translocation of norepinephrine and the subsequent production of a metabolite or change resulting in potentiation.",

      "title": "A rare case of dicyclomine and mefenamic acid abuse fulfilling criteria of dependence syndrome",
      "abstract": "Sir, Dicyclomine is a tertiary amine anticholinergic drug indicated for morning sickness, dysmenorrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome.[1] Mefenamic acid is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used primarily as an analgesic. It is quite effective in dysmenorrhea.[2] This is an extremely rare case of drug abuse of dicyclomine and mefenamic acid tablets fulfilling criteria of dependence syndrome. A 30-year-old woman presented with a complaint of excessive use of dicyclomine and mefenamic acid tablets for the past 10 years. She started using it in 2007 for dysmenorrhea. After 1 year of initiation, she started using it to get relief from nervousness and headache because of any stress. From 2014, she started taking 2–3 tablet daily to get relief from stress of marital discord which increased to 10–15 tablets daily in 2018 suggesting tolerance. She reported an intense desire to take tablets suggesting craving. She would have apprehension, restlessness, and headache 2–3 days after stopping it suggesting withdrawal symptoms. In 2017, her husband got to know about it leading to conflict between her in-law family and her family. Because of this, she had low mood, intermittent headache, apprehension and disturbed sleep. During mental status examination, she subjectively reported low mood and had anxious affect. On cue exposure and extinction, she developed tachycardia, palpitation, and sweating suggesting objective craving. Her body mass index was 18.2 kg/m2 and hemoglobin was 10.4 g/dl, and rest of the general physical examination and investigations were within the normal limit. She was diagnosed with abuse of nondependence-producing substances with adjustment disorder (International Statistical Classification of Diseases-10). Initially, on outpatient basis and later during ward admission, she was treated with fluoxetine 20 mg per day and clonazepam 0.5 mg per day and advised abstinence. With these measures, she reverted to normal physiological state in a week during ward stay. During 1 year of follow-up, she denied any abuse of dicyclomine and mefenamic acid tablets but that could not be corroborated with her husband who suspected that she may have used it intermittently. Our patient started using dicyclomine and mefenamic acid tablets for dysmenorrhea and later for stress relief. Since that caused therapeutic benefit, it acted as a positive reinforcement for drug use. Later, relief from withdrawal symptoms acted as a negative reinforcement for drug use. The transition from casual drug use to drug abuse may be neurobiologically conceptualized as a transition from positive to negative reinforcement mechanisms.[3] The abuse liability may have been because of dicyclomine's anticholinergic property and its property to cross blood–brain barrier.[4] Previous literature also reported abuse of dicyclomine[45] though no literature on abuse of mefenamic acid has been found to the best of knowledge of authors. Our patient fulfilled the criteria of craving, withdrawal, and tolerance for substance use disorder. This suggests that nondependence-producing substance like dicyclomine may also cause dependence if not used judiciously. Hence, further study on abuse of anticholinergic drug, particularly dicyclomine, is needed. We also suggest that therapeutic use of anticholinergic drug, particularly dicyclomine, should be combined with strict vigilance and effective counseling of patients and family members to prevent abuse of such drugs. Declaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained appropriate patient consent form. In the form, the patient has given her consent for clinical information to be reported in the journal. The patient understands that her name and initial will not be published and due efforts will be made to conceal his/her identity, but anonymity cannot be guaranteed.

Adverse effects include hemorrhage, skin necrosis and teratogenicity. Phenindione can also cause serious hypersensitivity reactions. Five oral anticoagulants are available in Europe, although warfarin, phenprocoumon and nicoumalone (acenocumarol) are the most commonly used agents. The choice of oral anticoagulant is often influenced by previous experience and familiarity, but in a survey of 22 clinical pharmacologists in 12 countries of Europe, warfarin (57%) or phenprocoumon (24%) were the agents recommended most often in clinical practice.",

Pilocarpine must therefore be used with caution in patients with asthma, cardiac arrhythmia, iridocyclitis, and closed-angle glaucoma. (5) In France, this pilocarpine formulation costs 18 times more than a preparation of pilocarpine 2% eye drops used orally (off licence). (6) In practice, patients needing symptomatic treatment of xerostomia after radiotherapy may benefit from oral pilocarpine but, given its limited efficacy and its adverse effects, other local treatments should be tried first.",

Methadone has an average primary-phase half-life of 14.3 hours and a slower secondary-phase half-life averaging 54.8 hours. Administering the recommended dose of methadone and escalating doses within 2-3 days may lead to very high plasma levels of the drug. In addition, factors such as drug-drug interaction and/or hepatic and renal dysfunction may affect the metabolism of methadone and result in its accumulation. Methadone is an effective analgesic whose pharmacokinetics must be appreciated in order for it to be used safely and effectively. Three cases of methadone overdose are presented.",

      "title": "Amphetamine Related Psychiatric Disorders",
      "abstract": "Amphetamines, such as methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), belong to a class of compounds called phenethylamines which induce catecholaminergic effects in the CNS and peripheral circulation. Amphetamine was first manufactured in 1893 to treat asthma and upper respiratory congestion, but indications and usage in the medical field have increased over the last century. Today, amphetamines are clinically used to treat short-term obesity, narcolepsy, and attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity. Recreational use of amphetamines has reached epidemic proportions in Asia, Australasia, and the United States. The majority of illegal amphetamines in North America are produced in rural areas of Mexico and the United States in clandestine labs. Amphetamines can be easily manufactured using common household materials, including acetone, red phosphorus, sodium hydroxide, sulfuric acid, ammonia, toluene, along with over-the-counter medicines, ephedrine, and pseudoephedrine.The routes of amphetamine administration may be inhalation, intravenous, intramuscular, or transmucosal (oral/nasal). Peak plasma levels can range from 5 to 10 minutes via intravenous administration and up to 2 to 3 hours if taken transmucosal. Symptoms typically last hours to days, based on dosage and strength, and dissipate once the drug is eliminated from the body. Given the acute symptoms associated with amphetamine intoxication, it is difficult for the clinician to distinguish amphetamine-associated psychosis from the acute psychosis of a primary mental disorder. Most agree that psychosis following amphetamine use is characterized by persecutory delusions, visual hallucinations, and symptoms resembling acute psychosis most commonly observed in schizophrenia.There is also a clear pattern of high dosage and daily usage correlating with higher risks of substance-induced psychosis. Amphetamines impair the cognitive thought process and subsequently precede acute psychosis. This suggests that continued impairment due to amphetamine use is a precursor to psychosis.",

Only some of these compounds have scientific rationale supporting their development. At least two inherent properties of a drug are desirable in considering its reformulation into a sustained-release entity. One of these properties is the demonstration of a concentration/response relationship together with a short plasma elimination half-life and inactive or uncharacterized activity of any generated metabolites. The second property is the production of transient side effects associated with dissolution and/or peak concentrations. When neither of these conditions is satisfied, then a sustained-release preparation may offer no advantages over the conventional formulation. The literature on indomethacin was examined with respect to the above conditions and it was concluded that its marketing as a sustained-release preparation is not justified and that investigations have failed to demonstrate clinical advantages of this new formulation.",

Symptoms at admission were: drowsiness, hallucinations, dysphasia, and impaired motor coordination. arterial blood pressure and heart rate were a little elevated. The symptoms lasted a dozen or so hours.

If this is ineffective, vitamin B6 and, if indicated, vitamin E or zinc sulfate should be added to the regimen. If therapy still is not effective, a diuretic (preferably spironolactone [Aldactone]) or natural progesterone should be added. This may also be done during the three to six months required for dietary therapy to achieve maximum effectiveness. Diuretics are less expensive, easier to use, and easier to obtain than natural progesterone, which is not widely available. If oral contraceptives are desirable for the patient, progestin-dominant pills may be tried instead of a diuretic or natural progesterone. For those patients whose symptoms are resistant to all of the aforementioned therapy, bromocriptine (Parlodel) or danazol (Danocrine) can be added to the regimen; these drugs, however, should be prescribed only by practitioners experienced in their use.",

      "abstract": "The selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have become drugs of first choice for many psychiatric conditions including major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bulimia, panic and other anxiety disorders, among others. SSRIs appear to be comparable in efficacy to the tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in adults but have fewer side effects, are far less lethal in overdose, and are likely to have more clinical indications (Emslie et al., 1999). Moreover, recent investigation has suggested the efficacy of the SSRIs, fluoxetine (Emslie et al., 1997, 2000), and paroxetine (Keller et al., 2001) in child and adolescent MDD, whereas the TCAs have consistently demonstrated no superiority over placebo in pediatric MDD (see Chapter 8). Brophy (1995) reported over 200,000 prescriptions and refills of fluoxetine and sertraline for children 5-10 years of age in 1994, representing a fourfold increase in a 2-year period. Increased use of SSRIs and other psychotropic agents, particularly the psychostimulants, in younger children has resulted in additional investigation into prescribing practices (Zito et al., 2000) and questions as to whether these medications have been overprescribed. While investigation to date raises many more questions than are answered, i.e, who is prescribing the medications, conditions being treated, etc, there is no question that these medications are being prescribed with a minimum224 Rosenbergof extant controlled research study (Emslie et al., 1999). While this chapter underscores the growing need for additional research investigation to better delineate the clinical efficacy vs. toxicity of the SSRIs as well as many other psychotropic medications in children, we have attempted to synthesize the limited available data to propose ''best resolution'' of current scientific insights into best clinical judgment and practice.",

Current treatments include stimulants, which inhibit the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, a nonstimulant norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) atomoxetine, and alpha-2 agonists clonidine extended release (ER) and guanfacine ER. Despite the effectiveness of these medications some patients do not respond to available drugs or may experience tolerability issues that hinder their use.Viloxazine, a serotonin norepinephrine modulating agent, was used outside of the United States (U.S.) as an effective antidepressant for several decades, but its use fell out of favor due to the need for multiple daily dosing. An ER viloxazine formulation was recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ADHD. The efficacy, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of viloxazine and viloxazine ER are reviewed.Viloxazine ER is the first nonstimulant approved to treat ADHD in more than a decade. Although they have not been directly compared, the effect size of viloxazine ER is less than has been observed for stimulants. However, its pharmacokinetic properties and tolerability make viloxazine ER a useful addition to the collection of FDA approved ADHD treatments.",

      "abstract": "Mexiletine is a new antiar‐rhythmic drug that has minor negative inotropic effects even in patients with underlying left ventricular dysfunction. The drug can be used in patients with underlying conduction system disease although reports of worsening sinus node function or atrioventicular conduction abnormalities have been noted. Mexiletine may aggravate venticular arrhythmias. The drug can be used safely with other cardioactive agents. Side effects are frequent but can be minimized by starting with low doses and titrating the dosage as tolerated. Mexiletine should be administered with meals or a snack or with antacids or possibly cimetidine to reduce gastrointestinal side effects. Mexiletine can cause abnormal liver function tests, hematologic abnormalities, and elevated titers of antinuclear antibodies (ANA). Regular monitoring of these parameters is suggested.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Guanethidine (Ismelin*) is a substance which reduces the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (Maxwell et al. 1 ). By virtue of this property, guanethidine has been used successfully as a hypotensive agent in essential hypertension over the last few years (Leishman et al., 2 Mertz, 4 Sturzenegger et al., 5 Dollery et al., 6 Jaquerod and Spuhler, 3 and others). Unlike hexamethonium and pentolinium, guanethidine has no ganglion-blocking action. It also has no peripheral sympathicolytic effect, since the sensitivity of the receptors to sympathicomimetic substances is not decreased but is, on the contrary, increased. Guanethidine inhibits the release of levarterenol somewhere between the ganglion and the receptor (Fig. 1). It has a long-lasting effect: after one therapeutically active dose, the inhibition lasts for several days. In experiments on animals it could be shown to be still present after 3 weeks. Following oral administration to patients, the maximum effect is",

      "abstract": "Ketamine is an anaesthetic and analgesic drug synthesized in the 1960s from phencyclidine. The recreational use of ketamine increased among the dance culture of techno and house music, in particular in clubs, discotheques, and rave parties. The psychotropic effects of ketamine are now well known and they range from dissociation to positive, negative, and cognitive schizophrenia-like symptoms. We report a case of a chronic oral consumption of ketamine which induced agitation, behavioral abnormalities, and loss of contact with reality in a poly-drug abuser; these symptoms persisted more than two weeks after the drug consumption had stopped. Antipsychotic treatment with paliperidone led to a successful management of the psychosis, getting a complete resolution of the clinical picture. Paliperidone has proven to be very effective in the treatment of ketamine-induced disorders. Moreover, the pharmacological action and metabolism of paliperidone are poorly dependent from the activity of liver enzymes, so that it seems to be one of the best second generation antipsychotics for the treatment of smokers and alcohol abusers.",

The reported frequency of side effects has differed considerably but is surprisingly low in all studies. The drug has caused an array of central nervous system disturbances, gynecomastia, and, rarely, hepatotoxicity, interstitial nephritis, bradycardia, hypotension, and even cardiac arrest. The last complication has occurred with rapid-bolus intravenous injection. Blood dyscrasias have also been rare and usually associated with serious underlying disease or multiple drugs, making it difficult to establish cause and effect in most cases. The drug is used widely to treatment conditions for which it is not approved. Some of these conditions are now believed to respond to cimetidine (gastric ulcer); others are known not to respond (acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding and acute pancreatitis).",

      "abstract": "With the advent of novel monocomponent venoactive drugs containing the flavonoid diosmin, the need has arisen to answer the question of therapeutic equivalence of the widely used micronized purified flavonoid fraction (MPFF) contained in Detralex and of the currently introduced monocomponent venoactive drugs. Experimental work provides evidence that each of the two dominant components, i.e. diosmin and hesperidin, has its specific and distinctive pharmacodynamic effect. There is also evidence of a mutual synergistic effect, e.g. in antiexudative action. Clinical studies have been carried out with MPFF for the most part, and effect has clearly been established in this particular form. Conversely, the results of studies documenting the effect of diosmin alone have been conflicting. Mutual comparisons failed to confirm equivalence of MPFF and monocomponent diosmin in any of the studies. This fact is clearly reflected in the relevant guidelines where the use of MPFF in chronic venous disease is recommended unequivocally (level of evidence 1 and strength of evidence B) while, in the case of monocomponent diosmin, it is stated that treatment can be considered (2C). It can be concluded that both experimental and clinical studies document that only a complex of biologically active flavonoids - a micronized purified flavonoid fraction - has evidence of effect and is recommended by relevant guidelines.",

Tetracycline에 의한 치아 착색 기전은 명확히 알려지진 않았지만 칼슘 이온이 킬레이트화를 통해 치아에 침착되어 발생한다고 알려져 있다2. 반면 doxycyline은 이러한 과정에서 다른 tetracycline계 약물에 비해 적은 양의 칼슘과 결합하므로 드물게 치아 착색이 발생한다고 알려져 있다1. 또한 푸른색 내지는 회색의 착색을 보이는 minocycline과 달리 노란색 내지는 갈색의 착색을 보인다는 차이점이 있다3.

Doxycycline은 피부과에서 자주 쓰는 약으로 성인에서 치아착색이 발생할 수 있다는 점을 인지하는 것이 필요하다고 생각된다.",

Quinine remains an effective drug when used correctly. However, compliance problems arise due to the often occurring side-effects during a ten day regimen. Prospects of overcoming these constraints by combining a short course of quinine with other drugs are limited, because of the lack of suitable partner compounds. For this reason quinine/clindamycin appears to be a more practical therapy of P. falciparum malaria. In vitro data from this study suggest that mefloquine is another effective alternative for the treatment of falciparum malaria in this Amazon region.",

The effect of supplementary doses of Granisetoron on delayed nausea and vomiting was less adequate during later stages than during earlier stages of hemotherapy.Granisetoron has a beneficial effect on acute drug-induced nausea and vomiting and is safe to administer. Granisetoron is, for the time being, an essential drug for chemotherapy using antineoplastic agents ; however, this drug fails to which sufficiently affect delayed nausea and vomiting develop during the later stage of chemotherapy.

      "abstract": "Cigarette dependence is recognised as a life-threatening disorder which can be treated by behavioural support and/or medication. Bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release (Zyban™, GlaxoSmithKline) is licensed in many countries including the US, Canada, UK, Australia and continental Europe to aid smoking cessation. The usual recommended dose is 150 mg b.i.d. taken for 7 – 14 days prior to the quit date, and then 6 – 8 weeks afterwards (figures vary across countries). Evidence from seven double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trials shows that it improves success at staying off cigarettes for at least 12 months by 9 – 10 percentage points. Taking into account estimates of subsequent cessation and relapse patterns in treated and untreated smokers, and the improvement in life-expectancy of smokers who manage to stop, the estimated cost/life/year saved from an episode of use of the medication is ∼ UK£1000 or US$1500. Bupropion has CNS stimulant properties; the common side effects are dry mouth and sleep disturbance. Rare but serious side effects are anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reaction and seizure (both estimated at 1 in a 1000). The drug is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its metabolites, any seizure disorder, eating disorder, severe hepatic cirrhosis, history of bipolar disorder or in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Extreme caution is advised where there are any predisposing factors that may reduce the seizure threshold. Bupropion sustained-release and nicotine replacement therapies are both considered as first-line treatments to aid smoking cessation. Ideally patients should also enrol in a structured behavioural support programme to boost their chances of success.",

In supragingival plaque control regimens, chlorhexidine has not been superceded as a chemical anti-plaque agent, although other compounds have been shown to be useful. The local side-effects of chlorhexidine and other cationic antiseptics, however, limit their long-term use for prevention. Extrinsic tooth staining in particular remains the greatest problem. Short-term anti-plaque uses for chlorhexidine include as an adjunct to mechanical cleaning in the initial oral hygiene phase of treatment, in situations where mechanical oral hygiene is difficult, including postsurgery, intermaxillary fixation, fixed orthodontic therapy, physically and mentally handicapped individuals, systemic diseases with oral manifestations such as leukaemia. More recent interest in chlorhexidine has resulted from the delivery of compounds subgingivally in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. Such methods have extended the use of chlorhexidine into areas inaccessible to the action of antimicrobial drugs delivered locally by conventional means, such as tooth brushing or mouth rinsing. Available evidence suggests that chlorhexidine may not be as effective as some antimicrobial drugs whose activity is more specific for those organisms considered particularly pathogenic to the periodontal tissues.",

      "abstract": "Paludism can occur quite easily in pregnant women in endemic zones, above all those who are primiparous or in their 2nd or 3rd terms. The onset of paludal attacks can be serious for both the mother and the child. That is to say, besides the obviously imperative therapeutic action, a prophylaxis is also a necessity. The use of antipaludial substances at our disposal has been complicated during the last few years as a result of chloroquine-resistance extension. Besides a few nuances of kinetic nature observed in pregnant women, a good knowledge of teratogenous or embryotoxic effects is necessary. But this remains fragmentary. Among the principal antipaludial medications is quinine (Q), reported to be abortifacient but in reality it is not: it is often poorly tolerated by the mother (hypoglycemia), but is not responsible for abnormalities in children, except under large doses. Chloroquine (CQ), considered to be without harmful effects, can be used in women without large restrictions, even if toxic effects have been observed in animals. The pyrimethamine-sulfanilamide (P-S) combination contains two substances which are a potential risk. Nevertheless, experiments have never showed harmful effects in pregnant women, particularly when under cover of a joint prescription of folinic acid. Proguanil is without doubt the only molecule which can be used without restriction. Two new medications, quinoline methanol, Mefloquine (MQ) and Halofantrine (HF) are contra-indicated for lack of experimentation and because of some abnormalities observed at high doses in animals. Artemisinine and amino-8-quinoline are contra-indicated, and cyclines are strongly inadvised. From the practical point of view, the present use of antipaludial medication in pregnancy should take into account the surrounding risk, namely that of paludism and of treatments. Curatively, Q remains a serious treatment in any form. In CQ-sensitive zones CQ is usable unreservedly in simple attacks. In CQ resistance zones the use of Q seems preferable to that of Fansidar proposed by certain people. MQ and HF, although contra-indicated, have already been employed without inconvenience. By way of prevention, it is important first of all to avoid all leisure stays in endemic zones. If travel is unavoidable or for indigenous people, a chemoprophylaxis, judged according to the local risk of impaludation, is desirable: CQ in sensitive zones, PG+CQ in resistant zones, P-S, as proposed by some people, is normally contra-indicated; MQ and HF are contra-indicated. Protection against nocturnal mosquito bites is still strongly applied (Mosquito net, repellents, insecticides).",

Later on, they developed psychosis, slurred speech, tremors of hands and initially underwent treatment for Parkinsonism and Wilson's disease because of clinical misdiagnosis. They were diagnosed with lead poisoning later and were treated successfully with lead chelator (CaNa2 EDTA).",

The response did not depend on the presence of overt fluid retention, renal impairment, or the use of antihypertensive drugs of high potency. Women had larger responses than men. Expansion of the plasma or extracellular fluid volume is an important cause of resistance to treatment even when a thiazide diuretic is used. An increase in diuretic treatment should be tried before using the postganglionic adrenergic blockers or minoxidil in resistant hypertension.",

      "title": "Psychedelic Therapy: A Primer for Primary Care Clinicians—Ketamine",
      "abstract": "Background: Ketamine, an arylcyclohexylamine dissociative anesthetic agent, has evolved into a versatile therapeutic. It has a rapid-onset, well-understood cardiovascular effects and a favorable safety profile in clinical use. Its enantiomeric compound, esketamine, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019 for both treatment-resistant depression and major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation. Areas of Uncertainty: Research indicates dose-dependent impacts on cognition, particularly affecting episodic and working memory following both acute administration and chronic use, albeit temporarily for the former and potentially persistent for the latter. Alongside acute risks to cardiovascular stability, ketamine use poses potential liver toxicity concerns, especially with prolonged or repeated exposure within short time frames. The drug's association with “ketamine cystitis,” characterized by bladder inflammation, adds to its profile of physiological risks. Therapeutic Advances: Data demonstrate a single intravenous infusion of ketamine exhibits antidepressant effects within hours (weighted effect size averages of depression scores (N = 518) following a single 0.5 mg/kg infusion of ketamine is d = 0.96 at 24 hours). Ketamine is also effective at reducing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity following repeated infusions (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores: −11.88 points compared with midazolam control). Ketamine also decreased suicidal ideation in emergency settings (Scale for Suicidal Ideation scores: −4.96 compared with midazolam control). Through its opioid-sparing effect, ketamine has revolutionized postoperative pain management by reducing analgesic consumption and enhancing recovery. Limitations: Many studies indicate that ketamine's therapeutic effects may subside within weeks. Repeated administrations, given multiple times per week, are often required to sustain decreases in suicidality and depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Ketamine's comprehensive clinical profile, combined with its robust effects on depression, suicidal ideation, PTSD, chronic pain, and other psychiatric conditions, positions it as a substantial contender for transformative therapeutic application.",

The physician's approach to the management of side effects is therefore determined by the patient's response as well as by adverse reactions. The severity of the adverse reaction and its natural history will influence the decision about treatment. There are just 3 options in a patient who develops a side effect due to penicillamine. Treatment may be stopped. It may be stopped and reintroduced, usually using a lower dose and cautious increases. Or it may be continued. Skillful management of side effects is an essential part of the treatment of RA with penicillamine. A therapeutic opportunity has been lost when treatment is stopped in a patient whose disease is controlled. The potential for side effects also influences the decision to use penicillamine and the surveillance required for patients receiving it.",

The rapidity of release of the active principle in the rectal fluid depends mainly on the physicochemical properties of the vehicle. Absorption per se is influenced by the liposolubility as well as the ionization of the medication, and by the site of its release since only the middle and inferior hemorrhoidal veins avoid the hepatic crossing. For molecules subjected to a major 1st hepatic crossing (lidocaine, propranolol, ergotamine...), pharmacokinetic studies demonstrate that the rectal route enables to obtain a bioavailability which is markedly higher by oral route, and plasma concentrations at a therapeutic level. The use, still experimental, of rectal osmotic pumps, provides balanced plasma concentrations which remain stable during the entire duration of the application. Undesirable side effects related to the administration of drugs via the rectal route, are, most of the time, local ones. The vehicles seem to be responsible for diffuse ano-rectitis. Cases of rectal ulcerations with necrosis have been reported following the excessive use of suppositories containing dextro-propoxyphene or ergotamine.",

Severe side effects associated with the administration of sulfonamide + pyrimethamine are discussed. The development of Plasmodium falciparum resistance to chloroquine and other agents creates a new challenge for chemoprophylaxis. The choice of chemoprophylaxis is dictated by the geographical incidence of resistance: in low risk areas (no chloroquine resistance), 4-amino-quinolines should be used because of the good tolerance; in medium risk areas (low frequency of resistant strains), amodiaquine is useful for prophylaxis and presumptive treatment of fevers is indicated; in high risk areas (high incidence of resistant strains), no anti-malarial agent but the newly developed mefloquine is effective.",

Limited data exist regarding the presentation and management of patients with lisdexamfetamine toxicity.Case presentation: A 17-year-old female with history of prior suicide attempt presented to the emergency department after ingestion of 50 lisdexamfetamine 40 mg capsules which belonged to a friend. The patient was asymptomatic until approximately seven hours post-ingestion when she developed hypertension, mydriasis and complained of severe headache, blurred vision, chest pain, nausea, and vomiting. The patient was diagnosed with drug-induced hypertensive emergency and phentolamine was administered after lorazepam failed to adequately control her symptoms. Discussion: While lisdexamfetamine is a pro-drug, onset of clinical effects after ingestion is typically quicker and often consistent with amphetamine intoxication including many sympathomimetic symptoms, not simply those related to vasoconstriction alone. Benzodiazepines are frequently utilized in the management of stimulant toxicity, however were insufficient for our patient. This case highlights a unique presentation of lisdexamfetamine toxicity with primarily alpha adrenergic stimulant effects in addition to altered pharmacokinetics observed in overdose. Phentolamine was effective for management of hypertensive emergency in this patient.Conclusion: Lisdexamfetamine toxicity may present with delayed onset of clinical effects. Phentolamine may be useful for treating hypertensive emergency resulting from overdose in addition to standard care.",

Since only from 20 to 33 per cent of an orally administered dose of penicillin is absorbed from the intestinal tract,2this route was originally considered wasteful of an expensive material. Moreover, since the absorption of the drug is limited to a small segment of the gastrointestinal tract, the period for absorption is short. This, coupled with rapid excretion, causes quite irregular or transitory demonstrable serum concentrations, lasting only from two to four hours, if small doses are employed.2The presence of food in the gastrointestinal tract also interferes markedly with the efficient absorption of orally administered penicillin with the result that the drug has had to take precedence over",

      "title": "Clonazepam as a therapeutic adjunct to improve the management of depression: a brief review",
      "abstract": "Abstract Clonazepam, first used for seizure disorders, is now increasingly used to treat affective disorders. We summarize the use of clonazepam to improve the management of depression. Clonazepam is useful for treatment‐resistant and/or protracted depression, as well as for acceleration of response to conventional antidepressants. Clonazepam is at this time recommended for use in combination with SSRIs (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline) as an antidepressant, and should be used at a dosage of 2.5–6.0 mg/day. If clonazepam is effective, a response should be observed within 2–4 weeks. It is significantly more effective for unipolar than for bipolar depression. Low‐dose, long‐term treatment with clonazepam exhibits a prophylactic effect against recurrence of depression. Although the mechanism of action of clonazepam has not yet been established, some investigators have been suggested that it involves enhancement of anti‐anxiety effects, anticonvulsant effects on subclinical epilepsy, increase in 5‐HT/monoamine synthesis or decrease in 5‐HT receptor sensitivity mediated through the GABA system, and regulate in GABA activity.

The first report on the clinical study of this substance from our laboratory<sup>1</sup>showed that its local application in the nose caused marked shrinking and paling of the mucous membrane without the irritation so frequently found when epinephrine is used. The duration and intensity of the local effect were in every way comparable to that of ephedrine. Phenylaminoethanol sulphate differs from ephedrine, however, in that it appears to be without useful therapeutic effect on the bronchi when injected subcutaneously or when taken orally. Topical application in the nose for the shrinking of swollen membranes thus appeared to be a clinically useful effect of phenylaminoethynol sulphate.",

      "title": "Phenolphthalein – inhalable fraction. Documentation of proposed values of occupational exposure limits (OELs)",
      "abstract": "Phenolphthalein is a colorless and odorless crystalline solid; in a powdered form white or pale yellow. It is non-volatile, practically insoluble in water, but it dissolves in ethanol. Phenolphthalein is not known to occur as a natural product. The synthetic substance is used as a pH indicator in laboratories, during work on metal surfaces in galvanizing plants as well as for measuring the saturation of concrete with carbon dioxide. Until the end of the 20th century, it was widely used as a component of non-prescription laxatives – in 1999 FDA removed phenolphthalein from the list of substances considered safe. In 2016 in Poland 255 enterprises were reported to work with phenolphthalein (mainly laboratories) and there were 2500 occupationally exposed people. Phenolphthalein used in therapeutic doses was well tolerated. Only a few side effects were reported: abdominal discomfort, nausea, reduced blood pressure and weakness. Chronic use of phenolphthalein resulted in widening of the colon, reduced thickness of the lining of the mucosa, gastric disorders, dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. In a 13-week study in which phenolphthalein was administered to laboratory animals with diets, mice turned out to be a more sensitive species from rats. Changes in testes and epididymides were observed in males and hypoplasia and bone marrow necrosis in males and females. The results of genotoxicity studies indicated that phenolphthalein acts as a promutagen and exerts a clastogenic effect after metabolic activation. Studies on the effect of phenolphthalein on the reproduction of animals indicated its harmful effect on reproductive functions of males. In the EU, phenolphthalein is classified as a category-2 mutagen and category-2 reproductive toxicant (due to its effect on fertility). A small increase in the risk of colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer was observed in case-control studies in patients using phenolphthalein-based laxatives (especially with intensive use of these agents), but the relationship was not statistically significant. In a 2-year NTP carcinogenicity study a significant increase in the number of benign phaeochromocytomas and adenomas of renal tubular epithelium was observed in male rats. There was also a significant increase in histiocytic sarcomas in mice of both sexes and in malignant lymphomas (of all types) and thymic lymphomas and benign ovarian tumors in females. Based on these experiments phenolphthalein has been identified as a substance reasonably anticipated as human carcinogen (NTP R). The experiment on heterozygous p53 (+/-) mice of both sexes confirmed an increase in lymphoma cases. Phenolphthalein is classified by European Union experts as a category-1B of carcinogenic substances, i.e. known or presumed human carcinogens, however the classification is largely based on animal evidence. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) identified phenolphthalein as a substance of very high concern (SVHC). Based on the NTP test results, the additional risk of malignant lymphoma at 8.25 mg/m3 occupational exposure to phenolphthalein for 40 years is 10-4. A concentration of 8 mg/m3 was proposed as the MAC-TWA value for phenolphthalein. Since phenolphthalein is a poorly water-soluble solid, only dust exposure of the substance will occur in the work environment, hence the proposed MAC value should concern the inhalable fraction of the substance. It is proposed to label phenolphthalein as \"Carc. 1B\" indicating that phenolphthalein is a category-1B carcinogen and \"Ft\" due to reprotoxicity. There are no bases for establishing the short-term exposure limit value (STEL) and the limit value in biological material (BEI).",

      "abstract": "Although widespread use has confirmed their efficacy as anxiolytic agents, the benzodiazepine drugs are indicated only for short-term or intermittent therapy at as low a therapeutic dose as possible because of their liability for causing dependence or abuse. When first introduced, benzodiazepine drugs appeared to be therapeutically equal or superior to barbiturate agents, while causing fewer side effects, being safer in overdose, and producing fewer dependence and abuse problems. Although benzodiazepine drugs have become the most commonly prescribed anxiolytic agents, evidence has emerged that their use in long-term therapy can cause severe withdrawal problems, even when relatively low doses are used or when the drug is discontinued gradually. Based on results from both animal models and clinical investigations, buspirone appears to be as effective in treating anxiety as the benzodiazepine drugs while causing fewer withdrawal problems. Data suggest no appreciable propensity to cause physical dependence or abuse associated with buspirone therapy. The drug demonstrates no cross-tolerance with either the barbiturate agents or the benzodiazepine drugs and seems to be a dysphoriant at high doses rather than a euphoriant. Although buspirone seems to be an appropriate drug for patients requiring longer-term anxiolytic therapy, careful monitoring for withdrawal problems and other adverse side effects is essential as buspirone is introduced to successive markets.",

      "abstract": "“Chasing the Dragon” refers to inhalation of the heated vapour of the free-base form of heroin. The powder is placed on tinfoil above a flame until it liquefies, vaporizes and is then inhaled by the user to experience a high. Smoking of is reported to have arisen in Shanghai in the 1920’s using porcelain bowls and bamboo straws [i] . The use of tinfoil in this practice was originally reported in Hong Kong in the 1950’s and is now known as ‘Chasing the Dragon’ 1 . This method of use has seen increasing use and is now a global phenomenon including in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. Heroin Induced Leukoencephalopathy (HIL) is a consequence that can occur after inhalation of vapour, and may present in a variety of ways varying from changes in personality, inattention and forgetfulness, to ataxia, dementia, and coma. This condition is fatal in 25 percent of cases [ii] . The pathophysiology of HIL is thought to involve the presence of a toxin that is activated by heating that causes injury, particularly to the white matter of the brain as evidenced on T2 MRI images. Treatment strategies for this condition are few and have yet to be fully investigated. We describe the case of a 30 year old male who presented with profound ataxia and dysarthria because of HIL and showed rapid short-term and sustained improvement following Buspirone treatment after previous treatment failure with an antioxidant. Buspirone has been investigated for the management of hereditary cerebellar ataxias but has not previously been implicated as a possible treatment for other causes of ataxia like HIL.

      "abstract": "The psychological effects of abrupt withdrawal of ataractic drugs have been studied by others. Physical symptoms also occur under such circumstances and include abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Forty patients were divided into four groups of 10, each group receiving one of the following drugs: chlorpromazine, thioridazine, perphenazine or chlorprothixene. This medication was then suddenly withdrawn. In each of the chlorpromazine and thioridazine groups, three patients had gastrointestinal symptoms within 48 hours, lasting one to eight days. One patient on chlorprothixene, 450 mg. daily, experienced symptoms for six days. Perphenazine withdrawal produced no such symptoms. Thioridazine has little antiemetic action but perphenazine is prescribed for vomiting; hence it seems unlikely that the reported symptoms are due to a rebound action on the vomiting centre.These findings are relevant to the situation of withdrawal of ataractics prior to administration of anesthetics and to drug studies involving cross-over from an active compound to a placebo. The increasing use of ataractics suggests that this additional diagnostic possibility should be considered in the presence of obscure gastrointestinal symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The accidental or intentional release of plutonium or americium can cause acute and long term adverse health effects if they enter the human body by ingestion, inhalation, or injection. These effects can be prevented by rapid removal of these radionuclides by chelators such as calcium or zinc diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (calcium or zinc DTPA). These compounds have been shown to be efficacious in enhancing the elimination of members of the actinide family particularly plutonium and americium when administered intravenously or by nebulizer. The efficacy and adverse effects profile depend on several factors that include the route of internalization of the actinide, the type, and route time of administration of the chelator, and whether the calcium or zinc salt of DTPA is used. Current and future research efforts should be directed at overcoming limitations associated with the use of these complex drugs by using innovative methods that can enhance their structural and therapeutic properties. Keywords: Actinide, americium, chelation, contamination, DTPA, plutonium, radionuclide, transuranics, Transuranic elements, zinc diethylenetriaminepentaacetate, nebulizer, therapeutic properties.",

      "abstract": "Characteristics of three different calcium antagonist groups: Most important calcium antagonists used to treat cardiovascular disease belong to one of three main groups, phenylalkylamines, dihydropyridines and benzothiazepines. The best known drug in each group is verapamil, nifedipine and diltiazem, respectively. Dihydropyridines are predominantly vasodilators, with little or no primary cardiac activity; the tachycardia . caused by these compounds is a reflex phenomenon. Verapamil and related drugs are also vasodilators, with an additional depressant effect on atrioventricular conduction, heart rate and contractility. Diltiazem's pharmacodynamic profile and side effects may be considered as intermediate between those of the dihydropyridines and verapamil. Characteristics of new calcium antagonists: Several new calcium antagonists have been introduced in the last few years, virtually all dihydropyridines. Compared with the older generation of calcium antagonists these newer drugs tend to have (1) a longer duration of action; (2) some selectivity for a specific vascular bed, such as resistance, coronary, renal or cerebral vessels; (3) a potentially useful extra component, such as diuretic or anti-atherogenic activity. Newer calcium antagonists described in this review: The newer compounds briefly characterized in this review are amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, lacidipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine and nitrendipine. New slow-release formulations are also discussed. There is a particular emphasis on lacidipine and its potential for cardiovascular drug therapy.",

Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors treat erectile dysfunction by selectively inhibiting the nitric oxide–cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway. Tadalafil is a unique phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor that has a long period of responsiveness – up to 36 h. Additionally, the absorption of tadalafil is not affected by a high-fat meal. These characteristics may give couples freedom in timing their sexual activity. Tadalafil is safe and effective for improving erectile function in both general and special populations. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events are generally mild or moderate in severity and include headache, flushing or dyspepsia. Tadalafil may cause mild vasodilation; it should not be given concomitantly with organic nitrates or α-blockers, except for tamsulosin (0.4 mg once daily).",

      "title": "Suspected drug reaction with piperacillin/tazobactam, in a premature infant",
      "abstract": "Drug-induced reactions are not well described in paediatric literature, less so in the newborn [1]. Piperacillin/tazobactam is a combination of an extended-spectrum penicillin, piperacillin and the α-lactamase inhibitor tazobactam commonly marketed by Wyeth (Maidenhead, UK) under the trade name Tazocin® or Zosyn®[2]. This broad spectrum antibiotic is used by neonatalogists to treat sepsis as a second- or third-line antibiotic. There are no reported data of skin reactions as a result of piperacillin/tazobactam in neonatal literature [3, 4]. In adults, the most commonly reported adverse events in clinical trials of piperacillin/tazobactam plus an aminoglycoside have included diarrhoea (17.6%), fever (2.7%), vomiting (2.7%), urinary tract infection (2.7%) and rash (2.3%). Piperacillin/tazobactam, like other penicillins, can also cause reversible agranulocytosis [2, 5]. A 27 + 4-week male infant weighing 0.936 kg was born vaginally to a 16-year-old primigravida following onset of premature labour. There was no evidence of chorioamnionitis. The baby was transferred ex utero to our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit soon after delivery. One dose of steroid had been given 6 h before the delivery and one dose of curosurf at birth. His Apgar score at 5 min was 8. He was extubated on the second day onto continuous positive airway pressure. He developed a septic illness when he was 26 days old and required re-ventilation. He was started on piperacillin/tazobactam (90 mg kg−1 12 hourly) and gentamycin 4 mg kg−1 once a day, as previous skin swabs had grown lactose fermenting coliforms. After his first two doses of piperacillin/tazobactam the baby developed a peeling exanthema mainly involving his hands and soles of his feet, which later spread to involve the rest of his body to a lesser degree. The piperacillin/tazobactam was stopped in favour of meropenem after 48 h because of the possibility that this was a drug reaction. No staphylococcus was isolated from any skin or blood cultures. During this episode, his blood pressure was stable and no inotropes were needed. At the same time, he developed a coagulopathy associated with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia managed with transfusions of platelets, blood and plasma. After stopping the piperacillin/tazobactam, the skin condition improved over the following week; he developed generalized exfoliation revealing normal underlying skin. Drug reactions are rarely described in the neonatal literature. In adult literature, piperacillin/tazobactam has been described to cause a dermatological reaction. We report a case of a 27-week infant who was treated with piperacillin/tazobactam for a septic episode, following which he developed a severe exanthema and agranulocytosis. Although staphylococcal scalded skin was a differential diagnosis in our patient, we failed to isolate any staphylococcus from blood or surface (including nose) swabs. It is important to consider drug reactions in neonatology where the use of antibiotics is rife. As there are scant safety and efficacy data for use of many drugs used in neonatology, there is a need to be suspicious of skin reactions in neonates, as these may be due to drugs. We would encourage neonatologists to consider adverse drug reactions and report them in order to gain more information on this topic.",

      "abstract": "Lenalidomide is a lead therapeutic in multiple myeloma and deletion 5q myelodysplastic syndromes and shows promising activities in other hematologic malignancies. This article presents a comprehensive review of the clinical pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of lenalidomide. Oral lenalidomide is rapidly and highly absorbed (>90 % of dose) under fasting conditions. Food affects oral absorption, reducing area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) by 20 % and maximum concentration (C max) by 50 %. The increase in AUC and C max is dose proportional, and interindividual variability in plasma exposure is low to moderate. Lenalidomide distributes into semen but is undetectable 3 days after stopping treatment. Biotransformation of lenalidomide in humans includes chiral inversion, trivial hydroxylation, and slow non-enzymatic hydrolysis. Approximately 82 % of an oral dose is excreted as lenalidomide in urine within 24 h. Lenalidomide has a short half-life (3–4 h) and does not accumulate in plasma upon repeated dosing. Its pharmacokinetics are consistent across patient populations, regardless of the type of hematologic malignancy. Renal function is the only important factor affecting lenalidomide plasma exposure. Lenalidomide has no QT prolongation risk at approved doses, and higher plasma exposure to lenalidomide is associated with increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Despite being a weak substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro, lenalidomide does not have clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with P-gp substrates/inhibitors in controlled studies. The AUC-matched dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment at the start of therapy. No dose adjustment for lenalidomide is needed on the basis of age, ethnicity, mild hepatic impairment, or drug–drug interactions.",

METHODSA questionnaire-based survey was conducted among 200 patients who required the administration of inferior alveolar nerve block for their dental treatment.This questionnaire contained basic information about Phentolamine Mesylate drug along with six questions where the patient was asked as to whether or not he / she was willing to take this drug for reversal of the effect of local anaesthesia and specific reason for its usage. RESULTSAmong 200 patients, 122 patients wanted to reverse the effect of local anaesthesia by the use of the phentolamine mesylate drug.Amongst these patients, 93 wanted to take the drug orally initially and upon informing that the injection will be given in the previously anaesthetized area, 91 patients preferred to take an injection of the drug. CONCLUSIONSMajority of patients surveyed in this study wanted to reverse the effect of local anaesthesia by taking phentolamine mesylate drug.However, there is a need to increase the awareness of the type of drug used and the importance of administration of the same.",

In 9 male volunteers in vivo diamine oxidase inhibition was investigated after taking 100 mg sildenafil (Viagra).Sildenafil citrate did not inhibit placental diamine oxidase either in vitro or in vivo. However, infusion of 300 mg of cimetidine inhibited diamine oxidase activity by 27 +/- 7% 15 min after infusion, demonstrating that drugs may inhibit diamine oxidase in vivo.As side effects of sildenafil are not caused due to inhibition of diamine oxidase, sildenafil citrate seems to be harmless for patients suffering from histamine intolerance.",

It is a safe and efficacious single agent for inducing remission and producing therapeutic benefit in patients with mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC) (2 or 4 g/day) or Crohn's disease (4 g/day), as well as for significantly enhancing quality of life for patients with mild to moderately active UC (2 or 4 g/day). It is also effective for maintaining remission in patients with quiescent UC and Crohn's disease (4 g/day). Disease location (left-sided UC or pancolitis) did not affect the agent's effect in active disease or maintaining remission. Fewer treatment-related adverse events were reported with mesalamine than with placebo in treating UC. In the treatment of active Crohn's disease, data showed no statistically significant differences in response for patients with ileitis, ileocolitis, or Crohn's colitis.

      "abstract": "(1) Several classes of antidepressants are available. The main difference between these classes is in their short-term pharmacological effects, leading to different patterns of adverse effects. Some antidepressants, especially tricyclics, have positive risk-benefit balances in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. (2) Duloxetine, a compound chemically related to fluoxetine, appears to have a short-term mechanism of action similar to that of venlafaxine. In the European Union, duloxetine was first approved for female urinary stress incontinence. Another brand of duloxetine has since been marketed for depression and neuropathic pain in diabetic patients. (3) Duloxetine at a dose of 60 mg once a day showed moderate efficacy in 2 placebo-controlled trials. At this dose, however, there are no other comparative trials. It is therefore not possible to know whether duloxetine is as effective as other antidepressants. (4) Two placebo-controlled trials involving patients with pain due to diabetic neuropathy concluded that a dose of 60 mg/day had efficacy, although of doubtful clinical relevance. In the absence of comparative trials, however, we do not know if this efficacy is even equivalent to that of a tricyclic antidepressant used as an analgesic. (5) In fibromyalgia, a controversial clinical diagnosis, two double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving 207 and 354 patients failed to prove that duloxetine had tangible analgesic efficacy. It is therefore appropriate that this use is not mentioned in the \"Indications\" section of the summary of product characteristics (SPC). (6) The assessment of duloxetine in depression and neuropathic pain confirms existing data on its gastrointestinal, neuropsychological and hepatic adverse effects. In these trials, duloxetine increased blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. (7) Duloxetine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP 1A2 and CYP 2D6, creating an important risk of interactions with other drugs. (8) In practice, duloxetine currently has no place in the treatment of depression or diabetic neuropathy. Its efficacy has not yet been demonstrated to be even equivalent to that of other available drugs, and it has too many adverse effects, given this degree of uncertainty.",

Notably, these adverse events resolved completely shortly after discontinuation of treatment. This case highlights a rare and potentially debilitating adverse reaction and underscores the critical importance of clinical judgement when prescribing off-label medicines in the paediatric population.",

      "abstract": "Rapidly progressive deafness in healthy young persons is very unusual. We recently encountered two young patients who experienced profound bilateral hearing loss developing over a few weeks. Known primary causes of hearing loss were excluded. There was no response in either patient to high-dose oral prednisone. Both patients were addicted to high doses of hydrocodone in combination with acetaminophen. Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic narcotic analgesic that is chemically similar to codeine but more potent on a milligram basis and with greater addiction potential.1 Deafness has been reported in association with high doses of propoxyphene, a similar compound.2-4 We subsequently became aware of an abstract describing acute hearing loss in six other southern California patients abusing hydrocodone, suggesting that this is more than a random association.5 Hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Vicodin [Knoll Pharmaceutical Company, Mount Olive, NJ] and others) is a commonly used recreational drug in the Los Angeles area, but an association with hearing loss is not well known.\n\nPatient 1. A 34-year-old woman was addicted to Vicodin, which was originally started for migraine headaches. She adopted a regimen of 15 tablets (5 mg hydrocodone/500 ng acetaminophen) four times per day. …",

Les premieres etudes de pharmacocinetique clinique suggerent l'hypothese d'une non-linearite pour des doses elevees de la gamme 25-400 mg. L'administration de 14c-milnacipran chez l'homme demontre une resorption intense, une elimination urinaire importante et un metabolisme reduit. La liaison aux proteines plasmatiques est faible et non saturable. L'effet de premier passage intestinal et/ou hepatique est limite, et la secretion renale du produit inchange est elevee. Une seconde etude clinique (25-200 mg) infirme l'hypothese de non-linearite. Les concentrations plasmatiques maximales et les surfaces sur les courbes sont correlees aux doses administrees. Aucun autre parametre cinetique n'est lie a la dose. L'administration de fortes doses de milnacipran chez le rat provoque une dose-dependance par saturation du metabolisme. Chez l'homme, ces voies metaboliques sont peu ou pas empruntees, et une saturation de la secretion tubulaire serait l'origine eventuelle d'une non-linearite de la cinetique. Enfin, le milnacipran et/ou ses metabolites suivent un cycle gastro-enterique et un cycle entero-hepatique chez le rat.

      "title": "A REVIEW OF KETAMINE ABUSE AND DIVERSION",
      "abstract": "Ketamine was discovered in the 1960s and released for public use in 1970. Originally developed as a safer alternative to phencyclidine, ketamine is primarily used in clinical settings for analgesia and sedation. In recent years, other uses have been developed, including pain management and treatment of asthma and depression. Clinical use of ketamine causes dissociation and emergence delirium. These effects have led to recreational abuse. Although death from direct pharmacologic effects appears rare, the disinhibition and altered sensory perceptions caused by ketamine puts users at risk of environmental harm. Ketamine has also been implicated in nonconsensual sexual intercourse. Data continue to build that chronic ketamine use may lead to morbidity. Impairment of memory and persistent dissociative, depressive, and delusional thinking has also been reported with long-term use. Lower urinary tract symptoms, including cystitis have been described. Gastric and hepatic pathology have also been noted, including abnormal liver function tests, choledochal cysts and dilations of the common bile duct. S-ketamine, an enantiomer in racemic ketamine, has been shown to be hepatotoxic in vitro. Abstinence from ketamine may reduce the adverse effects of chronic use and is considered the mainstay of treatment. Specialized urine drug testing may be required to detect use, as not all point of care urine drug screens include ketamine.",

      "abstract": "Fluropyrimidines have been a cornerstone in cancer management for the past five decades. The prototype pyrimidine analog, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), interferes with pyrimidine biosynthesis and, consequently, with the synthesis and function of nucleic acids leading to tumor growth arrest and regression (1). Consistent with its ubiquitous mechanism of action, 5-FU is active against a variety of solid tumors, including breast and colorectal cancer (2,3). 5-FU proved effective in both the adjuvant and palliative settings when used alone or in combination with other treatment modalities (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy). Owing its incomplete and unpredictable oral absorption, 5-FU must be administered by intravenous infusion, although patients prefer oral over intravenous palliative chemotherapy (4). Continuous infusion of 5-FU is associated with complications due to use of indwelling vascular devices or pumps, and with severe dose-limiting gastrointestinal toxicities such as stomatitis, diarrhea, and mucosal ulceration. Myelosuppression can occur with bolus-dose regimens (5). Limitations of 5-FU have prompted the development of several oral fluoropyrimidines. The first to obtain FDA’s approval is capecitabine (N4-pentyloxycarbonyl-5′-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine; Xeloda®, Roche Laboratories, Inc.) (Fig. 1).",

      "title": "Molecule of the Month",
      "abstract": "Pharmaceutical aphrodisia. Almost a decade ago, 43% of women and 31% of men in the United States were believed to suffer from one form or another of sexual dysfunction [1]. Viagra™ and other phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have provided viable pharmacological treatment options for men over the past decade. However, these drugs lack efficacy in women, and similarly successful drug treatments for female sexual dysfunction have yet to emerge [2]. Furthermore, despite the high efficacy and widespread tolerability of PDE inhibitors in men, these drugs are not without drawbacks. Headache and vision-related side effects are present in some individuals, and these drugs are contraindicated in patients concurrently taking nitrates or related drugs that may carry hypotension risks [3]. Additionally, it is estimated that half of men prescribed sildenafil (Viagra™) subsequently cease use over time [4]. Bremelanotide (formerly PT-141), a drug currently under development by Palatin Technologies [5], could prove a novel and effective treatment for female and male sexual dysfunction. The main reason underlying the drug ’ s potential efficacy in both sexes lies in its CNS-acting mechanism. Bremelanotide is a cyclic heptapeptide melanocortin analog, which acts as an agonist at the primarily CNS-expressed melanocortin receptors, MC3-R and MC4-R [6, 7]. The mechanism by which melanocortin receptor activation mediates sexual arousal and behavior is not well established; however, it likely involves an increase in nitric oxide signaling in the CNS [7]. Central activation of the melanocortin receptors by known agonist such as alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) causes increased sexual arousal and mating behavior in animals [8]. Likewise, the synthetic melanocortin analog Melanotan-II, which is structurally similar to Bremelanotide (and is the parent compound from which the latter was derived), induces penile erection in men suffering from erectile dysfunction (ED) [9]. Rodent and non-human primate studies demonstrate a potent erection-promoting effect of Bremelanotide [10]. Women with female sexual arousal disorder given Bremelanotide (by intranasal delivery) report significantly increased sexual desire after treatment, as well as more satisfaction with their level of arousal when attempting intercourse within 24 hours [11]. In both normal and ED men, treatment with Bremelanotide causes significant increases in erectile activity, in a dose-dependant manner [10]. Clinically and statistically effective doses of the drug (up to 20mg) are safe and well tolerated by both normal and ED patients [12]. Having completed all Phase II trials in men with promising results, Bremelanotide is set to enter Phase III for men in the first half of this year. In women, positive data from a Phase IIa trial and the recent commencement of a Phase IIb trial suggest that entry to Phase III for women may also be on the horizon. If approved, Bremelanotide would be the first FDA-approved synthetic aphrodisiac. This novel therapy could potentially address the substantial need for an effective female sexual dysfunction treatment as well as offer an alternative to traditional PDE inhibition in ED men.

      "abstract": "An episode of the common cold can have a significant negative impact on quality of life, mood, and daily activities. In line with this fact, there is a growing demand for health care and treatments associated with the common cold. Current treatments aim to (1) inhibit symptom severity and (2) shorten the duration of an episode of the common cold. These products include analgesics, antihistamines, and decongestants. In addition, various supplements, including vitamins, minerals, and herbs, are marketed to treat the common cold. The current products marketed for treating the common cold may reduce the severity of some (but not all) common cold symptoms, but they usually do not shorten the common cold episode. The recent indication that phenylephrine is not effective means that it will ultimately need to be removed from the over-the-counter monograph. Manufacturers will consequently need to reformulate their products and withdraw oral phenylephrine-containing products. Several newly developed common cold products are currently under investigation. These clinical trials should evaluate their efficacy and safety, as there remains a clear need for common cold products that significantly reduce both the symptom severity and the duration of episodes of the common cold.",

This is especially a problem in terminally ill patients who require higher-than-usual doses or more frequent drug administration than usual. Thus, oral administration of narcotic analgesics becomes desirable. However, effective oral narcotic analgesic therapy is difficult to achieve, primarily for the following two reasons: (1) the relative scarcity of oral dosage forms of potent narcotic analgesics, and (2) the poor bioavailability of these drugs on oral administration. One possible solution to these problems has been to use oral liquid combinations, such as the Brompton cocktail (morphine, cocaine, ethanol, and chloroform). However, this \"shotgun\" approach is unnecessary and undesirable when the same results could be obtained with other simpler preparations. Furthermore, the efficacy of oral cocaine is suspect, and its commercial availability",

Duloxetine, a potent reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and noradrenaline, is effective for the treatment of major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). Duloxetine is safe and well-tolerated across indications, with few reported serious side effects. Common adverse events are consistent with the pharmacology of the molecule and are mainly referable to the gastrointestinal and the nervous systems. Duloxetine should not be used in combination with CYP 1A2 inhibitors or nonselective, irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Duloxetine has a generally favorable side effect profile and dosing is simple. Nausea is the most common side effect, but it occurs less frequently if treatment is initiated at 30 mg . day-1 and titrated after one week to 60 mg . day-1, an efficacious dosage at which pain relief can occur within one week. Clinical trials have demonstrated the analgesic efficacy of duloxetine for PDN and fibromyalgia in addition to improvements in quality-of-life measurements. Furthermore trials for osteoarthritis, headache, and the pain associated with Parkinson disease may provide insight into alternative uses for duloxetine.",

Buspirone appears to cause less clinically significant impairment in cognition or motor performance, is less likely to potentiate the effects of brain depressants like alcohol, has little if any abuse liability, and produces no clinically identifiable physical abstinence syndrome when discontinued after long-term administration.

      "abstract": "The word “doping” is derived from the Dutch word “dopen”, used by the Dutch migrants in Southern Africa for the first time. Doping substances are mainly used to increase the performance, delay or remove the exhaustion, increase the stability and the frequency of the training, ease/prevent the anxiety and excitement affecting the overall performance, inhibition of pain (muscle, joint, tendon etc) which would eventually affect the speed and the movement, harmonization of locomotor system (musculoskeletal system) with better performance and even hide/tarnish the identification of the subtance (drugs) screened in urine/blood samples. Doping administrations are intentional; where stimulants, analgesics, opioids, anabolics, 2-adrenergic compounds, expectorants-mucolytics, diuretics, glycocorticoids and many other substances are mainly used. Some of these compounds are found naturaly (boldenon, estranediole, hydrocortizone, carbondioxide, testosterone), some in their feed/crude feed (dimethylsulfoxide, methoxityramine, salicillic acid) and even some are found coincidental (arsenic, cobalt). Doping is a deception, where it thwarts the fair play, equal chance, competition elements, social values and impeaches the reputation and respectability and even contravenes the national and international legislations. Doping, disrupts the physiology and health of the animal and may cause permenant changes in the musculoskeletal system which would eventually shorten the racing period of the horses and cause sudden death. Dissuasive and serious regulations are introduced by national/international organizations, including our country, regarding the prevention of the use of doping including the penalties (administrative, juridical, monetary) given to individuals (involved in the care, feding and training) and the horse involved in the violations. In this article, the basic information including definition of doping, prohibited- and controlled-medicinal substances and restrictive/preventive rules would be addressed.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Lower abdominal surgeries are one of the most frequently performed surgeries in the pediatric age group.A large number of these operations are done as day-care procedures.Caudal block is one of the most common regional anesthetic techniques in children being used to supplement general anesthesia for a wide variety of sacral-segment surgery.The local anesthetics currently in use are safe and their pharmacological effects have been well evaluated.There is no fear of neurological sequelae as in the past.Several studies have demonstrated that Clonidine added to the local anesthetic in caudal block both enhances and prolongs the analgesia produced by the block without the unpleasant or hazardous sideeffects associated with the use of other adjuvant drugs like opioids, epinephrine and some newer adjuvants like neostigmine and dexmedetomidine.Our study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of single-dose caudal epidural Clonidine in prolonging the post-operative analgesia when mixed with Bupivacaine in children. Materials and MethodsSixty children of ASA I and ASA II physical status, between 1 and 12 years of age, who underwent elective lower abdominal surgeries, were randomly divided into two groups B (N=30) and C (N=30).All the children were administered general anesthesia.After induction, a single-shot caudal block was administered using 0.25% Bupivacaine (group B) and 1.5 mg/kg of Clonidine hydrochloride (group C).Vital monitoring was done intraoperatively as per institutional protocol.Post-operative monitoring was done in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) for 2-3 hours and in the ward for next 24 hours.Data with respect to duration of surgery, duration of pain-free period, time to void and any other complications was compiled.The final results of the study were tabulated and analyzed for significance using standard statistical techniques (unpaired t-test).",

These were mainly related to the subcutaneous use of the compound. <h3>EVALUATION OF PROCAINE IN THE LITERATURE</h3> Eggleston and Hatcher<sup>2</sup>in 1916 and 1919, working with cats, reported that toxic effects of procaine were in direct proportion to the rate of introduction of the drug into the blood stream. They found that the injection of a sublethal dose produced an abrupt fall in blood pressure (believed to be due to cardiac effect) and cessation of respiration, followed by brief but severe clonic convulsions. This sublethal dose could be repeated with procaine in twenty minute periods without evidence of accumulation. Also, continuous intravenous administration of the compound",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Inhaled steroids such as fluticasone propionate and beclomethasone dipropionate play an important role in the treatment of bronchial asthma. Its usage facilitates disease control in asthmatic patients, resulting in improved quality of life. Because of its benefit, the inhaled steroid is used extensively, at higher doses and for longer duration. However, the localized effects of inhaled corticosteroids on oral/laryngeal mucosa, such as fungal infections can be problematic. Case Report: We report a case of oropharyngeal and laryngeal candidiasis following a long period and high doses of inhaled steroid in a 42-year-old male. He presented with a complaint of increasing tiredness, phlegm, intermittent wheezing and hoarseness for 2-3 months. There was no weight loss or loss of appetite. He has been using inhaled steroids and long acting bronchodilators in increasing doses for his claimed ‘wheezing’ despite the negative history of asthma. The inhaled steroids were fluticasone dipropionate at doses of 500-100 mcg daily for 2-3 months. Results: Examination revealed widespread oral thrush involving the oral cavity, oropharynx and larynx. There was no cushingoid habitus. His muscle power was of 5/5 bilaterally and his lungs were clear. Lung function and chest film were also normal. The steroid was stopped immediately and flucanozole and nystatin syrup were prescribed. The patient made an uneventful and complete recovery. Conclusion: We conclude that patients on inhaled corticosteroids should be monitored for local side effects. Physicians should be aware not only of the systemic but also of the local side effects of inhaled corticosteroids. Patients may increase doses without the knowledge of their physicians and subsequently suffer the adverse effects either local or systemic.",

      "title": "Treatment and management of Wilson's disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder related to the copper metabolism. The clinical symptoms are due to copper deposition in various tissues, including liver, brain, kidney, cornea and others. The key strategy of treatment is to reduce the amount of copper in the liver and other tissues by administering both copper-chelating agents and a low copper diet. D-Penicillamine is considered to be the first choice as a copper-chelating agent. Patients require 15–25 mg/kg daily in the early stages of treatment and this drug should also be given more than 2 h before meals. Some undesirable or serious side-effects, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and nephrotic syndrome, do occur in 20–25% of all patients. In such cases, trienthylene tetramine (trientine) appears to be as effective as penicillamine. This drug is usually used when D-penicillamine has to be withdrawn. It is also sometimes administered to patients with neurological symptoms as a first-choice drug. It is given in doses of 40–50 mg/kg daily, in the same manner as for D-penicillamine. Zinc salt administration has also emerged as an interesting supportive therapy for both treatments. A dose of 5–7.5 mg/kg daily is given before meals. The copper content of the diet should be less than 1 mg/day in the early stages of treatment. Thereafter, it can be increased to 1.0–1.5 mg/day during well-controlled periods. Liver transplantation is now performed in many countries for patients with either the fulminant or chronic progressive types of Wilson's disease.",

In numerous studies, delmopinol showed a plaque inhibitory potential. However, due to the lower efficacy and side effects similar to those of chlorhexidine, at present, delmopinol cannot be considered as an alternative to chlorhexidine. A long-term utilization of delmopinol in addition to the regular mechanical plaque control might be possible.

      "abstract": "Risperidone and ziprasidone are commonly used as first line drugs for the treatment of psychotic disorders and overdose with these agents is increasingly being reported. Relatively few of these reports have involved co-ingestion of multiple psychotropic agents. We report a case of overdose with risperidone, ziprasidone, valproate, trihexyphenidyl and clonazepam in a 25 years female, who recovered uneventfully with supportive management. Notwithstanding the benign outcome in this instance, age, co-ingested drugs, active metabolites and medical co-morbidity are critical issues in overdose with atypical antipsychotics. As prescription of these drugs continues to increase in developing countries, systematic studies evaluating their clinical toxicity and management are necessary. The issues associated with overdose of multiple psychotropic agents and appropriate management policies are highlighted.",

      "abstract": "The opioids vary greatly in addictive potential, from the highly addictive such as heroin to the opioid antagonists such as naltrexone, which can be used to treat opioid dependence and overdose. The various opioid compounds have different euphorigenic properties and also produce withdrawl syndromes of distinct patterns of duration and intensity. Dependence liability is affected by both the pleasure-seeking motives for initating drug use and the painful consequencyes of abstinence or withdrawl. Detoxification, which takes 7-10 days for the short-acting opioids, is usually the first stage in treatment. Methadone is often used as a preliminary stage in detoxification, but some patients are maintained on methadone for years, since it allows them to lead relatively normal lives. Non-opioid drugs used to control withdrawl include clonidine. After detoxification, naltrexone, a long-acting opioid antagonist, can be administered orally to prevent relapse.",

      "title": "The Roentgen Appearance of Injected Silicone in the Breast",
      "abstract": "Although the use of silicone injections for purposes of breast augmentation is illegal at this time (2), the practice appears to be widespread. The roentgen appearance of injected silicone in the breast may, at times, simulate that of neoplasm. Because of a rather characteristic appearance of some of these breasts, we believe the following report of several patients may be of value. Whereas previously utilized materials such as paraffin, petrolatum, and vegetable oils evoked a severe foreign-body response when injected subcutaneously, the liquid silicones in pure form are relatively inert and cause little inflammation or fibrosis. It was this property that led to the use of the material for cosmetic correction, not only in the breast, but also in the face. This discussion, however, will be limited to the use of silicone injections in the breast. Silicones are the long-chained polymers of dimethyl siloxane and may be liquid, resin, or solid, depending upon the length of the chain (5). Because injection of silicone substances into the breast is illegal, information was not obtainable regarding the type or quantity used in most of our patients. The material is injected serially, and the amount given at any one time may well influence the subsequent roentgen appearance. Migration or drift of the injected silicone in its pure form is said to be prevented by encapsulation of the injected material (4). Kagan (3) stated, however, that unadulterated silicone fluid, when injected, does not remain in situ, but tends to migrate into dependent areas. According to Kagan, this tendency has apparently been overcome by the Japanese investigator, Sakurai, by the incorporation of 1 per cent animal and vegetable fatty acids into the silicone fluid. After subcutaneous injection, this mixture is said to invoke a mild tissue response, resulting in encapsulation of the silicone material. Most of our patients noted a diminution in the size of their breasts several months to two years after injection. The reason for this reduction is not known with certainty. A possible explanation is that the silicone material migrated from the breast into the chest wall and abdominal soft tissues. Roentgen Appearance The roentgen density of Medical Fluid 360 is greater than that of water (Fig. 1). Medical Fluid 360 is a pure preparation that has been investigated extensively in animal work and has been widely applied clinically (4). We have noted two distinct roentgen patterns on mammograms of patients who received silicone injections. The most frequent appearance was that in which the injected silicone tended to collect in small-to-moderate-size nodules (Figs. 2, 3, and 4). The margins of these ovoid masses were sharply defined, simulating the appearance of benign breast masses, such as cysts or fibroadenomata.",

Indapamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase enzyme. Transdermal drug delivery systems, as compared to their corresponding classical oral or injectable dosage form counterparts, offer many advantages. The most important advantages are improved systemic bioavailability of the pharmaceutical active ingredients (PAI), because the first-pass metabolism by the liver and digestive system are avoided; and the controlled, constant drug delivery profile (that is, controlled zero-order absorption). Also of importance is the reduced dose frequency compared to the conventional oral dosage forms (that is, once-a-day, twice-a-week or once-a-week). Other benefits include longer duration of therapeutic action from a single application, and reversible action. For example, patches can be removed to reverse any adverse effects that may be caused by overdosing. In order to evaluate the effects of vehicles and penetration enhancers on skin permeation of Indapamide, the skin permeation rates of Indapamide from vehicles of different composition were determined using Franz cells fitted with excised hairless skins. Solubility of Indapamide in various solvents was investigated to select a vehicle suitable for the percutaneous absorption of Indapamide, The solvents used were Tween80, Tween20, Labrasol, Lauroglycol90 (LG90) and Peceol. Lauroglycol90 increase the permeability of indapamide approximately 3.75-fold compared with the control. Tween80, Tween20, Labrasol, Lauroglycol90 (LG90) and Peceol showed flux of , respectively.",

      "abstract": "Most drugs targeted to the respiratory tract are used for their local action. For example, ephidrine for nasal decongestion, beta-2 agonists for bronchodilatation, and inhaled steroids to suppress the inflammation seen in asthmatic airways. Since the drug is delivered directly to its required site, only a small quantity is needed for an adequate therapeutic response, and consequently there is a low incidence of systemic side effects compared with oral or intravenous administration. More recently, it has become apparent that the lining of the respiratory tract, from nasal mucosa to airways and alveoli, may be used for the absorption of a drug for its systemic effect. This route of administration may be particularly attractive if it avoids the metabolic destruction encountered when some drugs are administered by alternative routes (for instance, peptides and proteins are rapidly destroyed by peptidases when Oven by the oral route). If there is a lack ofclinical response to an aerosolized drug, it is important to question whether the drug has failed or whether delivery to the site of action is inadequate. To deliver therapeutic agents by inhalation to the lower respiratory tract, inhaled drug particles must have appropriate aerodynamic characteristics. In addition, the anatomy and pathophysiology of the patient's respiratory tract, mode of inhalation through the inhaler, and the characteristics of the inhalational device itself, may significantly affect drug deposition.",

However, more recent clinical studies suggest that mecamylamine is effective at much lower doses for blocking the central and peripheral effects of nicotine. Pharmacologically, mecamylamine has been well characterized as a nonselective and noncompetitive antagonist of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Because mecamylamine easily crosses the blood – brain barrier at relatively low doses (2.5 – 10 mg), it has been used by several research groups over the past two decades investigating the role of central nAChRs in the etiology and treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including addiction disorders, Tourette's syndrome, schizophrenia and various cognitive and mood disorders. Two independent Phase II clinical trials recently confirmed mecamylamine's hypothesized antidepressant activity and suggest that it may be effective as an augmentation pharmacotherapy for SSRI treatment resistant major depression. These areas of investigation for mecamylamine are reviewed and recommendations for future research directions are proposed.",

Intestinal gas–related symptoms and conditions that predispose affected patients to intestinal gas formation are common and may be associated with considerable discomfort and lifestyle impairment. The most frequent clinical manifestations are eructation (belching of swallowed air), bloating (uncomfortable fullness, often with abdominal distention, particularly after eating), and flatulence (excessive passage of air from the stomach or intestines through the anus). Differentiation of temporary symptoms from a chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder or condition such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), lactose intolerance, or celiac disease is important in recommending appropriate nonprescription treatment. The primary categories of nonprescription pharmacologic agents for intestinal gas are antiflatulence medications (simethicone, activated charcoal), digestive enzymes (lactase replacement and α-galactosidase products), and probiotic products (containing Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Saccharomyces, or Streptococcus thermophilus or other species, alone or in combination).",

      "abstract": "The newer tetracyclines are defined as those tetracyclines available in the United States but not approved for veterinary use. These include demeclocycline, methacycline, doxycycline, and minocycline. Of these, doxycycline and minocycline appear to offer advantages that would render them useful in certain situations in veterinary medicine. Their major advantage lies in their greater lipid solubility relative to other tetracyclines. This characteristic probably accounts for their enhanced antimicrobial effectiveness for some organisms, more efficient absorption after oral administration, and enhanced distribution in the body. The principal excretory organ for doxycycline is the intestine, where the drug diffuses through the intestinal mucosa into the intestinal tract. This unique characteristic makes this drug useful in cases of preexisting renal dysfunction and may render this drug superior to other tetracyclines in the treatment of intestinal infections. Doxycycline is used in other countries for respiratory tract and intestinal tract diseases of poultry. The usefulness of doxycycline and minocycline in food-producing animals may be limited because of persistent drug residues. Minocycline has, in large doses, been used with streptomycin in the elimination of the carrier state of canine brucellosis. The superiority of doxycycline and minocycline, relative to other tetracyclines, in their distribution to areas of he body such as the eye, brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and prostate gland suggests that trials of their efficacy in tetracycline-sensitive infections of these areas are indicated. Pharmacokinetic studies designed to determine optimal dosage schedules have not been made for domestic animals. These determinations are necessary to evaluate most effectively the usefulness of the newer tetracyclines in veterinary medicine.",

      "abstract": "Summary Weak organic acids possessing anti‐inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties — commonly known as aspirin‐like drugs — have been used in equine medicine for almost 100 years. These non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be classified chemically into two groups; the enolic acids such as phenylbutazone and carboxylic acids like flunixin, meclofenamate and naproxen. All NSAIDs have similar and possibly identical modes of action accounting for both their therapeutic and their toxic effects. They block some part of the cyclo‐oxygenase enzyme pathway and thereby suppress the synthesis of several chemical mediators of inflammation, collectively known as eicosanoids. The available evidence indicates that some of the newer NSAIDs have a reasonable safety margin but further studies are required. The toxicity of phenylbutazone in the horse has been investigated very thoroughly in recent years and it has been shown to cause renotoxicity and, most significantly, ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract when relatively high doses are administered. Several factors may predispose towards phenylbutazone toxicity in the horse, including breed and age, but high dosage is considered to be particularly important. The absorption into, and fate within, the body of NSAIDs are considered and particular attention is drawn to the ways in which these pharmacokinetic properties relate to the drugs' toxicity and clinical efficacy. In reviewing current knowledge of the clinical pharmacology of this important group of drugs, it is hoped to provide the clinician with a rational, scientific basis for their safe and effective use in equine practice.",

      "abstract": "Transdermal drug delivery system is a selfcontained delivery system used for topical application in the form of a multilaminated adhesive patch, which delivers a specific dose of drug at a predetermined rate and controls the drug release rate through the skin. This system provides constant drug release and enables continuous delivery of drugs with short biological half-lives, eliminating pulsed entry into the bloodstream. Several drugs that would otherwise degrade in the gastrointestinal tract have been successfully administered via this route. This method is especially beneficial for patients experiencing repeated emesis or dysphagia, who are unable to swallow large amounts of water. In this context, the significance of oral transmucosal drug delivery and its advantages over conventional oral delivery systems has been emphasized. Chronic hyperglycemia, as seen in diabetes, leads to longterm damage and dysfunction of organs, necessitating long-term medication. Metformin, an antihyperglycemic agent for type 2 diabetes, has poor bioavailability (50–60%) and a short biological half-life, requiring frequent high-dose administration. Glibenclamide, another oral hypoglycemic agent, is commonly used as well. This study aims to develop a polymer-based (chitosan) oral disintegrating film system for metformin, overcoming its limitations through improved delivery and bioavailability. The disintegration and bioavailability of these oral thin films (OTFs) are enhanced using superdisintegrants like starch, sodium starch glycolate, and microcrystalline cellulose. This approach offers a rapid, efficient drug delivery method. As diabetes prevalence is expected to rise significantly by 2025, such innovative delivery systems could provide a practical solution for improving therapeutic outcomes.",

Antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, anticholinergics, and alpha agonists can cause xerostomia. (4) The risk of salivary hypo-function increases with polypharmacy and may be especially likely when [greater than or equal to]3 drugs are taken per day. (5) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Among all reported side effects of antidepressants and antipsychotics, dry mouth often is the most prevalent complaint. For example, in a study of 5 antide pressants 35% to 46% of patients reported dry mouth. (6) Rates are similar in users of various antipsychotics. Patients with severe, persistent mental illness often cite side effects as the primary reason for psychotropic noncompliance. (7-9) Few psychiatrists routinely screen patients for xerostomia, and if a patient reports this side effect, they may be unlikely to address it or understand its implications because of more pressing concerns such as psychosis or risk of suicide. Historically, education in general medical training about the effects of oral health on a patient's overall health has been limited. It is crucial for psychiatrists to be aware of potential problems related to dry mouth and the impact it can have on their patients. In this article, we: * describe how dry mouth can impact a patient's oral, medical, and psychiatric health * provide psychiatrists with an understanding of pathology related to xerostomia * explain how psychiatrists can screen for xerostomia * discuss the benefits patients may receive when psychiatrists collaborate with dental clinicians to manage this condition. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Implications of xerostomia Saliva provides a protective function. It is an antimicrobial, buffering, and lubricating agent that aids cleansing and removal of food debris within the mouth. It also helps maintain oral mucosa and reminer-alizing of tooth structure. (10) Psychotropics can affect the amount of saliva secreted and may alter the composition of saliva via their receptor affects on the dual sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations of the salivary glands. When the protective environment produced by saliva is altered, patients may start to develop oral problems before experiencing dryness. A 50% reduction in saliva flow may occur before they become aware of the problem. (12), (13) Patients may not taste food properly, experience cracked lips, or have trouble eating, oral pain, or dentures that no longer fit well. (14) Additionally, oral diseases such as dental decay and periodontal disease (Photos 1 and 2), inflamed soft tissue, and candidiasis (Photo 3) also may occur. (10), (15) Patients may begin to notice dry mouth when they wake at night, which could disrupt sleep. Patients with xe-rostomia can accumulate excessive amounts of plaque on their teeth and the dorsum of the tongue. The increased bacterial count and release of volatile sulfide gases that occur with dry mouth may explain some cases of halitosis. (16), (17) Patients also may have difficulty swallowing or speaking and be unaware of the oral health destruction occurring as a result of reduced saliva. Some experts report oral bacteria levels can skyrocket as much as 10-fold in people who take medications that cause dry mouth. (18) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Infections of the mouth can create havoc elsewhere in the body. The evidence base that establishes an association between periodontal disease and other chronic inflammatory conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis is steadily growing. …",

If the person was being prescribed medicines for any reason, then he/she attempts suicide by taking an overdose of these medicines. If not, they procure sedative-hypnotics (most commonly).

We feel that the gastric irritability (and hence the symptoms) that is commonly seen with overdose of NSAIDs was probably nullified because the patient had also consumed significantly high dose of omeprazole, thus making it an interesting case snippet.",

It inhibits monoamine reuptake by binding to dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin system membrane transporters. Its half life is 50 minutes, and dysphoria—possibly caused by dopamine depletion—may rapidly follow. Twenty per cent of experimenters are said to become regular users. A small “rock” of crack can cost a few pounds. Crack has become widely available on thedrug scene in the past 10years. Its use is said to be linked with violent crime and prostitution.

The patient required multiple interventions, including aspiration and intracavernosal phenylephrine injections, to resolve the condition. The combination of these drugs, which are commonly used for urinary tract symptoms and erectile dysfunction, likely contributed to the priapism by increasing blood flow to the penis and preventing its return to a flaccid state.

We present a unique case report in which a Caucasian patient (an Italian 64-year-old woman) who was undergoing smoking cessation treatment with cytisine, and due to her misunderstanding of the therapeutic indications provided, took twice the recommended dose every day for 8 days, leading to an intake of 54 mg/dl of cytisine for 3 consecutive days. Notwithstanding the high dosage, the patient did not report any adverse reactions. This confirms the safety of the drug, even at high doses, in patients aiming to quit smoking.",

The most frequently used medications are antibiotics, followed by antifungals, analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs, benzodiazepine and topical corticosteroids. Uncritical and inappropriate use of any drug may result in multiple complications at a local and/or systemic level, such as drug resistance or drug interactions.\r\n The objective of this study was to show the use of the drugs prescribed by dental practitioners in the Republic of Croatia in the period from 2014 to 2017.\r\n Data presented in this study were obtained from the reports on the use of prescribed drugs available in the Croatian Health Insurance Institute, the national insurance company.\r\n The results demonstrated that antibiotics were the most frequently prescribed drugs by dentists. Penicillin was the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics, especially amoxicillin with clavulanic acid. Lincosamides were also broadly used antibiotics in dental medicine, especially clindamycin, followed by cephalosporines and metronidazole. Broad-spectrum antibiotics have been used more frequently than narrow-spectrum ones, which ultimately leads to the increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Other most commonly prescribed drugs were anti-infammatory drugs, especially the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, ibuprofen. The results also showed a small increase in prescribing corticosteroids, both for local and systemic use, as well as the increase in antifungals and antiviral medical treatments.\r\n The results of the study indicate that there was an increase in consuming the drugs prescribed by dentists in the period from 2014 to 2017. Antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs were the most frequently prescribed medications. These findings also suggest that there is a need to provide additional education on rational use of drugs in dental practice.",

A decade after its introduction in clinical medicine, its activity in supraventricular and ventricular tachyarrhythmias has been recoqnized (2). Data on the clinical benefits of amiodarone have been accumulating rapidly and consistently, but its acute and chronic toxicological profile is far from adequately understood, possibly because of the lack of systematic studies and the wide range of doses adopted by various authors (400 to 2000 mg/day loading dose; 200-800 mg/day maintenance dose) (3-6).

      "abstract": "Doxycycline is commonly used in respiratory medicine to treat bacterial lower respiratory tract infections and is also a frequent choice in dermatology for various skin conditions. However, neuropsychiatric adverse reactions to doxycycline are rarely documented in the literature. Even less frequently reported is the persistence of such reactions for up to six weeks after discontinuing a 100 mg doxycycline tablet. We present a rare case of doxycycline-induced mania and psychosis in a patient who had taken the antibiotic for only three days, yet experienced severe neuropsychiatric symptoms that lasted for six weeks after treatment cessation. This case highlights the need for further research to identify the underlying mechanisms, high-risk populations, and implications for informed consent and clinical recommendations.",

Treatment is based on the location and activity of the disease. Mesalamine is recommended to induce and maintain remission in patients with mild to moderate nonpenetrating, nonstricturing disease. Antibiotics may be used as an alternative or adjunct to mesalamine; ciprofloxacin and metronidazole are helpful in fistulizing Crohn's disease. For patients with moderate to severe disease, corticosteroids are recommended to induce remission; infliximab is an alternative for those with severe or refractory disease. Remission is then maintained with immunosuppressive therapy, not with corticosteroids. Fistulas are difficult to treat but may respond to antibiotics or azathioprine; however, closure rates are low. Infliximab produces higher closure rates; use azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine to maintain remission in this setting.",

      "title": "Pharmacotherapeutics of the Newer Tetracyclines",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The newer tetracyclines are defined as those tetracyclines available in the United States but not approved for veterinary use. These include demeclocycline, methacycline, doxycycline, and minocycline. Of these, doxycycline and minocycline appear to offer advantages that would render them useful in certain situations in veterinary medicine. Their major advantage lies in their greater lipid solubility relative to other tetracyclines. This characteristic probably accounts for their enhanced antimicrobial effectiveness for some organisms, more efficient absorption after oral administration, and enhanced distribution in the body. The principal excretory organ for doxycycline is the intestine, where the drug diffuses through the intestinal mucosa into the intestinal tract. This unique characteristic makes this drug useful in cases of preexisting renal dysfunction and may render this drug superior to other tetracyclines in the treatment of intestinal infections. Doxycycline is used in other countries for respiratory tract and intestinal tract diseases of poultry. The usefulness of doxycycline and minocycline in food-producing animals may be limited because of persistent drug residues. Minocycline has, in large doses, been used with streptomycin in the elimination of the carrier state of canine brucellosis. The superiority of doxycycline and minocycline, relative to other tetracyclines, in their distribution to areas of the body such as the eye, brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and prostate gland suggests that trials of their efficacy in tetracycline-sensitive infections of these areas are indicated. Pharmacokinetic studies designed to determine optimal dosage schedules have not been made for domestic animals. These determinations are necessary to evaluate most effectively the usefulness of the newer tetracyclines in veterinary medicine.",

      "abstract": "Bladder damage, including cystitis, hematuria, fibrosis and occasionally bladder shrinkage, can occur following chronic administration of certain alkylating agents, notably cyclophosphamide15-17 and ifosfamide.18 The metabolic byproducts of these drugs include the compound acrolein, which is a mucosal irritant. Within the last 20 years, this problem has been largely prevented by the concomitant use of increased hydration during administration of the drugs along with intravenous or oral mercaptoethane sulfonate (Mesna). Mesna binds and inactivates acrolein, preventing it from causing bladder irritation. Currently, most treatment regimens incorporating cyclophosphamide for children with cancer require that it be administered intravenously. Increased hydration to twice maintenance levels or greater can also be given intravenously, which is preferable to relying on oral hydration by the patient. Cyclophosphamide has also been implicated in the development of several histologic varieties of bladder tumors and possibly of renal cell carcinoma.19-23Several chemotherapeutic agents may interact with radiation therapy in such a manner as to increase the effect of the XRT on the irradiated tissues. This augmentation of XRT is most notable when actinomycin D or doxorubicin is given.24-27 Thus, administering either of these agents is contraindicated during the XRT treatment period itself, because the amount of enhancement is not easily quantified, and increased skin and deep tissue damage can result. The phenomenon of ‘radiation recall’ can also occur when either of these drugs is administered after the radiation course has been completed.28 The oncologist is cautioned to consider a modest drug dose reduction when continuing chemotherapy in patients who have previously experienced severe mucositis or other radiation-related acute effects, especially in young children. If tolerated, drug doses can be escalated to the full amount over the next several weeks. There is also an interaction between cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide and bladder irradiation, which can increase the likelihood of hemorrhagic cystitis and subsequent bladder fibrosis. In one review of 110 children who received cyclophosphamide with or without pelvic XRT, the incidence of chronic bladder toxicity (hematuria, fibrosis and dysuria) was 18 per cent in 50 patients who had received both the alkylating agent and pelvic radiation. Only 8 per cent of the 60 patients treated with cyclophosphamide without pelvic irradiation had hematuria, and it was temporary and did not become chronic.29 If overt hemorrhagic cystitis hasoccurred after the patient has received one of these alkylating agents and bladder irradiation, particular care should be taken with subsequent administration of actinomycin D or doxorubicin. Because of the radiation recall effect, severe vesical hemorrhage may take place and require local measures to stop the bleeding and perhaps blood transfusions.",

It has a pleotrophic pharmacology and affects the dopaminergic, serotonergic, muscarinic and adrenergic systems. The therapeutic advantage of recent antipsychotics (so-called atypical antipsychotics) has been attributed to additional serotonergic effects. Clinical studies and trials suggest that olanzapine is comparable or superior to haloperidol and may be superior to risperidone in terms of efficacy and side-effect profiles.The starting dose of olanzapine is a single dose of 10 mg. The drug reaches peak plasma levels in 5-8 h, and has a half-life of about 35h, depending on metabolism. The recommended maximum dose is 20 mg daily, but higher doses have been employed.Abnormalities of the QTC interval on ECG are unlikely to occur and so there is no need for a baseline ECG as with sertindole, which has recently been withdrawn. The most common side-effects are somnolence and weight gain. About 40% of patients in clinical trials gain weight - especially if they are on a high starting dose and if they were underweight pre-treatment. Reported evidence to date suggests that olanzapine is relatively less likely to produce sexual dysfunction. In general, weight gain and sexual dysfunction are of great concern to people taking antipsychotics and the side-effect profile of any antipsychotic may affect compliance. Olanzapine's general efficacy and side-effect profile suggest that, unforeseen post-marketing complications notwithstanding, olanzapine deserves a major place in the first-line management of psychotic disorders.",

      "title": "Routine use of dexamethasone for postoperative nausea and vomiting: the case against",
      "abstract": "Dexamethasone is a synthetic adrenocortical steroid used widely in numerous specialities, including anaesthesia. The expanding number of procedures performed as day cases has led to increasing use of dexamethasone for reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) 1. In addition to PONV, administration of dexamethasone is common for specific surgical procedures to reduce swelling and postoperative pain by reducing the inflammatory response 2. Dexamethasone is regarded by many as an ideal peri-operative agent: cheap; readily available; great for PONV; promotes appetite and a feeling of wellbeing; and associated with earlier discharge from day surgery units 3-5. Hence it is used widely; but should it be? Side-effects are generally thought of as being linked to long-term steroid use. What problems could possibly be caused by a single dose of dexamethasone at induction; surely the benefits outweigh any small risk of potential problems? Dexamethasone has very high glucocorticoid activity – 6–7 times greater than that of prednisolone 6, 7. Peak serum levels occur 2–12 hours after injection, and the drug is completely cleared within 3–5 days. However, cortisol levels are suppressed by 64–81% at 24 hours after injection, with most patients' values returning to normal by one week 7. Dexamethasone clearance is inversely related to age. A single dose of dexamethasone induces whole body insulin resistance and alters cardiac glucose metabolism 8. This may result in hyperglycaemia in patients both with and without diabetes mellitus, which is associated with poor outcomes, particularly for cardiac surgery and subarachnoid haemorrhage 9-11. A meta-analysis identified that blood glucose is higher for 24 hours after administration but markedly higher in those with obesity and poor glycaemic control 12. A matched case control study of 63 patients concluded that use of dexamethasone for PONV may confer an increased risk of postoperative infection 13. Despite this, a recent meta-analysis failed to show an increase in the infection risk; however, the authors concluded that patients at higher risk of infection are often excluded from peri-operative studies on dexamethasone 10. The risk of infection following a single dose is unknown, but for larger doses there are effects on innate and acquired immunity, predisposing to infection 14. Infection from any pathogen can be difficult to detect due to dampening of febrile responses. Opportunistic or atypical organisms occur over 40 times more often in those receiving glucocorticoids 15. Dexamethasone is particularly contraindicated in systemic fungal infections and before the administration of live or attenuated vaccines because the response to these vaccines cannot be predicted. Even a single dose of 8 mg dexamethasone partially suppresses the hypothalamic pituitary axis for up to a week 16. The degree of suppression is greatest and most prolonged when given at night: 1 mg taken orally at night inhibits corticotrophin secretion for 24 hours 6. However, this suppression has minor effects and unknown clinical significance. In animal studies, a single dose of dexamethasone significantly reduced collagenisation, epithelisation and fibroblast content, implying negative effects on wound healing 17. In another animal model, the healing of tracheal anastomoses was significantly impaired by dexamethasone 18. Dexamethasone increases the risk of post-dural puncture headache after spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section when compared with placebo 19. Use of steroids may increase the risk of perforation in patients with peptic ulcers, diverticulitis, new anastomoses and non-specific ulcerative colitis. There are no data on the risk of gastric ulceration after a single dose; however, a study in rats demonstrated a 30% ulcer rate in animals receiving 1 mg.kg−1 intramucular dexamethasone 24 hours earlier, associated with an 83-87% reduction in prostaglandin action via inhibition of prostaglandin synthase and peroxidise, and a doubling in gastric acid secretion 20. Signs of perforation may also be masked 20. Patients taking long-term dexamethasone have a 4% risk of avascular necrosis 21. The risk is multifactorial but is higher with older age, low albumin, high lipid levels and the amount of dexamethasone exposure 22. The shortest use of dexamethasone causing avascular necrosis in case reports is one week; typically, onset of symptoms is after six months to three years' exposure 23. The significance of one peri-operative dose is unknown. Use of corticosteroids in the healing phase of arthrodesis has been controversial for many years, particularly for spinal arthrodesis due to inhibition of bone graft incorporation 24. This syndrome is an oncological emergency and can be fatal. It occurs in haematological tumours that grow at a fast rate or have a large bulk. It is characterised by rapid onset of hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, lactic acidosis, hyperuricaemia and acute renal failure. It usually occurs after cytotoxic chemotherapy and dexamethasone is commonly used 25. Dexamethasone has a known lympholytic effect by arresting growth and inducing apoptosis in lymphocytes. There are case reports of tumour lysis syndrome following treatment with dexamethasone alone 26. Peri-operative death has also followed a single dose of dexamethasone causing tumour lysis syndrome in a 3-year-old undergoing adenotonsillectomy 27. It is therefore suggested that dexamethasone (and other corticosteroids) be avoided until a precise diagnosis is identified and to maintain a high index of suspicion. Dexamethasone is associated with neuropsychiatric side-effects ranging from mild symptoms of anxiety and irritability to mania and psychosis, even including suicide. Following introduction of steroid therapy in the 1950s, the reported frequency of psychiatric reactions has been as high as 5–10% 28. Critically, it remains poorly studied since the 1960s and reactions are substantially under-reported. Most current data exist from case reports, case series and review articles. There are varying reports of onset time, mostly within a few days to a week after taking the steroid 29, 30. This doesn't help quantification of risk for a single dose. Notable mania is more frequent then depression in approximately 75% of reported cases 31. The mechanism of psychiatric symptoms is multifactorial, including both direct and indirect effects on the brain. It is hypothesised that excessive levels of corticosteroids cause an increase in dopamine levels, which in turn result in symptoms of mania, psychosis and severe depression 32. Rome and Braceland performed a classic study in 1952 and reviewed the psychiatric effects of glucocorticoids 33. They identified four categories of psychiatric response to steroids (Table 1). Grade-1 effects are perceived as positive reasons to choose dexamethasone as a peri-operative anti-emetic. Symptoms reported less often include hypomania or mania, generalised anxiety, distractibility, agitation, insomnia, pressured speech, emotional lability and restlessness. These symptoms are probably more characteristic of grade-2 or -3 side-effects. At-risk groups were identified by Lewis and Smith in 1983 as women and those with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis 28. The glucocorticoid side-effects are inversely related to serum albumin due to an increase in the amount of free, unbound steroid 34. There have been cases of suicide and homicide following use of dexamethasone. One author (AJH) has acted as an expert witness at an Inquest in a case of suicide following a day-case ENT procedure. The possible role of peri-operative dexamethasone was examined in depth, but on the balance of probabilities no causative link could be proved. No doubt it caused months or even years of worry for the anaesthetist involved. There are case reports of criminal activity related to acute steroid-induced psychosis. One related to a 26-year-old who was charged with the attempted murder of his fiancée following osteotomy of the maxilla for which he received peri-operative dexamethasone; he was found not guilty on the grounds of involuntary intoxication. His psychosis lasted 15 days and then subsided with no long-lasting effects 35. In a series of 79 patients with steroid-induced psychosis, 93% made a complete recovery, 4% had continued symptoms and 3% committed suicide 28. This phenomenon is not fully understood, but intravenous administration of dexamethasone to awake patients can lead to acute, but short-lived (3–45 seconds) perineal pain, irritation, burning or tingling. It is postulated that the phosphate ester in dexamethasone sodium phosphate plays a significant role. Females seem to be affected more than males 36. There are a number of case reports of patients who, after receiving dexamethasone 8 mg before induction, experience distressing effects, leading to the suggestion that it should only be given after induction of anaesthesia 37. These unpleasant effects can be eliminated by administration in 50 ml over 5–10 minutes 36. The argument that dexamethasone should be used because of the expense of ondansetron or granisetron is no longer valid. At a local hospital pharmacy in March 2013, antiemetics are priced as follows: ondansetron £0.16/4 mg; granisetron £0.30/1 mg; dexamethasone £0.48/4 mg; and cyclizine £0.68/50 mg (Drug Information, Hillingdon Hospital, UK, personal communication). Whilst those patients with a history of PONV stand to gain from a polypharmacy approach to antiemetics, there can be no economic justification in using dexamethasone alone. There is well proven clinical benefit for the use of peri-operative dexamethasone, confirmed in a recent meta-analysis of its anti-emetic properties. This all stands despite the withdrawal of multiple papers on PONV written by Fujii 38-40. Despite the obvious benefit in preventing PONV, dexamethasone can produce a wide variety of short- and long-term side-effects. Though neuropsychiatric reactions are reported in 10%, the true figure is unknown due to substantial under-reporting. Cognitive dysfunction is difficult to demonstrate, particularly when other agents including general anaesthesia have been given. It is appropriate to discuss steroid therapy as a course of treatment; in fact the British National Formulary recommends giving out a patient information leaflet, but the position for a single peri-operative dose is unclear 6. Day-case patients in particular may not be reviewed beyond the initial recovery period and any side-effects may occur after discharge, but before any follow-up appointment (if one is even to be had), leading to significant under-reporting. Mild neuropsychiatric effects may not even be reported at all unless sought after specifically. We are concerned that dexamethasone causes harm that goes unnoticed. Should we at least be informing patients of its potential effects? Without greater evidence of safety, we suggest avoiding steroids in certain known at-risk groups such as those with a personal or family psychiatric history, or immunological disorders such as SLE. With these patients excluded, more detailed studies of patients receiving dexamethasone are warranted. In addition, careful consideration before administration is required in other groups: oncology patients with bulky or highly proliferative tumours; diabetics; elderly orthopaedic patients; those undergoing surgery in which anastomotic breakdown is catastrophic; and those at particular risk from infection, particularly immunocompromised patients. Further, we recommend that all patients receiving dexamethasone should be warned of its potential side-effects. Steroids are powerful agents and should be used with caution. No external funding declared. AJH has acted as an expert witness as described.",

Over time, it has been considered a safe and well-tolerated drug with rare and reversible side effects. Recently there have been reports of adverse drug-related reactions that persisted for at least three months after discontinuation of this drug, and the term post-finasteride syndrome arose. It includes persistent sexual, neuropsychiatric, and physical symptoms. Studies to date cannot refute or confirm this syndrome as a nosological entity. If it actually exists, it seems to occur in susceptible people, even if exposed to small doses and for short periods, and symptoms may persist for long periods. Based on currently available data, the use of 5α-reductase inhibitors in patients with a history of depression, sexual dysfunction, or infertility should be carefully and individually assessed.",

      "title": "Long-term Use of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) and Their Effects on Bone Health",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, More than 25% of the global population suffer from acid-related disorders such as dyspepsia or GERD.[1] Acid-related disorders are frequently treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). PPIs work by irreversibly inhibiting the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme, thereby reducing gastric acid secretion and regulating acid production. Since being brought to the market in 1989, their use has grown significantly globally, and they are currently among the top ten medications prescribed in the US and Pakistan. Six medications in this class—omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, pantoprazole, and rabeprazole—had received FDA approval as of 2015.[2] PPI prescriptions typically last four to eight weeks. However, long-term use may be necessary for patients with comorbidities who require multiple medications. PPI use should be carefully considered, particularly for patients whose treatment may last for many years and in third-world countries where people may use drugs based on word-of-mouth recommendations rather than prescriptions due to financial instability and illiteracy. Observational and population-based cohort studies have associated long-term PPI use with an increased risk of pneumonia, major cardiovascular events, dementia, vitamin B12 deficiency, bone fractures, gastric cancer, and kidney injury, among other complications.[1] A possible positive correlation between PPIs and osteoporotic fracture risk, including those of the hip, spine, and wrist, has sparked even more worries.[2] Prolonged PPI use has been linked to chronic kidney disease (CKD), which impairs vitamin D synthesis, reduces calcium absorption, and subsequently causes hypocalcaemia, increasing the risk of osteoporosis. Additionally, long-term PPI use reduces vitamin B12 absorption, leading to elevated homocysteine levels, which disrupt collagen cross-linking and contribute to osteoporosis. [4] PPI use has been associated with hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D3 deficiency, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesemia and a decrease bone mineral density (BMD). Risk factors for reduced BMD include age over 50, menopause, insufficient sun exposure, concomitant use of two PPIs, and daily intake after meals. [3] Rabeprazole is an exception to these effects; it improves glucocorticoid-induced decreased bone mineral density rather than exacerbating bone disorders. Rabeprazole differs from other PPIs due to its reversible inhibition of H+/K+ ATPase, which may explain its protective effect on bone mineral density. Thus, rabeprazole may be a preferable option for patients at risk of osteoporosis. 5] In light of the previously mentioned facts, we would like to call attention to Pakistan's population's excessive and unapproved use of PPIs. Therefore, it is important to regulate the use of PPIs and increase public awareness of their negative long-term effects.",

      "title": "Management of Xylazine Withdrawal in a Hospitalized Patient: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Background Xylazine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist commonly used as a large animal anesthetic. It is used as an adulterant in illicit opioids, and it is now well established that its synergistic effect with opioids increases lethality. The amount of xylazine adulterating illicit opioids is growing at an alarming rate, present in almost one-third of opioid overdose deaths reported in Philadelphia in 2019. Despite this, there are no reports considering the management of patients using xylazine chronically. In particular, there are no reported cases detailing the management of xylazine withdrawal or exploring the potential for ongoing treatment for those in recovery from xylazine use. Case Summary We present the case of a 29 year old female with opioid use disorder and chronic xylazine use, admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment of chronic lower extremity wounds thought to be due to xylazine injection. Her xylazine withdrawal was managed with a combination of dexmedetomidine infusion, phenobarbital and tizanidine, later transitioned to clonidine. By hospital day 4 she was no longer experiencing withdrawal symptoms. She was transitioned from full-agonist opioids for pain to buprenorphine via a buprenorphine “micro-induction” and was ultimately discharged on buprenorphine, clonidine, and gabapentin on day 19 of admission. Clinical Significance This case illustrates a potential treatment pathway that allows for safe and comfortable xylazine withdrawal in hospitalized patients. It also provides an introduction into several medical concerns affecting this patient population specifically, including xylazine-mediated soft tissue wounds.",

      "abstract": "Prokinetics are a heterogeneous class of drugs that enhance and coordinate gastrointestinal (GI) smooth muscle contraction to enhance gastric emptying and improve a wide range of motility disorders and related symptoms, even though high‑quality evidence is limited. These disorders range from very common but non‑fatal disorders such as functional dyspepsia (FD), gastroparesis or chronic idiopathic constipation (CIS) to severe motility disorders including chronic intestinal pseudo‑obstruction. Different classes of prokinetic agents with different mechanisms are available worldwide. Because of the great clinical need, many new drugs are currently under investigation or have recently been brought to market. Based on the latest recommendations of the European Association of Neurogastroenterology and Motility and the American Society of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, a review of the efficacy and safety of prokinetic agents in gastrointestinal disorders is presented. Such classes of kinetic agents as cholinesterase inhibitors (pyridostigmine, neostigmine, acotiamide), motilin agonists (erythromycin, mitemcinal), ghrelin agonists (relamorelin), muscarinic receptor agonists (bethanechol), 5‑HT4 receptor agonists (prucalopride, tegaserod, mosapride), dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (metoclopramide, domperidone, itopride, levosulpiride) were considered. The presented results demonstrated the potential benefits of prokinetics in improving gastrointestinal motility and symptom control through appropriate dose adjustments. However, further studies are needed to examine specific patient populations, optimal dosing regimens, and long‑term safety profiles of these drugs.",

      "abstract": "Sustained-release drug delivery systems, which meter out the encapsulated drug over a long period of time, augment the effectiveness of therapy in several ways. An ideal sustained-release drug delivery system prolongs the half-life of the drug while maintaining the concentration of the released drug in the therapeutic range during the entire duration of drug release (Fig. 1). For cell-cycle phase-specific drugs in particular, prolonging the half-life of the administered drug has a profound effect on its efficacy by increasing the area under the “exposure vs time” curve for a given amount of drug while, at the same time, decreasing toxicity by reducing the high concentration peak of drug which otherwise occurs immediately after injection. Tissue distribution of the drug is often altered, resulting in higher concentrations and greater efficacy at the desired site, and lower exposure and toxicity elsewhere. Sustained-release formulations are an effective tool in cases where patient compliance is a problem. The feasibility of delivering treatment with fewer injections may enable outpatient treatment that can markedly improve the patient’s quality of life. There are, of course, economic incentives. For parenteral products that require administration and monitoring by medical personnel, decreasing the number of injections may reduce overall treatment cost. Proprietary sustained-release formulations can extend the economic viability of a compound beyond the termination of its patent life.",

      "title": "Environmental Toxicology and Health Effects Associated with Dinitrotoluene Exposure",
      "abstract": "Dinitrotoluenes (DNTs) are nitroaromatic compounds appearing as pale yellow crystalline solids at room temperature. Dinitrotoluenes exist as a mixture of 2 to 6 isomers, with 2,4-DNT, and 2,6-DNT being the most significant. About 500 persons are estimated to be potentially exposed yearly to 2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT during the production of munitions and explosives. The main route of human exposure at ammunition facilities is inhalation, but dermal contact and inadvertent ingestion can also be substantial. In factory workers, exposure to DNTs has been linked to many adverse health effects, including cyanosis, vertigo, headache, metallic taste, dyspnea, weakness and lassitude, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. Other symptoms including pain or parasthesia in extremities, abdominal discomfort, tremors, paralysis, chest pain, and unconsciousness have also been reported. The primary targets of DNT toxicity are the hematopoietic system (pallor, cyanosis, anemia, and leukocytosis), the cardiovascular system (ischemic heart disease), the nervous system (muscular weakness, headache, dizziness, nausea, insomnia, and tingling pains in the extremities) and the reproductive system (reduction of sperm counts, alteration of sperm morphology, and aspermatogenesis). An association between DNT exposure and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinomas and subcutaneous tumors in rats, as well as renal tumors in mice, has been established. Epidemiologic studies of DNT toxicity have been limited to small groups of workers who had been occupationally exposed at various ammunitions production facilities. Clearly defining the health effects of DNTs with a high degree of confidence has therefore been difficult because of the multigenic nature of occupational exposure. In an attempt to update the toxicologic profile of the DNTs, we hereby provide a critical review of the environmental and toxicologic pathology of DNTs, with a special emphasis on their potential implications for public health.",

      "abstract": "High doses or prolonged use of diclofenac, a commonly prescribed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), may result in gastrointestinal complications, which, if ignored, can be fatal. A preventable death attributed to diclofenac in a 16-year-old girl with complex needs has been identified, and is described in this article. Adverse drug reactions from NSAIDs should be considered and treated in children and adolescents, especially those with complex needs. > This article is part of the Coroners' Concerns to Prevent Harms series.1 It discusses a Prevention of Future Death (PFD) report related to harm from diclofenac in an adolescent.2 Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly prescribed for its analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects. About 658 000 prescriptions were dispensed for diclofenac in English primary care in the 12 months from September 2019 to August 2020, costing £8.3 million.3 Diclofenac is thought to exert its action by reducing prostaglandin synthesis through inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2). It is classified as a non-selective COX inhibitor, though in vitro studies have shown it preferentially inhibits COX-2 more than COX-1.4 Diclofenac is most commonly prescribed for pain relief but the specific indications for its use in children and adolescents vary by age, as recommended in the British National Formulary for Children, see box 1.5 Diclofenac, along with other NSAIDs, is associated with increased risks of bleeding, cardiovascular events, renal impairment and gastrointestinal complications, including peptic ulcer disease.6 These harms are well reported in the elderly, and NSAIDs have been implicated in 30% of all hospital admissions due to preventable adverse drug reactions (ADRs).7 However, the prevalence of such harms is not well studied in children and adolescents.

      "abstract": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and adverse effects of amlodipine are reviewed. Amlodipine belongs to the dihydropyridine subclass of calcium antagonists. Amlodipine is a potent peripheral and coronary vasodilator with high selectivity for vascular smooth muscle and minimal effect on myocardial contractility or cardiac conduction. Absorption after oral administration is slow, and the duration of action is long, with a half-life of 36-45 hours. Amlodipine has FDA-approved labeling for use in the treatment of hypertension, chronic stable angina, and vasospastic angina. The agent is also indicated for use in hypertensive or anginal patients who also have congestive heart failure due to systolic dysfunction (New York Heart Association classes II and III). Clinical trials suggest that effective 24-hour control of hypertension and angina is provided by once-daily administration of amlodipine 5-10 mg alone or in combination with other drugs. No clinically important drug interactions have been observed to date. Amlodipine has not shown any unfavorable effects on serum glucose or lipid levels. The most common adverse effect is peripheral edema. Amlodipine is effective and well tolerated when given alone or in combination with other drugs for the treatment of hypertension and angina. Amlodipine may offer advantages over verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine in patients with hypertension or angina with associated congestive heart failure due to systolic dysfunction.",

This guideline sets out the latest insights on gastrointestinal decontamination in intoxication; the advice is summarized in a flowchart.- The advice is to generally administer activated charcoal, unless there are indications that the toxin will not bind to activated charcoal or that the amount of toxin that the patient has ingested is too great; in these cases gastric lavage can be considered.- Activated charcoal can be administered up to 2 hours after the ingestion of a toxic substance, unless there are contra-indications. Multiple-dose activated charcoal in combination with a laxative can be administered in cases of overdose with toxins that use the enterohepatic circulation (such as theophylline, carbamazepine, quinine, dapsone and phenobarbital).- Gastric lavage should be limited to extremely serious intoxication, when the substance has been ingested less than 1-2 hours previously.- Whole-bowel irrigation should not be performed routinely but should be limited to ingestion of toxins with sustained release or enteric coating, or for toxins that do not bind to activated charcoal.",

      "title": "[Drug interactions with contraceptive methods].",
      "abstract": "3 possible types of drug interactions with contraceptives involve oral contraceptives (OCs), IUDs, and spermicides. The interaction of combined OCs with various drugs is frequently discussed in the literature, but the reported facts are sometimes contradictory. Case studies have indicated failure of OCs in patients taking ampicillin, but comparative studies using ampicillin and placebos have shown no difference in rates of estrogen, progestogens, follicle stimulating hormone, or luteinizing hormone in the 2 groups. Individual differences and predispositions among some women appear to play a role in drug interactions. The clinician should be wary of modifying accepted prescription practices too readily in the face of findings that may be explained by other as yet undisclosed factors. Interactions are difficult to establish, as are their mechanisms. They may perhaps be explained by the estrogen or progestogen components of the pills, the timing of the antibiotic dose, the duration of treatment and the dosage used, resistance of the intestinal flora, self-medication, or other factors. The drug troleandomycin is a special case; it appears to favor the already existing tendency of OCs to provoke cholestatic jaundice. A table of drug interactions with OCs can be divided into 2 parts, those that have been confirmed and whose mechanisms of action are known, including antiepileptics such as phenobarbital, butobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone, and the drug rifampicin, which are enzyme inductors; and those that are suspected but as yet unconfirmed and whose mechanism of action is not established. The unconfirmed interactions involve a variety of effects in addition to pregnancy. It is not yet established whether enzyme inductors are a greater problem for users of low-dose pills, but the probable existence of individual variations in sensitivity causes problems in setting recommendations applicable to all patients. Interactions between progestogen-only OCs and other drugs have not been reported, perhaps because they have been in use for a short time and their use is somewhat restricted. It is possible that use of anti-inflammatory drugs in midcycle attenuates the inflammatory effect of the IUD at the endometrial level, thereby augmenting the risk of pregnancy, but thus far the effect has not been proven. Drug interactions with spermicides are difficult to detect because of their less than total effectiveness, but users are warned to employ another method if they are undergoing any kind of vaginal treatment with another product.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hydrocodone is a semisynthetic opioid, which has been used for decades as a short-acting analgesic combined with acetaminophen (or less commonly ibuprofen). Several long-acting, non-acetaminophen-containing hydrocodone formulations are undergoing trials in the US under the auspices of the US Food and Drug Administration, and may be available shortly. This article reviews some of the advantages (including drug familiarity and lack of acetaminophen toxicity) and potential disadvantages (including altered use patterns and high morphine equivalent dosing) of such a medication formulation. We also discuss the abuse potential of long-acting versus short-acting opioids in general and hydrocodone specifically, as well as the metabolism of hydrocodone.

      "title": "Glucocorticoid‐induced adrenal suppression: physiological basis and strategies for glucocorticoid weaning",
      "abstract": "Glucocorticoids are widely used in medicine, beginning with the revolutionary use of cortisone in rheumatoid arthritis, shortly after its synthesis in 1950.1 Inactive cortisone is converted endogenously to active hydrocortisone. Subsequently, Arthrobacter microbiological dehydrogenation introduced a 1,2-corticoid ring double bond, leading to prednisolone, which has four times the anti-inflammatory potency as hydrocortisone but less salt-retaining properties, a longer plasma disappearance half-life, and tissue effect compatible with once daily dosing.2, 3 Hence, prednisolone is the preferred anti-inflammatory oral glucocorticoid. Glucocorticoids are perhaps the most versatile of all medical therapies, leading to disease control, often life saving, in at least 50 discrete diseases.4 Nevertheless, glucocorticoids risk severe adverse reactions, particularly if taken in high systemic doses for a prolonged period. Use of prednisolone in supraphysiological doses (> 5 mg per day) or steroid equivalents (Box 1) for at least 21 days was reported in 14% of inhabitants of western Sweden over a seven-year period.5 Population prevalence of long term oral glucocorticoid use is estimated at about 1–3%.6, 7 The glucocorticoids side effects comprise metabolic (central fat mass increase, hyperglycaemia, hypertension), catabolic (skin thinning, proximal muscle atrophy, bone loss) and neurocognitive and mood disturbances, together representing exogenous Cushing syndrome. Typically, systemic glucocorticoids are given at a dose sufficient to control disease, then withdrawn at a rate that could minimise adverse withdrawal reactions, risk of adrenal insufficiency and disease reactivation. Glucocorticoid weaning has not been subject to rigorous clinical trial due to the many individual variables involved. These include variable metabolism of the administered glucocorticoids, the extent of glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms and the activity of the disease that led to glucocorticoid use. Hence, glucocorticoid withdrawal schemes are generally based on expert opinion rather than empirical evidence.8, 9 The safety of abrupt glucocorticoid cessation has not been studied. The use of a morning plasma cortisol or short synacthen test (SST) to evaluate adrenal reserve to determine the weaning rate of glucocorticoid is widespread.10 Unfortunately, their value in predicting actual adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis events on glucocorticoid withdrawal has not been systematically studied, and borderline values need to be interpreted with caution. This article aims to provide guidance to clinicians for a safe and effective way to wean patients off long term glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoid daily doses greater than those used for physiological replacement for more than three to four weeks often lead to long term suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, which operates to provide life-sustaining cortisol without excess.3 Adrenal suppression results from prolonged negative feedback by glucocorticoids on cortisol secretion (Box 2). Adrenal suppression arises from glucocorticoids acting via glucocorticoid receptors in key brain structures, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex and mineralocorticoid receptors in limbic structures.11, 12 In addition, feedback occurs via glucocorticoid receptors in the pituitary and adrenal cortex.12 The paraventricular nucleus corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons are critical in hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis regulation and they (or contiguous brain structures) primarily underlie the phenomenon of prolonged glucocorticoid suppression in humans and non-human primates.13 Direct suppression of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary corticotropes and adrenocortical atrophy, particularly at the cortisol secreting zona fasciculata also develop.14 The primacy of central sites of glucocorticoid suppression is suggested by a study of patients with Cushing syndrome after removal of their pituitary adenoma, where prolonged suppression of cortisol and ACTH (typically over six to 18 months) is seen, but an immediate post-operative infusion of CRH normalises cortisol secretion.14 * Cortisol negative feedback inhibition suppresses CRH and ACTH secretion, via glucocorticoid receptors, to prevent hypercortisolism. Exogenous glucocorticoids act via this negative feedback mechanism to suppress endogenous CRH, ACTH and cortisol. Glucocorticoid weaning may be met with symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (fatigue, nausea, anorexia, diffuse aches and pains) or adrenal crisis (adrenal insufficiency symptoms plus absolute or relative hypotension that responds rapidly, within one hour, to exogenous hydrocortisone, excluding other pathologies), and/or symptoms of hormone withdrawal syndrome.15 Patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency have established disease of the adrenal cortex or the pituitary and/or hypothalamus.3 Hypothalamic-based adrenal insufficiency may be referred to as tertiary adrenal insufficiency, but, from a clinical viewpoint, disease of the hypothalamic and/or pituitary unit is often considered together as both result from ACTH deficiency.3 Both primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency incur a risk of adrenal crisis — an acute emergency where cortisol production is insufficient to maintain homeostasis — considering that higher cortisol concentrations are needed in the face of states where tissue glucocorticoid resistance occurs, such as inflammation or trauma. Adrenal crisis risk in patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency is substantial, at 8% and 6% per annum respectively.15 Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency is generally considered common but entails a substantially lower risk of adrenal crisis. An Australian epidemiological study of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency showed a low rate of adult hospital admissions for adrenal insufficiency and rare admissions for adrenal crises.16 Hormone withdrawal syndrome, where symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, body aches and mood disturbance develop, can be confused with absolute adrenal insufficiency, but may occur at supraphysiological glucocorticoid doses. These symptoms are seen with withdrawal of other hormones and opiates and are postulated to have a unifying central nervous system mechanism.17, 18 Specific glucocorticoid dosing regimens for surgery, based on the extent of the surgical procedure, are available at the Addison's Disease Self-Help Group website.19 Assiduous \"sick day\" education along these lines may reduce the risk of adrenal crisis, but residual risk remains and is unevenly distributed among individual patients for uncertain reasons.16, 20 The extent and duration of adrenal suppression after exogenous glucocorticoid exposure varies, but generally only occurs after at least three weeks of supraphysiological glucocorticoid use.16 The duration may be as long as 12–18 months after glucocorticoid withdrawal, as revealed after Cushing syndrome,21 but most patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency are at risk for shorter intervals.16 No algorithm has been developed to clinically predict the risk of adrenal insufficiency after glucocorticoid withdrawal in the individual patient. A systematic review and meta-analysis showed that glucocorticoid dose and duration, reflected also in glucocorticoid administrative route and underlying disease, predict the risk of biochemically diagnosed adrenal insufficiency.22 The highest risk is seen in patients taking oral glucocorticoids (48.7%) and intra-articular forms (52%), with lower rates for inhaled (7.8%), topical (4.7%) and nasal (4.2%) glucocorticoids.22 There is a wide variability in glucocorticoid activity of a given oral dose in different individuals due to differences in absorption, metabolism, glucocorticoid receptor expression, and downstream gene activation.12, 23, 24 High intra-individual variability in glucocorticoid sensitivity is apparent in estimates of daily cortisol production rates at 9.9 mg per day (standard deviation, 2.7 mg per day) and a threefold variation in 24-hour urine-free cortisol in healthy individuals.25 Several tests have been used to assess cortisol secretion and the extent of glucocorticoid suppression from exogenous glucocorticoids. These tests include morning plasma cortisol, taking advantage of the peak of cortisol circadian rhythm at 6–9 am, shortly after waking, where cortisol concentrations are sevenfold those at nadir (midnight) in the presence of a typical sleep–wake cycle, as the rhythm is entrained by light. Morning cortisol often obviates the need for an SST, but SST is more reproducible.26 The SST uses the ACTH 1-24 (cosyntropin, synacthen) N-terminal fragment of the full 39-amino acid ACTH peptide to stimulate adrenal cortisol secretion. The test relies on the principle that adrenal suppression will eventually lead to adrenocortical atrophy (after about six weeks, as evidenced after pituitary surgery) and, hence, a subnormal response to administered synacthen will be observed. Alternative tests, such as insulin hypoglycaemia, metyrapone stimulation of ACTH and 11-deoxycortisol, CRH stimulation and morning salivary cortisone or cortisol are not routinely used in this context due to safety, side effects or expense, as well as insufficient supporting interpretative data in this context. Morning and SST-stimulated cortisol estimates vary between assays, so assay-specific control values should be used.27 A gap between the administered glucocorticoid and serum cortisol is essential for assessment of endogenous cortisol, which is 12 hours for hydrocortisone and 24 hours for prednisolone and dexamethasone.3 Cortisol circulates bound in high affinity to corticosteroid-binding globulin (80%), low affinity to albumin (15%) and free in plasma (5%) at physiological cortisol concentrations.28 A greater proportion is free when cortisol exceeds the corticosteroid-binding globulin concentration (~500 nmol/L).28 Conditions that may produce hypoproteinaemia, such as liver disease or nephrotic syndrome, may reduce bound cortisol. Conventional cortisol assays measure both bound and free cortisol and will be lowered in hypoproteinaemia, falsely implying low free cortisol that can diffuse through cell membranes.28 The rate of glucocorticoid weaning relates to these three risks and is quantitatively informed by measures of endogenous cortisol production. High disease activity is likely to prohibit glucocorticoid weaning, at least until there is a remission or alternative effective therapies are in place. Hormone withdrawal syndrome may develop with rapid glucocorticoid withdrawal above the physiological range. Adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis may develop with glucocorticoid withdrawal below the physiological range. Practically, these three considerations and cortisol measurements (morning cortisol or, if needed, an SST) should guide the rate of glucocorticoid withdrawal. Patients should be advised to report adrenal insufficiency symptoms and resume the previous dose should these occur after a weaning dose reduction step. Prevention measures for adrenal crisis events should be in place until 12 months after cessation of glucocorticoids. Morning cortisol and cortisol level after 250 μg intravenous or intramuscular SST (30- or 60-minute post-synacthen cortisol) should be considered similarly, but the SST is likely to be more reproducible. Low morning cortisol values are predictive of adrenal insufficiency, whereas high cortisol values indicate a low adrenal insufficiency risk; however, many patients have indeterminate values and an SST can be useful.26 The interpretation of the cortisol testing in this context is detailed in Box 3. Development of symptoms in the supraphysiological dose range requires discernment whether they represent recrudescence of the underlying disease that led to glucocorticoid use or hormone withdrawal syndrome. A slowing of the rate of withdrawal is required if symptoms develop. Excessively slow glucocorticoid withdrawal can prolong adrenal suppression, increasing the risk of adrenal crisis, as seen after treatment for Cushing syndrome.29 In summary, individualised glucocorticoid weaning can reduce the risk of Cushingoid side effects and facilitate prompt restoration of adrenal function.

      "abstract": "Bronchodilator drugs are the foundation for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The principal inhaled bronchodilator treatments used are β 2 ‐agonists and anticholinergics, either alone or in combination. Currently available β 2 ‐agonists are of either short duration and used multiple times/day, or of long duration, which requires twice‐daily administration. Indacaterol is considered an ultra–long‐acting β 2 ‐agonist and was recently approved for use in the United States. Its duration of action is approximately 24 hours, allowing for once‐daily administration. Cough was the most commonly reported adverse effect with use of indacaterol. Cough usually occurred within 15 seconds of inhalation of the drug, lasted around 6 seconds, was not associated with bronchospasm, and did not cause discontinuation of the drug. Otherwise, the drug's safety profile was similar to that of other bronchodilators. Based on similar improvement in spirometric measurements compared with other bronchodilator drugs and the convenience of its once‐daily dosing, indacaterol may be beneficial in the management of mild‐to‐moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, either alone or in combination with anticholinergic drugs administered once/day.",

Women are more frequently affected than men.We present a clinical description of two patients admitted to our department with acute dystonia precipitated by metoclopramide.Both patients received treatment with biperiden; one received additional benzodiazepine. Both recovered rapidly and were discharged symptom free the next day.Metoclopramide-induced dystonia is frightening both for the patient and the family. Because of concomitant anxiety and psychiatric symptoms, individuals are often regarded as hysterical. The attack can be abbreviated by parenteral administration of anticholinergic drugs. It is important that all doctors prescribing metoclopramide know of this side effect, especially when their patients are young females.",

      "abstract": "Methoxyflurane (Penthrane®) is a halogenated ether with a structure resembling that of halothane. Anesthesia with methoxyflurane is occasionally followed by hepatic injury similar to that after exposure to halothane. In addition, methoxyflurane anesthesia may be complicated by a distinctive syndrome of renal tubular injury characterized by inability to concentrate urine, dehydration, and azotemia, which may persist in part for several months. The first reported instance of both conditions occurring in the same patient is described, and the causes and implications of the hepatic and renal lesions are discussed. Methoxyflurane-induced hepatic injury is probably a hypersensitivity reaction, and methoxyflurane should accordingly not be used for patients who have reacted adversely to either methoxyflurane or halothane on previous occasions. Neither or these compounds should be readministered to patients who have been exposed to them before, even if such use has been without incident, when other anesthetic agents can be substituted. The renal lesion may result in part from a direct toxic action of methoxyflurane on the renal tubule. Little is known, however, of its causes and incidence, and further study of this complication is indicated.",

The objective of this survey is to review the clinical pharmacology of fentanyl in preterm infants. The bibliographic search was performed using PubMed and EMBASE databases as search engines. In addition, the books Neofax: A manual of drugs used in neonatal care and Neonatal formulary were consulted. Fentanyl is N-dealkylated by CYP3A4 into the inactive norfentanyl. Fentanyl may be administered as bolus doses or as a continuous infusion. In neonates, there is a remarkable interindividual variability in the kinetic parameters. In neonates, fentanyl half-life ranges from 317 minutes to 1266 minutes and in adults it is 222 minutes. Respiratory depression occurs when fentanyl doses are >5 μg/kg. Chest wall rigidity may occur in neonates and occasionally is associated with laryngospasm. Tolerance to fentanyl may develop after prolonged use of this drug. Significant withdrawal symptoms have been reported in infants treated with continuous infusion for 5 days or longer. Fentanyl is an extremely potent analgesic and is the opioid analgesic most frequently used in the neonatal intensive care unit.",

Amikacin rearranges lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane of the bacterial cell wall, resulting in disruption of the cell wall. Amikacin should not be administered with other medications that are nephrotoxic or ototoxic. Amikacin should be used with caution in children. Amikacin is more likely to be active against gram-negative rods when compared to the other aminoglycosides. Aminoglycosides require oxygen to be active and thus are less effective in anaerobic environments such as an abscess or infected bone. Aminoglycosides have decreased activity in low pH environments such as respiratory secretions or abscesses. It is concentration-dependent and therefore is more effective if given at longer intervals and with higher doses. For example, giving amikacin at 15 mg/kg/day may be more effective than 5 mg/kg/8 hours. The IV dose should be infused over 60 minutes to avoid neuromuscular blockade.",

Single intramuscular injections of this compound arrest pregnancy over a wide period of gestation in the bitch. A dose of 2.5 mg/kg was found to be very well tolerated and highly effective (100 per cent) when administered between the day of mating and the 15th day of pregnancy. The desired effect was not accompanied by uterine disorders or other unwanted effects. This non‐hormonal agent appears to have several real advantages over the only other drugs (oestrogens) available in veterinary practice for the termination of unwanted pregnancies in bitches.",

The reasons for the decreased use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy include its narrow therapeutic index and potential for long-term toxicity, as well as the development of other antiepileptic drugs throughout the second half of the twentieth century. Phenytoin has a good behavioural tolerability profile and a restricted range of psychiatric uses. Despite occasional reports of adverse behavioural effects (especially at higher doses), there is some weak evidence for its potential usefulness as mood stabilizer and in the pharmacological management of impulsive aggression.",

Chin MD, Department of Emergency Services, San Francisco General Hospital, San Francisco, CA 94110. rchin@sfghed.ucsf.edu Key Words: percutaneous salicylism, renal dialysis, renal failure, salicylate toxicity INTRODUCTION Salicylates are commonly used for their analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet properties. Acute salicylate poisoning is a common overdose resulting in high morbidity and mortality. Insidious cases of salicylate intoxication may also occur, caused by either ingestion or topical absorption, most often in elderly patients with associated medical illnesses. We present a fatal case of acute methyl salicylate toxicity from both ingestion and dermal absorption of oil of wintergreen. This case highlights the point that topical absorption of salicylates, particularly in patients with renal failure, can result in severe intoxication. CASE REPORT An 80-year-old man with end-stage renal disease had oil of wintergreen (containing 35% mg/ml methyl salicylate) rubbed regularly on his lower extremities by a live-in attendant. He applied it to the patient’s legs and left the bottle on the nightstand. The patient mistakenly drank a mouthful when he mistook it for a beverage. The attendant said the patient vomited the oil of wintergreen immediately. Two hours later, the man was found seizing. When paramedics arrived the patient remained unresponsive and apneic with a wide QRS complex on the cardiac monitor. The patient’s medical history included diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy requiring hemodialysis three times per week, and severe coronary artery disease. He had a coronary artery bypass graft and a pacemaker. He was dialyzed one day prior to presentation and had otherwise been in his usual health. Upon presentation to the Emergency Department, the patient was unresponsive and apneic. He had a blood pressure of 146/66 mm Hg, a palpable pulse at 55 beats per minute, and depressed respirations requiring assisted ventilation by bag valve mask. External cardiac monitoring revealed a wide QRS rhythm. The patient smelled of oil of wintergreen. Head and neck exam was normal. His lungs were clear and his heart without murmurs. Abdominal and rectal exam were unremarkable. His lower extremities demonstrated acrocyanosis and were cool to touch. Diminished pulses were noted, and no reflexes were elicited. His bilateral forearm shunts appeared intact. Resuscitation in the Emergency Department consisted of oral endotracheal intubation, followed by gastric lavage and administration of activated charcoal. The patient initial arterial blood gas on FiO2 100% was pH 6.95, pCO2 34 mmHg, pO2 400 mmHg, and the patient was given intravenous sodium bicarbonate. The serum potassium level was 8.6 mmol/L and the patient was given 1 gm of calcium gluconate intravenously. His electrocardiogram showed a wide complex QRS with pacemaker depolarizations at 80 spikes per minute. The patient also developed several runs of ventricular tachycardia, which responded to 1mg/kg (75 mg) lidocaine. The patient’s chest radiograph demonstrated cardiomegaly with no evidence of pulmonary edema. The endotracheal tube was in good position above the carina. Serum chemistries revealed the following values: sodium 134 mmol/L, potassium 8.6 mmol/L, chloride 97 mmol/L, bicarbonate 6 mmol/L, urea nitrogen 62 mmol/ L, creatinine 6.9 mmol/L. He had an anion gap of 31 (normal < 14). His salicylate level was 74.8 mg/dl. Immediate hemodialysis was initiated upon transfer to the Intensive Care Unit. Repeat arterial blood gas after 1 1/2 hrs of dialysis demonstrated a pH of 7.37, PaCO2 34 mmHg, and PaO2",

Bradycardia can be treated with atropine sulfate, epinephrine chloride, dopamine hydrochloride, or tolazoline hydrochloride. Hypotension is treated with intravenous fluids and dopamine, reserving tolazoline for refractory cases. Hypothermia is common but is of minor clinical significance. Paradoxical hypertension should be treated with tolazoline.

In our series, 13 children were identified, of whom 11 children were aged one to two years. Tenchildren either remained asymptomatic or made a complete recovery. Two children had a persisting major deficit and one died. Once ingestion of quinine has occurred, absorption should be prevented by the emptying of the stomach with ipecacuanha or gastric lavage promptly and then by the administration of activated charcoal.

      "abstract": "Ketamine, administered in subanesthetic doses, is an effective off-label treatment for severe and even treatment-refractory depression; however, despite dozens of studies across nearly 2 decades of research, there is no definitive guidance on matters related to core practice issues.This article presents a qualitative review and summary about what is known about ketamine dosing, rate of administration, route of administration, duration of treatment, and frequency of sessions.Ketamine is most commonly administered in the dose of 0.5 mg/kg, but some patients may respond to doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg, and others may require up to 0.75 mg/kg. The ketamine dose is conventionally administered across 40 minutes; however, safety and efficacy have been demonstrated in sessions ranging between 2 and 100 minutes in duration. Bolus administration is safe and effective when the drug is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Whereas the intravenous route is the most commonly employed, safety and efficacy have been described with other routes of administration, as well; these include oral, sublingual, transmucosal, intranasal, intramuscular, and subcutaneous routes. Patients may receive a single session of treatment or a course of treatment during the acute phase, and treatment may rarely be continued for weeks to years to extend and maintain treatment gains in refractory cases. When so extended, the ideal frequency is perhaps best individualized wherein ketamine is dosed a little before the effect of the previous session is expected to wear off.There is likely to be a complex interaction between ketamine dose, session duration, route of administration, frequency of administration, and related practice. Until definitive studies comparing different doses, rates of administration, routes of administration, and other considerations are conducted, firm recommendations are not possible. From the point of view of clinical practicability, subcutaneous, intranasal, and oral ketamine warrant further study. If domiciliary treatment is considered, the risk of abuse must be kept in mind.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Minoxidil, initially developed as an oral antihypertensive, is widely used topically for hair regrowth. Off-label applications, such as beard enhancement, have gained popularity. While generally safe, systemic absorption of topical minoxidil can lead to rare side effects, like peripheral edema. Case Presentation: A 17-year-old male developed peripheral edema seven weeks after starting topical minoxidil 5% to promote beard growth. Initially, he experienced mild headaches in the fifth week, which resolved spontaneously. By the seventh week, he noticed swelling, which was exacerbated by prolonged immobility. Diagnostic evaluations, including Doppler ultrasound, echocardiography, ECG, and blood tests, were unremarkable. Edema resolved completely one to two weeks after discontinuation of minoxidil. Conclusion: Minoxidil’s vasodilatory mechanism, which supports hair growth, can also lead to systemic effects, like peripheral edema due to fluid retention and increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. While rare with topical formulations, systemic absorption is influenced by factors, such as application area, concentration, and individual skin permeability. This case highlights a rare but clinically significant systemic side effect of topical minoxidil.",

      "abstract": "Exenatide once-weekly (EQW [2 mg s.c.]) is under development as monotherapy as an adjunct to diet and exercise or as a combination therapy with an oral antidiabetes drug(s) in adults with type 2 diabetes. This long-acting formulation contains the active ingredient of the original exenatide twice-daily (EBID) formulation encapsulated in 0.06-mm-diameter microspheres of medical-grade poly-(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG). After mechanical suspension and subcutaneous injection by the patient, EQW microspheres hydrate in situ and adhere to one another to form an amalgam. A small amount of loosely bound surface exenatide, typically less than 1%, releases in the first few hours, whereas drug located in deeper interstices diffuses out more slowly (time to maximum, ~2 weeks). Fully encapsulated exenatide (i.e., drug initially inaccessible to diffusion) releases over a still longer period (time to maximum, ~7 weeks) as the PLG matrix hydrolyzes into lactic acid and glycolic acid, which are subsequently eliminated as carbon dioxide and water. For EQW, plasma exenatide concentrations reach the therapeutic range by 2 weeks and steady state by 6-7 weeks. This gradual approach to steady state seems to improve tolerability, as nausea is less frequent with EQW than EBID. EQW administrations may be associated with palpable skin nodules that generally resolve without further medical intervention. In comparative trials, EQW improved hemoglobin A1c more than EBID, sitagliptin, pioglitazone, or insulin glargine and reduced fasting plasma glucose more than EBID. Weight loss due to EQW or EBID was similar. EQW is the first glucose-lowering agent that is administered once weekly.",

The detoxification should be planned for a time which is as stable and stress free as possible and free of distractions. The dangers of relapse with potential overdose due to loss of tolerance must be heavily emphasised. It is very desirable to involve the patient's partner or carer in the planning process. Withdrawal from opiates can be very unpleasant. The symptoms vary in severity according to factors such as the type of opiate used, the amount used, the length of use, the state of physical frailty of the patient, co-existing painful conditions and the level of motivation. Clonidine was introduced as a blood pressure-lowering drug more than three decades ago but was coincidentally found to have properties that alleviated the opiate withdrawal syndrome. Lofexidine has a similar mode of action to cloni-dine but was introduced specifically as a drug to aid opiate detoxification.",

      "title": "Haloperidol Clearly Is Neurotoxic. Should It Be Banned",
      "abstract": "Why use an old and harmful antipsychotic when safer alternatives are available? Few medications remain in use 50 years after they were launched. Advances in drug development often render older drugs obsolete because newer drugs are more efficacious or safer, or both. Consider reserpine: Nowadays, no internist would use this drug to treat hypertension, even though it was the top-selling antihypertensive 50 years ago. Why? The adverse effects profile is no longer acceptable, with safer alternatives available. Astonishingly, almost all first-generation psychotropics discovered 5 decades ago (neuroleptics, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors) are still on the formularies of most health care facilities and are used by many clinicians, especially those working with managed care organizations. Jails and prisons in the United States, where hundreds of thousands of seriously mentally ill patients are incarcerated, also use 50-year-old agents, without regard to the downside of older drugs on the body, brain, and quality of life of those incarcerated medically ill patients. If clinicians who use these decades-old drugs were to keep up with medical research and advances in knowledge, we would realize what a travesty it is to use a brain-unfriendly drug such as haloperidol when we have many safer alternatives. A massive volume of knowledge has emerged over the past 15 years about the neurotoxicity of older neuroleptics, especially haloperidol--knowledge that was completely unknown before. (a) Second-generation antipsychotics have been shown to be much safer for the brain than their older-generation counterparts (although they are not more efficacious). [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Changing awareness and changing practice I used haloperidol for 20 years, and can vouch for its unquestionable efficacy in treating delusions and hallucinations. But I have avoided using it over the past 15 years, as the neuroscience literature about its harmful effects on brain tissue emerged and multiplied. In addition, I came to realize that most psychiatric practitioners were unaware of the alarming deleterious neurologic effects of haloperidol--largely because the studies that reported those effects were published in neuroscience journals rarely read by practicing psychiatrists and nurse practitioners, and the pharmacists in charge of drug formularies at hospitals. Evidence for the grave neurotoxicity of haloperidol and other older neuroleptics, compared with atypical antipsychotics, is substantial and multifaceted. The FDA would never approve haloperidol today, given the serious harm it can do to the brain, despite its efficacy for psychosis. (It's interesting how the FDA bans a drug immediately if it causes tragic birth defects, such as thalidomide, but not if a drug is destructive to the brain tissue of a disabled adult patient. Invisible damage can be less alarming or urgent than visible damage.) Twenty-eight studies reporting the various destructive effects of older antipsychotics (especially haloperidol) on brain tissue have been published in prominent neuroscience journals, based on work in animal models, cell culture, and post-mortem human tissue. Multiple molecular mechanisms, pathways, and cascades are involved, eventuating in neuronal death. The first review and discussion of these 28 neurotoxicity studies was presented at the annual meetings of the Society of Biological Psychiatry' and the American Psychiatric Association2; a manuscript will soon be submitted for publication. …",

Pilocarpine acts directly upon the cholinergic receptor sites to mimic acetylcholine. Neostigmimine, methacholine, and bethanechol are usually contraindicated in narrow angle glaucoma. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and reduces the rate of secretion of aqueous humor. However, many drugs used systemically or in the eye for purposes other than glaucoma do raise intraocular pressure and may precipitate acute glaucoma. Those, such as belladonna alkaloids are well known. Others, such as corticosteroids are prescribed for ophthalmic use or systemically, and their intraocular pressure-heightening effect is often overlooked. Often the problem is exacerbated in older people since many take belladonna or other anticholinergic agents, and they are particularly prone to experiencing a rise in intraocular pressure.

      "abstract": "Suriclone is a new anxiolytic drug belonging to the family of cyclopyrròlones. Chemically it is entirely different from the benzodiazepines, but it acts as a benzodiazepine agonist with very high affinity to a subgroup of benzodiazepine receptors or to a special conformation of these receptors. In the present cross-over study, 33 out-patients with a diagnosis of neurotic anxiety were treated with suriclone (mean dose 2 mg/day) and diazepam (25 mg/day) in two 6-week periods. Both drugs had a significant anxiolytic effect, but diazepam appeared to have a better effect within the first 2 weeks of treatment. On the other hand, the suriclone effect showed a tendency to increase over time in contrast to the effect of diazepam. Suriclone and diazepam had a different side effect profile: suriclone produced mainly dizziness, while diazepam caused sedation. It is suggested 1) that the observation of less anxiolytic effect of suriclone reflects the special affinity of this drug to a subgroup or a subconformation of the benzodiazepine receptor, and 2) that suriclone, in spite of the tendency to lower anxiolytic effect than diazepam, may be of clinical therapeutic relevance due to a lower risk of abuse and tolerance during long-term treatment, and perhaps less respiratory depression and alcohol interaction.",

The packing does not adhere to the mucosa as does plain gauze, but comes out almost as readily as petrolatum gauze. Furthermore, if it is felt desirable to leave the packing in place a second twenty-four hours, the usual odor resulting from this will be absent and there will be less accumulation of pus in the nose. Although I have never happened to have an intracranial complication following a surgical procedure on the nose, still I feel, rightly or not, a little more secure with this packing when operating in case of a subacute condition, when, occasionally, this is necessary. The drug used is either sulfanilamide or sodium sulfathiazole (the sodium salt",

      "abstract": "Hiccups generally are self-limiting and of short duration. Those lasting more than 48 h or recurring at frequent intervals are termed persistent. There are numerous causes of hiccups, with medications implicated only rarely. While hiccups are usually benign, severe attacks may lead to exhaustion, eating difficulties, and affect quality of life. We report a case of severe hiccups in a patient receiving chemotherapy (oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin) for metastatic colorectal cancer. Hiccups began on the day following chemotherapy and continued constantly for over 30 h until relief was obtained by sucking the juice of a fresh lemonade. A similar pattern occurred in the next two chemotherapy cycles. Dexamethasone had been prescribed as prophylaxis against emesis and this was considered a possible cause. Withholding dexamethasone in the next cycle led to elimination of hiccups without having an impact on control of nausea and vomiting. A number of case reports have linked corticosteroids, particularly dexamethasone, to the occurrence of hiccups. Antineoplastic agents have occasionally been reported as causing hiccups; however, in most of these cases, corticosteroids, as part of the treatment protocol or as antiemetics, may have been a more likely cause. This case serves an as important reminder that adverse effects appearing during chemotherapy may not necessarily be due to antineoplastic agents. In the case of hiccups, oncology health professionals should review all medications and non drug-related factors before assigning causality.",

To address the extent and consequences of these discrepancies, we took a random sample of 18 common psychiatry, psychopharmacology and pharmacology texts for antipsychotic equivalence tables. We found a marked variation in stated equivalences for the majority of antipsychotics. Most affected were the high potency (haloperidol, fluphenazine) and newer (molindone) drugs, which had a 500% variance. This variation inadvertently contributes to the misuse of these agents. For instance, high-potency antipsychotics are prescribed in far larger doses than necessary, leading to decreased efficacy and increased side effects. Steps to simplify and rationalize the use of these agents are recommended.",

The most widely used club drugs are 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), also known as ecstasy; gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB); flunitrazepam (Rohypnol); and ketamine (Ketalar). These drugs are popular because of their low cost and convenient distribution as small pills, powders, or liquids. Club drugs usually are taken orally and may be taken in combination with each other, with alcohol, or with other drugs. Club drugs often are adulterated or misrepresented. Any club drug overdose should therefore be suspected as polydrug use with the actual substance and dose unknown. Persons who have adverse reactions to these club drugs are likely to consult a family physician. Toxicologic screening generally is not available for club drugs. The primary management is supportive care, with symptomatic control of excess central nervous system stimulation or depression. There are no specific antidotes except for flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine that responds to flumazenil. Special care must be taken for immediate control of hyperthermia, hypertension, rhabdomyolysis, and serotonin syndrome. Severe drug reactions can occur even with a small dose and may require critical care. Club drug over-dose usually resolves with full recovery within seven hours. Education of the patient and family is essential.",

According to the CDC, an estimate number of 1.2 million cases of giardiasis happen\r\nevery year, affecting especially schoolchildren.Nowadays, giardiasis treatment is\r\nbased on drugs from the 5-nitroimidazole family, particularly metronidazole (Flagyl),\r\nsecnidazole and tinidazole. Those drugs are indiscriminately used by the population,\r\nand it's not uncommon to find them causing clinical resistance due to inappropriate\r\nutilization and/or tratment abandon.

      "abstract": "While the emergence of drug resistance in Mycobacterium leprae was foreseen and known for a long time, it is now presented as a tragedy jeopardizing leprosy control through monotherapy. This resistance has been mainly reported in the United States. It is not observed in other parts of the world. In our opinion, the unfavorable observations made at present result from an incorrect implementation of dapsone (DDS) therapy in the patients, resulting in low sulfone blood levels, as a consequence of the use of complex disubstituted sulfones, insufficient daily dapsone dosages, irregular or noncompliance to treatment, premature interruption of treatment, etc. Two measures are required in order to prevent the emergence of primary or secondary resistance to dapsone in M. leprae. First, it is necessary to go back to the previous regimen of 200 mg dapsone daily in an adult. It yields the \"maximum tolerated effective dosage.\" It should never have been rejected in favor of 100 mg daily as currently recommended at the moment. The second measure is the implementation of multiple drug therapy (MDT), using concurrently DDS in association with rifampin and clofazimine. This is a logical and rational approach, at least from a theoretical point of view. However, MDT is most unfortunately quite expensive and therefore inapplicable in most countries with high prevalence, since they are poor and underdeveloped. Implementation of MDT also raises great problems, since dosages have to be strictly adhered to in order to prevent a potentially catastrophic emergence of multiple drug resistance in M. leprae.",

      "title": "Pathogenesis of Drug‐Induced Gingival Overgrowth. A Review of Studies in the Rat Model",
      "abstract": "D rug‐induced gingival overgrowth is a side effect associated principally with 3 types of drugs: anticonvulsant (phenytoin), immunosuppressant (cyclosporine A), and various calcium channel blockers (nifedipine, Verapamil, diltiazem). In this review, we describe the features of phenytoin‐, cyclosporine A‐ and nifedipine‐induced gingival overgrowth in rats and discuss factors influencing the onset and severity of these disorders. There are several features common to the gingival overgrowth induced by these drugs: 1) gingival overgrowth is more conspicuous in the buccal than in the lingual gingiva and less severe in the maxilla than in the mandible; 2) once the blood concentration of the drug reaches a certain level as a result of increasing the dose, the incidence of gingival overgrowth is 100% and its severity is dependent on the blood level, the most severe overgrowth being induced by cyclosporine A; 3) the duration of drug administration for maximal gingival overgrowth to develop is about 40 days; 4) the gingival overgrowth regresses spontaneously after discontinuing the drug; 5) accumulation of dental plaque is not essential for the onset of overgrowth, but plays a role in its severity; and 6) more severe overgrowth is induced in young than in old rats. Furthermore, male rats are more susceptible than females to nifedipine‐induced gingival overgrowth. These results suggest that drug‐induced gingival overgrowth in rats is dependent on the oral drug dose, blood drug level, age, and sex and that preexisting gingival inflammation is a factor relevant to its severity. Since these factors have also been suggested to be important determinants for human drug‐induced gingival overgrowth, the rat model may prove valuable in the future for elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of the disorder.

      "abstract": "Ceftriaxone is having many uses and useful “third-generation” cephalosporin that necessitates being given every day. Ceftriaxone acts as binds to one or many of the penicillin-binding proteins which inhibit the final transpeptidoglycan step of peptidoglycan synthesis in the bacterial cell wall, thus inhibiting biosynthesis and arresting cell wall assembly resulting in bacterial cell death. Ceftriaxone-associated biliary adverse events in children less than eighteen years cause biliary pseudolithiasis and scarcely nephrolithiasis often happen in children less than eighteen years after receiving overdoses of ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone perhaps binds with calcium and figure insoluble chelation leading to biliary pseudolithiasis. Cholelithiasis, increased biliary thickness, and pseudolithiasis rarely happen in a period of being a child, but there are two modes of distribu¬tion described by two peaks, the first being at an early stage of development and the second is a period of life when a child develops into an adult. Hyperbilirubinemia is significantly contraindicated for neonates administrated ceftriaxone, particularly premature neonates, because of the displacement of bilirubin from albumin-binding sites and increase in blood concentrations of free bilirubin. A child than one month old and a child less than twelve-month old in special are at great risk of poor results because of bilirubin encephalopathy. Coincident administrations of ceftriaxone with aminoglycosides such as gentamycin and loop diuretics (furosemide) perhaps increase the risk of nephrotoxicity (rapid degeneration in the kidney function to the toxic outcome of double or triple medications). Coincident administrations of ceftriaxone with anticoagulant medications such as warfarin are associated with bleeding due to increased prothrombin times, which is reversible with vitamin K.",

      "title": "Is Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of Teicoplanin Useful?",
      "abstract": "Vancomycin and teicoplanin are the glycopeptides currently in use for the treatment of infections caused by beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive organisms [1]. Teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, has a lower possibility than vancomycin to cause renal toxicity, and causes fewer anaphylactoid reactions [2]. Teicoplanin has been found to be comparable to vancomycin in efficacy [1]. As teicoplanin can be administered once daily intramuscularly as well as intravenously, it can be used for outpatient therapy of methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infections [1]. Teicoplanin completely excreted unchanged in the urine by glomerular filtration, and doses should be reduced appropriately in patients with renal dysfunction. Its pharmacokinetics include a prolonged terminal half-life of 150 to 180 h, which is important during long-term therapy [1].\r\n\r\nUsual dose and dosing interval of teicoplanin for IV injection or infusion consist initially 400 mg every 12 hours for 3 doses and subsequently 200 mg once daily (400 mg once daily for severe infections) [1, 3]. Higher doses are recommended in patients over 85 kg, or in severe burns or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection [1, 3]. For streptococcal endocarditis, initially 6 mg/kg every 12 hours for 3 doses, then 6 mg/kg once daily are typical [1, 3]. For enterococcal endocarditis, initially 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for 3 doses, then 10 mg/kg once daily are standard. For child, initially 10 mg/kg every 12 hours for 3 doses, subsequently 6 mg/kg once daily (10 mg/kg once daily for severe infections or in neutropenia) is a typical regimen [1, 3].\r\n\r\nVancomycin level monitoring is common in the hospitals with increasing minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of S. aureus (MIC creep) [1]. For complicated infections (bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, meningitis, and hospital-acquired pneumonia) and for infections caused by strains with MICs of >1 µg/mL, trough levels of 15 to 20 µg/mL are recommended [1]. Larger vancomycin doses are associated with increased nephrotoxicity [1], and monitoring of vancomycin trough serum levels is recommended in the view of avoiding nephrotoxicity [4].\r\n\r\nTherapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of teicoplanin is not routine because of the lack of evidence for dose-related adverse effects of teicoplanin [3]. However, measuring of teicoplanin plasma concentrations may help to optimize therapy in some patients. Data of teicoplainin TDM are largely lacking [1]. Harding et al. [5] reported the probability of successful treatment increased with mean pre-dose (trough) serum concentration of teicoplanin and reported that a mean daily dose of 4 mg/kg was associated with treatment failure when compared to a mean daily dose of 6 mg/kg [5]. Also, Harding et al. [5] suggested successful treatment of S. aureus septicemia with teicoplanin requires trough plasma teicoplanin concentration of >10 mg/L as a result of simulation. According to previous reports, higher trough concentrations > 20 mg/L and > 30 mg/L of teicoplanin are considered to be needed for MRSA endocardtis and osteomyelitis, respectively [6, 7].\r\n\r\nNah et al. [8] investigated the TDM of teicoplanin in clinical setting with Korean patients. They reported that there is the suboptimal concentration (< 10 mg/L) of plasma teicoplanin level in nearly half of the study patients in spite of the majority of the patients received loading dose as recommended (400 mg every 12 hours for three times), and emphasized the importance of loading dose and routine TDM of teicoplanin [8]. This article focused the roles of TDM for the optimal efficacy of therapeutic drug, not for avoiding adverse effects of a drug.\r\n\r\nAn area under curve (AUC)/MIC value of ≥400 was associated with a successful outcome with human pharmacodynamic study for vancomycin [9]. The vancomycin target was identified in patients with pulmonary infections [9]. However, established pharmacodynamic targets were not available for teicoplanin [10]. An AUC/MIC value of teicoplanin to Staphylococcus considered important pharmacodynamics parameter [10]. There is no information about MIC values of pathogens and AUC/MIC values and a peak concentrations in the study by Nah et al. [8]. The TDM for vancomycin therapy has been shown to be a cost-effective procedure [11]. However, cost effective study of teicoplanin TDM is still largely lacking. Nah et al. [8] reported the first study about teicoplanin TDM in Korea, which emphasize the importance of loading dose and TDM of teicoplanin. The limitations of this study include that the association between plasma concentrations of teicoplanin and clinical therapeutic effects are not evaluated.\r\n\r\nWe can expect the usefulness of teicoplanin TDM in the same respect of vancomycin TDM. However, we are currently in need of data of pharmacokinetics, clinical pharmacodynamics and TDM of teicoplanin in clinical setting, because of its current significant role for anti-MRSA treatment.",

      "title": "Periodic Treatment with Autologous Erythrocytes Loaded with Dexamethasone 21-Phosphate for Fistulizing Pediatric Crohn's Disease",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Steroids have been used for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) since the 1970s with satisfactory results. Unfortunately, most patients with CD develop a dependency to the treatment, and this means that they cannot taper or rapidly flare (usually within 6 months) after steroid withdrawal (1-3). For this reason and for the consideration that long-term use of steroids can produce a variety of metabolic, endocrine, and growth adverse effects (4), alternative forms of treatment have been experimented with. Nutritional treatment has been widely used, especially in pediatrics, in the acute form of CD, and this treatment can produce mucosal healing. However, there are major problems with compliance, especially in cases of relapse (5). Immunosuppressive agents (for example, azathioprine) are also used to keep remission at bay in steroid-dependent patients or nonresponders in corticosteroid therapy (5-7). In recent years, tumor necrosis factor-α antibodies (Infliximab) have been successfully used in patients with CD resistant to conventional treatment, and it has been shown to be particularly effective in the fistulizing forms of the disease but sometimes can cause severe side effects and infections that force the end of the treatment (5,8-10). To treat steroid-dependent patients who did not respond or reacted to alternative treatments, a new way to deliver steroids was developed (11). It was demonstrated that erythrocytes, because of the ability of their membrane to be opened and resealed, provide an excellent vehicle for the target delivery of drugs. In particular, dexamethasone 21-phosphate (Dex 21P), a nondiffusible pro-drug, can be encapsulated in human erythrocytes where is dephosphorylated to dexamethasone and slowly released into circulation (12,13). The erythrocyte-mediated delivery of this drug was studied in adult patients affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, showing positive results without appearance of side effects (11). We recently published the positive effects of this treatment in patients affected by cystic fibrosis with improvement of their respiratory performance without any side effects even after 15 months of continuous treatment. In these patients, pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that a single administration of drug-loaded erythrocytes (8.9 ± 3.8 mg of Dex-21P) was able to maintain detectable dexamethasone concentrations in the blood for up to 4 weeks (0.02-0.1 nmol/mL plasma) (14). We report the case of a 16-year-old patient affected by fistulizing CD and who was corticodependent who presented severe adverse effects when infliximab was used and who we are currently treating with periodic infusions of autologous erythrocytes loaded with Dex 21P with good results. CASE REPORT Our patient, female, presented at the age of 10 years to another hospital with weight loss, irritability, headache, muscle pain, anorexia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and low-grade fever. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was normal, but colonoscopy revealed aphthous ulcers in the colon and a cobble-stone aspect in the last 20 cm of the terminal ileum. Biopsy results confirmed the diagnosis of an ileo-colic CD. She was treated successfully with prednisolone and mesalazine. Subsequently, she had numerous episodes of relapse that were treated with prednisolone and metronidazole. For the appearance of side effects caused by prolonged use of steroids and the development of a perianal fistula, she was started on nutritional treatment, first with an elemental formula and then with a polymeric one. To keep remission at bay, she needed several courses of nutritional treatment with good compliance. Almost immediate relapse occurred when nutritional therapy was stopped. At the age of 16 years, she presented to our hospital with severe abdominal pain and a history of presence of feces in the urine. An abdominal ultrasound showed a parauterine abscess with a rectovesical fistula and an enterocutaneous fistula from the umbilicus to the terminal ileum. She refused further course of nutritional treatment, and therefore she was treated with prednisolone (60 mg/day) and antibiotics without any result. Afterward, she was treated for 24 weeks with budesonide (9 mg/day) and azathioprine (2 mg/kg/day). Because of almost no response to treatment, she was started on infliximab at the dose of 5 mg/kg. The result was excellent: her enterovesical and enterocutaneous fistula were closed, and the clinical condition improved rapidly after the first infusion. Unfortunately, despite premedication with steroids and antihistaminic, she developed a severe anaphylactic reaction at the beginning of the second infusion and the treatment had to be suspended. Her fistulas reopened, and she continued to have open fistulas despite antibiotic treatments and bowel rest. A new cycle of corticosteroid therapy was administered with slight improvement of her conditions, but her fistulas stayed opened. At this point, we decided to start treatment with periodic infusions of autologous erythrocytes loaded with Dex 21P. We chose a 4 week periodic infusion scheme because previous pharmacokinetic studies show stable drug levels for 4 weeks (14). For the procedure for the encapsulation of Dex 21P, a specially designed \"red cell loader\" apparatus, as previously described (12), was used. Essential steps of the process involve swelling of the patient's red blood cells in hypotonic solutions, entrapping Dex 21P, resealing of erythrocytes, and their reinfusion into the original donor (13). This procedure is completed in 3 hours at room temperature and under blood-banking conditions. Infusions began in October 2001, and she is continuing to have them every 4 weeks. The enterocutaneous fistula starts closing after every infusion, with stopping of external drainage and seldom reopened few days before the following infusion. After the fourth infusion, her enterovesical fistula closed, and she started having normal urine examinations. The patient, 3 years after beginning the infusions, feels well and is able to conduct a normal life. We used the pediatric Crohn activity index (pCDAI) (15) to evaluate her clinical condition. Her mean pCDAI decreased from 33 (range 25-40) 3 years before the beginning of treatment to 13 (range 10-20) during the 3 years of treatment (Fig. 1). She continues medical treatment with mesalazine 800 mg twice a day and azathioprine at 2 mg/kg per day. She is not showing any signs of common steroids side effects; in particular, she has not had any hematologic and ocular side effects. She never again needed any further corticosteroids treatment, either orally or intravenously. She had a computerized bone mineralometry-dual energy x-ray examination performed at the beginning of treatment that showed a Z-score of -1.3 SD; subsequent examination performed after 24 months did not show any worsening. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and a colonoscopy performed 24 months after the beginning of treatment showed endoscopic and histologic remission.FIG. 1: pCDAI 36 months before and 36 months after the beginnig of treatment with autologous erytrocytes loaded with Dex 21P.DISCUSSION One of the major problems in managing inflammatory bowel diseases and in particular CD is maintenance of clinical, biochemical, and histologic remission as long as possible. At the moment, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and other immunosuppressants and infliximab are the available drugs used for this purpose. Unfortunately, the prolonged use of these drugs is harmful. The prolonged use of corticosteroids is associated with the risk of clinically significant adverse effects such as high blood pressure, growth impairment, glucose intolerance, osteopenia and osteoporosis, water retention, and hirsutism (4). Furthermore, adolescent patients do not cope very well with their physical image alteration secondary to prolonged use of steroids. Infliximab is a new, revolutionary treatment, especially in cases of fistulizing CD. Unfortunately, severe side effects have been described (8-10). Diagnosis of CD in our patient was made at 10 years of age, and for 6 years, many kinds of available treatment strategies (mesalazine, prednisone, budesonide, immunosuppressant, nutritional treatment) were tried without obtaining long remission periods. She also underwent Infliximab treatment, but unfortunately, she developed a severe reaction after the first infusion. In a recent paper, we evaluated the safety and the efficacy of the administration of low doses of dexamethasone delivered by autologous erythrocytes in patients affected by cystic fibrosis, and we showed that the procedure was safe with benefits for patients (improvement of respiratory function) and without side effects (14). Analogue results were obtained in adult patients affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (13). On the basis of these encouraging results, we decided to try this form of treatment in patients affected by inflammatory bowel diseases, in particular in those affected by CD, with the purpose of long-term maintenance of remission. We were encouraged to use this treatment in our patient because of a lack of response to other forms of treatment and the impossibility of continuing Infliximab therapy. At the beginning of treatment, she had a pCDAI of 27 and two open fistulas (entero-vesical and entero-cutaneous). Unexpectedly, soon after the first infusion, the entero-cutaneous fistula closed with stopping of the external drainage, whereas the entero-vesical fistula closed definitively. She started having normal urine examinations after the forth infusion. Glucocorticoids are used to interfere with some inflammatory pathways and for this purpose are used in several inflammatory diseases. Nevertheless, the good results of corticosteroids treatment is influenced by several factors. As compared with other conventional steroids used for patients affected by inflammatory bowel disease such as prednisone, methylprednisone, and prednisolone, dexamethasone has fivefold higher anti-inflammatory activity, no mineralocorticoid activity, and a longer half life. Furthermore, our methods of delivering dexamethasone use the ability of erythrocytes to slowly release the drug, assuring a stable, continuous drug level in the blood that can have a therapeutic effect but is not high enough to give side effects. Our patient has been receiving this form of treatment for 3 years and has never presented steroid-related side effects. In particular, she has never had high blood pressure, moon-like face, hypertrichosis, and worsening of her osteopenia. She also reports a sensation of well-being with improvement of her quality of life, and her clinical improvement is also confirmed by the fall of her pCDAI (Fig. 1). In conclusion, our experience demonstrates the efficacy and the safety of prolonged treatment with periodic infusion of autologous erythrocytes loaded with Dex 21P, even in patients with fistulizing CD not responding or intolerant to conventional treatment.",

Moreover, the presence of diclofenac in ecosystems directly affects the health of living organisms, even if it is present at trace. Therefore, the development of analytical tools for diclofenac monitoring was needed. In this context, electrochemical sensing and biosensing methods have been commonly reported. In this review, a critical evaluation of the methods employed for diclofenac analysis is presented according to the following classifications: potentiometric sensors, sensing at non-modified solid electrodes, chemically modified electrodes and biosensors. Recent developments related to the use of electrochemical detection of diclofenac in pharmaceutical formulations, biological fluids and environmental samples were reported and discussed.",

It was found in a test of the gastric juice that the patient had gastric achylia where the acidity of gastric juice might have prevented the disintegration. The fact seems important to discuss because gastric achylia is not a rare symptom and because the drug is excreted without any effect in such patient.

      "abstract": "For 40 years, disulfiram has been the alcohol-aversive drug used most frequently by American physicians in the treatment of alcohol dependency disorders. We reviewed the clinical literature regarding the risks, benefits, indications, and efficacy of this controversial drug and summarized current knowledge of this therapy.Disulfiram will produce an aversive reaction with ethanol, usually at a dose between 250 mg/day and 500 mg/day, although some patients may not have an aversive reaction at this level. Cardiac, hepatic, and neurologic toxicity can also occur within this dosage range. If disulfiram is to be used, the patient must clearly understand the risks of drinking while taking the drug, and the physician and patient must agree about the need for continued clinical supervision and monitoring for efficacy and side effects. The physician must also recognize that disulfiram is only an adjunctive therapy and that continued support, supervision, and other therapeutic measures are required. Disulfiram is probably effective in reducing the frequency of alcohol consumption in the compliant patient over the short term (e.g., 6 months). Certain subgroups of patients, such as those who are older, those who are more socially stable, and those who are well-motivated, may experience a beneficial effect for longer periods. The drug may be most effective in reducing short-term alcohol consumption when the compliance of the patient is supervised, although consideration of this kind of therapy includes the practical problems of supervising the patient and concerns that the supervising person may be placed in a difficult position. Prescription of disulfiram without accompanying education, counseling, and concomitant alcoholism therapy is not beneficial. Disulfiram has no proven effect on the long-term outcome of alcoholism.",

Pentoxifylline is a hemorheologic agent with primary actions that include increasing erythrocyte flexibility, reducing blood viscosity and increasing microcirculatory flow and tissue perfusion. The result is improved supply of oxygen to ischemic muscles of the limbs. In several double‐blind studies, pentoxifylline increased walking distance of patients with intermittent claudication in comparison to placebo or vasodilators. Like other methylxanthines, pentoxifylline is well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, almost completely metabolized in the body and excreted in the urine. The most significant difference in its pharmacokinetics is that, unlike other methylxanthines, it is bound to the erythrocytic membrane where it is initially metabolized. Although pentoxifylline has been shown to be effective in the treatment of intermittent claudication, additional research is needed to determine its use as adjunctive therapy in patients with concurrent coronary or cerebrovascular disease.",

      "title": "An unusual case of dependence of megadose of veterinary intravenous pheniramine with opioid use disorder",
      "abstract": "Sir, Pheniramine maleate is an alkylamine-derived histamine 1 (H1) antagonist, used for the treatment of allergic conditions.[1] It is widely available over-the-counter (OTC) under the trade name Avil. It has a strong sedative effect and may also lead to euphoria.[1] Psychological tolerance to the sedation and physical withdrawal symptoms following pheniramine abuse have been documented but surveying literature on pheniramine dependence yielded limited case reports on the same.[1,2,3,4] Here, we present an unusual case of heavy dose pheniramine addiction, who abused injections meant for veterinary use with comorbid opioid dependence. Our case is the first of its kind ever reported of such megadoses of pheniramine abuse. A 29-year-old male presented to the psychiatry outpatient, with a history of opioid intake in the form of smack, melted and mixed with injection pheniramine maleate, intravenously for the last 8 months. He desired assistance to quit the substance and was admitted. He used 100 mg of melted smack mixed with 15 ml of injection pheniramine, intravenously, 4–5 times daily. He denied intake of any other substance. Initially, he started abusing in an attempt to deal with his sleep problems, being introduced by a friend. He mixed 1 ampoule (5 ml) of Avil with 50 mg smack, two times a day, after which he could sleep better, but steadily the sleep problems returned, and he increased the dose of both pheniramine and opioids to 60–75 ml/day and 100 mg/day. respectively, in 6 months. It became difficult for him to procure multiple ampoules from a pharmacy, thus, he started buying 100 ml bottles of injection pheniramine maleate for veterinary use [Panavil; see [Figure 1]]. Any attempt to decrease the dose would lead to reappearance of insomnia, restlessness, and tremulousness.Figure 1: Pheniramine maleate (Panavil) for veterinary useOn physical examination, he had multiple needle puncture wounds on his left arm.

He was started on tapentadol 300 mg, pregabalin 150 mg, and quetiapine 50 mg, to manage his withdrawal symptoms and sleep problems. Tapentadol was down-tapered. The Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale decreased from 13 on the day of admission to 4 on discharge. He scored high on Barratt Impulsivity Scale, with a score of 92. Addiction Severity Index scored high in drug-8 and family/social relationship-7 problems. The patient was started on relapse prevention therapy and was discharged on tapentadol 50 mg, pregabalin 75 mg, and quetiapine 25 mg, with a plan to continue psychotherapy sessions on follow-up. Scarcity of literature exists regarding pheniramine addiction. Few case reports emphasized the easy availability of antihistamines, pheniramine potential for overdose and dependence, and the necessity for strict vigilance of OTC drugs.[1,2] Pal et al. discussed two cases of psychiatric comorbidity associated with pheniramine abuse.[2] Buckley et al. conducted a study on 102 subjects, suggesting that pheniramine is a much-abused drug, more likely to be used in overdose, and appears to be more proconvulsant, as compared to other antihistamines.[3] Orum reported a case of pheniramine dependence who abused up to 1100 mg/day intravenously.[4] Our case used massive doses of pheniramine, 1350–1700 mg/day with melted opioids parenterally and easily assessed veterinary injections. This might be the heaviest dose of pheniramine abuse reported to date. Some H1 antagonists stimulate dopamine transmission in the nucleus accumbens in rats, similar to cocaine.[5] This could be maybe a probable reason for their addictive potential, although further investigation is warranted regarding the exact mechanism. Our case concludes that pheniramine has a dependence potential. OTC medication abuse seems to be underreported and could be an emerging medical concern in the ensuing years. Medical practitioners should routinely inquire about their use. Pharmacists should also get involved in identifying the habitual users and denying dispensing drugs without a prescription. We enunciate the need for the formulation of specific rules and regulations to supervise the availability of both human and veterinary drugs.

      "title": "Thiazolidinediones: tentative steps forward",
      "abstract": "The sulphonylureas and biguanides have been the mainstays of oral treatment for type 2 diabetes for nearly five decades. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study established the effectiveness of these drugs in improving long-term outcomes.1, 2 The subsequent arrival of the thiazolidinediones (glitazones) brought new opportunities for managing type 2 diabetes. By reducing insulin resistance, drugs in the latter class offer a complementary mode of action to the aforementioned agents and as such provide a potentially attractive addition to the armamentarium. Clinical trials have established that the currently available agents, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone, can reduce blood glucose when used either as monotherapy, or in combination with metformin, sulphonylureas or insulin. Until very recently (see below), the use of glitazones in the United Kingdom, reflecting the situation within the European Union in general, has been restricted to (a) combination therapy with metformin in obese patients where glycaemic control is inadequate despite maximal tolerated doses of oral monotherapy, and (b) in combination with a sulphonylurea where metformin is not tolerated or is contraindicated. What do the clinical trials tell us about the glucose-lowering effects of the glitazones? To take some examples, six months' treatment with rosiglitazone in combination with 2.5g metformin per day reduced HbA1c by 1% (4mg daily) and by 1.2% (8mg daily) relative to placebo.3 The efficacy of rosiglitazone is generally greater in overweight subjects,4 appears to be consistent across different ethnic groups5 and extends to at least 18 months, among responders. The picture is similar for pioglitazone. Thus, 16 weeks' therapy with 30mg daily of pioglitazone in combination with metformin reduced HbA1c by 0.83% relative to placebo, with evidence of effectiveness extending out to at least 72 weeks.6 Rosiglitazone has also been shown to produce significant reductions in HbA1c in combination with a sulphonylurea over six months. At a dose of 1mg b.d. (a dose not used in the UK) HbA1c was reduced by 0.59% and at 2mg b.d. (4mg preparation in the UK) HbA1c was reduced by 1.03% relative to placebo.7 Over 16 weeks, pioglitazone 15mg daily in combination with a sulphonylurea reduced HbA1c by 0.9% relative to placebo, 30mg daily reducing HbA1c by 1.3%.8 As monotherapy, rosiglitazone has been shown to produce dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c over 26 weeks, with reductions relative to placebo of 0.8% on 4mg o.d., 0.9–1.2% on 2mg b.d. and 1.5% on 4mg b.d. (licensed dose 4mg o.d., increasing to 4mg b.d., in the UK).9, 10 Pioglitazone monotherapy produces dose-dependent reductions in HbA1c with falls of 1% relative to placebo using 15mg and 30mg o.d. and 1.6% relative to placebo using 45mg (new licensed dose up to 45mg in UK).11 Note that a significant glucose-lowering effect of glitazone in combination therapy may be delayed for several weeks, requiring up to 12–16 weeks to become fully apparent. Although it is difficult to compare the trials directly, on higher doses in combination therapy approximately 50% of patients will have a reduction in HbA1c of 0.6% or greater. Both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are generally well tolerated with similar side effect profiles.12, 13 As a class, the glitazones are associated with weight gain (circa 5% of body weight), a prospect that patients invariably find disagreeable. Weight gain tends to be greater in combination with a sulphonylurea than with metformin, mirroring the intrinsic properties of the latter agents. Peripheral oedema is another unwanted effect, recorded in approximately 5% of patients in studies of combination therapy. Oedema is usually mild and has tended not to be associated with signs or symptoms of heart failure; however, note that patients with pre-existing heart failure tended to be excluded from trials (see below). When glitazone-induced oedema occurs it is generally unresponsive to diuretics. The withdrawal of the first glitazone to reach the market, troglitazone, following a series of cases of severe liver toxicity – including fatalities – inevitably focused attention on the effects of rosiglitazone and pioglitazone on liver function. To date there has been no evidence to suggest a class effect for the devastating hepatotoxicity that led to the demise of troglitazone (which was, incidentally, well regarded as an insulin sensitiser by some clinicians). Nonetheless, confirmation of satisfactory liver function tests before commencing drug therapy followed by monitoring two-monthly for the first year after starting therapy continues to be recommended. While direct head-to-head data comparing rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are not available, current information, such as it is, suggests that their effects on hyperglycaemia are broadly similar.14, 15 Perhaps partly driven by this equivalence, much interest has surrounded potentially beneficial non-glucose-lowering effects of the drugs. Particular attention has focused on apparent differences in the effects of the glitazones on circulating lipids and apoproteins. Both drugs cause a small but significant rise in cardioprotective high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of approximately 10–12%. Pioglitazone also tends to reduce hypertriglyceridaemia, being broadly neutral, compared with placebo, as far as its effect on total cholesterol is concerned. In contrast, rosiglitazone appears to have no consistent effect on triglycerides and can cause a rise in both total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The long-term implications of these changes are presently unclear.15 In the absence of outcome data, qualitative changes including increased LDL-particle buoyancy and reductions in apolipoprotein B have been invoked; the implication is that the net effect of these changes could be cardioprotective. Interest has also surrounded potentially favourable effects on inflammatory cytokines, blood pressure, vascular intimal hyperplasia and the pro-thrombotic state that is associated with insulin resistance.16 Again, the clinical significance of these effects remains uncertain; several clinical trials with cardiovascular endpoints are currently in progress. With evidence of effectiveness in reducing hyperglycaemia, an acceptable safety profile when used appropriately, theoretical benefits on multiple aspects of cardiovascular risk and little evidence to date of drug interactions, use of glitazones is an attractive option for selected patients. However, these agents are significantly more expensive than some of the more traditional drugs already available. Moreover, an evidence base of clinical outcomes is lacking for the glitazones; some patients simply don't respond well to these agents. Shortly after their launch, both drugs were reviewed by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE);17, 18 this guidance was recently subject to a planned reappraisal.19 In the original guidance for rosiglitazone (in 2000) and pioglitazone (in 2001), the clinical potential of both drugs was recognised – up to a point. It was felt that the use of either glitazones in combination therapy with metformin or a sulphonylurea offered no clear advantage over the combination of metformin + sulphonylurea, particularly in the absence of outcome or cost effectiveness data. The original NICE guidance suggested that patients inadequately controlled on oral monotherapy should first be offered combination therapy with metformin + sulphonylurea wherever possible; patients could subsequently be offered a glitazone (a) if either drug in the original combination was not tolerated or was contraindicated or (b) if glycaemic control remained insufficient despite an adequate trial of the metformin + sulphonylurea combination. Of the options, use of a glitazone + metformin was preferred over combination therapy with a sulphonylurea. The view of the role of glitazones has not fundamentally changed in the recent reappraisal. However, some aspects of the recommendations have evolved. It has now been recognised that the assumptions underpinning substitution of a glitazone for a sulphonylurea or metformin in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on combination metformin + sulphonylurea therapy were not supported; this practice often led to a temporary deterioration in glycaemic control and is no longer advised. The new guidance is also more directive about reviewing drug use, suggesting that if glitazone combination therapy fails to achieve adequate glycaemic control (between 6.5% and 7.5%) within six months, consideration should be given to changing to insulin treatment, avoiding long-term use of a potentially sub-optimal oral drug combination and encouraging closer patient monitoring. Audit measures have been suggested (NICE guideline appendix C) to ensure use of glitazones within the new guidelines. If the updated NICE guidelines for use of glitazones are followed rigorously and audited, utilisation of glitazones in England and Wales will remain somewhat restricted. Although there may be special groups, e.g. those with renal impairment, wherein glitazones might offer a safer alternative to a sulphonylurea or metformin, neither metformin nor glitazones should be used in patients with heart failure or significant hepatic impairment. As for drug intolerance, while an appreciable proportion of patients starting metformin therapy develop gastrointestinal side effects, these are often self-limiting, few patients not being able to tolerate any dose. Contraindications to sulphonylureas which would make a metformin + glitazone combination the first choice are few, sulphonylureas being well tolerated by the majority of patients. What of so-called triple therapy? Some evidence of the effectiveness of this approach – glitazone + metformin + sulphonylurea – has accrued since the original NICE guidance.20 Patients with inadequate glycaemic control on a metformin + sulphonylurea combination who have sound reasons to avoid insulin (e.g. impact on occupation) may wish to be considered for a trial of such a combination. Triple therapy is currently outside the licence for both rosiglitazone and pioglitazone. While the updated NICE appraisal recognises the fact that some patients are treated with triple therapy, no guidance on this point is provided; this reflects the remit of NICE, which is unable to recommend use of drugs outside their licensed indications. Clinicians who elect to adopt this approach should ensure that the patient is able to make an informed decision; if glycaemic targets are not attained, transfer to insulin is likely to be necessary.21 Glitazones require the presence of sufficient insulin to exert their glucose-lowering effects; their introduction late in the natural history of type 2 diabetes, when endogenous insulin production is severely compromised, is therefore at odds with theoretical benefits of using glitazones at an early stage. The 2003 guidance from NICE on use of glitazones goes some way to countering the uncertainties imbued by the original recommendations.21 However, hard on the heels of the revised NICE-guidance – literally days afterwards – came the news that the licence for both drugs has been extended by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal products. The new licence permits use of glitazones as monotherapy in overweight patients who are inadequately controlled with diet and exercise and who are intolerant of metformin, or where metformin is contraindicated. Combination therapy with insulin remains a contraindication, contrasting with the situation in the United States where clinicians attest to the utility of this approach. It seems unlikely that the 2003 NICE guidance will be re-reviewed in the immediate future to incorporate the updated licences. As with combination therapy, use as monotherapy has come with strings attached, i.e. only in the overweight for whom metformin is not tolerated or contraindicated. Thus, while progress has been made, some of the hesitancy and circumspection that has surrounded use of the glitazones seems set to continue, at least for the time being.

AJK has acted as a consultant to GlaxoSmithKline and Takeda and has received remuneration for participation in educational activities funded by both companies.

Early studies with this drug suggested that it possessed high analgesic potency, few respiratory or circulatory side effects, and low addiction liability In this study, the relative respiratory depressant activity of equivalent analgesic doses of phenazocine and morphine were determined in normal adult males. Although there was significantly less respiratory depression I hour after phenazocine than after morphine, this difference was small and probably not of clinical significance. Respiratory depression persisted 3 hours after phenazocine, whereas morphine depression was waning at this time. On the basis of respiratory effects, peak action of phenazocine occurred between 30 and 90 minutes after intramuscular administration, and it persisted longer than morphine.",

Insulin degludec is a novel acylated basal insulin with a unique mechanism of protracted absorption involving the formation of a depot of soluble multihexamer chains after subcutaneous injection. PK/PD studies show that insulin degludec has a very long duration of action, with a half-life exceeding 25 h. Once-daily dosing produces a steady-state profile characterized by a near-constant effect, which varies little from injection to injection in a given patient. Clinically, insulin degludec has been shown consistently to carry a lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia than once-daily insulin glargine, in both basal+bolus and basal-only insulin regimens. The constancy of the steady-state profile of insulin degludec also means that day-to-day irregularities at the time of injection have relatively little PD influence, thereby offering the possibility of greater treatment flexibility for patients.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have shown an increase in the use of the so-called “designer drugs.” This term is usually applied to recreational drugs that are new, synthetic and emerge as unscheduled drugs since they have not been in existence long enough to be illegal. These drugs are usually available at “head shops”, tobacco stores, gas stations and via the internet. Several such classes have gained increasing notoriety in the past 3-4 years, especially Spice and bath salts. One class that has gone almost unrecognized is the 2C class.\r\nThe 2C’s are a class of synthetic hallucinogens known as phenethylamines, the same class as the naturally occurring drug mescaline. Few case reports of actual overdoses from 2C compounds have been reported, but some of the physical stigmata of use or overdose are thought to be pupil dilation, facial flushing, diaphoresis, bruxism, facial grimacing, tachycardia, tachypnea, emotional lability, and subjective symptoms such as accelerated internal clock, and detachment from surroundings. There are no known screening tests to easily detect the substance. However, it has been shown to be detected in rat urine using gas-chromatographic-mass spectrometry (GM-MS) as well as in human blood plasma using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and in human urine by capillary electrophoresis-MS [11,23]. Recommended treatment is similar for treatment of most hallucinogenic or sympathomimetic overdoses, and includes supportive care, benzodiazepines, and placing patient in a calm, quiet setting. Use of SSRI for “bad trips” has been described in the lay literature, but is not recommended [ 20].",

      "title": "Drug-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiotoxicity",
      "abstract": "Mitochondria has an essential role in myocardial tissue homeostasis; thus deterioration in mitochondrial function eventually leads to cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell death and consequent cardiovascular dysfunction. Several chemical compounds and drugs have been known to directly or indirectly modulate cardiac mitochondrial function, which can account both for the toxicological and pharmacological properties of these substances. In many cases, toxicity problems appear only in the presence of additional cardiovascular disease conditions or develop months/years following the exposure, making the diagnosis difficult. Cardiotoxic agents affecting mitochondria include several widely used anticancer drugs [anthracyclines (Doxorubicin/Adriamycin), cisplatin, trastuzumab (Herceptin), arsenic trioxide (Trisenox), mitoxantrone (Novantrone), imatinib (Gleevec), bevacizumab (Avastin), sunitinib (Sutent), and sorafenib (Nevaxar)], antiviral compound azidothymidine (AZT, Zidovudine) and several oral antidiabetics [e.g., rosiglitazone (Avandia)]. Illicit drugs such as alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, ecstasy, and synthetic cannabinoids (spice, K2) may also induce mitochondria-related cardiotoxicity. Mitochondrial toxicity develops due to various mechanisms involving interference with the mitochondrial respiratory chain (e.g., uncoupling) or inhibition of the important mitochondrial enzymes (oxidative phosphorylation, Szent-Györgyi-Krebs cycle, mitochondrial DNA replication, ADP/ATP translocator). The final phase of mitochondrial dysfunction induces loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in mitochondrial oxidative/nitrative stress, eventually culminating into cell death. This review aims to discuss the mechanisms of mitochondrion-mediated cardiotoxicity of commonly used drugs and some potential cardioprotective strategies to prevent these toxicities.",

      "abstract": "Purpose. The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions, and role in therapy of vildagliptin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus were reviewed. Summary. Vildagliptin is an agent in a new class of medications called dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors. By inhibiting DPP4, vildagliptin causes an increase in glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an intestinal hormone that aids in glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion. The manufacturer of vildagliptin received an approvable letter from the Food and Drug Administration in late February 2007. Vildagliptin has a halflife of about 90 minutes; however, ≥50% of DPP4 inhibition continues for more than 10 hours, allowing for once- or twice-daily dosing. Clinical trials have shown that vildagliptin is effective in significantly lowering glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose, and prandial glucose levels. Beta-cell function may also be improved. The most common adverse effects in patients receiving vildagliptin included headache, nasopharyngitis, cough, constipation, dizziness, and increased sweating. In most studies, the rate of hypoglycemia appeared to be similar to that of placebo. Conclusion. In clinical trials of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, vildagliptin has been shown to reduce HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose levels, prandial glucose levels, and prandial glucagon secretion and to improve β-cell function. If vildagliptin is approved for marketing, it will add to the available treatment options for diabetes and will provide patients and health care providers with another noninjectable therapy option.",

Depending on when it is injected, each component of the insulin regimen has a maximal effect on a specific period of the 24-hour cycle (e.g., overnight, morning, afternoon, or evening). The glucose pattern in that period determines whether the dose of that component of the insulin regimen requires adjusting. Regarding which insulin types and insulin regimens to use, human insulin (NPH and regular) is as effective as analog insulins, and a two-injection intensified insulin regimen is as effective as a four-injection regimen.",

      "abstract": "Penicillin was discovered serendipitously by Alexander Fleming in 1928 while he was examining Staphylococcus variants. The first trials of penicillin in humans who had serious staphylococcal infections were undertaken more than I decade later and yielded impressive therapeutic results. Despite the introduction of numerous other antimicrobial agents and the emergence of many organisms resistant to penicillin, this agent remains a powerful and essential antibiotic 50 years after its first clinical application. Pharmacology The basic structure of the penicillins consists of the thiazolidine ring, a beta-lactam ring, and a side chain (Figure 1). The antimicrobial activity of all penicillins is produced by the thiazolidine/beta-lactam nucleus, and the organism-specific activity of a particular penicillin is determined by the side chain derivative. There are many naturally occurring side chain derivatives, but penicillin G is the most potent of these and, therefore, the only one used clinically. Semisynthetic penicillins are constructed from the basic penicillin nucleus with a side chain added. Each side chain alters the susceptibility of a particular penicillin to inactivating enzymes. MECHANISM OF ACTION All pencillins work by inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis, thereby affecting the stability of the cell wall and subsequent bacterial development. The cell wall is made of a peptidoglycan that is synthesized in three stages. MECHANISM OF ACTION",

Although no studies exist showing the drug to be mutagenic, teratogenic, or carcinogenic in humans, animal and laboratory tests raise concern of this possibility. For this reason, metronidazole therapy should be stopped in two to six months if ineffective and stopped periodically when disease is controlled to see if it can be discontinued.",

Bleomycin is used primarily in the chemotherapy of squamous cell carcinomas, lymphomas, and testicular carcinoma, while cisplatin possesses significant activity against testicular and ovarian carcinoma, head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, and neuroblastoma. Bleomycin is rapidly excreted renally (terminal phase half-life = 2–4 h), although enzymatic inactivation also occurs in many tissues. Cisplatin is nonenzymatically converted to highly protein bound metabolites, which then undergo renal elimination, but total body clearance occurs much more slowly than with bleomycin (terminal phase half-life = 40–50 h). Both agents have acute and chronic toxicities; the acute toxicities are generally reversible but cause a great deal of patient discomfort, while the chronic toxicities are often irreversible and dose-limiting. For bleomycin, the acute toxicities are mucocutaneous and pyretic; severe nausea and vomiting represents the major acute toxicity of cisplatin therapy. Cumulative dose-related pulmonary toxicity is the most serious chronic toxicity of bleomycin. The clinical, radiographic, and pathologic presentations are nonspecific, although identification of high risk patients may be possible with serial pulmonary function tests. Cumulative nephrotoxicity occurs with cisplatin use, and its incidence and severity can be reduced by maintaining adequate hydration and diuresis during and following administration of the drug.",

      "abstract": "Interactions with oral contraceptives (OCs) occur with drugs commonly used to treat epilepsy, tuberculosis, and depression. Most women are more likely to use antibiotics, analgesics, and antihistamines, which have also been shown to interact with OCs. The mechanisms behind these interactions may be hepatic microsomal enzyme induction or inhibition, interference with the enterohepatic circulation of steroid metabolites, interference with absorption, competition between two drugs for the same metabolizing enzyme, or induction of an opposite physiologic effect. Rifampin was the first drug reported to interfere with the efficacy of OCs. The anticonvulsants and certain antibiotics, namely ampicillin and tetracycline, also decrease the efficacy of OCs. Oral contraceptives also interfere with the metabolism of other drugs. Plasma concentrations of theophylline, diazepam, and certain other benzodiazepines are increased by OC steroids. Because OCs interact with a wide variety of prescription and over-the-counter medications, a thorough drug history should be taken in all patients taking OCs.",

      "abstract": "The oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have made a valuable contribution to the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). PDE5 inhibitors enhance cavernosal smooth muscle relaxation, vasodilatation and penile erection. However, PDE5 inhibitors are not always effective. Decreased efficacy, cost, incorrect administration, lack of sexual stimulation, vascular risk factors associated with ED and vascular or neurogenic diseases are causes of PDE5 inhibitor failure. Tachyphylaxis may also occur. This is defined as reduced tissue responsiveness to a drug in the presence of a constant concentration of this drug. Treatment failure may cause considerable distress. If dose titration, more attempts and continuous dosing of PDE5 inhibitors (taken on a daily basis) fail to resolve the initial PDE5 inhibitor failure, clinicians need to consider alternative treatments. These include sublingual apomorphine, intracavernosal/intraurethral pharmacotherapy, vacuum devices, the insertion of a prosthesis and penile vascular surgery. Combination therapy like prostaglandin E(1) (PGE(1)) with doxazosin (dox; an alpha-1-blocker) or ketanserin (ketan; a 5-HT(2) antagonist) as well as other pro-erection agents, like Endothelin-1 antagonists, angiotensin II antagonists (valsartan/losartan), adrenomedullin, Rho kinase inhibitors and nitric oxide (NO) donors may be beneficial in the treatment of ED. However, these combination therapies need to be validated. Adding an androgen to a PDE5 inhibitor may help when circulatory testosterone levels are low. The early use of PDE5 inhibitors in patients with hypertension, hyperlipidaemia or diabetes with concomitant ED and treating these risk factors may improve corporeal blood flow and lead to long-term preservation of cavernosal function. Therefore, the efficacy of PDE5 inhibitors may be maintained. Targeting the risk factors of ED (similar to those for arteriosclerosis) in the early stages of the disease may prevent the development or decrease the severity of ED.",

Lonidamine does not affect general behaviour and autonomic functions and is devoid of anticonvulsant, anti-reserpine, anti-apomorphine, anti-amphetamine, antitremor , antipyretic, antiinflammatory and analgesic effects. It also lacks those side effects which are considered characteristic of different antitumour agents, such as thymus and spleen atrophy, delay in skin wound healing and damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa. At doses 40 times higher than that of hydrochlorothiazide, lonidamine produces diuretic effects. The practical importance of these findings in the current therapeutic use of lonidamine appears to be limited. The most typical signs of acute intoxication produced by high doses of lonidamine are salivation, lacrimation, diarrhea, ataxia, muscle rigidity and prostration with superimposed convulsions.",

      "title": "Benzodiazepines: effects on memory functioning",
      "abstract": "Benzodiazepines (BZDs) became widely available in the 1960s and have been prescribed to hundreds of millions of people over the past four decades. BZDs are effective in the treatment of insomnia, anxiety, epileptic disorders, for skeletal muscle relaxation, and for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. The rapid onset and reliable efficacy of their therapeutic actions and their favorable side-effect profile have led to a continued large prescription. BZDs are less toxic in overdose than alternatives; they are safe and have little liability for abuse among patients without a history of abuse.1 Despite their dubious reputation, due to the risk of dependence, withdrawal syndromes, their use as a 'date-rape drug,' for drug-facilitated robbery and chemical submission,2 their risk-benefit ratio is rather positive. Nevertheless, a common side effect of this class of drugs is dose-related anterograde amnesia, i.e. forgetfulness for events that occurs following drug intake and which persists for several hours. This effect was initially reported in the 1980s after intravenous administration of various BZDs as pre-surgery medications and further extended to their oral intake.3 The intensity of the amnesic effect depends on the nature of the molecule (potency, elimination half-life, onset of action), dose, route of administration, acute or chronic administration, and the subject's profile.4 It appears to be a robust phenomenon, generalizing across species and experimental conditions. The greatest amnesic effect is observed after administration of a single dose of a BZD with short elimination half-life and rapid onset of action to benzodiazepine-naive subjects. It was assumed that the mechanism of memory impairment was a failure of memory consolidation, and this deficit is transitory. Retrograde amnesia, i.e. memory loss for events prior to administration of drugs, has not been observed with BZDs. In fact, BZDs may even facilitate retrieval of information learned prior to drug administration, a phenomenon known as retrograde facilitation, which reduces interference of additional information acquired post-drug ingestion.5 Recently, Pomara et al6 demonstrated a dose-dependent retrograde facilitation ofverbal memory in healthy elderly persons after acute oral lorazepam administration – a property associated with the amnesic and sedative effects produced by the drug.",

      "title": "Occupational contact allergy to benzyl alcohol in epoxy hardeners",
      "abstract": "Benzyl alcohol (phenylmethanol, CAS 100-51-6, INCI: Benzyl Alcohol) is an aromatic alcohol commonly used as a fragrance component, preservative, solvent, food additive (E1519) and excipient in medicinal products.1-4 Despite its widespread use, contact allergy to benzyl alcohol is considered rare.5 We describe a case where occupational exposure to epoxy hardeners was the probable source of exposure and sensitization to benzyl alcohol. The patient is a 24-year-old painter who in her work is involved in the repair and coating of concrete floors and handles 2-component epoxy and polyurethane coatings. She has no history of atopic dermatitis or of dermatitis associated with use of cosmetic or topical medicinal products. For treatment of recalcitrant chronic spontaneous urticaria she currently uses cyclosporine at a daily dose of 200 mg. After 2 years in her present work, she developed eczema on her fingers, wrists, eyelids and anterior thighs where coatings were spilled. The eczema healed on holidays and recurred when at work. The patient was first patch tested at a regional central hospital and found strongly positive to diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and F (DGEBF) epoxy resins and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDGE) and referred for further examinations at FIOH. At FIOH, the patient presented with mild hand and wrist eczema that had recurred at work and healed by the end of the patch tests. Instead, she developed a mild acute facial eczema during patch testing. Patch testing was performed with Finn Chambers (SmartPractice, Calgary, Canada) in accordance with ESCD guidelines6 with baseline series and a selection of FIOH patch test series including epoxy, isocyanate, acrylate, glues and plastics and rubber series. We routinely patch test benzyl alcohol along with the epoxy patch test series. The already diagnosed occupational contact allergens DGEBA and DGEBF were excluded. In addition, some of the patient's current worksite products were patch tested. Of note is that the cyclosporine treatment might have had a suppressing effect on the patch test reactions. The positive patch test results at day 4 are presented in Table 1. 1%, 0.32%, 0.1% ++, Neg, Neg 1%, 0.32%, 0.1% ++, +, Neg Contains benzyl alcohol and MXDA 1%, 0.32%, 0.1% ++, Neg, Neg Contains benzyl alcohol and MXDA 1%, 0.32%, 0.1% ++, +, Neg Contains benzyl alcohol and IPDA The patient had a strong allergic test reaction to benzyl alcohol. According to the safety data sheets, benzyl alcohol was present in seven of the patient's eight epoxy hardeners (concentration ≥25%–50% in each hardener) and in one epoxy resin part (≥10%), and it was present in all the patch test positive epoxy hardeners. As the epoxy hardeners 2 and 3 also contained m-xylylene diamine (MXDA) and epoxy hardener 4 contained isophorone diamine (IPDA), the patient's weak contact allergies to MXDA and IPDA might have contributed to patch test reactions to these hardeners. Benzyl alcohol was also present in a face cream the patient had taken into use shortly before the examinations at FIOH and continued to use it until the end of the patch tests. The use of a face cream that contained benzyl alcohol probably explains the patient's facial eczema that appeared during patch testing. Several of the patient's other cosmetic products were perfumed, but benzyl alcohol was not mentioned in their INCI lists. In this patient case, the regular occupational exposure to epoxy products that contained benzyl alcohol was considered the probable cause of sensitization to benzyl alcohol. The patient's work-related eczema was not only explained by contact allergy to benzyl alcohol but also by contact allergies to several epoxy compounds. Her contact allergies to diglycidyl ethers and MXDA and IPDA as well as the previously diagnosed contact allergies to DGEBA and DGEBF were attributed to regular skin exposure to epoxy coatings used at work. Patch test reaction to diaminodiphenyl methane (MDA) may indicate contact allergy to diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) which was present in one of the patient's polyurethane coating products. Alternatively, it might be attributed to previous exposure to epoxy hardeners that may contain chemicals that structurally resemble MDA such as hydrogenated formaldehyde-benzenamine polymer (FBAP).7 Benzyl alcohol is common in epoxy products. According to the National Chemical Products Register,8 there are currently about 600 benzyl alcohol-containing products on the Finnish market. Most of them are epoxy products such as hardeners, coatings and adhesives. In conclusion, contact allergy to benzyl alcohol may be caused by occupational exposure to epoxy products that contain benzyl alcohol.

      "abstract": "The range of vasoconstrictors available for use with local anesthetics in dentistry has been reviewed with emphasis on epinephrine and its physiological effects. All of the vasoconstrictors reviewed provide satisfactory results in dental anesthetic solutions when administered in appropriate concentrations and volumes. Possible drug interactions of concern to dentists include the use of vasoconstrictors with inhalational anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers and, possibly, phenothiazines. Data reviewed indicates that the amounts of epinephrine used in dentistry can result in significant elevations in circulating levels of ephinephrine and concomitant physiologic changes. Evidence reviewed suggests that 1:200,000 epinephrine concentration results in optional duration and depth of local anesthesia. With the potential for adverse effects from epinephrine concentrations that are needlessly increased, it appears that in most clinical situations a 1:200,000 concentration of epinephrine can be used in an efficacious manner.",

Summary Methylphenidate has been an established treatment for ADHD, but due to its relatively short half-life, numerous intermediate- and long-acting products have been developed. While these extended-release products provide efficacy similar to that of immediate-acting products, the pharmacokinetics and adverse effects can vary. Intermediate-acting methylphenidate products have effects that can last as long as 8 hours, but clinically patients have still required twice-daily dosing. Long-acting products have helped to address these challenges, with recently developed products including controlled-release and bimodal-delivery systems and a patch formulation. Many of these products can be opened and sprinkled on applesauce for ease of administration. Conclusion Knowledge of the various formulations of methylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate is crucial for appropriate medication selection for control of ADHD symptoms. Knowledge of differences between release mechanisms and the pharmacokinetic properties are essential for appropriate use of these products.",

      "title": "Impact of Clindamycin on the Oral-Gut Axis: Gastrointestinal Side Effects and Clostridium difficile Infection in 45 Patients",
      "abstract": "Introduction The use of antibiotics such as oral clindamycin has been effective in treating bacterial infections. However, this medication often comes with significant side effects, particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) system. This study aims to evaluate the impact of different doses of clindamycin on GI health, specifically examining side effects like stomach upset, diarrhea duration, stomach pain, and recovery time. Given that clindamycin is frequently prescribed, understanding its impact on the oral-gut axis is critical to optimizing antibiotic therapy and reducing adverse events. Background Clindamycin, a lincosamide antibiotic, is widely used to treat a variety of bacterial infections. It acts by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis but, like many antibiotics, also has unintended consequences for human gut health. The oral-gut axis represents a complex connection where antibiotics, such as clindamycin, can significantly alter the microbiota, leading to imbalances that manifest as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and other digestive issues. This study aims to explore these effects in depth by comparing two common doses of clindamycin, 300 mg versus 600 mg, and the impact of each dose on the severity and duration of GI side effects. Materials and methods This study involves 45 patients prescribed clindamycin for various bacterial infections. The patients were evaluated in two groups: 22 patients who received 300 mg and 23 patients who received 600 mg. Treatment duration ranged from seven to 10 days. Data collection focused on patient-reported symptoms, including the presence and duration of stomach upset, the length of diarrhea episodes, the persistence of stomach pain, and the overall recovery time. Statistical analysis included independent t-tests to compare symptom severity between the groups and chi-squared tests to assess differences in the incidence of side effects, while regression analysis was used to examine predictors of prolonged GI symptoms. Results The results of the study showed that 98% of patients experienced some side effects from oral clindamycin. Among those receiving the 600 mg dose, the frequency and severity of side effects were significantly higher compared to the 300 mg group. Specifically, the average duration of diarrhea in the 600 mg group was five days, compared to three days in the 300 mg group. Similarly, the average length of stomach pain in the higher dose group was seven days, compared to four days for those taking the lower dose. Chi-squared analysis indicated a significant association between the higher dose and increased incidence of GI symptoms. Regression analysis further showed that the 600 mg dose was a significant predictor of prolonged GI disturbances, underscoring a dose-dependent relationship. Conclusion The findings of this case study highlight that oral clindamycin, particularly at higher doses, is associated with increased GI side effects, including prolonged diarrhea and stomach pain. Almost all patients experienced side effects, with those on the 600 mg dose suffering more severe and prolonged symptoms compared to those on the 300 mg dose. The results suggest avoiding the prescription of oral clindamycin unless absolutely necessary, to reduce adverse outcomes and improve compliance. It is recommended to prioritize first-line antibiotics and reserve oral clindamycin as a secondary option. Further research is needed to investigate strategies for prescribing.",

Metoclopramide is an antidopaminergic benzamide with mainly antiemetic effects, due to the interaction with dopamine receptors in the central trigger zone. Another effect is to enhance the transit of material through the gastrointestinal tract. Disadvantages in the use of metoclopramide are neurological effects (asthenia, sleepiness), extrapyramidal dyskinetic reactions and/or neuroendocrine side effects (galactorrhea). Domperidone is a pure dopaminantagonist that accelerates gastric emptying. It is useful in the treatment of acute nausea and vomiting caused by different agents.

      "abstract": "Current knowledge on side-effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is reviewed. These occur most commonly in the gastro intestinal tract and include peptic ulceration and haemorrhage as well as effects on the small and large bowel. Renal effects with many manifestations are also increasingly described. Photosensitivity is the most common adverse dermatological effect. The role of various NSAIDs in causing asthma is now well recognised. Many less common side-effects occur, the most significant of which is marrow aplasia. Phenylbutazone and indomethacin are rarely but definitely associated with this, but other NSAIDs including ibuprofen are also suspected, but unproven, causes. A strategy for minimising side-effects is outlined. Where there is not a strong indication for use of an NSAID, local physical measures or a pure analgesic can be substituted. If an NSAID is really necessary, it is best to commence with a drug of lesser potency in the first instance, unless the patient is suffering from a severe inflammatory disorder. Indomethacin and piroxicam should be reserved for when other NSAIDs have not been effective. Patients who have a past or present history of peptic ulceration but still need to continue their NSAID therapy, should combine it with an anti-ulcer drug. In the case of younger patients a H2 receptor antagonist is the drug of first choice, whereas in the older patient a mucosal protective agent such as sucralfate is preferred. In the event of ulcer relapse, combination with a prostaglandin analogue is the next step. The growing awareness of side-effects with NSAIDs suggests that monitoring of patients commencing NSAIDs and on long-term treatment, should be increasingly practiced.",

      "title": "Toxicity of the Penicillins",
      "abstract": "THE absence of direct toxicity is one of the most remarkable properties of the penicillin molecule; that is to say, the penicillin molecule as we know it and as we should use it. If you try hard enough, you can make it toxic by altering it or abusing it, as I shall try to show later. With this reservation, one can say that penicillin G and the main therapeutic derivatives of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) at present in use are virtually non-toxic. By this I mean that these drugs can be given in doses very much larger than those of any comparable biologically-active substance to some animals and to man without disturbing organic function or causing any signs or symptoms suggestive of damage to essential tissue (Table I). In mice, rats and dogs, penicillin G, the phenoxypenicillins, methicillin, the isoxazoles and ampicillin are all tolerated intravenously in doses of 2 g./kg. or more, and in twice that dosage subcutaneously or orally. With some derivatives (e.g. ampicillin) it is difficult to establish a toxic dose within the limits of solubility. Extremely high doses (5 g./kg.) may cause convulsions if given intravenously: this would be equivalent to about half a kilogram by injection or a kilogram by mouth to man! At about half this dose level, the isoxazoles cause transient hypotension but in other respects there is no interference with vital functions. The toxic level in man has never been established but it is known that methicillin and penicillin G can be given intravenously in doses of 20 g. per day for weeks on end, and that ampicillin and the isoxazoles can be given in doses of at least 4 g./day (80 mg. /kg.) without any signs of immediate or delayed toxicity. This means that concentrations of penicillin G and methicillin of 50 mg.% can circulate harmlessly in the blood and tissues; in other words, that penicillin is no more toxic than glucose or urea, and much less toxic than many other physiological substances. When such large doses are being given, it is best to use the sodium salt as the potassium cation can be toxic: 15 mega units of penicillin G supplies 25 mEq. of K+ which may cause cardiac dilation, especially if the heart is already damaged, as in bacterial endocarditis, which is the main disease requiring such high doses. Even the sodium cation may rise if there is any renal impairment and it should be remembered that normal doses of methicillin yield 5-10 mEq. of Na+. Some among you may recall that, in the early days, the toxicity of successively purified batches of crude peni-",

If irrigants and medicaments had effective long-term residual antimicrobial activity that could prevent re-infection of the root canal system, then the long-term outcomes of endodontic treatment might be improved. Only a small number of studies have investigated the short-term substantivity of commonly used antimicrobial agents and the results show substantivity of chlorhexidine lasts for up to 12 weeks and tetracycline for up to 4 weeks.

      "abstract": "1. The rat is as satisfactory for the production of experimental convulsions as the rabbit or cat hitherto used for this purpose. 2. Of the three convulsants; picrotoxin, camphor and thujone, the last is the most satisfactory for the study of experimental convulsions, since its convulsant dose is well below its minimum lethal dose and its effects quite rapidly wear off. 3. While the individual response to thujone varies considerably, the percentage of a group of rats responding with convulsions to a fixed dose of thujone is remarkably constant. 4. The convulsive dose of camphor is close to the lethal dose and its duration of action is so prolonged that repeated injections are inadvisable. 5. The dose of picrotoxin necessary to produce pronounced spontaneous convulsions is greater than the minimum lethal dose of this drug. 6. Sodium phenobarbital, sodium bromide or chloretone will decrease or abolish the incidence of thujone convulsions in the rat. This effect persists for from one to several days after the last administration of the drug. Bulbocapnin is without effect on thujone convulsions.",

Buprenorphine/naloxone combination (BNC) is a drug that has misuse potential and is used to treat opioid dependence, including buprenorphine and naloxone. Buprenorphine shows its pharmacological effects by binding to opioid receptors. Buprenorphine is a partial agonist and has smaller maximal effects compared to those of full agonists (heroin, methadone). Naloxone is a non-selective opiate antagonist added to buprenorphine for the prevention of intravenous diversion. BNC is used in the treatment of opioid dependence for detoxification and maintenance. The drug should be used as a sublingual film tablet. Pregabalin is used in the treatment of neuropathic pain, epilepsy and anxiety disorders. It is increasingly being reported as possessing a potential for misuse. In this article, we present a case of intravenous BNC and concomitant oral pregabalin misuse that developed in a monitored and treated patient for the reason of opioid dependence.",

      "title": "The provision of analgesia and sedation in the PICU: current practice and recent advances",
      "abstract": "Current practice Sedation of children in requiring intensive care in Europe has favoured a combination of a sedative drug, mainly midazolam, and an analgesic, usually morphine. In North America fentanyl is often employed as the first line analgesic. Postoperatively, the need for analgesia is obvious but for other patients analgesic drugs are used as an adjunct to spare the dose of a pure sedative. Propofol, although an undoubtedly useful drug, has been used widely albeit with concerns regarding its safety in children (1) and even in adults (2). This debate was curtailed recently (3) and is no longer a viable alternative, at least in the UK. However, even the more established drugs are not free from generating problems: Tolerance and Tachyphlaxis Classically seen with local analgesics and opioids, this is also observed with midazolam (4) and dose rate does not relate reliably to adequacy of sedation (5) Withdrawal This is seen with almost all classes of drugs used in sedation in PICU. Not only as ‘expected’ with opioids and the benzodiazepines, but also with propofol (6), isoflurane (7) and barbiturates (8). Many of these reactions may be mediated through NMDA receptors and this can be modified by the use of ketamine (8). Some of these reactions can have long drawn out symptoms and necessitate tapering regimens that may fast up to three weeks (8-10). The incidence of such phenomena varies from 17 to 35% in published data, particularly where midazolam was concerned (9, 10) Immune effects Morphine has titratable effects in decreasing the proliferation of stimulated human lymphocytes, and it also suppresses killer cell cytotoxicity. Selective α, κ and δ agonists decrease immunoglobulin production by B lymphocytes (1l). Sedative sparing strategies Clinical observation systems should be objective and reproducible in a quantitative form so that assessments of sedation can be made independently of varying individuals or units. The COMFORT score is validated but has 5 scores in each of 8 categories (12) so we use a simpler version in our unit (13). The EEG is difficult to interpret and suppression of waveforms is non linear with concentration of propofol (14). In paediatric patients we found that propofol levels varied widely, given the same dose, and that there was no correlation between these levels, the EEG and the level of clinical sedation (15). The use of muscle relaxants may reduce the total sedative requirement, but may lead to overdosage where awareness is feared (8). They affect thoracic compliance (16) and lead to more nosocomial infections (16, 17), and increase the length of ventilation and length of stay (17). Drug ‘holidays’ can be achieved with reduced length of stay and length of ventilation in adults (18) but this would be problematic in children. However, cycling of drug regimens can be used to good effect. We vary drug regimens every week in a three week cycle, switching from morphine/midazolam (week 1) to ketamine/promethazine (week 2) to clonidine/chloral (week 3). Analgesia can be delivered in short acting form as a bolus for specific procedures, e.g. physiotherapy and as regional blockade, epidurally or spinally, even for thoracic and cardiac procedures (19, 20). Dealing with sequelae Withdrawal is the most obvious side effect and can be extremely distressing for the child, the parents and for the clinical staff. A good outcome from the acute illness can be frustratingly marred by unwelcome neurological side effects that range from jitteriness, irritability, refusal to feed/drink, to outright myoclonus, ataxia and vomiting (8). Gradual tapering of sedatives is one approach but substitution by a drug from the same class or by a drug from a different class with similar effects can be beneficial. The partial α2 agonist drug clonidine has proved to be very useful in either combating withdrawal or being used as a primary sedative (21, 22). Dexmedetomidine, a drug first used in veterinary anaesthesia, is being evaluated as a first line sedative in adults. It is a pure α2 agonist and may be more prone to hypotensive and bradycardic episodes (23). Clonidine has some α1 activity that may be more protective in this regard. Other agents can be used to combat withdrawal and drugs used in clinical practice include chlorpromazine, lorazepam, oramorph and methadone. Sleep deprivation plays a part in withdrawal. Diurnal variation is disturbed and this is associated with abnormal steroid and melatonin secretion (24). Future Developments for Evaluation Lorazepam may have advantages over midazolam, with shorter return to consciousness (25). Further study of α2 agonists is needed. Remifentanil as a primary sedative/analgesic agent looks promising, especially in view of its pharmacokinetic profile. We are evaluating its use as a procedural bolus drug. Eltanolone/pregnanolone and other such drugs are being evaluated as a possible substitute for propofol. Regional analgesia is being looked at in our unit, not only for its beneficial effect intraoperatively (20), but as a means of sparing opioid administration on PICU. Melatonin needs evaluating in re-establishing sleep patterns in children in intensive care together with its specific sleep inducing properties (26).",

      "abstract": "The pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs used for the treatment of human epilepsies is reviewed for dogs and cats. In dogs, especially phenobarbital and primidone must be regarded as useful drugs for chronic treatment on account of their elimination rate and bioavailability. Phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid and benzodiazepines are eliminated so rapidly that a therapeutic value cannot be expected. In cats, phenytoin, phenobarbital, valproic acid and diazepam must be regarded as suited for chronic treatment, but there is a definite lack of clinical experience. Phenobarbital and primidone are useful for treatment of clonic-tonic generalized seizures (grand mal) in dogs. The effect of primidone depends mostly on its metabolite phenobarbital. Since primidone, given in high dosage for longer periods of time, gives rise to liver damage, phenobarbital is regarded as the drug of first choice. A status epilepticus may be treated by i.v. injection of diazepam, clonazepam, phenytoin or lidocaine. In cats with grand mal, treatment with daily doses of about 1 mg/kg diazepam may be tried. It proved effective for longer time periods without development of tolerance. There is no reliable clinical experience with other drugs in this species.",

(2) Aliskiren is the first renin inhibitor to reach the market. (3) There are no published trials of aliskiren with clinical endpoints. Five double-blind short-term (8 weeks) placebo-controlled trials showed a moderate effect on blood pressure. This effect was not superior to that of other antihypertensive drugs with which aliskiren was compared: hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, irbesartan, losartan, valsartan, lisinopril and rampiril. (4) When added to another antihypertensive drug, aliskiren had little or no additional effect on blood pressure. In particular, there is no firm evidence that adding aliskiren to amlodipine 5 mg/day is any more effective than doubling the dose of amlodipine. (5) Aliskiren has not been tested in patients with renovascular hypertension or severe hypertension, but pharmacological data suggest that aliskiren might be less effective in these individuals. (6) Overall, the adverse effect profile of aliskiren does not seem to be any better than that of other antihypertensive drugs. Aliskiren contributes to the onset of angioedema, cough, diarrhea and abdominal pain, hyperuricaemia, gout attacks, kidney stones and skin rash. Pharmacovigilance should focus specifically on certain adverse effects that are known to occur with other drugs acting on renin-angiotensin axis, such as angioedema, muscle disorders and anaemia, even though few such cases were observed with aliskiren during clinical trials. (7) Aliskiren is contraindicated during pregnancy, as are other antihypertensive drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin axis.

Providing as they do a specific and apparently effective form of treatment for a group of conditions previously difficult of therapeutic approach, it is small wonder that the drugs have gripped the medical and the popular imagination. In the face of the widespread and occasionally injudicious use of these drugs, it is surprising how small an amount of experimental work was performed to determine the toxic reactions to them and their therapeutic efficacy before they were launched for clinical trial. It is still to be hoped that such late complications as the cataract due to dinitrophenol will not be the lot of patients benefited by treatment with sulfanilamide. An increasing number of papers have recently been devoted to the side effects of sulfanilamide therapy. No mention will be made",

      "abstract": "For over 40 years, antipsychotic drugs have been used as long-term maintenance treatment to control symptoms and reduce relapse rates in patients with schizophrenia. ‘First-generation’ oral agents such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine are associated with high levels of unwanted neurological effects and poor rates of patient adherence.1,2 Long-acting (‘depot’) injections of antipsychotics were developed to try to improve adherence. ‘Second-generation’ antipsychotic agents (also known as atypical antipsychotics) were introduced into clinical practice over 16 years ago. Although these agents have a lower propensity to cause extrapyramidal side effects, they are associated with a range of other unwanted effects (e.g. weight gain and its sequelae).1,3,4 Initially, second-generation agents were only available as orally administered medicines. Three long-acting injectable formulations of second-generation antipsychotics are now available in the UK: θolanzapine embonate injection (ZypAdhera), θpaliperidone injection (Xeplion) and θrisperidone injection (Risperdal Consta). In this article we review the evidence for these agents and discuss the practical implications of their use.",

There is no evidence that fluoxetine produces a flu-like syndrome or neuropathy similar to that seen with zimelidine. It does not appear to cause phospholipidosis in humans. Fluoxetine appears to have no epileptogenic potential except at extremely high doses. It is usually well tolerated in overdoses.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Fluoroquinolones are highly effective antibiotics with many desirable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties including high bioavailability, large volume of distribution, and a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. Despite their attractive profile as anti‐infective agents, their use in children is limited, primarily due to safety concerns. In this review we highlight the pharmacological properties of fluoroquinolones and describe their current use in pediatrics. In addition, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the safety data associated with fluoroquinolone use in children. Although permanent or destructive arthropathy remains a significant concern, currently available data demonstrate that arthralgia and arthropathy are relatively uncommon in children and resolve following cessation of fluoroquinolone exposure without resulting in long‐term sequelae. The concern for safety and risk of adverse events associated with pediatric fluoroquinolone use is likely driving the limited prescribing of this drug class in pediatrics. However, in adults, fluoroquinolones are the most commonly prescribed broad‐spectrum antibiotics, resulting in the development of drug‐resistant bacteria that can be challenging to treat effectively. The consequence of misuse and overuse of fluoroquinolones leading to drug resistance is a greater, but frequently overlooked, safety concern that applies to both children and adults and one that should be considered at the point of prescribing.",

      "title": "A Case of Acute Psychosis Secondary to Coricidin Overdose",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Dextromethorphan and chlorpheniramine maleate are common ingredients in over 140 prescription and over-the-counter cough and cold medicines, including CoricidinHBP. When used at recommended doses, they are safe and effective agents with minimal adverse effects. However, at higher doses, typically as a result of recreational abuse, dextromethorphan and chlorpheniramine are capable of inducing a specific toxidrome that includes various psychiatric sequelae such as euphoria, agitation, psychoses, dissociative phenomena, and, rarely, dependence.1 Some of the street names for CoricidinHBP (or specifically for the dextromethorphan component) are Red Devils, Robo, Triple C, Skittles, and poor man’s PCP. The street terms for illicit use are skittling and robo-tripping.2 The use of these terms stems from the commonly abused over-the-counter formulae Robitussin and CoricidinHBP. We present here the case of a patient who developed acute psychosis induced by an overdose of CoricidinHBP.\r\n\r\nCase report. Mr A, a 40-year-old white man, was hospitalized in the intensive care unit for the management of acute psychosis and irritable mood. He was found at a supermarket exhibiting bizarre behavior after he had purchased and rapidly ingested about 30 tablets of CoricidinHBP. On arrival to the emergency department, he was tremulous and diaphoretic and demonstrated a clouded sensorium, euphoric mood, and circumstantial thought process. He stated that he could “look at people and know exactly what they were thinking” and displayed paranoid behavior. He had abused CoricidinHBP “to get high” off and on for the past several weeks.\r\n\r\nHe reported past use of marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, and opiates and had been previously diagnosed with alcohol dependence, in partial remission. His past medical history was nonsignificant, he had no drug allergies, and he was not on treatment with any prescribed medications. His past psychiatric history included DSM-IV polysubstance dependence. He had no family history of any psychiatric illness. A complete medical evaluation revealed a positive hepatitis C antigen test, elevated liver enzymes (alkaline phosphatase 277 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 120 U/L), and negative urine toxicology screen. Findings of routine blood work were otherwise within normal limits. He was prescribed intravenous lorazepam 1–2 mg every 4 hours for agitation, which was gradually discontinued over a period of 2 days. His other medications included ondansetron and ranitidine for symptomatic relief.\r\n\r\nMr A’s clinical manifestations showed complete remission without the need for any antipsychotic treatment within 2 days after discontinuing CoricidinHBP. His mental status at the time of discharge was stable with no clinical evidence of psychosis.\r\n\r\nCoricidinHBP is a cough and cold medicine that contains 30 mg of dextromethorphan and 4 mg of chlorpheniramine maleate per tablet. Previously, CoricidinHBP-induced psychosis was thought to be due to the sympathomimetic amines present in many preparations.3,4 However, it was later suggested that the causative agent is dextromethorphan.5\r\n\r\nDextromethorphan is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 2D6 (CYP2D6) to its active metabolite dextrorphan.6 Dextrorphan has shown to have phencyclidine-like behavioral effects in animal models. Like phencyclidine, it is a strong non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. When it binds to and blocks these receptors, it can produce euphoria, hyperactivity, and psychosis. It is also an antagonist at the α3/β4 nicotinic receptors and an agonist at the opioid σ1 and σ2 receptors and targets the serotonin reuptake pump. Due to the genetic polymorphism of CYP2D6, patients can be slow or rapid metabolizers of dextromethorphan, and the latter group are more prone to neuropsychiatric manifestations.6 Acute intoxication with dextromethorphan can produce drowsiness, tachycardia, ataxia, agitation, hysteria, nystagmus, urinary retention, hallucinations, stupor, or coma.2\r\n\r\nChlorpheniramine maleate is an alkyl amine histamine H1 receptor antagonist that produces anticholinergic effects. Acute chlorpheniramine maleate intoxication can cause tachycardia, hyperthermia, urinary retention, confusion, altered coordination, agitation, hallucinations, seizures, or coma.2\r\n\r\nThe clinical manifestations of dextromethorphan and chlorpheniramine maleate overdose are overlapping, and both of the compounds most likely cause the constellation of symptoms in CoricidinHBP overdose (Figure 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1.\r\n\r\nOverlapping Adverse Effect Profile of Dextromethorphan and Chlorpheniramine\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough dextromethorphan dependence is rare, it was reported among those who were chronically abusing the drug.2 It supposedly has no addictive qualities, although there are few reported cases of dependence and craving. One such case report described a patient who had abused cough syrup containing dextromethorphan for 8 years.7 He was hospitalized for a manic episode that resolved during a period of abstinence in which he reported craving for the drug. Once discharged, he recommenced the drug abuse and his cravings subsided. Another case described a patient who was snorting dextromethorphan powder for several months and, when hospitalized and off the drug, reported cravings.8 Although dependence characteristics and long-term psychiatric manifestations of the drug are not well established, dependence is a possible consequence with chronic use.\r\n\r\nDue to the extensive and over-the-counter availability of CoricidinHBP, patients and health-care providers alike are largely unmindful of its potential toxidrome and dependence liability. Coricidin, with its psychiatric and physical manifestations, could have short-term and long-term health implications. Coricidin addiction must be managed like any other chemical dependency, and treatment strategies should be drafted to ensure the best chance of patient recovery.",

      "title": "Pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepines. Short-acting versus long-acting.",
      "abstract": "Among the various benzodiazepines large differences exist with regard to their pharmacokinetic properties and metabolism in man. Some are eliminated from the body at a relatively slow rate (e. g. diazepam), others are metabolized rather rapidly (e. g. oxazepam, temazepam, triazolam). Several benzodiazepines have the long-acting metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam in common (diazepam, fosazepam, prazepam, clorazepate). Such differences may be very important clinically because pharmacokinetic factors will determine the duration of drug effect and pharmacokinetic parameters constitute the basis for a rational dosage regimen. For the various clinical indications of benzodiazepines the required duration of drug action differs quite fundamentally. In anticonvulsant and anti-anxiety treatment continuous treatment is pursued, so that compounds with long elimination half-lives of parent drug or active metabolites are of advantage. If on the other hand a benzodiazepine is taken as a hypnotic, the duration of action should be restricted to the night, hence a compound with a short elimination half-life is to be preferred. A review is given of the pharmacokinetics of the major benzodiazepines presently available.",

However, there have been some concerns regarding their abuse, especially by teenagers and young adults. Lisdexamfetamine was recently approved for the treatment of ADHD in 6-12-year-olds and provides a novel approach to the treatment of ADHD. Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug comprised of dextroamphetamine covalently attached to an essential amino acid, L-lysine. Following oral administration, the amide linkage between the two molecules is enzymatically hydrolyzed in the gastrointestinal tract, thus releasing active dextroamphetamine, which mediates the therapeutic effect in a fashion similar to other stimulants. The parent drug does not bind to sites responsible for the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine in vitro. Lisdexamfetamine does not produce high dextroamphetamine levels when injected or snorted, and thus may have lower abuse potential compared to conventional stimulants. Lisdexamfetamine appears to have efficacy and tolerability comparable to other extended-release stimulant formulations used to treat ADHD, but reduced potential for abuse-related liking effects. Compared to equivalent amounts of immediate-release dextroamphetamine.",

      "title": "A case of pregabalin addiction",
      "abstract": "Pregabalin, a gamma-aminobutyric acid analog, is a new-generation anticonvulsant that acts by reducing the release of glutamate, noradrenaline, and substance P. Apart from use as concomitant therapy in partial epilepsy, it is used in the treatment of treat neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, and generalized anxiety disorder. Experimental studies have claimed its usefulness in the treatment of benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal, as well as preventing relapse in alcohol-dependence patients.[12] Pregabalin use in primary health care has increased recently. In therapeutic dosage, chances of addiction are unlikely. However, there are few reports of addictive potential of the drug when prescribed in higher amount.[3] A case of pregabalin addiction is presented because of its rarity in India. A 32-year-old married male, an operation theater assistant, reported with the complaints of regular use of tablet pregabalin for the past 7 years. Initially, the patient was prescribed tablet gabapen 300 mg bd for chronic pain following traumatic mandibular subluxation. After taking the medication for 3 months, he perceived improvement in his pain. He also felt energetic. When he stopped taking tablet gabapen, he experienced fatiguability and irritability. Since tablet gabapen was costly and he had easy access to tablet pregabalin, he started consuming pregabalin. However, he was not getting the same effect, so he kept increasing the dosage and eventually was consuming 20 tablet/day. At this dose, he used to feel energetic, elated, had increased work performance, and was appreciated by his seniors. His appetite increased significantly. Over the course of 7 years, he experienced diminishing effect, so he gradually increased the dosage to 40 tablet/day. Finally, he was caught stealing drugs and was removed from the job. To satisfy his craving, he started taking loans and sold household articles, and consequently, his family abandoned him. He then tried stopping tablet pregabalin for a few days, but he experienced low mood, irritability with decreased sleep, and appetite, so he restarted taking the tablets. His friend eventually brought him to the psychiatric center. Past and family history was not significant. No history of other substance use was reported. His physical examination and routine investigations were within normal limits. Electroencephalogram showed right frontocentral abnormality. On mental status examination, he was in contemplation stage of motivation. He was admitted and was started on tablet oxcarbazepine 150 mg bd, tablet clonazepam 0.25 mg tds, and tablet tryptomer 10 mg along with psychotherapy. Gradually, his craving reduced and he has maintained abstinence for 3 months after discharge. A systematic review of 106 studies on PubMed/Scopus did not find credible evidence of a strong addictive power of gabapentinoids, due to their limited rewarding properties, few relapses, and the very few cases with gabapentinoid-related behavioral dependence symptoms in patients without a history of substance abuse/dependence. Further, there were no reports of people seeking treatment for abuse of gabapentinoids.[4] Our patient was strongly addicted, felt euphoric and energetic due to the drug, gave history of relapse, and came for treatment. It is assumed that gabapentinoid pharmacodynamics possibly include brain's drug-reward pathways.[5] Physicians prescribing gabapentins should carefully evaluate any history of substance misuse before starting the drug. Furthermore, they should be able to promptly identify signs of pregabalin/gabapentin misuse, while providing assistance in tapering off the medication.[6] The tendency to downplay the addiction potential of gabapentinoids should cease forthwith.

      "title": "Third Generation Cephalosporins: Safety Profiles After 10 Years of Clinical Use",
      "abstract": "Compared with aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and even penicillins, the cephalosporins represent a remarkably safe class of antibiotics. Among the cephalosporins, the extended spectrum, third generation agents developed generally produce few side effects and appear to be less allergenic than the penicillins. Nephrotoxicity has not been a problem at recommended doses. Some third generation agents can cause hypoprothrombinemia if not administered with vitamin K, and disulfiram‐like reactions occur with some agents because of the presence of a thiomethyl tetruzole moiety affixed to the cephem nucleus. There is a greater incidence of diarrhea associated with the agents excreted through a primarily biliary route, and this may contribute to the selection of drug resistant bacteria. Some agents are less active against staphylococci and their use may result in an increased incidence of superinfection or overgrowth of enterococci. If attention is given to the potential for adverse effects, many of these problems can be avoided and the third generation cephalosporins can be used safely in hospitals, nursing homes, and home care settings.",

They are widely available in the USA, and they are sold under various brand names, including \"K2\" and \"spice.\" Many adverse effects have been attributed to SCs, but most recently, they have also been associated with bleeding. There have been reported cases around the globe of SCs contaminated with long-acting anticoagulant rodenticide (LAAR) or superwarfarins. They are developed from compounds such as bromethalin, brodifacoum (BDF), and dicoumarol. LAAR exhibits their mechanism as a vitamin K antagonist inhibiting vitamin K 2,3-epoxide reductase, preventing activation of vitamin K1 (phytonadione). Therefore, reducing the activation of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X and proteins C and S. In contrast to warfarin, BDF has an extremely long-acting biological half-life of 90 days due to minimal metabolism and limited clearance. Here, we report a 45-year-old male who presented to the emergency room with a 12-day history of gross hematuria and mucosal bleeding without previous history of coagulopathy and recurrent SCs use.",

      "abstract": "Heroin and related illicit opioid abuse continues to be a significant problem in the United States and globally, as measured by a variety of indicators. The ability of naltrexone to effectively antagonize heroin use is unequivocal. However, despite this pharmacological efficacy, noncompliance with oral naltrexone formu lae has been a significant impediment to its adoption as a treatment. Noncompliance is often associated with a patient' withdrawal from treatment and return to heroin use, although several recent studies specifically aimed at improving medication compliance have yielded promising results. An alternative method of naltrexone maintenance delivery involves the injection or surgical insertion of a sustained release preparation of naltrexone. This approach removes the onus on patients to use daily oral naltrexone. To date, a number of sustained release preparation of naltrexone have been developed for intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, or surgical insertion. Optimally, these products should be easy to administer, have no \"major\" adverse tissue reaction (biocompatible), be biodegradable, provide thera-peutically relevant blood naltrexone levels, and be clinically effective. This chapter reviews the history, development, and comments on the relative merits of different formulations.",

Naloxone is the agent of choice in reversing the effects of narcotics and synthetic opiate derivatives, such as propoxyphene and pentazocine. The manufacturer's present recommended dosage may not be sufficient to reverse the effects of large narcotic ingestions.

      "title": "Dosing for Fentanyl Infusion in Obese Children: Just Because It's What We Have Always Done Doesn't Mean It Is Right",
      "abstract": "It is estimated that nearly 19% of admissions to children's hospitals involve obese children.1 Some of these children will be admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), where they may be initiated on sedatives and analgesic medications. Many of these medications, including midazolam, propofol, and fentanyl, are lipid soluble at physiological pH. These highly lipophilic drugs widely distribute to organs and tissues, including adipose tissues; hence, they could have altered drug disposition characteristics in obese individuals.23Harskamp-van Ginkel et al4 performed a systematic review of pharmacokinetic studies conducted between 1970 and 2012 in obese children. Pharmacokinetic studies were available for only 21 drugs; fentanyl was not among these agents. Fentanyl is favored for its fast onset and short half-life when used in boluses. However, its half-life when administered as a continuous infusion increases by approximately one-fold for every hour increase in the duration of infusion due to a greater extent of drug distributed to adipose tissue and slow redistribution into plasma for elimination.5 Two retrospective studies compared surrogate pharmacodynamic markers, including number of dosage changes per day and time to reach goal sedation, in obese and non-obese children receiving fentanyl infusions in the PICU.67 Findings from these studies allude to potential differences in these pharmacodynamic outcomes that could reflect pharmacokinetic alterations in obese children, but this is difficult to confirm without pharmacokinetic data.Though there are no pharmacokinetic data for fentanyl infusions in obese children, previous studies evaluating pharmacokinetics of some lipophilic medications have noted larger volumes of distribution and accelerated clearance in obese patients versus non-obese patients.8 Therefore, based on this higher volume of distribution, obese children may require a higher initial dose or loading dose to achieve analgesia and sedation, considering the 3-compartment model of fentanyl. Once distribution to the adipose tissue in the third compartment has reached equilibrium, a lower maintenance infusion may be needed to prevent oversedation. Undesirable outcomes, such as respiratory depression, prolonged use of mechanical ventilation, and longer PICU stays, could follow in cases of oversedation.9Dosing for fentanyl infusions is generally weight-based in children. This approach is problematic for obese patients because clinicians must choose the correct weight to use. Various weight adjustments, including ideal body weight [i.e., (50th percentile body mass index for age and gender) × (height (m2)], and adjusted body weight [i.e., (ideal body weight) + (pre-specified cofactor) × (total body weight − ideal body weight)], have been proposed for obese children. For lipophilic drugs such as fentanyl, some have proposed to use total body weight for loading doses and ideal body weight for maintenance doses. Shibutani et al10 conducted a pharmacokinetic study of fentanyl infusions in adults and developed a non-linear model that demonstrated lower weight-normalized clearance with increasing body weight and possible accumulation if total body weight was used. As a result of the potential risk for accumulation based on total body weight, Ross et al11 recommended an adjusted body weight, with a cofactor of 0.25, for fentanyl dosing in obese children.The use of fixed cofactor adjustment may not take into consideration the other pharmacokinetic variations that are noted in children versus adults. To illustrate this point, we utilized deidentified data from 4 females between the ages of 4 and 9 (Group 1) weighing approximately 30 kg, and another 4 females between the ages of 12 and 15 (Group 2) weighing approximately 44 kg who were admitted to our institution. Each age group included 3 obese patients and 1 non-obese patient (Table). For these patients, we calculated the total body weight, ideal body weight, and adjusted body weight. We used these weights to calculate a dose based on 1 mcg/kg/hr of these different dosing weights. As noted in the Table, the use of the cofactor of 0.25 to calculate adjusted body weight resulted in fentanyl doses of 25 mcg/hr for all patients in Group 1, and doses ranging from 32 to 34 mcg/hr for patients in Group 2. The adjusted body weight is largely affected by height; hence, this dosing weight assumes larger doses are required for taller patients. Although adjusted body weight incorporated the 50th percentile of body mass index specific for the age and gender, the influence of age and gender on dosing weight were relatively small.We also used data from published studies to compare the relationship to total body weight and clearance in adults and children receiving fentanyl infusions. Adult clearance data were obtained from Shibutani et al.10 Clearance data for children were extracted from a study by Katz et al12 evaluating the pharmacokinetic data of fentanyl infusions in 19 children. As this study did not report patient weights, we used the weight of the 50th percentile for their age to approximate their clearance and weight relationship. Using the nonlinear clearance and weight relationship model from Shibutani et al,10 we included total body weight from the pediatric patients from the study by Katz et al12 and plotted these data together (Figure). A commonly used allometric model and an extrapolation model based on Clark's rule were compared with the adult non-linear model. The allometric and Clark's rule models are described as the following equation:where WeightAdult was assumed to be 70 kg, and the γ-exponent is 0.75 for the allometric model and 1 for Clark's rule.All 3 models were overlaid with the adult clearance values from Shibutani et al10 and the pediatric clearance values from Katz et al.12 The Figure shows that the adult non-linear model well described the adult population, but not the pediatric population. The adult non-linear model was not developed to be extrapolated to children, and lower limit of the range of body weight is 22 kg. In contrast, the allometric model better predicted pediatric clearance, but did not perform well in adults at body weights >100 kg. Allometry was a better fit in children than adults, because it takes into account the relationship of body size and physiology.These results are supported by findings of Liu et al,13 who examined the predictability of pediatric drug clearance using the allometric scaling approach. They reported that the deviation of predicted clearance were within two-fold of actual clearance for 46 drugs and within 50% for 31 drugs. Clark's rule did not provide a good fit for adults and children and has fallen out of favor in determination of dosing.Although the allometric model is a reasonable approach for weight-based dosing selection in pediatrics, the effect of age and obesity on pharmacokinetics should not be ignored. If the dosing regimen were designed solely based on the weight and clearance relationship, then all 4 patients in Group 1 would receive a fentanyl infusion dose of 30 mcg/hr, and the patients in Group 2 would receive an infusion dose of 44 mcg/hr, regardless of their age and other characteristics (Table). Studies have shown that fentanyl clearance varies with age in children.1214 Due to the heterogeneity in pharmacokinetic parameters across the continuum of age in children and the effects of obesity on these age-specific pharmacokinetic parameters and fentanyl pharmacokinetics, future studies of fentanyl pharmacokinetics in obese children require stratification into separate age groups in order to examine the weight and age effects.Because of these complexities, it may be more appropriate to utilize more sophisticated approaches, such as a population physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model that incorporates interindividual variability and physiologic data. Mula et al15 recommended the use of either a \"bottom up\" or a \"top down\" approach to improve pediatric clinical study design. The \"bottom up\" approach utilizes a PBPK and simulation technique to predict drug disposition (i.e., absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) in obese children. The \"top down\" approach employs population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation based on clinical data to investigate the population pharmacokinetic parameters and the source of variability (i.e., age, weight, renal function) for individual patients.In conclusion, pharmacokinetic studies of obese children receiving fentanyl infusion are needed. A more sophisticated approach, including population PBPK modeling, can be used to account for age-related and obesity-related effects on fentanyl pharmacokinetics. Until further research is conducted, clinicians should continue to utilize pharmacodynamic targets, such as sedation and pain scores, to guide dosing of fentanyl infusions in obese children. Clinicians should be mindful that, due to the higher volume of distribution, obese children may initially require a higher mcg/kg dose than non-obese children, but ultimately require a lower maintenance mcg/kg dose once fentanyl distributes to deep or slowly equilibrating tissues.",

      "title": "A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF FLAXEDIL AND SYNCURINE COMBINED WITH PENTOTHAL ANESTHESIA IN MODIFYING ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY",
      "abstract": "The authors have treated over 200 patients with electroconvulsive therapy modified by Sodium Pentothal anesthesia and curarization with Syncurine or Flaxedil or both. Sodium Pentothal was the usual cause for the infrequently occurring cough, bronchospasm, and rash. No case of Flaxedil allergy was encountered in 111 patients. The availability of several intravenous anesthetics and several types of curarizing drugs supplemented by antihistaminics helps the therapist to avoid or control allergic respiratory reactions, but intubation should be available. After maximal softening of the seizure with Flaxedil, the time required for return of self-sustaining respiratory movement can be greatly shortened with the use of prostigmine or Tensilon. This cuts the time of oxygen administration after the seizure in half as compared with Syncurine-treated cases, as for the latter drug no antidote is available. Tensilon, 5 to 10 mg., must be given only intravenously after the seizure. Its use permits avoidance of atropine, needed when prostigmine is employed. As we believe atropinization is needed to prevent seizure-induced salivation and cardiac arrest, we prefer to give 2 to 2.5 mg. of prostigmine intramuscularly, conserving available veins for the more essential curarizing injection. After Flaxedil injection, pulse rates rose 10 to 40 beats per minute, whereas Syncurine produced no change. Blood pressure changes with Flaxedil are essentially the same as with Syncurine. Hypertensive patients may show a fall of 40 to 60 mm. systolic and 10 to 20 mm. diastolic, attributed to Pentothal anesthesia. Of 21 \"Flaxedil\" cases tested, two-thirds (including 2 markedly hypertensive patients) showed less than 10 mm. change in blood pressure before their seizure. During and immediately after the seizure blood pressure rose 40 to 60 mm. systolic and 10 to 30 mm. diastolic even when the seizure was externally perceptible only in the face. We believe that complete abolition of seizure muscle rigor decreases but does not remove the element of danger in the giving of ECT to patients with cardiovascular disease, as changes in blood pressure and cardiac rate and rhythm, probably of central origin, nonetheless occur. This produced coronary occlusion in one of our cases. Within the limitations outlined above, Flaxedil joins Syncurine as a valuable addition to available synthetic curarizing drugs employed in modification of the electroconvulsion.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Novel psychoactive drugs (NPS) has rapidly increase in the last years in the drug market as a recreational use. Fenethylline is a theophylline, an amphetamine-like drug, having stimulant effects similar to those of other amphetamine-type derivatives. Fenethylline was used as medicament for hyperactivity disorders in children, narcolepsy and depression, but it has also been used as a drug of abuse under the common name of ‘captagon’. The purpose of this report is to review the clinical evidence for the potential of abuse of fenethylline. We propose a case report and literature review. Method We conducted a systematic review of the literature with the principal database (PubMed, Enbase, PsychInfo) and we present a case report. Results The effects of fenethylline is characterized by euphoria, derealization, autopsychic and somatopsychic depersonalization, hallucination, agitation and decrease of pain perception. Discussion and conclusion The primary drug market for fenethyline (as captagon) has traditionally been countries located on the Arabian Peninsula but also North Africa since 2013. To our knowledge, there is no report on the recreational use of fenethylline in literature. The clinical features of fenethylline intoxication were also similar to effects from other amphetamine-like drugs. In our case report, dissociative symptoms are the core of fenethylline intoxication. Further research is warranted to replicate our clinical and qualitative observations and, in general, quantitative studies in large samples followed-up over time are needed. Methodological limitations, clinical implications and suggestions for future research directions are considered [1,2]. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

Vadocaine was administered in single doses of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 50 mg. At these dose levels vadocaine had no effects on the cardiovascular system, the haematological variables, blood biochemistry or urinary sediment examined as safety evaluation. The antitussive properties of the compound were studied using inhaled citric acid for induction of the cough response. The antitussive properties of vadocaine were most effective at a dose of 15 mg, although no statistical significance was found. Neither was any dose-response relationship noted. However, at this dose level vadocaine is apparently safe and its antitussive properties seem promising enough for further evaluation.",

If used properly spermicides can be more than 95% effective and they are about 85% effective even if they are not used properly all the time. They also meet the folowing important needs that other methods may fail to meet: 1) they are safe with no proven systemic side effects or even any serious local reactions; 2) they are readily available from commercial sources; 3) they are useful as a simple and easily understood introduction to fertility control; 4) they are convenient for use by couples who have intercourse frequently; 5) they are appropriate for short-term use or for adjunct use with other methods; 6) they are acceptable to women who might not otherwise use family planning; and 7) they are probably to some degree protective against venereal disease and certain other sexually related infections. The spermicidal products that are available come in 5 different forms: creams jellies foams in pressurized containers foaming tablets and suppositories. Each consists of a relatively inert base material which physically blocks the passage of sperm and simultaneously serves as a carrier for a chemically active ingredient which incapacitates the sperm before it can reach the ovum. Discussion focus is on histor usage acceptability measuring effectiveness protection against infection and research and development.",

Xylazine can be used orally, intranasally, sniffed, smoked, and injected, but is mostly used intravenously. Adverse effects of xylazine are secondary to central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular, and respiratory function depression. When alpha-2-receptors in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems are stimulated, physiological effects include bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory and CNS depression. There are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for the treatment of xylazine withdrawal or reversal of its overdose.

      "abstract": "ONE of the constant aims of the ophthalmic surgeon is to reduce post-operative inflammation to the minimum.The introduction of steroids has intensified interest in this problem.There is experimental evidence that steroids have a retarding effect on wound healing (Ashton and Cook, 1951; Newell and Dixon, 1951; Leopold, Purnell, Cannon, Steinmetz, and McDonald, 1951), but clinically this has not been confirmed (Woods, 1952;Dunnington, 1955), whereas their action in reducing inflammation in a non-specific fashion is more generally accepted (Gordon, McLean, and Koteen, 1953).Unfortunately, steroid therapy also has its complications and contraindications, notably steroid dependence on the continuation of therapy and the risk of infection by viruses and fungi or bacteria.This has lead to a search for substances with steroid-like actions that contained their virtues but not their vices.Oxyphenbutazone (Tanderil) may be regarded as one of these, combining pronounced anti-inflammatory activity with minimal disturbance of electrolyte or glucose metabolism and absence of dependence or the need for increased dosage.In experimental animals, oxyphenbutazone has been shown to be effective in reducing sterile inflammations (Wilhelmi, 1960), and it has been suggested (Domenjoz, 1960) that part of its action is on the pituitary, thus causing adrenal stimulation.However, adrenalectomy does not seriously reduce the effectiveness of the drug, and it is probable that it also has a peripheral action, perhaps by reducing the increased capillary permeability found in inflammatory conditions.In addition, it has a central antipyretic and analgesic effect.Oxyphenbutazone, a white powder insoluble in water, is soluble in alcohol and acetone; it is freely absorbed from the alimentary tract, although when taken by mouth it may prove to be a gastro-intestinal irritant and should be avoided when gastritis or peptic ulcer is suspected.Depression of the bone marrow may rarely occur, and the drug should not be given to patients with a history of blood dyscrasia or pyrazole sensitivity.Similar care should be taken with patients with cardiac, renal, or hepatic disease because of its mild but constant effect on electrolyte balance.Clinically the drug has been used to reduce post-operative inflammation in dental",

      "title": "The epidemic of fentanyl misuse and overdoses: challenges and strategies",
      "abstract": "Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid with analgesic and anesthetic properties, is currently associated with one of the deadliest addiction crises in the US. Misuse of fentanyl (and fentanyl analogues) has been estimated to be responsible for 48,000 (out of a total of 83,335) overdose deaths in the 12 months ending in June 20201, a rate that has increased more than 29 fold since 2012, when the annual fatalities from fentanyl and its analogues were 1,615. The cases of overdoses and deaths in the US are linked to illegally manufactured fentanyl, which rapidly penetrated the US illicit market since 2013. Though not as pervasively as in the US, increases in overdose deaths due to illicit fentanyl and its analogues have also occurred in Canada, in several European countries (including Estonia, Germany, Finland and the UK) and in Australia2. Fentanyl is relatively easy to synthesize and manufacture, and less difficult to traffic than heroin, since it requires much smaller volumes to transport across borders. It is, therefore, hugely profitable to drug dealers (50-100 times more than heroin), which can be expected to result in an expansion of the illicit fentanyl market across the globe. The majority of opioid-related overdose deaths in the US are the result of fentanyl being ingested as a substitute for heroin or with drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine that had been adulterated (cut) with the opioid, frequently without users being aware of this. Fentanyl, when used by itself or in combination with other drugs, can be taken orally, injected, snorted or smoked. Most heroin users do not report actively seeking fentanyl, and some are afraid of it but might have no choice because of the higher costs of uncontaminated heroin or its unavailability. When fentanyl is used to adulterate other drugs (heroin, prescription opioids, psychostimulants), it increases their lethality. In the case of psychostimulants, this occurs not only due to the synergistic effects on the cardiopulmonary system, but also because stimulant users, who have no tolerance to opioids, are at very high risk of overdosing when ingesting fentanyl. The unique pharmacological effects of fentanyl have contributed to its widespread misuse and are also the ones that make it a valuable therapeutic for anesthesia and for severe pain management. Fentanyl binds to mu-opioid receptors (MOR), which mediate the analgesic and the rewarding effects of opioid drugs, such as morphine and heroin, as well as their respiratory depressing actions3. However, fentanyl is much more potent at activating MOR-associated signaling than morphine (80-100 fold) or heroin (30-50 fold), and its higher lipophilicity leads to higher and faster brain uptake than for those other drugs. These properties underlie fentanyl's high potency as an analgesic and its rapid actions, which are beneficial for the treatment of breakthrough pain or other severe pain conditions. However, they are also responsible for its powerful rewarding effects, which can rapidly result in physical dependence and in addiction, and for its severe and abrupt inhibition of respiration, which increases the risk for overdose. The treatment of fentanyl addiction (fentanyl opioid use disorder or fOUD) is the same as for other opioid use disorders (OUD). It is based on the use of medications such as methadone (full MOR agonist), buprenorphine (partial MOR agonist) and naltrexone (MOR antagonist)4. These medications are the gold standard for OUD treatment, and multiple studies have shown that they prevent overdoses and relapse in patients exposed to fentanyl. However, clinical cases and anecdotal reports indicate that it is much more challenging to treat patients with fOUD than with other OUD. There are greater difficulties in initiating buprenorphine treatment, resulting from buprenorphine-precipitated withdrawal5 and lower rates of abstinence and retention after six months of buprenorphine treatment6. The slow clearance of fentanyl as a result of its accumulation in fatty tissues may require slower detoxification prior to buprenorphine or naltrexone induction, and the higher rates of tolerance and physical dependence associated with repeated fentanyl use might necessitate higher doses of methadone or buprenorphine than for other OUDs. Treatment of withdrawal symptoms during fentanyl detoxification might be aided, as for other opioids, by the use of the alpha-adrenergic drugs lofexidine and clonidine7. Overall, much more clinical research is needed to investigate how to optimally treat fOUD. Like other opioids, fentanyl can result in overdoses due to its respiratory depressant effects. Signs of overdose include slow irregular breathing, slowing of circulation, sedation, acute respiratory distress, seizures, and coma. With repeated opioid exposure, individuals develop tolerance to the respiratory depressant effects of opioids (tolerance also develops for analgesia and reward), allowing them to tolerate much higher doses than naïve individuals8. Because tolerance to opioids decreases with interruption of use, whether during voluntary detoxification or incarceration, the relapse to opioid use after treatment discontinuation or after release from jail/prison is particularly dangerous. Even for those who have developed tolerance to opioids, the very high potency of fentanyl, the impossibility of precisely dosing and the frequency with which drugs are mixed in the black market contribute to the high overdose risk associated with its misuse. As for other opioids, the treatment of fentanyl overdoses requires the timely delivery of naloxone (MOR antagonist) either via parenteral or intranasal administration3. Naloxone, which also has a very high affinity for MOR, displaces fentanyl from the receptor, thereby restoring breathing (as well as precipitating an acute opioid withdrawal). Clinical cases and case reports have indicated that overdoses from fentanyl frequently require multiple naloxone administrations, due to the shorter duration of the action of naloxone (t1/2: 1.3-2.4 hours) than that of fentanyl (t1/2: 7 to 8 hours), prolonged further by the slow clearance rates of fentanyl in frequent users. Additionally, when fentanyl is injected rapidly, it can result in chest wall rigidity, which interferes further with breathing and exacerbates the risk of death; these effects are not MOR-mediated and might reflect noradrenergic and cholinergic mechanisms9. All this generates the need for further development of fentanyl overdose treatments, including higher-dose naloxone formulations, autoinjectors that automatically release naloxone with an impending overdose, longer-acting opioid antagonists (i.e., nalmefene), treatments against chest wall rigidity, and medications to stimulate respiration and oxygenation to help overdoses from the combination of opioids with alcohol, benzodiazepines or stimulants. Modeling studies have revealed that the epidemic of opioid overdose deaths, including those from fentanyl, can be reversed by multi-pronged approaches that expand access to medications to treat opioid use disorders and increase retention in medication treatment, and by widely expanding access to naloxone for overdose reversals. It will also require strengthening the education of health care professionals in pain management, in safe use of opioids, and in how to screen and treat substance use disorders (including OUD). Allocation of resources to implement these interventions is necessary, and timely surveillance systems that can serve as early warning signals for the presence of fentanyl or other opioids in a community would also be beneficial. In parallel, prevention interventions are needed to protect against opioid misuse initiation, recognizing that socioeconomic factors have contributed to the opioid crisis and that addressing them is necessary for preventing OUD and other substance use disorders in the long term.",

      "title": "The Effect of Clonidine on Gastrointestinal Side Effects Associated with Ultra-Rapid Opioid Detoxification",
      "abstract": "Given the frequent failure rates and occurrence of early relapses with conventional opioid detoxification programs, the technique of ultra-rapid opioid detoxification (UROD) has become increasingly popular (1). This technique allows for rapid opioid withdrawal using a combination of oral (PO) and IV administered opioid antagonists (e.g., naloxone, nalmefene, and/or naltrexone). In an effort to reduce the systematic side effects associated with opioid withdrawal, the UROD procedure is normally performed under general anesthesia (2,3). However, acute short-lasting opioid withdrawal symptoms (e.g., hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, shivering, abdominal cramping, muscle pain, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) can be even more debilitating than those associated with conventional opioid withdrawal programs (4). Clonidine, an α2-adrenergic agonist, has been shown to suppress the opioid withdrawal symptoms in rats (5). In addition, clonidine has been found to possess antidiarrheal activity in humans with chronic diarrhea (6–9), and in animals after morphine withdrawal (5,10,11). Therefore, we performed a retrospective chart evaluation involving UROD procedures performed at two major medical centers in Los Angeles to evaluate whether the dose of clonidine administered during a UROD procedure influenced patient outcome with respect to gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. Methods A retrospective evaluation of the medical charts of 138 UROD patients at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (n = 54) and Centinela Hospital Medical Center (n = 84) in Los Angeles was conducted. The UROD protocols were approved by both medical centers and the chart review was considered to be exempt from IRB approval because the patient charts were reviewed anonymously. All of the study patients were addicted to either heroin, methadone, codeine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, or hydrocodone. Upon arrival in the UROD treatment room, standard anesthetic monitors were applied, as well as a bispectral index (BIS®) monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc. Natick, MA). Patients were premedicated with IV midazolam or diazepam (Tables 1 and 2). Anesthesia was induced with propofol, 1.5–2.0 mg/kg IV, and succinylcholine, 40–100 mg IV, was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained using a propofol infusion (50–200 μg/kg/min) to maintain a BIS value in the range of 55–60. Glycopyrrolate, 0.2 mg IV, was given at both the start and the end of the procedure as an antisialagogue, and a combination of ondansetron (4–8 mg IV) and droperidol (0.625–1.25 mg IV) was administered for antiemetic prophylaxis. Sandostatin (0.2–0.4 mg IV) was the standard therapy for diarrhea at both medical centers.Table 1: Demographic Characteristics, Anesthetic Medications, Withdrawal Symptoms, and Discharge Times After UROD Procedures Performed at Cedars-Sinai Medical CenterTable 2: Demographic Characteristics, Anesthetic Medications, Withdrawal Symptoms, and Discharge Times After UROD Procedures Performed at Centinela Hospital Medical CenterAt Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, clonidine, 0.1 mg PO, was given to patients for premedication before the UROD procedure. Clonidine was subsequently administered in doses of 0.1–1.5 mg via the nasogastric (NG) tube. Acute opioid withdrawal was initiated using naltrexone, 37.5–400 mg, via the NG tube. At Centinela Hospital Medical Center, clonidine was administered incrementally in 0.1-mg IV doses during the UROD procedure. Naltrexone, 300–350 mg via the NG tube, and/or naloxone, 5–15 mg IV, was then administered over 20–30 min to initiate the opioid withdrawal process, followed by either nalmefene (4–12 mg IV), or a combination of nalmefene (4 mg IV) and naloxone (25 mg IV) which was infused over an 8-h period. Approximately 4 h after the initial withdrawal symptoms ended, patients were administered an additional dose of naloxone, 2–4 mg IV, and then carefully observed for further clinical signs of acute opioid withdrawal. If no withdrawal symptoms were observed, the propofol infusion was discontinued and patients were allowed to awaken from anesthesia. Patients were then transferred to the intensive care unit for continuous electrocardiogram monitoring. Naltrexone, 25 mg PO, was given before discharge and all patients were subsequently administered naltrexone daily for 6 mo. The occurrence of acute withdrawal symptoms (e.g., hemodynamic changes, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) requiring a therapeutic intervention were recorded before discharge from the hospital. These data were analyzed according to the total dose of clonidine administered either PO (at Cedars) or IV (at Centinela). The overall incidences of GI side effects were compared at these two institutions. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way analysis of variance or Student's t-test for continuous variables, and when significant differences were determined, a post hoc intergroup comparison was performed using a Newman-Keuls multiple-comparison test. Categorical data were analyzed using χ2 or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. All tests were two-sided and P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results The clonidine subgroups were comparable with respect to demographic characteristics, dosages of sedative-hypnotics, and opioid antagonist medications administered during the UROD procedure at both medical centers (Tables 1 and 2). However, at Centinela Hospital, the clonidine subgroup receiving the larger total dose of clonidine (>1.0 mg IV) required a smaller dose of propofol than the subgroup receiving the smaller dosage of clonidine (≤1.0 mg IV). The incidences of withdrawal symptoms (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle spasms) were not significantly different among the clonidine subgroups at either medical center during the UROD procedure. However, the incidence of diarrhea after the UROD procedure was significantly decreased in patients who received larger dosages of clonidine (>1.0 mg IV or PO) compared with the smaller dosage subgroups at both centers (Tables 1 and 2). A comparison of the overall incidences of GI side effects at the two medical centers revealed less frequent incidences of vomiting (4% versus 11%, P > 0.05), and diarrhea (1% versus 13%, P < 0.05) during the UROD procedures at Centinela (versus Cedars-Sinai). However, muscle spasms were less frequent during the UROD procedures at Cedars-Sinai compared with Centinela (52% versus 75%, P < 0.05). After the UROD procedure, the incidences of nausea (39% versus 31%, P > 0.05) and vomiting (35% versus 26%, P > 0.05) were similar at the two medical centers. However, the incidence of diarrhea was significantly reduced after the UROD procedure at Centinela compared with Cedars-Sinai (11% versus 35%, P < 0.05). Discussion The acute withdrawal symptoms associated with the UROD procedure can lead to dehydration and electrolyte disturbances, as well as patient discomfort. Clonidine, an α2-adrenergic agonist, has been reported to be effective in suppressing symptoms of opioid withdrawal (12–16). There are no clinical studies evaluating the antidiarrheal activity of clonidine during and after UROD procedures. In animal studies, clonidine has been reported to prevent naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal symptoms in a dose-dependent manner (5,10,11). In a rat study (10), diarrhea occurred in all animals undergoing morphine withdrawal without clonidine. However, clonidine, 0.1 mg/kg IV, decreased the incidence of diarrhea by 50%, and a 0.3-mg/kg IV dose effectively prevented diarrhea in this animal model. In our retrospective clinical assessment, the incidence of diarrhea seemed to be decreased with increasing dosages of clonidine when given either PO or IV to patients undergoing UROD procedures. A comparison of the overall antidiarrheal efficacy of clonidine suggested that the IV route of administration was more effective than giving the drug PO. Clonidine has been used to treat patients with intractable diarrhea secondary to diabetes, cholera, or small bowel transplantation (6–8). Previous animal and human studies have suggested that the antidiarrheal properties of clonidine are largely attributed to effects on fluid absorption in the small bowel and intestinal motility (9,17–20). Although the site of action of clonidine in preventing diarrhea associated with opiate withdrawal is unclear (5), some authors have suggested that withdrawal-induced diarrhea may be mediated through α2-adrenoceptors located on intestinal smooth muscle (10,11). During the UROD procedure, clonidine was administered primarily to attenuate the systemic effects associated with opiate withdrawal (21). Most of the published studies used clonidine, 5–6 μg/kg PO, to control opiate withdrawal symptoms (11,12). However, larger doses of clonidine (e.g., >10 μg/kg) have been used in patients undergoing opiate detoxification without significant side effects (14). In this retrospective study, the dosage of clonidine used during the UROD procedures varied from 2 to 30 μg/kg. Although two patients in our study population experienced transient bradycardia after large doses of clonidine (>1 mg IV), this side effect did not require anticholinergic treatment. The use of larger IV doses of clonidine not only decreased the incidence of diarrhea, but also produced a reduction in the propofol dosage requirement during the UROD procedure. Our current analysis can be criticized because: 1) this was a retrospective chart review, 2) there was no \"placebo\" control group receiving no clonidine because of ethical concerns, and 3) the dosages of adjunctive drugs were not standardized (e.g., opioid antagonist). In the future, a prospective, randomized, double-blinded dose-ranging study should be performed to more precisely quantify the antidiarrheal effect of clonidine in patients undergoing UROD procedures. In conclusion, clonidine seems to be beneficial in reducing diarrhea associated with UROD procedures. In addition, the use of larger doses of IV clonidine can also produce a dose-dependent propofol-sparing effect.",

      "title": "B-337 Case Report: Fatal Opioid Overdose Induced by Over-the-Counter Cold Medication Diphenhydramine",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Accidental drug-related deaths frequently arise following ingestion of multiple co-intoxicants, including opioid analgesics. Hydrocodone, the most prescribed opioid for pain management, is metabolized by hepatic enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 to the pharmacologically active metabolite hydromorphone and the inactive metabolite norhydrocodone, respectively. As a result, inhibition of CYP2D6 by other pharmacologic agents can impair the analgesic properties of hydrocodone and prolong its half-life in circulation. One such example is diphenhydramine, which is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity. This case highlights a drug-drug interaction likely resulting in an accidental fatal opioid overdose. Case Presentation A 58-year-old female had longstanding prescriptions for hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Norco® 10/325), alprazolam, carisoprodol, and diltiazem. The decedent had recently taken an over-the-counter cold medication, diphenhydramine (Benadryl), shortly preceding death. A toxicology report (NMS labs, Horsham, PA) from a post-mortem femoral blood sample detected the presence of the following therapeutic compounds by High Performance Liquid Chromatography/Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (LC/TOF-MS) analysis: acetaminophen (14 μg/mL), hydrocodone (410 ng/mL), dihydrocodeine (hydrocodol, 24 ng/mL), alprazolam (42 ng/mL), carisoprodol (88 ng/mL), diltiazem (110 ng/mL), and diphenhydramine (150 ng/mL). Hydromorphone, the active metabolite of hydrocodone, was not detected (&amp;lt;2 ng/mL). With the exception of hydrocodone, which was present at fatal concentrations, all other compounds were within therapeutic range. Together, these observations are strongly suggestive of a drug-drug interaction leading to impaired hydrocodone metabolism. Conclusions This case report highlights a fatal opioid overdose as a result of CYP2D6 inhibition by diphenhydramine, a readily available over-the-counter medication. Post-mortem toxicological analysis revealed hydrocodone was present in lethal concentrations, whereas its pharmacologically active metabolite, hydromorphone, was undetectable at time of autopsy. Further, the patient was prescribed a formulation of hydrocodone in combination with acetaminophen, which was present at therapeutic concentrations despite the two drugs having similar elimination half-lives. These toxicological findings suggest administration of diphenhydramine precipitated a deadly accumulation of hydrocodone in the deceased. Overall, this case report underscores the importance of understanding and preventing harmful drug-drug interactions in patients taking opioid medications for pain management.",

      "abstract": "Pholcodine has antitussive activity similar to, or somewhat greater than, that of codeine in animal test systems. The drug, which has been formulated in many combination medications (45)--some rational and some quite irrational pharmacologically--also appears to be active in man, although the clear-cut demonstrations, unfortunately, are in artificially-induced cough models. Additional efficacy studies are needed. Preclinical toxicity studies demonstrate a generally safer profile for pholcodine than codeine, although pholcodine appears to have greater depressant effects on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems in animals. These effects have not been observed in man after administration of therapeutic doses. Pholcodine appears to be devoid of addiction liability in man. In contrast to codeine, pholcodine is not metabolised to morphine in man, a fact which may contribute to its more favourable toxicity profile, and it is metabolised and eliminated much more slowly than codeine.",

      "abstract": "Tetracyclines (TCN) were introduced in 1948 as broad‐spectrum antibiotics that may be used in the treatment of many common infections in children and adults. One of the side‐effects of tetracyclines is incorporation into tissues that are calcifying at the time of their administration. They have the ability to chelate calcium ions and to be incorporated into teeth, cartilage and bone, resulting in discoloration of both the primary and permanent dentitions. This permanent discoloration varies from yellow or gray to brown depending on the dose or the type of the drug received in relation to body weight. Minocycline hydrochloride, a semisynthetic derivative of tetracycline often used for the treatment of acne, has been shown to cause pigmentation of a variety of tissues including skin, thyroid, nails, sclera, teeth, conjunctiva and bone. Adult‐onset tooth discoloration following long‐term ingestion of tetracycline and minocycline has also been reported. The remarkable side‐effect of minocycline on the oral cavity is the singular occurrence of “black bones”, “black or green roots” and blue‐gray to gray hue darkening of the crowns of permanent teeth. The prevalence of tetracycline and minocycline staining is 3–6%. The mechanism of minocycline staining is still unknown. Most of the reviewed literature consisted of case reports; longitudinal clinical trials are necessary to provide more information on the prevalence, severity, etiology and clinical presentation of tetracycline and TCN‐derivative staining in the adult population.",

Preshock was administered in a context different from, or the same as, that in which the test shock was delivered. The combination of naloxone and preshock led to more defensive burying than did saline and preshock. This was the case regardless of preshock context, a result suggesting that fear and/or analgesia may not always be critical ingredients in the preshock-naloxone interaction. Interpretative matters notwithstanding, the pattern of results for defensive burying was in basic agreement with that of other research on naloxone and defensive behavior and represents an extension of the literature to a new species-specific defense reaction.",

      "title": "Analytical Investigations of Toxic p-Phenylenediamine (PPD) Levels in Clinical Urine Samples with Special Focus on MALDI-MS/MS",
      "abstract": "Para-phenylenediamine (PPD) is a common chromophoric ingredient in oxidative hair-dyes. In some African countries like Sudan, Egypt and Morocco but also in India this chemical is used alone or in combination with colouring extracts like Henna for dyeing of the hair or the skin. Excessive dermal exposure to PPD mainly leads to the N-mono- and N,N′-diacetylated products (MAPPD, DAPPD) by N-acetyltransferase 1 and 2 (NAT1 and 2) catalyzed reactions. Metabolites and PPD are mainly excreted via renal clearance. Despite a low risk of intoxication when used in due form, there are numerous cases of acute intoxication in those countries every year. At the ENT Hospital - Khartoum (Sudan) alone more than 300 cases are reported every year (∼10% fatal), mostly caused by either an accidental or intended (suicidal) high systemic exposure to pure PPD. Intoxication leads to a severe clinical syndrome including laryngeal edema, rhabdomyolysis and subsequent renal failure, neurotoxicity and acute toxic hepatitis. To date, there is no defined clinical treatment or antidote available and treatment is largely supportive. Herein, we show the development of a quick on-site identification assay to facilitate differential diagnosis in the clinic and, more importantly, the implementation of an advanced analytical platform for future in-depth investigations of PPD intoxication and metabolism is described. The current work shows a sensitive (∼25 µM) wet chemistry assay, a validated MALDI-MS/MS and HPLC-UV assay for the determination of PPD and its metabolites in human urine. We show the feasibility of the methods for measuring PPD over a range of 50–1000 µM. The validation criteria included linearity, lower limit of quantification (LLOQ), accuracy and precision, recovery and stability. Finally, PPD concentrations were determined in clinical urine samples of cases of acute intoxication and the applied technique was expanded to identify MAPPD and DAPPD in the identical samples.",

Preliminary results indicate a biological half-life of 22 to 32 hours and a therapeutic serum concentration of 5 to 50 ng/ml. Many studies report tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects with chronic administration. Major side effects of the drug are drowsiness, ataxia, and behavior changes. They tend to be dose related, occur early in the course of therapy, and may subside with chronic administration. Accordingly, the dosage is begun at a low level and increased slowly.",

      "abstract": "Hydantoin derivatives are commonly used anticonvulsants. In general, they are effective for partial-onset seizures and tonic-clonic seizures, but not for absence seizures. Phenytoin is the most important drug in this group, and other drugs, ethotoin, and mephenytoin, are also commonly used to treat epilepsy. Prodrugs such as derivatives have been created. Phenytoin is effective in some cases of trigeminal neuralgia and related neuralgia. Phenytoin is also used to treat arrhythmias. Hydantoins or glycolylureas are heterocyclic organic compounds with the formula CH2C(O)NHC(O)NH. It is a colorless solid formed by the reaction of glycolic acid and urea. It is an oxidized derivative of imidazolidine. In a more general sense, hydantoins can refer to groups and classes of compounds that share the same ring structure as their parent. For example, phenytoin (see below) has two phenyl groups substituted at the 5th carbon of the hydantoin molecule. Actual chemotherapy for epilepsy dates back to the 1850s when \"inorganic bromides\" were introduced. However, it is worth noting that around the 1920s, the therapeutic and beneficial use of 'phenobarbital' usheredin an era of meaningful treatment of epilepsy. Hydantoin ring chemistry is the synthesis of rings by various methods and their applications in the medical field. Previous descriptions of hydantoin-containing compounds have broad pharmacological and biological activities, including anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-immune, antimetabolite, antioxidant, antibacterial, CNS-related, anticonvulsant, antitussive, and cytoprotective activities.&#x0D; Keywords: Hydantoin derivatives, anticonvulsants, partial-onset seizures and tonic-clonic seizures",

(1) Although it has been used empirically for a wide range of ailments in the past, including skin conditions, nerve problems, and muscle pain, the primary uses currently are for depression and nervous conditions, (2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7) due to its ability to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine within the brain. (2)Although promising evidence is emerging for the clinical use of St. John’s wort, data specific to pediatrics are still limited, warranting additional research.Surveys in the United States and Britain of herbal use for the treatment of pediatric depression (8)(9) demonstrate that St. John’s wort is used commonly by children (22% and 9% in the two surveys, respectively). Formal evaluation of efficacy in pediatric populations is preliminary but shows some promise. Presently, no systematic reviews or randomized, controlled trials have been published regarding the use of St. John’s wort in children.An open-label pilot study conducted by Findling and associates (10) analyzed the use of St. John’s wort in children between the ages of 6 and 16 years for treatment of major depressive disorder. The starting dose was 150 mg 3 times daily for 4 weeks. Exclusion criteria included failure to respond to 4 weeks of antidepressant therapy. Patients considered clinically nonresponsive to St. John’s wort (as per a priori criteria) after 4 weeks had their dosage increased to 300 mg 3 times daily. A total of 33 patients were enrolled in the study, with a mean age of 10.5 years (SD, 2.9 y). At the end of the 8-week trial, 25 patients met the criteria of clinical response (76%). Also, 93% of the study population decided to continue therapy at the end of the 8-week study. Statistically significant improvements were documented in the two primary outcome measures (Children’s Depression Rating Scale-Revised and Children’s Depression Inventory) from baseline to 8 weeks. The major limitations of this study are that it was open-label, had no control group, had a small sample size, and had limited follow-up (8 wk).In a prospective, open-label, outpatient study, Simeon and associates (11) investigated the efficacy of St. John’s wort in adolescents between 12 and 17 years of age (mean age, 14.8 y) who had major depressive disorders. Of the 26 patients enrolled, only 11 completed the 8-week study; the remaining 58% were either noncompliant or discontinued use due to continuing or worsening depression. Nine of the 11 compliant patients (82%) showed a significant clinical response, as indicated by the Clinical Global Improvement scores (either “very much improved” or “much improved”) at the final visit. The limitations of this study include its lack of a control group, small sample size, short follow-up period (8 wk), and open-label design.In an observational study involving pediatric patients taking St. John’s wort for symptoms of depression, physicians and parents were asked to complete questionnaires about the efficacy and tolerability of the treatment. (12) Descriptive data were collected on 101 patients between the ages of 1 and 12 years (median age, 9 y). The median dose was 300 mg daily. Follow-up lasted 6 weeks, with physicians and parents reporting “excellent” efficacy in 55% of the patients. Although ratings of depressive symptoms improved over the course of the study, given the open-label, observational design, it is hard to interpret how clinically significant such improvements were. Physicians and parents did report high ratings of tolerability, but there were no descriptions of adverse events, and there was a high rate of losses to follow-up. Although 101 subjects were enrolled in the study, only 74 children were included in the final analysis. It is concerning that nine children dropped out during the trial, six of them because of inadequate therapeutic effects.The data obtained from the previously cited studies show some promising results for the tolerability and potential efficacy of St. John’s wort in the treatment of depression in children. Better-designed research involving blinded controls is required to strengthen the findings.Formal evaluation of St. John’s wort in the pediatric population includes its use in otitis media. (13) A randomized, controlled trial studying a combination product containing Hypericum perforatum in olive oil (as well as Allium sativum, Verbascum thapsus, and Calendula flores) found significant improvements in ear pain associated with otitis media in children between the ages of 6 and 18 years (n=103). This product was determined to be as effective as anesthetic ear drops in relieving ear pain.A systematic review analyzing the adverse effects associated with St. John’s wort in patients of all ages concluded that the herb is well tolerated in most individuals, with adverse events occurring in approximately 1% to 3% of patients. (14) The rates of adverse events were similar compared with placebo and less compared with other commonly prescribed antidepressants. Clinical studies have found that healthy individuals can tolerate St. John’s wort for up to 3 months. The adverse effects reported most commonly included gastrointestinal (GI) upset, fatigue, headache, restlessness, and dry mouth. Allergic skin reactions and increased photosensitization also have been identified, but evidence regarding the clinical relevance of these findings is conflicting. (1) (14) Fair- or sensitive-skinned individuals or those who have skin diseases should be cautioned about this possible risk. Potentially more serious adverse events, such as manic episodes, neuropathy, and serotonin syndrome, have been reported, but they were rare, and evidence is not clear whether St. John’s wort was the only contributing factor. (1)(14)Studies analyzing the effects of St. John’s wort in the pediatric population found generally good tolerance for up to 8 weeks with appropriate doses. (10)(12) The most common adverse effects were dizziness, diarrhea, and change in appetite. (10)(12) Less commonly reported effects included constipation, headache, chills, GI discomfort, rash, fatigue, and photosensitivity. Treatment with St. John’s wort was found not to be associated with any clinically significant changes in weight, vital signs, or laboratory test results. (10) One case of worsening nervousness presented in the observational study, in which symptoms changed from “not present” at baseline to “mild” at 2 weeks. (12) Overall, the adverse events experienced in pediatric patients using St. John’s wort were mild and short-lived. Additional research is needed to determine the long-term safety of St. John’s wort use in children.Sufficient evidence is lacking to recommend the use of St. John’s wort in women who are pregnant or lactating, and the drug is rated as being risk category C in pregnant women. (15) In two cases of St. John’s Wort use during human pregnancy, no immediate observable adverse effects were demonstrated. (16)In terms of breastfeeding, one case report found that only hyperforin (not hypericin) was excreted in human milk after multiple sampling of both fore and hind milk. (17) Hypericin and hyperforin were immeasurable in the infant’s plasma. An observational cohort study was conducted in 33 breastfeeding women receiving St. John’s wort and 101 disease-matched controls as well as 33 age- and parity-matched nondisease controls. (18) The women were followed for 2 years, with no significant differences in adverse events. In the control infants, there was one case of colic; in the treatment group, there were two cases of colic, two cases of drowsiness, and one case of lethargy. No medical treatment was required for any of these reported events. No significant differences were found in relation to milk production or infant weight during the first postnatal year.Numerous drug interactions are associated with St. John’s wort, and caution is warranted during its concomitant use with certain medications (TableT1). The most significant interactions are the possible induction of serotonin syndrome when St. John’s wort is combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the induction of the CYP450 3A4 enzyme, which could reduce the plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by this pathway. (14)(19) (20) Concomitant drugs of particular concern in a pediatric and adolescent population are cyclosporine, warfarin, oral contraceptives, protease inhibitors, and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. (14) (19)(20)(21)Although several drug interactions associated with St. John’s wort have been reported, no clinical reports of these interactions are available within the pediatric population. Encouraging parents to report the use of St. John’s wort in their children is imperative to assess the safety of concomitant medication use.The multiple constituents of St. John’s wort identified as potential active ingredients include naphthodianthrones, flavonoids, and xanthones. Most preparations are standardized to hypericin content (a naphthodianthrone), but recent data indicate other active ingredients, including hyperforin. (22) (23) The precise mechanisms of action are not known and are being debated. Irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity noted in vitro has not been observed in vivo. Other postulated mechanisms include selective inhibition of serotonin, gamma-aminobutyrate, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake in the central nervous system. (1) (24). Studies also have identified antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory actions in association with St. John’s wort, although details are scarce on the exact mechanisms. (2)(4)Commercially available extracts of St. John’s wort are manufactured as capsules, tablets, or caplets. (2) Studies conducted with pediatric patients have found good tolerance with doses ranging from 300 to 900 mg/d in divided doses for up to 8 weeks. (10)(12)Although most product labels state that the extract is standardized to 0.3% hypericin content, additional evaluation suggests that this concentration may vary considerably. (23) Patients should be cautioned to consider this variance when selecting an appropriate product.Although preliminary data suggest efficacy and tolerability of St. John’s wort for the treatment of depression in children, additional research with better study designs is needed to support using this agent as an antidepressant in the pediatric population. Clinicians must inquire as to whether families are giving this agent to their depressed children.The authors would like to thank Wendy Weber (Bastyr Center for Natural Health) for her constructive feedback.",

The mechanism by which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs produce these effects is not fully understood; however, it is believed to be related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins.1 Prostaglandins (for example, bradykinin) are thought to sensitize pain receptors to mechanical or chemical stimulation. 1 In gynecologic and obstetric applications, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are useful for treating various pain syndromes thought to result from an increase in serum prostaglandins, such as dysmenorrhea, uterine contractions, and premenstrual physical complaints (back and muscle aches, headache, breast tenderness, and gastrointestinal discomfort). Thirty to sixty percent of patients receiving indomethacin report adverse effects, most involving the central nervous and gastrointestinal systems.1 This report describes a psychotic reaction in a patient who received an indomethacin suppository postpartum.",

      "abstract": "Benzodiazepine drugs are controversial because of safety and abuse liability concerns, although they have clinically relevant pharmacological differences. The current article reviews studies pertaining to the pharmacology, safety, and abuse liability of oxazepam. Compared to other benzodiazepine drugs, oxazepam has a favorable safety and abuse liability profile, which may be related to its pharmacology. Oxazepam is more slowly absorbed and enters the brain more slowly than other benzodiazepine drugs; it does not have active metabolites and does not accumulate with chronic dosing; its metabolism is not affected by age or by mild/moderate liver disease; and it is not prone to drug-drug interactions. Oxazepam also binds to the translocator protein, which stimulates the synthesis of neurosteroids, and this effect may contribute to its reduced abuse liability.",

Chronic constipation is often unrelieved by simple laxatives, dietary manipulation or lifestyle modification, with other specialist treatment options being invasive and often not widely available. More recently attention has turned to newer prokinetic agents, such as prucalopride (Resolor®), which increase gut motility and intestinal transit, for the relief of chronic constipation. While these are not effective for everyone, there is evidence that prucalopride can increase bowel frequency, relieve bothersome symptoms associated with constipation and improve quality of life for women who have failed to achieve satisfactory relief from two other laxatives (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence).",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors are preferred by most men for the oral treatment of erectile dysfunction. In many guidelines, this therapy is recommended as first-line therapy because of convenience, high efficacy, and low rates of side-effects. Sildenafil was the first drug for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, introduced in 1998. There are now two new phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, vardenafil and tadalafil, for which approval was recently given in the European Union and is expected this year in the United States. Recent findings Sildenafil has proved to be a very effective medicinal product. According to initial studies, vardenafil and tadalafil have demonstrated efficacy comparable to that of sildenafil. However, fewer data are available evaluating the adverse effects of vardenafil and tadalafil, particularly on their long-term use and their use in high-risk groups. Interestingly, vardenafil and tadalafil have a higher potency than sildenafil. Moreover, the long life of tadalafil has been associated with an erectogenic potential of the drug lasting for more than 24 h. The advantage of this is the possibility of a patient engaging in sexual activity more than once after a single administration of the drug. Summary In the future, in addition to sildenafil, the new phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors vardenafil and tadalafil will play an important role in the management of erectile dysfunction, depending on the patient's health profile.",

      "abstract": "The review article is devoted to modern information about the effects and main indications for the use of metronidazole and its place in the pharmacotherapy of infectious diseases. Metronidazole remains an essential drug for the treatment of various infections due to its broad spectrum of action, high efficacy, and low level of resistance. Its use in the prevention and treatment of anaerobic infections, as well as in surgery, makes it indispensable in clinical practice. Widespread use increases the likelihood of side effects. Metronidazole can cause a wide range of adverse reactions, ranging from mild to severe. The most common include nausea, metallic taste in the mouth, diarrhea, and headache. More serious effects such as neuropathy or allergic reactions are also possible. Some side effects of metronidazole can significantly impair the quality of life of patients, which may lead to decreased adherence to treatment. Long-term use of metronidazole may increase the risk of developing more serious adverse effects such as peripheral neuropathy, metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, metronidazole-induced cerebellar syndrome, etc.",

      "title": "Pharmacovigilance in the paediatric respiratory medicine. The misuse of some mucolytic drugs in children",
      "abstract": "Background. There are several agents with mucolytic properties. The main effect of these compounds is related to reduce viscosity of sputum. Seven years ago we observed a lot of children who presented in emergency department of paediatrics that the main symptoms were cough, wheezing, bronchospasm, and sometime reflex vomiting. The intensity and duration of cough and bronchospasm were strongly linked to orally use of carbocysteine. Method. Two years ago we noted the same symptoms after use of carbocysteine, acetylcysteine, and ambroxol hydrochloride in children. We tried to establish if a relationship between the use of these three mucolytic drugs and exaggereted cough or/and bronchospasm in children can be done. This time we focused on 220 paediatric subjects receiving one of the three mucolytic drugs: acetylcysteine, carbocysteine or ambroxol or even a combination of these agents. The statistical evaluation was carried out using chi square test. Results. The use for a few days of any of three agents was associated with prolonged coughing, the development of wheezing and even acute asthma episodes. By the age subgroup distribution we can emphasize that a significant percentage of children belongs to 1-2 years category (37.73%, 83 cases), folowed by the 3-4 years subgoup (24.09%, 53 cases). Other important aspect regard to use of mucolytic drugs in children is the presence and misuse of those three mentioned drugs in the management of respiratory infections or other respiratory diseases of infants: 38 cases in 0-1 years category. All three mucolytic agents are responsible for admission into the hospital in a great proportion: 43 of 48 admitted children. Conclusions. These drugs elicits an irritating effect on the airways. In children with asthma, recurrent wheezing or upper and lower respiratory tract infection the use of acetylcysteine, carbocysteine, and ambroxol should be avoided. Orally administered, these agents are relatively well tolerated, but clinical studies in chronic bronchitis and asthma have been disappointing. Overall, we believe that the use of carbocysteine, acetylcysteine, and ambroxol hydrochloride in children exceeds the therapeutic benefit.",

      "abstract": "The antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics, and clinical uses of vancomycin are reviewed. Vancomycin interferes with peptidoglycan biosynthesis in multiplying organisms and is bactericidal. It is supplied as the hydrochloride salt and is available in 500-mg ampuls. Vancomycin is usually administered intravenously or orally. I.V. vancomycin should be administered slowly (over 30--60 min) and in an adequate volume (100--250 ml) of 5% dextrose injection. Usual adult dose is 500 mg every six hours or 1 g every 12 hours. Serum vancomycin kinetics are best explained on the basis of a two- or three-compartment open model. Vancomycin is almost completely eliminated through the kidneys. Mean vancomycin concentrations in the presence of inflamed meninges, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, ascitic fluid, synovial fluid, and bile are approximately 15% of the serum concentrations. Vancomycin is used prophylactically to prevent infections caused by gram-positive cocci. Vancomycin is an ideal drug for prophylaxis in prosthetic implant surgery because of its long serum half-life and activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staph. aureus. Vancomycin has been used in the prevention and treatment of shunt infection in hemodialysis patients. It can be used adjunctly with a number of antibiotics to treat a variety of bacterial infections. Vancomycin is recognized as one of the most potent antistaphylococcal drugs available. It is the drug-of-choice in the treatment of serious methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus infections. It is the preferred therapy for Clostridium difficile (antibiotic-associated) colitis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Valbenazine for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Chronic intake of typical neuroleptics or centrally acting dopamine receptor blocking antiemetics may cause onset of tardive syndromes. Various types exist. One of them is tardive dyskinesia, characterised by often stigmatising, purposeless, rapid, repetitive, stereotypic, involuntary movements of face, limbs or trunk. Effective symptomatic drug treatment options beyond application of tetrabenazine are rare. Tetrabenazine is usually administered three times daily due to the short half life of this agent.Areas covered: This narrative review discusses the value of valbenazine for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia as a therapeutic alternative to tetrabenazine.Expert commentary: Valbenazine is a selective inhibitor of vesicular monoamine transporter 2, which is metabolized to (+)-alpha-dihydrotetrabenazine. Valbenazine and particularly its metabolite inhibit vesicular monoamine transporter 2 function. Once daily intake of valbenazine ameliorated the severity of tardive dyskinesia. The chiral purity of valbenazine circumvents generation of the (-)alpha and (+) and (-)beta dihydrotetrabenazine metabolites of tetrabenazine or deutetrabenazine. Valbenazine and its metabolite do not antagonize postsynaptic monoamine receptors in contrast to the tetrabenazine formulations. Therefore one may hypothesize that fewer and less severe motor and psychopathological side effects will occur during valbenazine long term application compared with tetrabenazine or deutretrabenazine.",

Fortunately, the nephrotoxicity of each of these drugs appears to be reversible provided their administration is stopped soon enough. Patients with underlying renal disease appear to be particularly sensitive to most of these agents. This sensitivity may be attributable in part to the tendency of these drugs to accumulate rapidly in the blood of uremic patients given ordinary therapeutic doses and in part to the diminished renal functional reserve of uremic patients. Tetracycline may now be added to the group of potentially nephrotoxic drugs, because a reversible Fanconi-like syndrome produced by preparations containing degraded tetracycline has been observed. <h3>Tetracyclines.—</h3> A primary renal toxic effect of undegraded",

The drugs may exhibit effects independently or may interfere with each other. Metformin is an anti-diabetic drug and diclofenac is a NSAID. The in vitro interaction of metformin with diclofenac was studied at room temperature and at different pH conditions. The studies were performed by various UV-Visible spectrophotometric, conductometric and HPLC methods. It was found that metformin formed stable 1:1 complex with diclofenac.

Overall, it is a very safe drug with few side effects. A rare side effect of this medicine is interstitial nephritis (IN). With discontinuation of the drug the renal function usually restores. However, if damage has not been detected for a long time, irreversible changes may occur. In this article, we present a clinical case of mesalamine induced IN. A 56-year-old man who has had ulcerative colitis for 20 years, was admitted due to mesalamine induced acute renal failure. A year before, the patient had been diagnosed with mesalamine-induced interstitial nephritis and the treatment with mesalamine was discontinued. The symptoms of ulcerative colitis worsened, and the patient independently decided to start taking mesalamine, which resulted in worsening of his health condition and impaired renal function. Mesalamine has been discontinued, additional treatment for acute kidney failure has been administered including hemodialysis. Renal function recovered and the patient was released for further treatment of ulcerative colitis and monitoring of renal function.",

Of note, recreational use of ketamine may pose a threat to public health, leading to numerous physical, as well as psychiatric negative effects. In addition, simultaneously or sequentially ketamine use with other drugs, resulting in serious health consequences. Currently, there are no specific treatment options for managing compulsive drug-seeking behavior in patients with ketamine use disorder, while the pharmacotherapy of side effects is limited and mostly symptomatic. In this chapter, we discuss ketamine abuse history. Further, we proposed the mechanisms of neural disinhibition underlying addiction development in ketamine-dependent patients. We have also included details of possible negative consequences focusing on long-term and recreational ketamine use for both, central and peripheral systems. Finally, we provide an overview of ketamine concomitant use and corresponding adverse interactions.",

      "abstract": "The effectiveness of systemic lidocaine in relieving acute and chronic pain has been recognized for over 35 years. In particular, systemic lidocaine has been utilized both as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for intractable neuropathic pain during the last decade. The introduction of oral lidocaine congeners such as mexiletine has significantly extended the usage of lidocaine therapy in chronic pain settings. However, a number of clinical issues remain to be addressed including (1) an effective, meaningful dose range for the clinical lidocaine test, (2) the predictive value of the lidocaine test for an oral trial of lidocaine congeners, (3) identification of pain symptoms and signs relieved by systemic lidocaine, (4) comparisons of therapeutic effects between systemic lidocaine and its oral congeners, and (5) long-term outcomes of systemic lidocaine and its oral congeners. Mechanisms of neuropathic pain relief from lidocaine therapy are yet to be understood. Both central and peripheral mechanisms have been postulated. Systemic lidocaine is thought to have its suppressive effects on spontaneous ectopic discharges of the injured nerve without blocking normal nerve conduction. However, there remain inconsistencies in the scientific basis underlying the clinical application of lidocaine therapy. Recent demonstration of changes in tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive and TTX-resistant sodium channels following nerve injury and their link to certain neuropathic pain symptoms may lead to the development of subtype-specific sodium channel blockers. The thoughtful use of lidocaine therapy and the potential application of subtype-specific sodium channel blockers could provide better management of distinctive neuropathic pain symptoms.",

A case is presented in which a doctor, who previously admitted to using pethidine, was suspected of re-using, following a second positive urine test. A laboratory had reported the presence of pethidine in the doctor's urine; however, the doctor denied re-use. The norpethidine (normeperidine) metabolite, normally found in urine, had not been detected, raising concern over the laboratory's conclusion and necessitating an independent investigation. Because the major metabolite of pethidine is pethidinic acid (meperidinic acid), accounting for approximately 40% of the excreted dose, its presence or absence were deemed to be important criteria in interpreting the laboratory result. Pethidinic acid was synthesized by alkaline hydrolysis of pethidine and used as a control. Urine samples from a patient receiving pethidine for pain, from the previous pethidine use of the doctor, and the urine under question plus the control were analyzed for the presence of pethidinic acid using electrospray mass spectrometry. Pethidinic acid was found in all samples except the one under dispute. The absence of pethidinic acid appeared to corroborate the doctor's denial of re-use.",

      "abstract": "Fentanyl is a potent synthetic opioid with short-acting analgesic activity after intravenous or subcutaneous administration. The potency and lipid solubility of fentanyl make it suitable for delivery via the transdermal therapeutic system in the treatment of chronic pain. In this paper a case of nonfatal, severe poisoning after intravenous injection of the content from four transdermal patches (Durogesic 75 microg/h) in the 18-year-old male opiate abuser is presented. The present case demonstrates the possibility of intravenous abuse of transdermal patches and the risk of severe intoxication. In the cases of suspected fentanyl overdose specific assays should be utilized for the detection of fentanyl because it may not be detected by the routine opiate screening procedure.",

      "title": "Effect of Using Tramadol on Shoulder Dislocation",
      "abstract": "Background: One of the side effects of tramadol is seizure. Tramadol is a synthetic analgesic used to treat mild to moderate pain. Tramadol can cause seizures in the range of treatment and toxic doses. This seizure is usually in a generalized tonic-clonic from and usually occurs in the first 24 hours after ingestion. Case Presentation: The patient was a 32-year-old man referring to the emergency department with a right shoulder joint dislocation. It was reported that after a tonic-clonic seizure for about 1 minute, it has been followed by foaming at the mouth, eye lifting, urinary incontinence and loss of consciousness for about 5 minutes. He used a combination substance of sildenafil and tramadol to treat an early ejaculation. The patient has referred to the hospital 5 times with shoulder dislocation, without providing a detailed explanation about the use of tramadol and subsequent seizures Discussion: Tramadol misuse and overdose is a common medical issue in Iran and around the world. Regarding the arbitrary use of tramadol in Iran, especially through the non-scientific prescriptions by apothecaries in some cases such as early ejaculation treatment, attention to patient records along with the cause of referral is essential. Conclusion: Considering the prevalence of tramadol use, the community of physicians is advised to think of tramadol as a common cause for shoulder dislocation.",

Whereas the emergence of resistance is a major problem with the older quinolones such as nalidixic acid, this appears to be a minor problem with the new fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. These drugs are bactericidal and are well-absorbed orally. Parenteral preparations should be available in the future. The drugs are particularly active against gram-negative bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The fluoroquinolones are less active against pneumococci, Group A streptococci, Pseudomonas cepacia, and most anaerobes. The drugs appear potentially useful to treat urinary tract infections caused by multiply resistant pathogens, prostatitis, gastrointestinal pathogens, osteomyelitis, gram-negative pneumonia, and sexually transmitted diseases. Adverse effects occur in approximately 10% of patients and include gastrointestinal symptoms and potential central nervous system toxicity in patients receiving theophylline, non-steroidal drugs, or caffeine. The oral quinolones may reduce the costs of treating serious infections in the elderly.",

This recent event has major implications for paediatric hospitals all over the country. The use of a more concentrated formulation is of particular concern in low-weight infants because the required volumes of digoxin are almost impossible to draw precisely. Such a situation is problematic because of the narrow therapeutic index of digoxin. There are different ways to deal with this inconvenient situation; however, none is as efficient or safe for infants as the discontinued formulation. The authors believe it remains imperative that patients requiring intravenous digoxin be treated with the safest and most efficient formulation possible, regardless of their age or size.",

Suicidal poisoning with lidocaine pharmaceutical formulations is rare since no pharmaceutical dosage forms for oral use are available except gels and sprays used as local anesthetics in dentistry. Cases: Three cases of suicidal poisoning by ingestion of the content of lidocaine topical spray are reported in the present study. The cases developed episodes of seizure requiring diazepam and other therapeutic modalities upon admission. Eventually, one of the cases expired . Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first reported case of suicidal poisoning after ingestion of this formulation which highlights the fact that lidocaine topical spray formulation may be used for committing suicide. Ingestion of lidocaine present in topical spray can induce varying levels of toxicity that can even be fatal .",

      "abstract": "Sir,\r\n\r\nIn 1992, the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning in the Scoline® (suxamethonium chloride, GlaxoSmithKline, USA) package insert after receiving reports of intractable cardiac arrests.1 It stated: “Since there may be no signs or symptoms to alert the practitioner as to which patients are at risk, it is recommended that the use of succinylcholine in children should be reserved for emergency intubation or instances where immediate securing of the airway is necessary, e.g. laryngospasm, difficult airway, full stomach or intramuscular (IM) use when a suitable vein is inaccessible.”\r\n\r\nScoline® has been used for rapid sequence tracheal intubation since its introduction into clinical practice in Europe in 1951 and in the USA in 1952.2 It gained popularity for its quick onset (less than 60 seconds) and ultrashort duration of action. Scoline® came to rule the practice of anaesthesia and continues to do so even today. It is the gold standard against which the other muscle relaxants are compared;3 however, a number of clinical case reports have shown clearly that the use of scoline has been associated with a number of serious adverse effects4,5 and its use has declined since 1992.\r\n\r\nIn our hospital, there have been cases (unpublished reports) of prolonged apnoea and trismus following scoline use. Since it is not possible to predict at the outset which patient will have prolonged apnoea unless a family history is available, is it prudent to use scoline in cases of anticipated difficult intubation? Cardiac arrests after Scoline® use have been reported in Japan in pregnant patients who had been immobilised due to concern about preterm labour.6 A couple of reports even mention that the use of Scoline® led to a ‘can’t ventilate and can’t intubate’ situation due to severe trismus in an emergency,7,8 and even following attempts at routine intubation.9 Are these adverse effects acceptable in current day practice of medicine and anaesthesia?\r\n\r\nFor the quick onset of relaxation of vocal cords, rocuronium bromide, a non-depolarising muscle relaxant, is available (Esmeron® N.V. Organon, Oss, Netherlands). It was introduced in clinical practice in 1994 and has been used in many countries for the last 17 years. It belongs to the aminosteroid group and studies show that it achieves rapid onset of good intubating conditions within 60 seconds if a dose of 1.2 mg /kg is given intravenously.10–13 In patients for whom intravenous access is not available it can even be administered intramuscularly.14 It has been safely administered in the paediatric age group from 1–24 months of age.15\r\n\r\nWhen comparing the intubating conditions between rocuronium and Scoline®, the Cochrane database meta-analysis found that rocuronium is less effective than succinylcholine for creating excellent intubation conditions and recommended that rocuronium should therefore only be used as an alternative to succinylcholine when it is known that succinylcholine should not be used.16 However, in an emergency situation it is not known and cannot be predicted which patient will have an adverse reaction to Scoline®.6–8\r\n\r\nOn reviewing and comparing the overall safety and efficacy profile, rocuronium has not shown any of the serious adverse reactions seen with scoline. It is even used safely in asthmatic patients.17 The only adverse reaction is hypersensitivity, but the overall incidence is not more than Scoline®, or other non-depolarising muscle relaxants. The main concern with rocuronium has been the long duration of action.18 The possibility of awakening the patients in case of an inability to ventilate was the main reason preventing the use of this drug for rapid sequence intubation.\r\n\r\nWith the availability of sugammadex sodium (Bridion®, Schering-Plough Merck, USA) this should no longer be a barrier to using rocuronium. It has been recommended to the cardiac anaesthesiologist for clinical use for high risk patients at appropriate doses.21 Sugammadex is a cyclodextrin derivative which seems to provide a faster onset-offset profile than that seen with 1.0 mg/kg succinylcholine.20 This drug has even been used as an antidote to the muscle relaxant in case of a hypersensitivity reaction.19 It was approved for clinical use by the European Medicines Agency in 2008.22 It awaits FDA approval in the USA due to concerns about its hypersensitivity, but there is no concern about its efficacy.21\r\n\r\nNowadays, we have intubating laryngeal mask airway (iLMA), proseal airway and gum elastic bougie for securing the airway in case intubation is difficult. We would not like any patient to develop severe trismus and make the possibility of ventilating difficult or even impossible in an emergency situation.\r\n\r\nTherefore the time has now come to reconsider the recommendations and indeed to discontinue the use of Scoline® for rapid sequence intubation.",

      "abstract": "OMethoxyflurane, introduced as an anesthetic agent in the 1960s, quickly gained popularity due to its potent properties. However, its use as an anesthetic was discontinued due to significant side effects, particularly nephrotoxicity, manifested as acute renal failure with high diuresis. By the mid-1970s, methoxyflurane was withdrawn from the anesthetic market in North America and gradually worldwide. It was later discovered that low-dose methoxyflurane had powerful analgesic properties, allowing its use for short-term pain relief in traumatic injuries and during ambulatory procedures. Australian emergency services began using portable methoxyflurane inhalers for emergency care. Clinical trials confirmed the effectiveness of this agent, with no significant side effects such as renal or hepatic toxicity reported. The physicochemical properties of methoxyflurane, particularly its high lipid solubility and low vapor pressure, provide a slow onset of sedation, limiting its sedative effects when used short-term. Clinical studies have confirmed the safety and efficacy of methoxyflurane in conducting ambulatory procedures such as colonoscopy and burn wound dressing changes. Methoxyflurane reduces anxiety and pain, allowing patients to return to normal activities more quickly. Thus, methoxyflurane, used as a low-dose inhaled analgesic, can be an effective and safe pain relief option during ambulatory medical and surgical procedures, particularly in patients at high risk of complications from traditional sedation methods. Further research, including large randomized controlled trials, may provide additional evidence to support the potential benefits of methoxyflurane.",

La succinilcolina es el único curare despolarizante utilizado en clínica y se emplea principalmente para la intubación traqueal y los procedimientos que requieren una relajación muscular breve. Tiene muchos efectos secundarios, como mialgias, hiperpotasemia en algunos pacientes (paraplejía, grandes quemados), curarización prolongada en presencia de seudocolinestarasas atípicas y reacciones anafilácticas. Los curares no despolarizantes pertenecen a dos familias, los aminoesteroides (vecuronio, rocuronio) y las benzilisoquinolinas (atracurio, cisatracurio). El plazo de acción, la profundidad del bloqueo muscular y su duración dependen del tipo de curare no despolarizante y de la dosis administrada. Los aminoesteroides se eliminan por el riñón, el hígado y la bilis. Las benzilisoquinolinas se metabolizan en el plasma por la vía de Hofmann y por las esterasas. La farmacocinética y la farmacodinámica de los curares se modifican por factores fisiológicos (edad, embarazo) y patológicos (insuficiencia renal, insuficiencia hepática, obesidad). Muchos fármacos interfieren con la acción de los curares. Los más frecuentes son los anestésicos halogenados, los antibióticos y el magnesio. Los curares se utilizan para la intubación traqueal, la relajación muscular peroperatoria y en reanimación para facilitar la ventilación artificial en algunos casos difíciles. El rocuronio, que tiene un plazo de acción corto, puede reemplazar a la succinilcolina para la intubación traqueal de secuencia rápida. Los curares se administran en bolo o en perfusión continua. La frecuencia de la curarización residual postoperatoria justifica el uso sistemático de la monitorización de la curarización.",

      "title": "Effect of botulinum toxin on improving quality of life in patients with chronic migraine",
      "abstract": "Introduction and purpose: Migraine is a chronic condition affecting up to 10% of the adult population in Poland. Migraine pain is severe and may be accompanied by nausea or vomiting, as well as hypersensitivity to light, sounds or smells. Chronic form of migraine means the occurrence of headache a minimum of 15 days per month, for a period of at least three months, of which eight days or more of pain meet the criteria for migraine pain. The chronic form of migraine is targeted for treatment with botulinum toxin, a neurotoxin secreted by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum.&#x0D; Brief description of the state of knowledge: The pathogenesis of migraine is still unknown. There are many hypotheses explaining the origin of migraine pain, of which the most plausible seems to be the theory involving the trigeminal nerve system, as well as trigger points in the head and neck area. Their activation leads to the triggering of pain. Botulinum toxin has been used to treat migraine for several years. The only registered drug is Botox, the effectiveness of which has been confirmed in clinical studies. The preparation is administered by injection into the muscles of the head and neck region in cycles with an interval of 12 weeks. Botulinum toxin works by blocking the release of inflammatory and pain mediators from the trigeminal nerve endings.&#x0D; Summary: Chronic migraine refers to the occurrence of headache for more than half of the month, which significantly reduces the quality of life of people worldwide. Migraine headaches often refractory to pharmacological treatment may respond well to botulinum toxin type A. Therapy should be under the supervision of a neurologist, who will familiarise the patient with the expected effects of botulinum toxin treatment before starting treatment.",

The discussion covers systemic and local antimicrobials, controlled-release drug delivery, antivirals/antifungal agent prescription, prescribing for acute dental pain, the prevention and management of opioid prescription drug misuse, and the use of oral sedation and glucocorticosteroids in dentistry. Clavulanate has a beta-lactam ring like penicillin, which strongly and irreversibly binds to the penicillinase, blocking the actions of penicillinase from breaking down the amoxicillin molecule and restoring the antimicrobial activity to amoxicillin. Antifungal agents must be taken for about two days after oral lesions disappear to avoid recurrence of lesions. Since there is no ceiling effect for opioids, dosage requirements vary widely among patients and opioids must be titrated to an acceptable level of analgesia or until side effects occur.",

Flurazepam is more effective than placebo and is as effective as other hypnotic drugs in most short-term controlled studies. In long-term dosage studies, flurazepam's efficacy persists while other hypnotics become ineffective. Flurazepam has relatively minor effects upon rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and does not lead to REM rebound; this may reduce the likelihood of drug dependence. Flurazepam does not cause enzyme induction and probably presents little hazard of abuse or overdosage. The rational use of hypnotic agents depends as much upon the underlying cause of the sleep disorder as upon the choice of a particular drug.

      "title": "Carcinogenic Risk of Toluene Diisocyanate and 4,4′-Methylenediphenyl Diisocyanate: Epidemiological and Experimental Evidence",
      "abstract": "Diisocyanates are highly reactive compounds widely used, for example, in the production of polyure-thane foams, elastomers, paints, and adhesives. The high chemical reactivity of these compounds is also reflected in their toxicity: diisocyanates are one of the most important causes of occupational asthma but also other adverse effects, such as irritation and toxic reactions, have been described in exposed subjects. One of the open questions is whether occupational isocyanate exposure is a carcinogenic hazard. The few epidemiological studies available have been based on young cohorts and short follow-up and are not conclusive. Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) has been classified as carcinogenic in animals on the basis of gavage administration studies, but no conclusions are available on inhalation exposure. For 4,4′-methylene diphenyldiisocyanate (MDI) there is suggestive evidence for carcinoge-nicity in rats. The possible carcinogenic mechanism of TDI and MDI is not clear. Both chemicals have been positive in a number of short-term tests inducing gene mutations and chromosomal damage. The reactive form could be either the diisocyanate itself or may derive from the metabolic activation of the aromatic diamine derivatives formed by hydrolysis. TDI and MDI react with DNA in vivo and in vitro. However, the structure of the adducts has not been identified. Especially from the in vivo experiment it is not known if the adducts are a product from the reaction with the isocyanate or the corresponding amine. In conclusion, both TDI and MDI are highly reactive chemicals that bind to DNA and are probably genotoxic. The alleged animal carcinogenicity of TDI and MDI would suggest that occupational exposure to these compounds is a carcinogenic risk. The few epidemiological studies available have not, however, been able to clarify if TDI and MDI are occupational carcinogens.",

      "title": "Serious drug interactions.",
      "abstract": "Of the many varieties of drug interactions, which occur when the disposition or actions of one drug are changed by another, only a few are serious or potentially fatal. A representative outline of some of these illustrates the problem. Precipitant drugs are those which produce the interaction, and object drugs are those whose effects are changed. The interactions which are usually significant are those which alter the metabolism, involve renal excretion, or change the effects of the object drug, especially when the object drug has a low therapeutic index (cardiovascular drugs, anticoagulants, drugs acting on the brain, hypoglycemic drugs, hormones, and cytotoxic drugs). Warfarin toxicity, for example, is produced by aspirin, phenylbutazone, and azapropazone. The dosage requirements of warfarin are reduced by chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin and other quinolones, erythromycin and some of the other macrolides, metronidazole and other imidazoles, tetracyclines, amiodarone, cimetidine (but not ranitidine), and fibrates. Potassium-depleting drugs can potentiate the action of digoxin, and the elimination of digoxin can be reduced by amiodarone, propafenone, quinidine, and verapamil. Combined oral contraceptives can lose effectiveness through the interaction of carbamazepine, griseofulvin, phenytoin, or rifampicin, which increase estrogen metabolism. In addition, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin or tetracyclines also reduce contraceptive effectiveness by altering gut absorption. Even a single drink of an alcoholic beverage may be dangerous to people taking antidepressants, antihistamines, antipsychotic drugs, benzodiazepines, or lithium. Antihistamines suffer inhibited metabolism in the liver if taken in conjunction with the antifungal imidazoles and some of the macrolide antibiotics. Cardiotoxicity of antihistamines is also enhanced by drugs with similar cardiotoxic effects. Lithium potentiation is enhanced by the new serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, and lithium excretion can be reduced by diuretics or fluoxetine. When drugs such as antifungal imidazoles, azapropazone, or phenylbutazone are permitted to inhibit the metabolism of sulphonylureas, hypoglycemic effects are enhanced and, if unnoticed, may cause brain damage. Fibrates should not be combined with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors because of the increased risk of myopathy. Patients taking non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors should avoid amine-containing foods and drugs such as matured cheeses, meat, yeast extracts, some wines, unfresh protein, and cold-curing medications. The metabolism of azathioprine is inhibited by allopurinol, and this combination requires a reduced dosage of azathioprine. Mercaptopurine, used in the treatment of leukemia, is also a metabolite of azathioprine. Sources of comprehensive information on drug interactions are 1) the \"British National Formulary,\" appendix 1; 2) Chapter 10 of \"The Oxford Textbook of Clinical Pharmacology and Drug Therapy\"; and 3) a monograph by Stockley entitled \"Drug Interactions.\"",

The two major classes of analgesics in clinical use are narcotic or opioid analgesics and non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs act by inhibiting the enzyme cycloxygenase and are further sub-classified on the basis of their selectivity for the target enzyme. Analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents in current use have many toxic effects that limit their therapeutic usefulness (Krenzischek et al, 2003). NSAIDs are notorious for causing gastric ulceration and renal failure (Rodrigiez et al., 2007). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibitory agents have, unfortunately, been recently shown to have serious cardiovascular toxicity (Stacy et al, 2012). The acute adverse effects caused by opiod analgesics include constipation, drowsiness, confusion, nausea and itching. Tolerance and dependence occur after chronic use (Zollner and Stein, 2007). Forty percent of the patients suffering from chronic pain are dissatisfied with the drugs used to manage their pain (Eriksen et al, 2003).

      "abstract": "Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy can have serious adverse effects on the quality of a woman's life, affecting her occupational, social, and domestic functioning, and her general well-being; therefore, it is very important to treat this condition appropriately and effectively. Evidence-based algorithms support the use of oral pyridoxine alone or combined with doxylamine as first-line treatment. Promethazine or dimenhydrinate, known as a second-line treatment, should be added to the first-line treatment or should be added only to pyridoxine according to different algorithms. In most of the world, there is a lack of approved medicines using this combination approach known as the first-line treatment. Therefore, compounding pharmacists should supply the demand by compounding 10-mg pyridoxine hydrochloride and 10-mg doxylamine succinate slow-release capsules. Since transdermal promethazine does not exist world wide, and, since this medicine has significant added values compared to the oral/rectal dosage forms, compounding pharmacists should offer physicians transdermal promethazine as a second-line therapy in nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. This review summarizes the nausea and vomiting in pregnancy problems and discusses the compounding opportunities that exist in this common and wide-spread pathology in order to improve a woman's quality of life.",

      "abstract": "(1) When single-agent therapy provides inadequate glycaemic control for patients with type 2 diabetes, most guidelines recommend metformin in combination with a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea as standard treatment, despite the lack of any proven impact on morbidity or mortality. Other options include switching to insulin or abandoning the target of strict glycaemic control. (2) Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are approved for use in combination with a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea when metformin is poorly tolerated or contraindicated, and in combination with metformin in overweight patients. (3) A fixed-dose combination containing 1 or 2 mg of rosiglitazone plus 500 mg of metformin (hydrochloride) was launched onto the French market in October 2004. (4) The indication for rosiglitazone was extended to include its use as triple-agent therapy in combination with metformin and a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea. (5) No clinical trials assessing effects on mortality or morbidity have evaluated rosiglitazone or pioglitazone in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs. (6) Several trials have compared the glucose-lowering effects of dual-agent therapy using rosiglitazone or pioglitazone plus a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea or metformin versus dual-agent therapy with metformin and a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea. (7) These clinical trials indicate that in terms of HbA1c level, dual-agent therapy based on rosiglitazone or pioglitazone is about as effective as combination therapy with metformin plus a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea. (8) The main known adverse effect of pioglitazone and rosiglitazone is water-sodium retention, which can provoke oedema and haemodilution anaemia, and can aggravate or reveal heart failure. (9) Pioglitazone has a positive effect on the lipid profile, whereas rosiglitazone increases the LDL-cholesterol level. (10) Dual-agent therapy with pioglitazone and a sulphonylurea causes more weight gain than metformin plus a sulphonylurea. (11) Several trials have assessed triple-agent regimens containing a glitazone. Three placebo-controlled double-blind trials have tested pioglitazone (one trial, nearly 300 patients) or rosiglitazone (two trials, about 1200 patients) for 12 to 26 weeks in patients whose glycaemia was poorly controlled by dual-agent therapy with a sulphonylurea plus metformin. The glycated haemoglobin level fell by 0.3% to 1.1% (in absolute values), depending on the trial and the dosage, but at a cost of the usual adverse effects such as weight gain, anaemia and oedema. Three unblinded trials have compared oral triple-agent regimens containing glitazone versus insulin plus metformin, alone or in combination with a glucose-lowering sulphonylurea; the treatment including glitazone was no more effective in terms of the glycated haemoglobin level, but was associated with an increase in adverse effects and dropouts. (12) Given the limited clinical data available in early 2005, pioglitazone and rosiglitazone have no place in the management of type 2 diabetes.",

Midazolam, a fast-acting benzodiazepine, is now authorised for use in this setting, in the form of a solution for oral transmucosal route. The results of five trials conducted in specialised centres suggest that midazolam oromucosal solution is at least as effective as rectal diazepam in reducing the duration of seizures and preventing early seizure recurrence. However, the evidence provided by these studies is weak. The main adverse effects of midazolam oromucosal solution are the same as those of rectal diazepam; in particular, respiratory depression occurs in 1% to 5% of patients and can necessitate intubation. Some anticonvulsants, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital, may reduce the effectiveness of midazolam and diazepam. At the recommended doses, midazolam overdose may occur when the oromucosal solution is used to treat infants less than 6 months old. Midazolam oromucosal solution is sold in single-dose ready-to-use oral syringes. In France, diazepam doses for rectal administration must be prepared from a vial of solution. In early 2013, the usability of oral transmucosal versus rectal administration has not been compared prospectively in children with convulsive seizures. In practice, rectal diazepam is the drug of choice for paediatric convulsive seizures occurring outside the hospital setting. Midazolam oromucosal solution is an alternative for children over 6 months of age, especially when preparation or administration of the rectal diazepam dose poses a problem.",

Most common drugs causing them include antimicrobials. Fluroquinolones especially norfloxacin is commonly used in the treatment of gastrointestinal infections. Cutaneous adverse drug reactions are very rare with norfloxacin. Case Report: In this case report, a young female, soon after taking Nofloxacin tablet, developed a blister with erythema and itching after self treatment for urinary tract infection. It got cured after stopping the drug and taking treatment from a dermatologist. It resolved as a hyper-pigmented scar. She experienced a similar episode of drug eruption on the same site when she again self medicated herself with Norfloxacin for diarrhoea. This time the reaction occurred within few hours and resolved with hyperpigmentation after medication. She was advised not to indulge in self-treatment in future. Suspecting association between the drug and the rash was confirmed and a diagnosis of Norfloxacin induced fixed drug eruption was made. Conclusion: Causality assessment by Naranjo’s algorithm revealed a definite relationship between the cutaneous adverse drug reaction and the offending drug.",

The paper provides a brief analysis of Clozapine drugs Usage, Formulation and Evaluation. The drugs were used upon animals at first to test the effects. There are several side effects of Clozapine that includes High fever and also symptoms like flu, Weakness and dizziness, allergy in skin and red spots, Sometimes itching problems in vaginal, in serious problems it can also create breathing problems and worsening cough. This is known as the Second Generation Antipsychotic that helps in balancing the dopamine and serotonin that improves the cognitive functions like mood, thinking and behaviour of an individual. Clozapine is restricted to use however it is used under one particular condition i.e. when the person suffering from Schizophrenia does not respond to other medications, have suicidal incidents or have positive symptoms. Furthermore, considerable clinical study has proven that clozapine seems to be more efficacious than just about any other antipsychotic drug throughout therapeutic interventions and therefore it clearly outperforms some other antipsychotics with in treatment of recurrent schizoaffective disorder.

      "title": "Neurotoxic or Protective Cannabis Components: Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (<sup>Δ9</sup>THC) and Cannabidol (CBD)",
      "abstract": "Cannabis sativa contains phytocannabinoids that are psychoactive and neurotoxic (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol: Δ9THC) or nonpsychoactive and presumptively neuroprotective (cannabidiol: CBD). Along with rising legalization, availability, and demand, the Δ9THC:CBD ratio also has increased. Cannabis legalization means that use will likely increase in pregnant or breastfeeding women, affecting all stages of brain and neurodevelopment of their offspring. Δ9THC exposure in utero or during development leads to lasting detrimental effects on behavior, cognition, locomotor activity, as well as epigenetic changes. Caution is urged with cannabis use. CBD is one of the most actively studied therapies for a broad spectrum of neurological, inflammatory, and mental diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia) because of its efficacy, low toxicity, and availability. While data indicate that the benefits of CBD may outweigh its risks, there are indications that it poses a risk for adverse effects on neurodevelopment from in-utero exposure as well as detrimental effects on male reproduction. Therefore, there is a clear need to continue researching the effects of Δ9THC exposure as well as the optimal CBD treatment related to disease management while stressing the need to further characterize possible adverse effects.",

Sharing a common mechanism of action at the 5-HT2a receptor, drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin, while they can rarely induce significant short-term psychopathology, are remarkably safe physiologically, do not cause dependence, and are now being actively researched again for their therapeutic potential in non-psychotic conditions such as anxiety, addictions, and depression. Ketamine is also being explored as a treatment for resistant depression and is in common use as an anaesthetic. However, it has increasingly become recognized as a drug with abuse potential. Although safe in overdose, ketamine carries acute risks related to vulnerability while intoxicated, and chronic use is associated with urinary tract toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Xylazine, commonly called “tranq” or “sleep cut”, is a strong α2-adrenergic agonist used in veterinary practice as a sedative, analgesic, and muscle-relaxing agent. It has never been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for human use, but its use by people is on the rise. In the last decades, due to its low cost and ease of availability, it has often been illicitly used due to its abuse potential as a drug for attempted sexual assault and intended poisoning. In addition, xylazine’s presence in the human body has also been related to domestic accidental events. Generally, it is combined with multiple other drugs, typically by intravenous injection, potentiating the doping effects. Xylazine’s mechanism of action is different from that of other illicit opioids, such as heroin and fentanyl, and it has no known antidote approved for use in humans. The combination with fentanyl prolongs the euphoric sensation and may heighten the risk of fatal overdose. Furthermore, it may cause adverse effects, including central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, and even death. Recent reports of xylazine misuse have risen alarmingly and describe people who become “zombies” because of the drug’s harmful effects on the human body, including serious wound formation that could even lead to limb amputation. This paper is an extensive review of the existing literature about xylazine and specifically deals with the chemistry, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological aspects of this compound, highlighting the most recent studies.",

      "title": "Chronic Misuse of Paracetamol in OCD Without Hepatic Injury: A Case Report and Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Aims Paracetamol is a commonly used antipyretic and analgesic over the counter medication. In acute or chronic overuse it is associated with dose-dependent hepatic injury. There is a narrow therapeutic margin and that consistent use of as little as 7.5 g/day may be hazardous. Unintentional overdose with paracetamol is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United Kingdom Here we present an unusual case of a 60-year-old lady with a reported chronic history of self-medicating with an above daily recommended dose of paracetamol without evidence of hepatic injury. Methods A 60-year-old Caucasian lady known to psychiatric services for 20 years with Recurrent Depressive disorder, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), Dependent Personality Disorder with Borderline personality traits. She reported consuming 32 tablets of paracetamol (16gm per day) every day for the past 11 years. She experienced obsessions of fear that if she did not take a particular number of paracetamols in a day then her friends will come to harm and her anxiety was relieved by the compulsion of consuming supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol. There was no evidence of misuse of any other medications other than paracetamol. Her blood investigations revealed liver function tests within normal limits and ultrasound of the liver was unremarkable. Results A literature search of “paracetamol or acetaminophen” and “no liver or hepatic” and “damage or injury” found only one case report. The case reported that studies of paracetamol metabolism were performed in a 58-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis who had consumed 15–20 g paracetamol daily for 5 years without developing liver damage and data were compared with results in seven normal volunteers. The report concluded that a combination of slow paracetamol absorption, enhanced detoxication of paracetamol (by sulphation) and reduced metabolism to potentially cytotoxic metabolites may have reduced the risk of liver damage in this patient. Conclusion In OCD, misusing medications can be an uncommon presentation of compulsive acts to relieve anxiety. The diagnostic dilemma of factitious illness is probable, however supratherapeutic use of paracetamol without physical harm is rare but possible.",

In three of the four patients this practice has led to erythematous lesions, while the remaining patient showed gingival recession and bone sequestration. These lesions can probably be attributed to the vasoconstrictor activity of cocaine, and to its caustic effects on the mucosa.",

Levodopa has remained the \"gold standard\" of the therapy even several decades after its introduction. Chronic levodopa treatment is associated with the development of motor complications in most patients. Advanced Parkinson's disease is characterized by these complications: motor and non-motor fluctuation and disturbing dyskinesia. Continuous dopaminergic stimulation might reduce these complications. In advanced Parkinson's disease levodopa is still effective. In the treatment of this stage there are several advanced or device-aided therapies: apomorphine pump, deep brain stimulation and levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel. Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel is an aqueous gel that can be delivered to the jejunum via a percutaneous gastrojejunostomy tube which is connected to an infusion pump dosing the levodopa gel continuously to the place of absorption. Levodopa/carbidopa gel infusion can be used as monotherapy, can be tested, can be used individually and this therapy is reversible. Several clinical trials demonstrated that levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel therapy is of long-term benefit, improves the quality of life of the patients and can reduce motor fluctuation and dyskinesia.",

      "abstract": "IpecacuanhaSir I was interested in your comment on the use of Ipecacuanha in children as an altemative to gastric lavage.It has been my practice over many years to choose this method and I have found it very effective in inducing vomitting in the majority of small children.How effective it is in returning significant amounts of ingested drugs is much more in doubt, especially as it is rare to know precisely how much of the substance was initially swallowed in young children.Tablet debris is returned, particularly where the drug is associated with delay in gastric emptying.However, I would question its value if a drug ingested is known to alter gastro-intestinal mobility, e.g.Metoclopramide Hydrochloride.I would also emphasise the necessity of exercising caution in its use where the drug, by virtue of its pharmaceutical properties, causes drowsiness.In particular, I believe its use in the presence of the ingestion of Tricyclic antidepressants is contra-indicated.I believe that our recent experience of such a case is worthy of record.A 2-year-old male child was brought to the Accident and Emergency Department within an hour of having ingested twelve 75 mg tablets of the Tricyclic anti-depressant Dothiepin Hydrochloride prescribed for his grandmother.Initial clinical examination was normal apart from some dilatation of the pupils.Ipecacuanha was given and failed to produce emesis within the 20-minute period.The failure to respond to the initial dose prompted the decision to carry out a gastric lavage.Before this was effected the child had an epileptiform convulsion, during which aspiration of the Ipecacuanha and orange juice occurred.Simultaneously, a series of bizarre cardiac arrhymias developed, rapidly followed by cardiac arrest.Cardiac massage was initiated and maintained manually for a prolonged period throughout which severe hypotension persisted, and even after the restoration of an effective heartbeat in sinus rythmn, hypotension proved difficult to control.Respiration was maintained on a ventilator for some 24 hours after which the child recovered, but with serious neurological deficits.Tricyclic anti-depressants in children present a particular problem in that there is a theoretical risk that the passage of the gastric tube may, in itself, induce cardiac arrhythmia.However, gastric aspiration followed by methods to reduce further absorption may have some value.In my experience tricyclic ingestion in children is one of the most urgent toxicological emergencies demanding the most experienced and urgent management, and the child should be managed from the outset by a team experienced in resuscitation and intensive care techniques with the appropriate facilities.A gastric tube is the logical first step in drug overdose where the product ingested requires a delivery system to the gastro-intestinal tract as part of the initial or continuing treatment, e.g.iron and paraquat ingestion, and those ingestions where there may be a value in administering activated charcoal.",

Another antimalarial that is likely to be used in increasing amounts in Africa is pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine. With prolonged use of this combination for prophylaxis, the adverse reactions usually associated with the long-acting sulfonamides are possible.Genetic abnormalities may also play a part in the incidence and severity of adverse reactions to certain drugs, e.g., primaquine and quinine. Most of the common adverse reactions are mild and have little or no influence on the acceptability and utilization of the drugs, with the exception of chloroquine-induced pruritus.

      "abstract": "With great interest we read the article by Antonio et al.[1] reporting on the serological response to syphilis treatment with penicillin benzathine or doxycycline in patients with HIV following a manufacturing shortfall of penicillin benzathine. No differences in serological response were observed between the two treatment strategies. Long-acting penicillin formulations, however, remain first-line treatment for syphilis [2]. Dependent on the stage of the infection, treatment is recommended by a single injection of 2.4 million units benzylpenicillin benzathine [early infection (acquired within the last 12 months)] or by three successive weekly injections of 2.4 million units (late infection). Administration of benzylpenicillin benzathine is recommended to be split over two doses of 1.2 million units, each in one buttock [3]. Discomfort of these injections can be reduced by replacing part of the solvent by a lidocaine (lignocaine) solution [3]. In addition to manufacturing shortfalls, treatment with benzylpenicillin benzathine may be complicated by drug–drug interactions between lidocaine and components of HIV treatment regimens, especially with inhibitors of lidocaine metabolism. Lidocaine is metabolized in the liver by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) to its metabolite monoethylglyxinexylidide (MEGX) [4]. To enhance exposure to antiretroviral drugs, such as atazanavir, darunavir and elvitegravir, ritonavir and cobicistat are used as boosters in combined antiretroviral therapy. Ritonavir and cobicistat inhibit CYP3A4, resulting in an increased exposure (increased area under the curve), increased maximum concentration (Cmax) and increased half-life (t1/2) of antiretroviral drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4 [5]. Drug–drug interactions between ritonavir or cobicistat and lidocaine have been suggested to increase lidocaine exposure by more than three-fold [6], complicating treatment with benzylpenicillin benzathine as this interaction may lead to higher plasma lidocaine levels and adverse effects, including neurological and cardiac side effects. Neurological side effects may consist of respiratory depression, convulsion and coma. Cardiac effects may include elevated blood pressure, increased heart rate (HR) and cardiac output with mild intoxications and, with severe intoxications, reduced HR, conduction velocity and contraction of the heart with dilated vessels [7]. The clinical relevance of the interaction between ritonavir and cobicistat and lidocaine during the treatment of syphilis in HIV patients has not been reported thus far. To determine the relevance of this interaction, lidocaine peak serum levels were determined in three male HIV-positive patients suspect for syphilis infection (refer to Table 1 for details on the patients). Patients were treated with two injections of 1.2 million units benzylpenicillin benzathine dissolved in 2 ml of water for injection and 2 ml of lidocaine 20 mg/ml, according to local guidelines. In total 80 mg of lidocaine was administered by intramuscular injection. Peak concentrations for lidocaine are expected about 30–60 min after intramuscular administration [8]. Lidocaine serum levels were determined with a validated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method. Lidocaine peak serum levels were found to range from 0.2 to 0.6 mg/l (Table 1). Therapeutic lidocaine levels for the treatment of arrhythmia are in the range 1.5–6 mg/l [8–10]. Our observations show that the interaction between lidocaine and ritonavir or cobicistat is not of clinical relevance for this specific patient group and lidocaine may be used safely in the treatment of syphilis with benzylpenicillin benzathine. However, if higher doses of lidocaine are administrated, this interaction may become relevant, especially as pharmacokinetic modelling indicates that inhibition of CYP3A4 may result in an increased half-life. In these cases, use of lidocaine should be avoided or lidocaine drug concentrations should be monitored, especially in old patients or patients treated with drugs known to affect hepatic blood flow or metabolism [10].Table 1: Patient characteristics (concomitant), medication and lidocaine serum concentrations.Acknowledgements The study was not financially supported by external funding sources.

      "abstract": "Clozapine is licensed in the UK for use in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, treatment-intolerant schizophrenia, or psychosis associated with Parkinson’s disease. As with many drugs, it is also used outside of these licensing parameters for other conditions or clinical situations—often referred to as ‘off-label’ prescribing. These off-label indications have varying degrees of theoretical support, peer-reviewed evidence, and practical experience associated with them. This chapter discusses the use of clozapine for children and adolescents, older adults, and in the treatment of aggression and mood disorders. The use of supramaximal doses of clozapine to achieve therapeutic plasma concentrations is also off-label, although adding interacting medication to reach the same result is not; these contrasting approaches are also debated. Finally, rechallenging with clozapine in patients who have previously had serious adverse events to the drug is also considered.",

Bicalutamide 50 mg plus LHRHa is at least as effective as flutamide plus LHRHa in terms of survival and time to progression. Monotherapy with bicalutamide 150 mg once daily has similar survival rates compared with castration in advanced non-metastatic disease. Current clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of bicalutamide as monotherapy in the setting of adjuvant therapy in early stage disease. Sexual interest appears to be better preserved with bicalutamide than with castration. Breast pain and gynecomastia are the most common side effects. Bicalutamide is not associated with interstitial pneumonitis and difficulty with light/dark adaptation seen with nilutamide, and in 50 mg/day dosage causes a lower incidence of diarrhea than flutamide 750 mg/day. Changes in hepatic function are usually transient and resolve or improve during therapy or after bicalutamide treatment is withdrawn.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dysmenorrhea and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) are the main disorders related to the menstrual cycle. The prevailing symptoms of dysmenorrhea are painful cyclic cramps in the lower abdomen, while PMS is accompanied by a wide and varied set of symptoms that includes both physical and psychological aspects. These disorders are characterized by oxidative stress, increased production of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α), and intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in myometrium. Currently, the main pharmacological therapies involve the use of NSAIDs and combined hormonal contraceptives, even if both approaches may have some limitations. Recent scientific evidence supports the use of food supplements for symptom prevention and management, also in association with conventional therapies. The study aimed to investigate the in-vitro effect of a novel combination of active substances (mix), composing the food supplement Miledix® (Kolinpharma S.p.A., Lainate, Milan, Italy) on: 1) antioxidant activity; 2) variation of PGF2α levels; and 3) variation of [Ca2+]i induced by PGF2α.METHODS: We used a primary human cell line of uterine smooth muscle. Cell viability was assessed by MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] test. Oxidative stress was investigated with glutathione assay and dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate assay. PGF2α levels were assessed by ELISA while [Ca2+]i by fluorometric test.RESULTS: Results show that the mix determines an increase in the Reduced Glutathione/Oxidized Glutathione Ratio, while it decreases reactive oxygen species levels, the expression of PGF2α, and [Ca2+]i induced by prostaglandin.CONCLUSIONS: Under these experimental conditions, the mix was able to act on the molecular mechanisms underlying the onset of cycle disorders, such as oxidative stress, the production of PGF2α, and the accumulation of [Ca2+]i.",

Effective treatment of ED should restore quality of life and allow patients to return to the sex life they had before. Current therapeutic options include non-pharmacological treatments, locally administered drugs and oral therapies. The oral phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors are considered first-line treatments of ED and have revolutionized ED management in the last five years. Three PDE5 inhibitors are currently available, sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil. They are all effective with similar efficacy and good safety profiles. However, tadalafil has the added benefit of a broad window opportunity offering patients more freedom to choose when to initiate sexual activity.",

This paper intends to highlight the issue of pregabalin misuse, a concern that will be unfamiliar to most clinicians in New Zealand.A review of the literature of papers documenting the misuse of gabapentin and pregabalin was conducted with a specific focus on pregabalin.There is a growing body of evidence regarding the potential of misuse of pregabalin. It produces a range of sensations, including euphoria, sedation and dissociation. It is commonly used in conjunction with other drugs, most notably sedatives and opioids, which leads to an additive effect. Although generally safe when taken alone, pregabalin is a growing feature of drug-related deaths.Prescribers need to be alert to the potential of pregabalin misuse. This should be achieved through prescribing with great care (not prescribing to new or unknown patients; not in response to direct patient requests for it by name; supplying in limited quantities), regular review of patients and stopping treatment, by slow withdrawal, when lack of efficacy is seen.",

In upperabdominal surgery adequate analgesia, stable haemodynamic, early bowel movement, free from nauseaand vomiting is wanted, as a part of multimodal analgesic approach, premedication by clonidine is veryimportant for it analgesic, angiolytic and sedative properties. Alpha two (α–2) adrenoreceptor agonist,Clonidine exerts central sympatholytic effect for 8 to 10 hours as its half life is 9-12 h. So thatpremedication with oral clonidine causes reduction of anxiety, reduction of perioperative analgesicdrugs and also reduction of anaesthetic doses. In addition, clonidine increases cardiac baroreceptorreflex sensitivity to increase in systolic blood pressure, and thus stabilizes blood pressure. Clonidine israpidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration with a time to maximum plasmaconcentration of between 1.5 and 2 hr and elimination half-life of 8 to 12 hr. But clonidine producesanalgesia in a dose dependent manner, achieving complete pain relief for up to 5 hours without sensoryor motor block at large doses (oral 7000 to 900 mcg) however large doss were associated withdisadvantage including hypotension, bradycardia and transient sedation.

      "abstract": "Justification of early treatment of nocturnal enuresis is founded in the negative psychological impact on the child. In fact nocturnal enuresis delays early autonomy and socialisation by decreasing in self-esteem and self-confidence. Nocturnal enuresis classification is the preliminary step to correct therapy. Enuresis must be classified as primary (never acquired nocturnal control) or secondary (at least 6 months of dry nights). A child is also classified as having monosymptomatic enuresis if she/he experienced only night wetting and symptomatic enuresis if she/he experienced night wetting associated with diurnal voiding symptoms (urinated > or = 7 times a day, urgency, damp pants, squatting, holding the perineum, sitting on one heel). Monosymptomatic patients must be treated with desmopressin nasal spray at the daily dose of 20 micrograms at bed time. If the reduction of at least the 50% of the basal number of the wet nights is not achieved, the dosage must be increased until 40 micrograms. For patients affected by rhinitis or asthma, desmopressin is now available in tablets. In symptomatic patients desmopressin therapy must be associated to oxybutinin (5 mg x 2). Therapy interruption must be gradual with desmopressin reduction of 10 micrograms every 30 days. In symptomatic patients oxybutinin must be introduced only at bed time. The efficacy of the drugs depends on the therapy length. The highest percentage of success is obtained if the treatment is protracted for at least six months. Antidepressants are also used for nocturnal enuresis especially imipramine. The dosage varies between 0.5-1.5 mg/ kg/daily. As plasmatic levels are achieved only in 30% of treated patients, a 3-5 fold increase in suggested. Nevertheless these levels result in near toxic threshold concentration. Sporadic treatment purposes include amytriptiline, diclofenac sodicum, viloxsazine and methilphenidate if giggle incontinence is present. Non responders may be treated with alarm. If after 16 weeks of treatment no success is obtained alarm use must be interrupted.",

The FDA discourages the use of local anesthetic gels, notably lidocaine, for teething pain in pediatrics due to concerns regarding potential adverse effects if inadvertently swallowed excessively. Therefore, significant attention is being directed towards modifying available marketed products to make them suitable for pediatric use. Here, we introduce mucoadhesive patches that not only have an adjusted dose of lidocaine but also feature a controlled release profile to manage teething pain with prolonged effect. This design helps to prevent issues related to gel liquefaction and swallowing, thereby reducing the potential hazardous side effects of lidocaine in the pediatric population.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Anaemia due to chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common and may be managed with erythropoiesis stimulating agents and/or iron preparations. Iron preparations may be administered orally, intravenously or by intramuscular injection. Oral preparations pose a significant tablet burden on patients who are often taking multiple medications and may have undesirable gastrointestinal side effects. The existing intravenous preparation Venofer ® requires multiple doses of drug (typically 100–200 mg) at multiple clinic visits. The preparation Cosmofer ® may be given as a single dose, but this requires four to six hours to administer. For these reasons, their use in pre‐dialysis patients remains limited in practice. The new intravenous iron preparation Ferric Carboxymaltose (Ferinject ® ) may be given as a single dose of up to 1000 mg (but not exceeding 15 mg/kg/week) as an infusion over 6–15 minutes. This offers a significant advance in the management of these patients. We describe our initial experience with using this drug in a non‐dialysis patient population with chronic kidney disease.",

We irradiated a number of antimalarial drugs (amodiaquine, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, mefloquine, primaquine and quinacrine) with light (lambda > 300 nm) and conducted electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and laser flash photolysis studies to determine the possible active intermediates produced. Each antimalarial drug produced at least one EPR adduct with the spin-trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide in benzene: superoxide/hydroperoxyl adducts (chloroquine, mefloquine, quinacrine, amodiaquine and quinine), carbon-centered radical adducts (all but primaquine), or a nitrogen-centered radical adduct only (primaquine). In ethanol all drugs except primaquine produced some superoxide/hydroperoxyl adduct, with quinine, quinacrine, and hydroxychloroquine also producing the ethoxyl adduct. As detected with flash photolysis and steady-state techniques, mefloquine, quinine, amodiquine and a photoproduct of quinacrine produced singlet oxygen ([symbol: see text]delta = 0.38; [symbol: see text]delta = 0.36; [symbol: see text]delta = 0.011; [symbol: see text]delta = 0.013 in D2O, pD7), but only primaquine quenched singlet oxygen efficiently (2.6 x 10(8) M-1 s-1 in D2O, pD7). Because malaria is a disease most prevalent in regions of high light intensity, protective measures (clothing, sunblock, sunglasses or eye wraps) should be recommended when administering antimalarial drugs.",

      "abstract": "Cigarette dependence is recognised as a life-threatening disorder which can be treated by behavioural support and/or medication. Bupropion hydrochloride sustained-release (Zyban trade mark, GlaxoSmithKline) is licensed in many countries including the US, Canada, UK, Australia and continental Europe to aid smoking cessation. The usual recommended dose is 150 mg b.i.d. taken for 7 - 14 days prior to the quit date, and then 6 - 8 weeks afterwards (figures vary across countries). Evidence from seven double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trials shows that it improves success at staying off cigarettes for at least 12 months by 9 - 10 percentage points. Taking into account estimates of subsequent cessation and relapse patterns in treated and untreated smokers, and the improvement in life-expectancy of smokers who manage to stop, the estimated cost/life/year saved from an episode of use of the medication is approximately UK pound 1000 or US$1500. Bupropion has CNS stimulant properties; the common side effects are dry mouth and sleep disturbance. Rare but serious side effects are anaphylactic/hypersensitivity reaction and seizure (both estimated at 1 in a 1000). The drug is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the drug or its metabolites, any seizure disorder, eating disorder, severe hepatic cirrhosis, history of bipolar disorder or in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Extreme caution is advised where there are any predisposing factors that may reduce the seizure threshold. Bupropion sustained-release and nicotine replacement therapies are both considered as first-line treatments to aid smoking cessation. Ideally patients should also enrol in a structured behavioural support programme to boost their chances of success.",

A 100:1 dose ratio of pentazocine-naloxone was shown to be optimal and equivalent in oral analgesic effects to pentazocine alone. The same combination, administered parenterally, showed little or no analgesia indicating a suppression of pentazocine activity. Pentazocine-naloxone combination appears, therefore, as a feasible means to retain full analgesic activity of pentazocine when administered orally while any attempt to extract pentazocine from this formulation for intravenous administration would result in little or no pharmacological effect and, therefore, eliminate the potential parenteral abuse of tablets.",

Here, we summarize our seven last studies which concerned green clay, glucosamine, sildenafil, a homeopathic drug, as well as diclofenac, meloxicam and etoricoxib, three anti–inflammatory drugs. Green clay appeared to be an excellent product without adverse effects. In humans, it allows reducing gastric hyperacidity and should thus be used instead of aluminum hydroxide or calcium + magnesium carbonates which present adverse effects. Glucosamine was also safe. It only increased the ants’ locomotion and this effect might explain, at least partly, its efficiency. Sildenafil has many adverse effects, the cause of which being probably a decrease of sensitive perception. Such an impact may result from the activity of sildenafil: it inhibits phosphodiesterases and increases amounts of cGMP and cAMP. The homeopathic drug Ignatia amara, used for decreasing stress symptoms, had no adverse effects and unexpectedly reduced the ants’ state of stress. Even if its functioning stays unknown, this drug could help stressed persons. Diclofenac had several adverse effects and may lead to dependence; meloxicam had far less adverse effects and did not lead to dependence; etoricoxib had some adverse effects and did not lead to dependence. Obviously, meloxicam was the safest of the three anti–inflammatory drugs. Experimentation on ants can thus inform practitioners and pharmacists on potential harmful effects of products before providing them to humans.",

      "abstract": "Most antidepressants lead to adverse discontinuation symptoms when they are abruptly stopped or rapidly tapered. Antidepressants with a short half-life, such as paroxetine and venlafaxine, can cause significantly more severe discontinuation symptoms compared with antidepressants with a longer half-life. One culprit in particular Among serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), venlafaxine is notorious for severe discontinuation symptoms. Venlafaxine has a half-life of 3 to 7 hours, and its active metabolite, desvenlafaxine, possesses a half-life of 9 to 13 hours. Higher frequency of discontinuation symptoms is associated with the use of higher dosages of venlafaxine and longer duration of treatment. Venlafaxine is available in immediate release (IR) and extended release (XR) formulations. Venlafaxine XR has a slower release, extending the time to peak plasma concentration and, therefore, has once daily dosing and fewer side effects; however, it offers no substantial advantage over IR formulation in terms of diminished withdrawal effects. Desvenlafaxine also is marketed as an antidepressant and, although one can speculate that the drug would have a lower rate of discontinuation symptoms than venlafaxine, no evidence supports this hypothesis. A range of venlafaxine discontinuation symptoms have been reported (Table). (1) Preventing discontinuation symptoms Patients for whom venlafaxine is prescribed should be informed about discontinuation symptoms, especially those who have a history of noncompliance. Monitor patients closely for discontinuation symptoms when venlafaxine is stopped--even if the patient is switched to another antidepressant. A gradual dosage reduction is recommended rather than abrupt termination or rapid dosage reduction. Immediately switching from venlafaxine to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) generally is not recommended, although it could alleviate some discontinuation symptoms (2); cross-taper medication over 2 to 3 weeks. Switching from venlafaxine to another SNRI, such as duloxetine, is less well studied. At venlafaxine dosages of Most patients tolerate a venlafaxine dosage reduction by 75 mg/d, at 1-week intervals.

      "title": "What can we learn from the history of research on psychedelic drugs in the addictions?",
      "abstract": "The history of research on the use of psychedelic drugs to treat alcohol dependence in the 1950s and 1960s suggests the need for caution in their proposed clinical use. Since 2006 there has been a revival of interest in using psychedelics to treat depression and post-traumatic stress disorders [1] and the addictions [2]. What lessons may we glean from research in the 1950s and 1960s on the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) to treat alcohol dependence [3, 4]? A 'psychedelic' drug 'produces thought, mood, and perceptual changes otherwise rarely experienced except in dreams… and acute psychosis' and does so 'without causing physical addiction, craving, major physiological disturbances, delirium, disorientation, or amnesia' [5]. The classic psychedelics include mescaline, psilocybin and LSD, all of which appear to act on the 5-HT-2a serotonin receptor [6]. The class has more recently been expanded to include 3,4-methyl​enedioxy​methamphetamine (MDMA) and plant-based drugs such as ibogaine and ayahuasca, with more varied effects and mechanisms of action that may be used in various combinations [7]. In the early 1950s Osmond & Hoffer used mescaline (and later LSD) to treat patients with alcohol dependence in mental hospitals in the Canadian Province of Saskatchewan [3, 4, 8, 9]. Osmond & Hoffer [4] hypothesized that large doses of mescaline could safely produce psychotic symptoms, like those in delirium tremens (DTs), and 'scare' alcoholics into sobriety [3, 4]. They found instead that their patients reported a mystical epiphany that led them to embrace abstinence [4]. Osmond later coined the term 'psychedelic therapy' to describe the use of high doses of mescaline or LSD to induce the therapeutic epiphanies [10] that he and his colleagues believed were essential for successful treatment, because they facilitated engagement with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) to sustain longer-term abstinence [3, 4, 11]. The local chapter of AA was very supportive of this use of LSD [8], presumably because it seemed to help alcoholics to achieve the first and second of AA's 12 Steps. A colleague of Osmond & Hoffer used their approach to treat 24 patients and reported that six were greatly and six moderately improved, and 12 were unchanged 6 months after [8, 9]. Similar later reports encouraged the Provincial Alcoholism Treatment Bureau to make LSD therapy the standard treatment for alcoholism in Saskatchewan [3, 4]. Sceptics questioned these positive results [3, 8, 12, 13]. First, they argued that their studies were uncontrolled, involved small numbers of patients and did not compare psychedelic therapy with other treatments [3, 13]. Secondly, they thought that the putative 50% success rates were inflated because outcomes were assessed by therapists who were not blind to the patients' treatment and who may have been biased by their own use of LSD [3, 4, 12]. The positive results of LSD treatment were called into question by a controlled trial at the Addiction Research Foundation (ARF) in Toronto that randomized 30 patients to receive an 800 μg dose of LSD, ephedrine and treatment as usual without a drug [9]. In this and several later trials the investigators reported that there were no better outcomes in patients who had been given LSD [9]. Osmond & Hoffer reasonably argued that the ARF study had not implemented psychedelic therapy because patients were given a large dose of LSD with no preparation or psychotherapeutic support [3]. Some later trials that more faithfully implemented Osmond & Hoffer's treatment model reported higher abstinence rates at 3 months' follow up in patients who received LSD [9], but no differences in outcome 12–18 months after treatment. A meta-analysis of these trials found better outcomes in the LSD group up to 6 months after treatment but no differences at 12 months [14]. LSD was, unsurprisingly, not a one-shot cure for alcohol dependence. It was also not seen as a standalone treatment by Osmond & Hoffer, who used it in combination with AA to maintain long-term abstinence. Krebs & Johansen [15] suggest that LSD may have a similar role in alcohol dependence to acamprosate and naltrexone; that is, it may need to be repeated and combined with aftercare to address the multiple personal and social problems of people with addiction. A major challenge will be avoiding the irrational exuberance that psychedelics seem to produce in some therapists [16]. Some of those conducting randomized controlled trials on depression and PTSD have publicly discouraged the non-medical use of psychedelic drugs [15], but it remains to be seen whether their 'sober advocacy' [15] will continue if the unsupervised clinical use of these drugs is permitted before controlled trials have defined their role in treatment. In Australia, for example, Mind Medicine Australia is facilitating the use of psychedelics in psychiatric practice by using special access schemes that allow the compassionate use of unapproved medicines [17]. They are advertising training courses for therapists on how to use these drugs, and they have enlisted politically well-connected people to argue that failing to allow the use of these drugs before regulatory approval will deny patients access to effective treatments [17]. Concerns about an over-exuberant therapeutic use of psychedelics will not end with the regulatory approval of psychedelics to treat depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. We can expect these drugs to be used off-label to treat a variety of behavioural disorders, including addictions. We may also see demands for compassionate access to plant-based psychedelic drugs, such as ayahuasca and ibogaine, based on appeals to the alleged 'entourage' effects of the whole plant. There is also a risk that enthusiasm for the use of psychedelic drugs may reduce interest in providing more mundane but effective psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for addiction. The history of psychedelic drugs suggests the need for caution in the revival of their therapeutic use. Clinical trials of their safety and efficacy need to be conducted (e.g. [18]) in larger, more representative patient samples, and under conditions more like routine clinical practice. Once given regulatory approval, their use should be restricted to research and supervised clinical settings to enable clinicians to be trained to deliver them in ways that minimize the risks of misadventures in the hands of exuberant clinicians [16]. Such a measured approach is needed if we wish to avoid the mistakes of the past. None. Wayne Hall: Conceptualization. Michael Farrell: Conceptualization.",

The term “toxic alcohols” is a collective term that includes methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol. Ethylene glycol exposure can be extremely dangerous, with significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Ethylene glycol is a colorless, sweet-tasting liquid most commonly found in antifreeze, but occasionally used for other purposes, such as industrial solvents. Exposures are generally observed due to accidental or intentional ingestions, with its sweet taste lending to accidental toxic exposures, whereas intentional exposures may be motivated by suicide attempt or desire for inebriation in the absence of ethanol. Ethylene glycol exposures can cause varying degrees of toxicity and management generally requires supportive care, close laboratory monitoring and antidotal therapy. The primary treatments are either ethanol or fomepizole and, occasionally, dialysis.",

      "abstract": "Pentamidine is an aromatic diamidino compound synthesized originally for the therapy of trypanosomiasis. The pharmacologic effects of pentamidine vary, depending on its route of administration. In animals, the dominant effects have been a precipitous, transitory drop in blood pressure after injection and renal toxicity following repeated administration. To avoid the possibility of immediate toxic reactions associated with iv administration, we now usually give the drug im to humans. Further interest in pentamidine has been stimulated by its usefulness in the treatment of interstitial pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii. In some patients receiving antineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapy who have superimposed P. carinii pneumonia, pentamidine may cause serious renal toxicity. Distribution and excretion studies in animals indicate pentamidine is deposited in tissues, with the greatest concentration in the kidneys, and gradually eliminated over a prolonged period. The mechanism of action of pentamidine against P. carinii or the means whereby fixation in tissues and subsequent toxicity occur have not been elucidated. Recent investigations to help clarify these points indicate that pentamidine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase in all tissues studied both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, pentamidine interacts and forms water-insoluble products with specific nucleotides and nucleic acids.",

When used in a combination of 2 parts chlordiazepoxide and 1 part clidinium, the protective effect was nearly five times greater than that produced by clidinium alone. Furthermore, the combination dosing proved nearly three times more potent than the potency that was predicted from simple additivity of the individual drug effects. This potentiation appears related to the number of ways in which the combination treatment can decrease autonomic input to the gastric mucosa. Thus, the peripheral cholinergic blockade by clidinium may be potentiated by a central chlordiazepoxide suppression of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activities. Therefore, the combined use of these drugs in the therapy of stress-induced gastric disorder appears to have a rational pharmacologic basis.",

Ses indications sont (i) le traitement du trouble d'hyperactivité avec déficit de l'attention (THADA) et (ii) le traitement de la narcolepsie avec ou sans cataplexie chez l'adulte et l'enfant de plus de six ans. Le MPH est inscrit sur la liste des stupé ants et sa prescription doit être effectuée sur ordonnance sécurisée limitée à 28 jours. Il est également soumis à une prescription initiale hospitalière annuelle. Parmi ses effets secondaires gure le risque d'abus et de dépendance. Ces comportements s'observent soit dans un contexte récréatif, en général chez des étudiants, soit chez des patients traités pour un THADA, et s'inscrivent souvent dans un contexte de polyconsommation. Il convient cependant de prendre en compte le fait que le THADA constitue en lui même un facteur de risque de toxicomanie. Sur le plan analytique, le MPH et son métabolite, l'acide ritalinique, sont identifiables et dosables dans le sang et l'urine par chromatographie en phase gazeuse couplée à la spectrométrie de masse, ainsi que par chromatographie en phase liquide couplée à la spectrométrie de masse ou à la masse tandem, cette dernière technique étant actuellement retenue par la majorité des auteurs.",

      "abstract": "Insulin resistance is an important mechanism in the development of the insulin resistance syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Although treatment has hitherto been confined to metformin or non-pharmacological measures, efforts are now being made to discover new drugs active against insulin resistance, so-called insulin sensitisers, for instance among the thiazolidinedione group. These are beginning to be tested in larger clinical trials where they have manifested effects not only on glucose metabolism but also on other cardiovascular risk factors such as hyperlipidaemia, defective fibrinolysis, and hypertension. However, adverse reactions to one of these drugs, troglitazone, include severe hepatic effects in certain cases. Accordingly, registration of the product has been stopped for use in Europe, but not in the USA and Japan. It is likely to take some time before thiazolidinediones will be introduced for clinical use in this country, though research and development continue.",

In practice, three substances are available or will shortly be available in France: lignocaine, etidocaine and bupivacaine, thus limiting the choice. This choice is guided by the toxicity of the substance, its clinical effects and 1st side effects. 1-Toxicity depends upon the nature of the substance, the dose necessary to obtain analgesia and to prolong it for a sufficient time. 2-Amongst the clinical effects which should be noted in the choice of a local anaesthetic are the latent period before analgesia is obtained, the degree of sensory block, the degree of motor block and the duration of action. The three substances available are compared in relations to these parameters and in the light of the specific requirements of obstetric analgesia. The value of the addiction of adrenalin is discussed. 3-The side effects are those of the local anesthetic itself and of its possible association with adrenalin. On the basis of the various criteria mentioned, it would seem that the analgesic of choice for obstetric analgesia is bupivacaine used with or without adrenalin.",

Its mode of action is not fully elucidated but it is believed that it and its metabolites stabilize the inactivated state of voltage-gated sodium channels, preventing their return to the inactivated state. Eslicarbazepine acetate is extensively converted to eslicarbazepine, its major active metabolite. Its pharmacokinetic profile is unaffected by food, gender, age or moderate hepatic impairment; clearance is dependent on renal function and dose reduction is recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min. Eslicarbazepine acetate does not induce its own metabolism or clearance. Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy in short and long term studies (up to 1 year) together with improvements in quality of life outcomes and depressive symptoms where these existed at baseline. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity and occurred early in treatment; the most frequently reported events were dizziness, somnolence and headache. Trials using eslicarbazepine acetate as monotherapy are ongoing.",

Since Diokno and Lapides described the properties and application of oxybutynin chloride in the therapy of urinary dysfunction, antimuscarinic therapy has remained the mainstay of therapy for detrusor overactivity and, more recently, the symptom complex known as OAB (2,3). According to the International Continence Society (ICS), OAB is classified as a symptom syndrome and is characterized by urgency, with or without incontinence and sometimes with frequency and nocturia (4). These symptoms are suggestive of detrusor overactivity (that is, urodynamically demonstrable IVCs) but can be attributed to other forms of voiding or urinary dysfunction as well.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Piribedil ([1‐(3,4‐methylenedioxybenzyl)‐4‐(2‐pyrimidinyl)piperazine]; S 4200) is a dopamine agonist with equal affinity for D 2 /D 3 dopamine receptors effective in treating Parkinson's disease as monotherapy or as an adjunct to levodopa ( L ‐dopa). However, its ability to prime basal ganglia for the appearance of dyskinesia is unknown. We now report on the ability of repeated administration of piribedil to induce dyskinesia in drug naïve 1‐methyl‐4‐phenyl‐1,2,3,6‐tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) ‐lesioned common marmosets compared with L ‐dopa and its actions on the direct and indirect striatal outflow pathways. Administration of piribedil (4.0–5.0 mg/kg orally) or L ‐dopa (12.5 mg/kg orally plus carbidopa 12.5 mg/kg orally twice daily) produced equivalent increases in locomotor activity and reversal of motor deficits over a 28‐day study period. Administration of L ‐dopa resulted in the progressive development of marked dyskinesia over the period of study. In contrast, administration of piribedil produced a significantly lower degree and intensity of dyskinesia. Surprisingly, piribedil caused an increase in vigilance and alertness compared to L ‐dopa, which may relate to the recently discovered α 2 ‐noradrenergic antagonist properties of piribedil. The behavioural differences between piribedil and L ‐dopa are reflected in the biochemical changes associated with the direct striatal output pathway. Administration of L ‐dopa or piribedil did not reverse the MPTP‐induced up‐regulation of preproenkephalin A mRNA in rostral or caudal areas of the putamen or caudate nucleus. In contrast, administration of either piribedil or L ‐dopa reversed the downregulation of preprotachykinin mRNA induced by MPTP in rostral and caudal striatum. L ‐dopa, but not Piribedil, reversed the decrease in preproenkephalin B mRNA produced by MPTP treatment. © 2002 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "In the study of Viitanen et al (1), unfortunately, only children 1–3 yr old are included. We feel it would have been better if children of all age groups were included. According to their study, routine oral premedication with midazolam delays recovery and emergence. But some groups of children may benefit from preoperative sedation before day surgery. These include the unduly anxious child, the child presenting for repeated procedures at short intervals, and the child with learning difficulties with whom it may be difficult to gain rapport. In recent years, considerable interest has been focused on the use of midazolam for sedating these groups of children. With a dose of 0.5–0.75 mg/kg it is effective in terms of rapid onset sedation and anxiolysis, which is needed in children. The main advantage claimed for midazolam premedication is that it does not delay recovery after day surgery and is not associated with an increased incidence of inpatient admission (2). In this usual preanaesthetic dose, it produces amnesia with few side effects, and mental function returns to normal within 4 h, making it a popular choice for ambulatory surgery (3). Further midazolam given as premedicant may combat the emergence delirium which may occur after sevoflurane anaesthesia in children including agitation, restlessness, combativeness and extreme fright (4). In conclusion, I strongly support their study and discourage the routine use of midazolam as a premedication in children. I thank Dr Chris Secker, FRCA, Consultant Anaesthetist, Department of Anaesthesia, Staffordshire General Hospital, for his encouragement and teaching on this topic. S. Sathish Kumar MB, BS",

      "abstract": "The management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in children remains challenging due to differences in the chemotherapy regimens, their relative emetogenicity compared to that in adults and differences in drug metabolism and the available formulations. The common four classes of anti-emetics used for the treatment and prophylaxis of CINV in children include dexamethasone, neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists (5HT3RAs), and olanzapine. The appropriate dose of dexamethasone for CINV prophylaxis in children is unknown, with a significant variability in dosage ranging between 6 and 32 mg/m2/day. The dose of dexamethasone is decreased by 30% when this drug is combined with (fos)aprepitant in children, in contrast to a decrease of 50% required in adults. The use of aprepitant in younger children (&lt;12 years) is often hampered by the non-availability of oral suspension formulations in many countries; alternatively, 80 mg capsules are administered for 1–3 days in certain institutes to children weighing between 15 and 40 kg. Among the different 5HT3RAs, palonosetron is comparatively metabolized faster in children than in adults, requiring a higher dosage for similar efficacy to that achieved in adults. Olanzapine is a newer agent, used in doses between 0.1 and 0.14 mg/kg/day in children, with good anti-emetic efficacy, but has sedation and hyperglycemia as concerning adverse effects. Drug interactions between anti-emetics and between anti-emetics and chemotherapy/supportive agents (azole antifungals, cyclosporine, arsenic trioxide), especially QTc prolongation, should be considered during prescription.",

      "title": "Postoperative Pain Management After Intraoperative Remifentanil",
      "abstract": "Remifentanil hydrochloride, an esterase metabolized opioid with rapid onset and offset of action (1,2), complements the anesthetic armamentarium of other rapidly titratable drugs (e.g., propofol and volatile anesthetics). Unlike other opioids, at the cessation of remifentanil administration at the end of surgery or in the recovery room, its pharmacodynamic effects rapidly dissipate as a result of its metabolism by nonspecific esterases (1,3). As a consequence, the residual respiratory depressant and analgesic effects normally seen with other opioids are minimized (4,5). The absence of any residual analgesic effects after remifentanil-based anesthesia means that measures must be taken to prevent pain before the remifentanil infusion is discontinued; otherwise, patients may experience unacceptable pain in the postoperative period. 1 This is particularly important because postoperative pain is often difficult to control once it becomes established. The focus of this article is on strategies for postoperative pain management after remifentanil has been administered for intraoperative analgesia. Remifentanil does not accumulate in the body (1,2,6). Approximately 5–10 min after cessation of an infusion, any analgesic effect attributed to remifentanil is insignificant. Witkowski et al. (4) demonstrated that within 10 min of discontinuing a remifentanil/O2/N2O anesthetic or alfentanil/O2/N2O anesthetic in which no prophylactic analgesics for postoperative pain management were administered, significantly more patients complained of moderate to severe postoperative pain in the remifentanil group (43%) compared with the alfentanil group (11%). Dershwitz et al. (7) found that 92% of patients reported pain after discontinuation of a remifentanil/O2/N2O anesthetic at a median time of 21 min. Thus, there may be a critical transition period of ≤30 min after surgery during which analgesia may be lacking after a remifentanil anesthetic if the appropriate procedures have not been initiated. Four different approaches to postoperative pain management are discussed in this article: start of postoperative pain management before the end of surgery; start of postoperative pain management immediately after surgery; continuing the remifentanil infusion; and decreasing the remifentanil infusion and substitution with a longer-acting opioid. The choice of a particular postoperative pain therapy depends on the anticipated postoperative pain intensity, the type of surgery performed (in- or outpatient cases, major or minor surgery) and the capacity for postoperative monitoring and supervision. Management of Anticipated Mild or Moderate Pain After Remifentanil- Based Anesthesia The transition to postoperative analgesia for patients with mild or moderate pain is straightforward (Table 1). However, the traditional strategy of administering an analgesic after postoperative pain starts is often problematic. Table 1: Postoperative Pain Management: Anticipated Mild to Moderate PainPhilip et al. (8) studied patients with remifentanil-based anesthesia for short outpatient procedures in which postoperative pain management was not initiated before the onset of pain. They found that immediate postoperative pain treatment was required by more patients and that time to first analgesic requirement was significantly shorter for remifentanil patients compared with those receiving alfentanil intraoperatively (P< 0.05). Patients undergoing outpatient laparoscopic surgery with either remifentanil or alfentanil received no additional longer-acting intraoperative analgesics for postoperative pain management. The time to first analgesic use was significantly shorter for remifentanil patients compared with alfentanil patients. Overall postoperative analgesia with fentanyl in 12.5-μg increments was required by more remifentanil patients (87%) compared with alfentanil patients (65%) (P< 0.001) while in the hospital (8). In the 24-h period after discharge from the ambulatory center, the incidence of analgesic use for pain was similar between the two groups: 82% of the remifentanil patients and 77% of the alfentanil patients. Similar results were found by Guy et al. (9) for inpatient surgery. After craniotomy for supratentorial space-occupying lesions, 64% of patients who received remifentanil and 50% of those who received fentanyl intraoperatively required analgesics for headache within 8 h postoperatively (P= 0.22). However, the median time to first analgesic administration occurred significantly earlier in patients in the remifentanil group (34 vs 136 min;P= 0.04). It is clear from this and other studies (4,8,10,11) that postoperative pain may occur earlier after remifentanil-based anesthesia than after other opioids. The traditional approach to postoperative pain management (administration of an analgesic after the onset of pain) is not very effective, especially when remifentanil is used intraoperatively; studies clearly demonstrate that pain management should be initiated before the onset of pain. In an open, randomized, comparative study of 18 female ASA physical status I or II inpatients, aged ≥18 yr, scheduled to undergo gynecological laparoscopies (12), the first patient was assigned to receive IV piritramide 2 postoperatively titrated to effect once she expressed moderate or severe pain, as no data were available at the time for the level of pain occurring after laparoscopy using a remifentanil-based technique. This first patient was given a total of 10.5 mg of piritramide, and the following 12 patients received a titrated average of 9 mg of piritramide at the first expression of pain. Shivering was seen in a few patients, regardless of whether they had received isoflurane, enflurane, or propofol, and this was successfully treated with meperidine. Therefore, the last five patients received a bolus of meperidine/pethidine immediately after tracheal extubation, before the expression of any pain. At that time, they were all fully awake and oriented to time, place, and person. None of these last five patients complained of pain or shivering, and they were discharged from the recovery room to the ward 30 min after tracheal extubation without requiring any further pain management. These results suggest that the immediate postoperative IV administration of a longer-acting opioid after remifentanil-based anesthesia for short, less painful procedures associated with mild postoperative pain provides successful pain management without compromising the rapid recovery and clear patient sensorium that characterizes remifentanil anesthesia. The administration of intraoperative nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or nonopioid analgesics in such procedures also provides effective postoperative pain control in most cases without the additional use of a postoperative opioid. Anticipated Moderate to Severe Postoperative Pain Surgical procedures with moderate postoperative pain include some outpatient procedures (e.g., herniorrhaphies, laparoscopic cholecystectomies). Other more elaborate procedures, such as placement and/or removal of external fixators on the foot or hand, can also be performed on an outpatient basis. When using traditional opioids, such as fentanyl or alfentanil, intraoperatively for these procedures, postoperative pain is usually treated with a combination of local infiltration and NSAIDs/analgesics (13–17). Claxton et al. (18) compared IV morphine with IV fentanyl for “painful” outpatient procedures. The procedures in their study were classified as having moderate postoperative pain and included operative arthroscopic surgery, removal of hardware, and breast augmentation. Typically, procedures with anticipated severe postoperative pain are performed exclusively on an inpatient basis. Examples of inpatient surgery with moderate to severe postoperative pain include major abdominal, trauma, and orthopedic surgeries, which are traditionally treated with parenteral analgesics (e.g., morphine, meperidine/pethidine, or piritramide). Postoperative pain management in these patients can be complex, as cases can be more involved and associated with greater intraoperative stress. Longer-acting and more potent drugs are often used, making emergence more variable in terms of speed and quality. Ideally, the patient awakens fairly rapidly but has enough analgesia to block at least moderate to severe pain. The patient usually needs supplemental analgesics shortly thereafter in the postanesthesia care unit. Classification of postoperative pain is difficult and is usually defined by the amount of postoperative analgesia needed to control the pain. Two approaches can be used if moderate to severe postoperative pain is anticipated. In the first approach, awakening is separated from postoperative pain. This can be accomplished by performing major regional blocks using local anesthetics and/or opioids for postoperative analgesia (19–23). These techniques could provide a rapid, painless emergence from an anesthetic during which remifentanil was the primary analgesic. The postoperative regional analgesia would not prolong emergence. In the second approach, awakening is balanced with postoperative pain. This usually involves using parenteral opioids for postoperative analgesia, i.e., IV opioids such as morphine or piritramide before the end of anesthesia. In orthopedic and trauma surgery with high incidences of moderate to severe postoperative pain, the combination of intraoperative NSAIDs and a longer-acting opioid provides satisfactory transition analgesia. Management of Moderate or Severe Postoperative Pain After Remifentanil-Based Anesthesia In major surgery, which can be associated with moderate or severe postoperative pain, four studies have reported the use of remifentanil in the immediate postoperative period for the control of postoperative pain before transitioning patients to longer-acting analgesics (10,11,24,25). The postoperative pain regimen and the results related to this type of management are summarized in APPENDIX 1. Using remifentanil in the tracheally extubated patient in the immediate postoperative period requires close monitoring and supervision to ensure individual titration of analgesic versus respiratory depressant effects, which occurs in 14%–42% of treated patients (10,11,24,25). The authors of all four studies conclude that, although an infusion of remifentanil for postoperative analgesia is effective, this form of pain management may only be appropriate in certain highly monitored settings. Bolus doses of remifentanil for postoperative analgesia are associated with an increased risk of respiratory depression and apnea and are generally not recommended (10,25). By nature of its pharmacokinetic properties, remifentanil can be used as an infusion at analgesic doses. Morphine, or any other moderate- to long-acting traditional opioid, can be given via boluses or a combination of infusion and boluses (i.e., patient-controlled analgesia). In one study (24), patients received either 0.15 mg/kg morphine (M group) or a placebo bolus (R group) 20 min before the end of major general surgery. From the end of surgery to 35 min postextubation, the R group received an infusion of 0.1 μg · kg−1 · min−1 remifentanil, and the M group received a placebo infusion. Patients also received either remifentanil infusion rate increases of 0.025 μg · kg−1 · min−1 and a placebo bolus (R group) or 2-mg morphine bolus doses and a placebo infusion rate increase (M group) as required for pain management during the first 25 min postoperatively. Successful analgesia, defined as no or mild pain with adequate respiration (>8 breaths/min; SpO2 > 90%) was achieved in a greater proportion of the remifentanil patients compared with the morphine patients (58% and 33%, respectively) 25 min after extubation (P< 0.05). The median remifentanil rate for successful analgesia was 0.125 μg · kg−1 · min−1 (range 0.05–0.23 μg · kg−1 · min−1), and the median number of 2-mg morphine doses was two (range zero to five). In conclusion, remifentanil (≤ 0.23 μg · kg−1 · min−1) was more effective for immediate postoperative analgesia than preemptive treatment with morphine (0.15 mg/kg) followed by morphine boluses (up to five 2-mg boluses). Results of this and other studies (11,26) suggest that a larger initial dose of morphine may be more effective and that once pain is established it is more difficult to treat. However, using a remifentanil infusion delayed, but did not eliminate, the need for alternative analgesia. Once the remifentanil infusion was discontinued, its effects dissipated rapidly, and pain could not adequately be managed by the two divided doses of morphine. Similar results were found in a previous multicenter investigation (11). From discontinuation of the postoperative remifentanil infusion until 30 min thereafter, 32% of the treated patient population had no or mild pain. In 157 patients undergoing abdominal, spine, joint replacement, or thoracic surgery, the remifentanil infusion was continued for at least 45 min into the postoperative period (10). During the first 30 min, remifentanil was titrated to ensure that patients had no or mild pain. At the end of the 30-min period, 78% of infusion rates were in the range of 0.05 to 0.15 μg · kg−1 · min−1, 5% were <0.05 μg · kg−1 · min−1, and 17% were >0.15 μg · kg−1 · min−1. Of the patients, 64% had no or mild pain at the end of the 30-min titration period. This approach can also be modified by combining the traditional opioid with a remifentanil infusion. In this technique, the opioid is titrated together with the remifentanil infusion. As more opioid is given, the remifentanil infusion is decreased to a small (i.e., analgesic) dose rate. This can be accomplished during dressing application in the operating room or as the patient is admitted to the PACU. A moderate dose of traditional opioid is started 30 min before the end of surgery, and the remifentanil infusion is continued (at the same or slightly smaller dose) into the PACU. The remifentanil is titrated down, and more of the other opioid is given as necessary. A simple and effective transition for the immediate management of postoperative pain in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery could be the administration of a longer-acting opioid 20–30 min before the end of surgery (Table 2). While remifentanil is dosed at the therapeutic optimum until the end of surgery and provides a maximal blockade of painful stimuli intraoperatively, a bolus of morphine 15 mg or piritramide 15 mg prevents the establishment of postoperative pain once remifentanil has been discontinued. This strategy offers the advantage of initiating postoperative pain management intraoperatively with the preferred analgesic used in the recovery room and in the general ward. After the initial intraoperative bolus, patients may receive a second reduced bolus in the recovery room (RR) or may be immediately transferred to a patient-controlled analgesia device delivering the same opioid. Table 2: Postoperative Pain Management: Anticipated Moderate to Severe PainConclusion Clinical experience with remifentanil has shown that it is indeed a short-acting opioid with an evanescent action. The clinical effects of the initial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data with remifentanil have now been consistently shown across a range of different surgery and patient types. Remifentanil may enable profound intraoperative analgesia that can be titrated to individual patient requirements without compromising recovery, which is both rapid and predictable. With the intraoperative use of traditional opioids, the analgesic management of a surgical patient can be divided into two distinct stages: intraoperative and postoperative. The prolonged effects of the traditional opioids used for intraoperative analgesia, e.g., fentanyl, can be used to reduce or delay postoperative pain until treated with routine postoperative pain medication in the RR or PACU. With remifentanil-based anesthesia, the rapid offset of remifentanil means that active postoperative pain management must be considered before arrival in the RR or PACU. Postoperative pain management therefore may be integrated into one analgesic concept starting with premedication or induction, giving remifentanil before any nociceptive stimulus and continued intraoperatively. Postoperative pain therapy is started before the antinociceptive effect of remifentanil ceases and is continued in the RR and ward. Clinical results offer a number of strategies to achieve this, depending on the anticipated level of postoperative pain, the concurrent anesthetics to be used, the duration of surgery, and whether an inpatient or outpatient procedure is being performed. In outpatient surgery, it is advantageous to have the patient wake up quickly for early discharge. Short-acting drugs such as propofol, desflurane/sevoflurane, and remifentanil seem to be appropriate for this purpose. Whatever is used intraoperatively, a supplemental analgesic will be needed for the immediate postoperative period (e.g., local infiltration, NSAIDs). For inpatient surgery, rapid emergence is not as essential, and the short-acting drugs are less compulsory. However, when postoperative pain is classified as mild, these short-acting drugs can be advantageous. There are many cases in which a short-acting opioid such as remifentanil can be effective in providing intraoperative hemodynamic stability for the patient without the risk of the drug accumulating and prolonging postoperative recovery. For inpatient cases in which mild postoperative pain is anticipated, the lack of residual analgesia when remifentanil is discontinued presents fewer problems and is easily managed (Table 1). In cases in which moderate to severe postoperative pain is anticipated, an early postoperative pain management plan should be followed to provide immediate postoperative pain control and to transition patients to ward analgesia. This can be achieved by continuing the remifentanil infusion at markedly reduced (i.e., analgesic) doses into the immediate postoperative setting, ensuring appropriate supervision to enable dose titration with maintenance of adequate respiration, before transferring patients to ward analgesia (10,11,24). However, this approach may be unsatisfactory, as it can be associated with a higher incidence of respiratory depression and muscle rigidity compared with other pain managements. Moreover, after discontinuing the remifentanil infusion for discharge to the general ward, another pain treatment must be initialized to ensure adequate pain relief. Another, probably more efficient, approach to the management of moderate to severe postoperative pain may be achieved by administering a longer-acting IV opioid as a bolus 20–30 min before the end of surgery (24,26). The kinetics and dynamics of remifentanil are such that if another potent opioid is given at that time, it will not interfere with the rapid recovery profile of remifentanil, which means that postoperative analgesia can be provided without the concern of residual opioid side effects, such as respiratory depression, after the remifentanil infusion is discontinued. NSAIDs such as ketorolac, nonopioid analgesics, local infiltration, epidural, patient-controlled analgesia, or longer-acting opioids are also suitable options depending on the degree of postoperative pain, the surgical procedure, and the patient.",

Data synthesis: The treatment of functional constipation in children is composed of several stages, among which is the long-term use of laxative drugs. The therapeutic options are limited and they carry problems related to longterm use, especially due to the adverse effects and child’s low adherence to the treatment. Polyethylene glycol is an odorless, tasteless and minimally absorbed osmotic agent, available in 3350 and 4000 molecular weights, with or without electrolytes. Good results have been reported in controlled and randomized studies regarding the improvement of symptoms of constipation. It is considered safe, without significant side effects. Conclusions: Polyethylene glycol is superior to other osmotic agents as far as taste and children’s acceptance are concerned. Low daily doses are safe and effective. It is a good treatment option for chronic functional constipation in children.",

      "title": "Phenytoin-induced fatal drug reactions in two patients with brain tumors: Need to re-think our routine anticonvulsant usage",
      "abstract": "Sir, Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are routinely prescribed to patients with brain tumors for seizure treatment and prophylaxis, despite there being no evidence of their proven role in prophylaxis against seizures.[1] Phenytoin is the most commonly used drug for this purpose in our country because of its easy availability and low cost. The widespread use of phenytoin is further questionable in view of its seemingly higher adverse effects in patients with brain tumors, viz., worsening of immunosuppression in brain cancer, its role in decreasing the efficacy of concomitant chemotherapy and steroids, and the development of serious side effects such as liver dysfunction, myelosuppression, cognitive impairment, and life-threatening muco-cutaneous reactions of Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).[2,3] Among all AEDs, phenytoin is the most common drug implicated in the development of SJS–TEN (with its incidence being approximately 13.37%).[3] In this article, we report two patients who died from phenytoin-related SJS–TEN, and recommend the need to restrict its current rampant usage for seizure prophylaxis in patients harbouring a brain tumor. Case 1 A 58-year-old male patient with a right cerebellar tumor was admitted with impaired sensorium and a 2-day history of fever and cough. He was on phenytoin prophylaxis for 8 days; acetazolamide and dexamethasone were added. Three days later, he abruptly developed clusters of non-pruritic, maculopapular rash, and small red blisters on the face, trunk, extremities, and genitalia; painful oral mucosal ulcers causing swallowing difficulty; and, minute conjunctival and corneal erosions. Bullous eruptions replaced the rashes, with peeling of the overlying skin, exposing the red, oozing, and painful dermis [Figure 1]; the denuded skin was roughly 10% of the body surface area (BSA), and the Nikolsky sign (skin peeling with gentle pressure) was positive. Skin biopsy showed mostly neutrophilic perivascular inflammatory dermal infiltrates with focal epidermal necrosis. The patient developed breathing difficulty, hypoxia, and hypotension, which rapidly progressed to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); he died approximately 40 hours after the appearance of the rash.Figure 1: Denuded skin areas with erythematous background in Case 1, and widespread cutaneous blisters and maculopapular lesions in Case 2Case 2 A 42-year-old female patient with a left sphenoid wing meningioma was admitted with decreased light perception and an episode of seizure. She was started on phenytoin, acetazolamide, and dexamethasone, and underwent a craniotomy and tumor excision after 3 days. The next day, she developed extensive, blanchable erythematous macular lesions on the trunk, extremities, and face, as well as painful ulcers and erosions in her oral cavity, auditory canal, conjunctiva, and eyelids. Extensive skin denudation occurred over 55% of her BSA [Figure 1]. The skin biopsy revealed subepidermal separation and inflammatory infiltration. The patient soon developed a high fever, hypoxia, kidney and liver derangements, and refractory shock. She died 58 hours after the appearance of the rash. Both the patients were managed with immediate phenytoin withdrawal, local treatment of the muco-cutaneous lesions, and an intensive care support. SJS–TEN is a dreaded hypersensitivity reaction of phenytoin that causes epidermal necrolysis via infiltrating cytokine-releasing CD8 T-lymphocytes and macrophages; direct cell damage may occur via the release of toxic drug metabolites as a result of defective phenytoin metabolism. A genetic cause is implicated by the significant correlation observed between phenytoin-induced SJS–TEN and HLA-B*1502 allele in patients of Asian ancestry. Normal serum phenytoin levels suggest that the reaction is not dose-related, and its progression may not reverse with drug withdrawal.[4] The clinical manifestation occur within a few hours to up to 45 days (mean: 6 days) after phenytoin administration, with the peak levels being reached by the fourth day. The risk of mortality in SJS–TEN is high (SJS: 3.92%; TEN: 28.20%; transitional SJS–TEN: 5.26%) due to the occurrence of serious consequences such as septicemia, acute renal failure, shock, ARDS, metabolic encephalopathy, cardiovascular instability, and intracranial bleeding.[3,2] Phenytoin-induced fatal SJS–TEN has been reported earlier, though infrequently [Table 1].[4,5,6,7,8,9] Combining phenytoin with radiotherapy and steroids enhances the fatality risk, and is best avoided [Table 1].[4,5,6] The severity-of-illness score for toxic epidermal necrolysis (SCORTEN), a predictive score based on seven independent prognostic criteria, has a linear relationship with the mortality risk in SJS–TEN.[3] An increasing age as well as the presence of chronic conditions, infections, hematological malignancy, and renal failure were the predictors of mortality in a recently published study;[10] some previous authors have also observed a link between advanced age and mortality [Table 1].[5,9] A prompt recognition of SJS–TEN is vital to averting a fatal outcome. A missed or delayed diagnosis is not uncommon, and hence there is a constant need to repeatedly educate neuro-clinicians regarding this grave complication. Development of any skin or mucosal lesion, preceded at times by a flu-like illness, should be viewed suspiciously in a patient on phenytoin, and immediate dermatology confirmation should be sought. Immunoglobulins and early dexamethasone therapy may help to reduce the mortality.[3]Table 1: Phenytoin-induced fatal SJS-TEN cases in literatureThe sudden development of SJS–TEN causing rapid death of our otherwise stable patients with treatable brain tumors was alarming. Incidents such as these are grim reminders that AEDs should be administered judiciously in neurosurgical practice. A routine prophylactic treatment with anticonvulsants is not recommended in the presence of newly diagnosed brain tumors because of their lack of efficacy and the potentially serious side effects. Limiting AED therapy to patients with established seizures or to those at a considerable risk of developing seizures, and their discontinuation after the first postoperative week, is advocated.[1] Moreover, concerted efforts should be made toward replacing the traditional drug phenytoin with suitable alternatives that have a lower incidence of rash formation such as levetiracetam, gabapentin, valproic acid, topiramate, and zonisamide.[5] Levetiracetam is increasingly gaining popularity because of its lesser side effects, comparable clinical efficacy, and no constraints of serial drug level monitoring.[11,12] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

In June 1996, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved its use in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to fluorouracil (5-FU)-based therapy. The recommended starting dose is 125 mg/m2 administered as a weekly infusion for four weeks followed by a two-week rest period. The most common and clinically significant adverse events include diarrhea, neutropenia, and nausea and vomiting. Other adverse events include alopecia and fatigue.Irinotecan has significant activity in patients with 5-FU-refractory colorectal cancer. This drug is well tolerated and easily administered in an outpatient setting. The most common adverse events are well characterized and are reversible upon treatment discontinuation or dosage reduction. In particular, diarrhea, the most common toxicity, is manageable with use of appropriate dose modification and rigorous administration of loperamide at the first signs of diarrhea.Nurses need to focus on identifying and managing adverse effects based on individual patient tolerance. Nurses have an important role to play in patient education and follow up in order to minimize toxicity. Patient care concerns include management of diarrhea and nausea and vomiting, neutropenia with related risk of infection, and fluid and electrolyte imbalances.",

La actividad fundamental consiste en que anula las alteraciones clínicas y bio-eléctricas producidas por las drogas alucinóqenos (ácido lisérgico y mescalina). En diversas psicosis tóxicas y en reacciones esquizofrénicas agudas ha hecho desaparecer los trastornos mentales, algunas veces, en un tiempo extremadamente corto. Ciertas reacciones psicóticas han remitido durante la primero inyección endovenoso del preparado. En este trabajo, el primero que se hace en el país, se usó azacyclonol por vía endovenosa y oral en 11 casos, 5 sufrían de esquizofrenia paranoide, 3 de psicosis paranoide, 2 de psicosis tóxicas y 1 de una reacción obsesiva en la involución. Todos los casos eran recientes, con excepción de uno. El tiempo de observación ha variado entre 3-40 días, la dosis promedio fue de 100 mgs. diarios y los resultados han sido buenos en 1, regulares en 3 y nulos en 7 casos.

Methodologic and economic considerations have hampered attempts to develop agents with significantly greater specificity or safety than traditional agents. Traditional agents, while lacking specificity, do have extensive records of efficacy and long-term safety and are usually less expensive than new agents. Patients not responding to traditional agents often have medical or characterologic problems that exclude them from participating in controlled studies of new agents.

They include a nitroglycerin system for the prophylaxis of angina, and a scopolamine system for the prevention of motion sickness. In addition, there are also published reports on rate-controlled transdermal forms of clonidine and estradiol. Since the trans-dermal mode of drug administration can provide continuity of delivery and precise control of drug plasma concentrations, it offers particular advantages for drugs with short half-lives or narrow therapeutic indices. It is also useful when the oral route is unsuitable. Transdermal rate-controlled therapy appears on the brink of rapid expansion for the administration of potent, nonirritating, nonallergenic agents with suitable physi-cochemical properties. In the case of new agents, rate-controlled transdermal administration may render some drugs routinely usable that otherwise would produce unacceptable side effects or require impractical regimens. Some older agents will gain an increased margin of safety and convenience—as well as expanded therapeutic usefulness—compared with their administration in conventional dosage forms. Owing to constraints arising from drug potency, skin permeability, and/or topical reactions, however, transdermal administration is not expected to become the preferred dosage form for a high percentage of drugs.",

Additionally, delayed disintegration and dissolution of tablets affect a drug's efficacy.

      "abstract": "In recent times there has been a growing research interest in Nevirapine an antiretroviral medication that prevents human immunodeficiency virus cells from multiplying in the blood. Nevirapine comes as tablet and a suspension (liquid) often taken by mouth, it is taken with or without once a day for 2 weeks and twice a day after the first 2 weeks. It is best to swallow nevirapine with liquids such as water, milk or soda. Feeding experiments in various animal species and humans have highlighted the beneficial role of nevirapine on health. These benefits include significant reduction in acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related morbidity and mortality. However, nevirapine hypersensitivity reaction can lead to morbidity through treatment interruption, inconvenience and loss of productivity. Additionally, nevirapine has an excellent bioavailability and a long half-life. This increases the risk of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance when patients discontinue all the other antiretroviral drugs in the regimen at the same time. Thus, this can lead to decreased therapeutic options if nevirapine resistance develops. The gastrointestinal tract is a major portal of entry of nutrients into the body and nevirapine first make contact with the gastrointestinal tract. The health of an individual is dependent on the nutrient absorbed and hence functional integrity of the gastrointestinal tract. Studies have revealed that the interaction with drug have led to disruption of gastrointestinal function.",

      "title": "Pendrin—A New Target for Diuretic Therapy?",
      "abstract": "Diuretics are among the most frequently used drugs to treat hypertension, congestive heart failure, and edema and play a role in the prevention of some forms of recurrent nephrolithiasis.1–3 Most commonly used diuretics act by directly inhibiting tubular transport processes, such as the loop diuretics blocking the Na+/K+/2Cl− cotransporter (NKCC2) in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, the thiazides and chlortalidones inhibiting the Na+/Cl− cotransporter (NCC) in the distal convoluted tubule, or the potassium-sparing diuretics of the amiloride or triamterene type blocking the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the connecting tubule and collecting duct. Other classes of diuretics interfere with metabolic or endocrine mechanisms linked to tubular transport processes, such as in the cases of the rather infrequently used carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (e.g., acetazolamide) that mostly reduce Na+/H+ exchanger activity and the more widely used mineralocorticoid receptor blockers (e.g., spironolactone and eplerenone) reducing the stimulatory effect of aldosterone on ENaC–mediated salt absorption. Two novel classes of substances increase diuresis but do not act primarily on salt reabsorptive pathways: the aquaretics blocking the V2 vasopressin receptor reducing AQP2 water channel activation by the antidiuretic hormone (e.g., tolvaptan) and the inhibitors of the Na+/glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) (e.g., canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin) primarily reducing proximal tubular glucose absorption causing osmotic diuresis.4,5 The use of diuretics from the first group directly blocking salt reabsorption can be limited by hypo- or hyperkalemia or hypercalcemia. In patients with CKD and increasingly lower GFR, the efficacy of drugs can be reduced, requiring escalating doses or alternative drugs. The indications for SGLT2 inhibitors and vasopressin receptor antagonists are distinct and currently, mostly restricted to the treatment of type 2 diabetes, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, and hyponatremic syndromes. Moreover, the efficacy of diuretics blocking salt absorptive pathways is often limited by the plasticity of the renal tubule and its ability to stimulate the growth and activity of downstream segments contributing to treatment-resistant hypertension.3,6 Then, combinations of diuretics acting in subsequent segments and on distinct pathways may help to improve diuretic efficacy. The collecting duct is the last site of salt reabsorption and contributes to up to 2% of absorption of the filtered salt load. Renal salt reabsorption in the collecting duct depends on several factors and transport pathways. Distal delivery of sodium and chloride is determined by GFR and the rate of reabsorption of both ions in upstream nephron segments. Particularly, NaCl reabsorption by the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the distal convoluted tubule influences the delivery of sodium and chloride to the collecting duct. There, sodium is reabsorbed in part by the epithelial Na+ channel ENaC, which is stimulated by angiotensin II and aldosterone. Chloride absorption occurs via different routes, in part through the paracellular pathway requiring claudins 4 and 8 and through intercalated cells.7,8 In nontype A–intercalated cells, chloride can be directly reabsorbed in exchange for bicarbonate, a process mediated by the anion exchanger pendrin, or chloride absorption can be coupled to sodium absorption involving a more complex scheme. Secretion of two bicarbonate ions and absorption of two chloride ions by pendrin are driving the activity of another transporter, the Na+–dependent bicarbonate-chloride exchanger (NDBCE), exchanging one intracellular chloride for one extracellular bicarbonate plus one sodium (Figure 1). This results in the net absorption of NaCl.8Figure 1.: Transport pathways involved in salt absorption by the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and collecting system as targets of diuretics. Scheme of a nephron depicting the major transport pathways targeted by commonly used diuretics. In the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL), furosemide and chlortalidon inhibit the NKCC2 cotransporter, and in the DCT, thiazides block the NCC cotransporter. In the collecting system (first cells starting in the late DCT), potassium-sparing diuretics inhibit ENaC activity in principal cells (PCs). Chloride absorption occurs in part through a pendrin-dependent process located in type B intercalated cells (B-ICs; basolateral V-ATPase) and nontype A/nontype B intercalated cells (non-A/non-B ICs; apical V-ATPase). V-ATPase–driven proton secretion energizes chloride/bicarbonate exchange by pendrin. Coupling of pendrin activity to the NDCBE allows for NaCl absorption. NDBCE may also be targeted by thiazides, whereas pendrin can be blocked by novel inhibitors.

Patients with Pendred syndrome caused by mutations in pendrin (SLC26A4) suffer most notably from sensorineural deafness and frequently develop hypothyroidism and goiter. However, their renal phenotype has been studied very little to date. Hypochloremic alkalosis was reported in two patients with Pendred syndrome; however, the condition occurred only during acute illness or therapy with thiazides primarily causing volume depletion.9,10 Next to these incidental reports, detailed studies in mice suggest an important role of pendrin in renal control of salt excretion and BP. Salt depletion or aldosterone stimulates pendrin expression and activity in parallel to other chloride and sodium transport proteins, such as NaCl cotransporter NCC or the epithelial sodium channel ENaC.8 Mice lacking pendrin lose more salt during salt depletion and have lower BP, suggesting that pendrin is required for the renal capacity to conserve salt and maintain BP. Moreover, pendrin-deficient mice are partly protected from developing hypertension during high-salt/aldosterone treatment. Vice versa, mice overexpressing pendrin develop chloride-sensitive hypertension.11 Because salt absorption by the collecting duct is influenced by salt delivery, the role of pendrin in compensating for reduced salt absorption by earlier segments has been studied. On the one hand, chronic inhibition of NCC activity with thiazides increases pendrin expression, whereas on the other hand, concomitant genetic ablation of NCC and pendrin causes a severe syndrome of renal salt loss and volume depletion.8,12 Similarly, deletion of NCC and the NDBCE transporter working in conjunction with pendrin also leads to salt wasting.13 Taken together, the biology of pendrin and its interactions with other salt–transporting pathways make pendrin an attractive target for novel inhibitors that may be useful as diuretics standing alone or used in combination with existing drugs to enhance their efficacy. Verkman and colleagues14 identified novel compounds selectively inhibiting pendrin with high affinity using a functional chemical library screen. As reported here in this issue of the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, these compounds given to mice had, per se, no effect on diuresis or acid-base parameters in urine and blood.15 However, when given in combination with furosemide, pendrin inhibitors potentiated the diuretic effect of furosemide. Importantly, the pendrin inhibitor even further increased diuresis in mice given chronically furosemide. However, mice treated with hydrochlorothiazide plus pendrin inhibitor showed a paradoxical reduction in diuresis.15 Several issues are of major interest, and some questions remain unanswered. Next to tests of safety and pharmacokinetics in humans, the question remains of whether pendrin inhibitor will have a similar diuretic potency in humans as in rodents. The relative number of pendrin-expressing cells may be relatively lower in human kidney compared with rodent kidney and thus, limit the efficacy of pendrin inhibitors.16,17 Next to kidney, pendrin (SLC26A4) is expressed in various other organs, including thyroid glands, inner ear, adrenal glands, and airways, which will affect its side effects as well as modulate its diuretic and antihypertensive effects. Although pendrin function in inner ear and thyroid glands may be problematic and cause side effects, the inhibition of adrenal gland pendrin may add to the beneficial effects of pendrin blockade in kidney. Pendrin function in adrenal glands seems to support aldosterone secretion, and inhibition may help to reduce renal salt reabsorption as well as other extrarenal effects of aldosterone (e.g., in heart and vasculature).18 Chronic treatment with loop diuretics as well as thiazides and chlortalidones often causes hypokalemia because of the excessive stimulation of potassium secretion in the collecting duct by increased urinary flow and stimulation of ENaC activity, which in turn, increases renal outer medullary K+–mediated K+ secretion. The combination of the pendrin inhibitor with furosemide further increased urinary K+ excretion, pointing to another possible side effect of this class of inhibitors. Also, metabolic alkalosis was aggravated by the combination of furosemide and the pendrin inhibitor, further underlining the potency of this combination. The pendrin inhibitor reduced the diuretic response to thiazide treatment. At first glance, this is surprising, because the combined ablation of NCC and pendrin causes a massive diuresis and renal phenotype in mice.12 However, thiazides have also been reported to block not only NCC activity but also, the NDCBE transporter working in conjunction with pendrin in the collecting duct. Thus, during acute treatment with thiazides, both NCC– and NDCBE/pendrin–dependent salt absorption may be blocked, and further blockade with a pendrin inhibitor does not cause more salt wasting. In contrast, pendrin inhibition in adrenal glands may reduce filtration and thereby, cause a paradoxical reduction in diuresis. Clearly, these effects will require more clarification and may also provide novel insights into the renal handling of chloride and the role of pendrin. Pendrin inhibitors, if making the difficult way into clinics, may represent another promising new class of drugs targeting a tubular transport pathway, like the more recently developed inhibitors of urea transporters or the renal outer medullary K+ channel.19,20 Their specific application may be in the combination with other diuretics, such as loop diuretics, to address some of the adaptive responses of the tubular transport machinery contributing to the resistance to diuretics.

      "abstract": "The long-term stability of an active-pharmaceutical ingredient and its drug products plays an important role in the licensing process of new pharmaceuticals and for the application of the drug at the patient. It is, however, difficult to predict degradation profiles at early stages of the development of new drugs, making the entire process very time-consuming and costly. Forced mechanochemical degradation under controlled conditions can be used to realistically model long-term degradation processes naturally occurring in drug products, avoiding the use of solvents, thus excluding irrelevant solution-based degradation pathways. We present the forced mechanochemical oxidative degradation of three platelet inhibitor drug products, where the drug products contain thienopyridine. Model studies using clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate (CLP) and its drug formulation Plavix show that the controlled addition of excipients does not affect the nature of the main degradants. Experiments using drug products Ticlopidin-neuraxpharm and Efient show that significant degradation occurs after short reaction times of only 15 min. These results highlight the potential of mechanochemistry for the study of degradation processes of small molecules relevant to the prediction of degradation profiles during the development of new drugs. Furthermore, these data provide exciting insights into the role of mechanochemistry for chemical synthesis in general.",

Occasionally it has been overlooked not only that morphine potentiates the action of pentothal but that pentothal will potentiate the action of morphine. When morphine is administered to a patient postoperatively it is important to know whether such a patient has received a pentothal anesthetic. If he has, and the fact is disregarded, the morphine administered may produce a clinical narcotic effect far greater than was desired or anticipated.

      "title": "Efficacy and Toxicity of the Solvent Polyethylene Glycol 400 in Monkey Model",
      "abstract": "Summary: Several antiepileptic drugs, such as carbamazepine and clonazepam, have low bioavailability in solid form and are insoluble in an aqueous solution. Alcohol solvents are often employed as vehicles when these drugs are studied in animal models. Secondary and particularly tertiary alcohols are suspected of some anticonvulsant activity. The present research evaluated the possibility that polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) might be efficacious, toxic, or both. Monkeys (N = 11) rendered epileptic by aluminum‐hydroxide were administered PEG 400 by constant rate (1 ml/hr) intravenous infusion for 3–4 weeks, preceded and followed by several weeks of baseline. At a concentration of 60%, PEG 400 significantly reduced seizure frequency, but also exhibited severe side effects. These findings suggest that experimental testing of anticonvulsants may be compromised when this or similar solvents are used chronically. RÉSUMÉ Plusieurs médicaments antiépileptiques, tels que la carbamazépine et le clobazam, sont insolubles dans l'eau et sont done dissous dans des solvants alcooliques pour les études expérimentales chez l'ariimal. Mais les alcools secondaires et plus particulièrement tertiaires sont suspectés de presenter une activité antiépileptique. La présente recherche a done pour but d'évaluer la possibilityé que le polyethylène glycol 400 (PEG 400) presente un effet antiepileptique, ou toxique, ou les deux. Onze singes rendus épileptiques parl'hydroxyde d'alumine reçoivent en perfusion du PEG 400, de façon continue a raison de 1 ml/hr pendant 3 à 4 semaines avec durant les quelques semaines précédentes et consécutives des contrôles répétés. A la concentration de 60% le PEG 400 réduit significativement la frequence des crises mais presente également des effets secondaires importants. De telles constatations suggèrent que l'appréciation au moyen de tests expérimentaux de la valeur de médications anticonvulsivantes peut étre compromise lorsque ce solvant (ou d'autres de nature comparable) est utilisé. RESUMEN Varios productos antiepilépticos, tales como la carbamazepina y el clonazepan, tienen una biodis‐ponibilidad reducida, en forma sólida, y son insolubles en agua. Cuando estas drogas se aplican a modelos animales, frecuentemente se utilizan disolventes alcohólicos como vehiculos. Se acepta que algunos al‐coholes secundarios y, particularmente, los terciarios poseen cierta actividad anticonvulsiva. La presente investigatión valoró la posibilidad de que el glicol polietileno 400 (PEG 400) fuera eficaz y/o tóxico. PEG 400 fue administrado mediante una infusidn intravenosa a ritmo constante (1 ml/hr) durante 3–4 semanas a 11 monos convertidos en epiiepticos mediante hidróxido de aluminio. Estas observaciones fueron precedidas y seguidas de varias semanas de estudio basal. En con‐centraciones de 60% el PEG 400 redujo, de modo sig‐nificativo, la frecuencia de los ataques pero tambien produjo signos colaterales. Estos hallazgos sugieren que los ensayos experimentales de los anticonvulsives pueden estar comprometidos cuando este tipo de disolventes, u otros similares, se utilizan crónicamente. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Mehrere Antiepileptika wie Carbamazepin und Clonazepam besitzen eine niedrige Bioverfügbarkeit in fester Form und sind wasserunlöslich. Alkoholische Lösungsmittel werden oft verwendet, wenn diese Medikamente im Tiermodell untersucht werden sollen. Von sekundären und besonders tertiären Alkoholen wird eine gewisse antikonvulsive Wirkung angenommen. Die gegenwärtige Studie untersucht die Möglichkeit, daß Polyethylen‐Glycol 400 (PEG 400) wirkungsvoll, toxisch oder beides sein könnte. Bei 11 Affen wurde eine Epilepsie durch Aluminium‐Hydroxid‐erzeugt; sie bekamen während 3–4 Wochen PEG 400 darch intravenöse Infusion 1ml pro Stunde ziigeführt, wurden vorher und anschließend mehrere Wochen beobachtet. In einer Konzentration von 60% reduzierte PEG 400 die Anfallshäufigkeit signifikant, zeigte aber auch schwere Nebenwirkungen. Diese Be‐funde lassen vermuten, daß ein experimentelles Testen der Antikonvulsiva beeinflußt werden kann, wenn diese oder ähnliche Lösungsmittel chronisch verabfolgt werden.",

Typical low ceiling diuretics are the thiazides. Also, such compounds as chlorthalidone and mefruside belong to this group. A further characteristic of this group is the protracted duration of activity which is particularly advantageous in long-term treatment (Figure 1). In contrast to this, the dose/activity curves of high-ceiling diuretics run almost linearly over a wide range. Such diuretics have a reserve in capacity and can, therefore, also be used on thiazide-resistant patients.

      "title": "Individualized short-course cyclosporin therapy in psoriasis",
      "abstract": "The efficacy and side-effects of cyclosporin in psoriasis, namely hypertension and renal dysfunction, are dose-related. An initial dose of 3 mg/kg per day has a better risk/benefit ratio than 5 mg/kg per day. Maximum efficacy is usually reached after 2-3 months, and effects of the drug remain even after treatment stops. We therefore suggest that periodic short-term use of cyclosporin in order to combine persisting therapeutic effect with safety. Psoriatic erythroderma and arthropathy also respond rapidly to oral cyclosporin. Once patients have been successfully treated, the drug should be discontinued. Treatment must not exceed 6 months, but in the case of relapse a new cycle of the previously effective and tolerated dose can be given. The concomitant use of other therapies has been assessed in an attempt to reduce the dose of cyclosporin. There are no significant cyclosporin-sparing effects when etretinate or UVB are used adjunctively, and currently no convincing data on the risk of combining low-dose cyclosporin with immunosuppressive therapy (including methotrexate, UVB, and PUVA) in dermatological indications. The addition of topical corticosteroids or calcipotriol leads to more rapid clearing of psoriasis plaques, although relapse rates remain unchanged. Individualized short-course cyclosporin therapy is useful in controlling acute psoriasis flares and/or inducing remission; less potent agents can then be used for maintenance therapy. Short courses of low-dose cyclosporin may almost completely eliminate the risks of renal dysfunction from this drug.",

After cessation of the administration of diuretics, the antihypertensive effect persisted for a longer time with chlorthalidone than with the other two drugs. The full antihypertensive effect of chlorthalidone and chlorothiazide was still present 24 hours after the administration of the drugs was ceased, and the full effect of chlorthalidone was present 72 hours after the administration of the drug was ceased. Side effects related to a rapid diuresis were more common with frusemide. The study indicated that chlorthalidone could be given at 48-hour or 72-hour intervals, and that other diuretics may be given once daily to exert their full antihypertensive action.",

      "abstract": "Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) have been commonly used in both human and veterinary medicine to reduce pain and inflammation in different arthritic and postoperative conditions due to their three major activities, viz., anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic. Phenylbutazone, diclofenac, meloxicam and some other NSAIDs are being used as therapeutic measures for pain, inflammation and fever in clinical veterinary medicine. Anti- inflammatory effect is mainly due to their ability to inhibit the activities of cyclooxygenases, enzymes those mediate the production of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, a dietary fatty acid. Cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX-2) is the inducible form of the enzyme and is involved in inflammation. The widespread use of NSAIDs has meant that the adverse effects of these drugs have become increasingly prevalent. The two main adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with NSAIDs relate to gastrointestinal (GI) effects and renal effects of the agents. The most common is a propensity to induce gastric or intestinal ulceration that can sometimes be accompanied by anemia from the resultant blood loss.

This long‐acting formulation contains the same active ingredient as exenatide twice daily, except that the exenatide is encapsulated in dissolvable microspheres. Following subcutaneous injection, exenatide once weekly microspheres remain in place under the skin and slowly degrade, releasing active exenatide continuously into circulation. In randomized clinical trials, exenatide once weekly was associated with significant glycaemic improvement and moderate weight loss in patients with T2DM when administered as monotherapy or in combination with a variety of oral antidiabetic agents. Exenatide once weekly also lowered blood glucose more effectively than titrated basal insulin in patients on metformin or metformin plus sulphonylurea background therapy. Gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) were the most common tolerability issues associated with exenatide once weekly administration, but they occurred at lower rates than in patients on other glucagon‐like peptide receptor agonists (i.e., exenatide twice daily or liraglutide). Issues regarding the place of exenatide once weekly in T2DM pharmacotherapy are discussed.",

Mifepristone prevents 92–100% of pregnancies with an acceptable side‐effect profile on oral intake of a 10–600‐mg dose within 72 h of unprotected intercourse. A single dose of 10 mg mifepristone resulted in a pregnancy rate of 1.5%, similar to a 1.5‐mg single dose or two doses of 0.75 mg levonorgestrel 12 h apart, administered within 120 h (current standard) of unprotected sexual intercourse. Mifepristone and levonorgestrel do not differ in efficacy as emergency contraceptives. The mode of action of emergency contraception (EC) with mifepristone or levonorgestrel is primarily associated with inhibition of ovulation rather than prevention of implantation. Different doses of mifepristone appear to have similar effects. However, delay in the onset of subsequent menstruation caused by mifepristone is dose dependent and is reduced with a lower dose without affecting its efficacy. Patient acceptability of mifepristone as EC is high. However, the optimum standard dose of mifepristone is yet to be established for its application as an effective and acceptable emergency contraceptive drug for ordinary clinical use or practice.",

      "title": "Evaluation of efficacy of pilocarpine and bethanechol in xerostomic denture wearers",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Salivary hypofunction is frequently encountered among denture wearers. Saliva is necessary and important for the maintenance of oral health. It helps in swallowing, speech, and oral function, and serves as an adhesive between undersurface of denture and mucosal surface. It also provides protection against chemical, mechanical, and microbial pathogens.[1] Xerostomia may be due to various reasons that need to be assessed. Complete and thorough evaluation is necessary to assess the case of xerostomia. It is more frequently seen among old age people. Saliva plays an important role in denture retention. Without saliva, patient faces loss of denture retention and irritation. Management of patients with xerostomia includes frequent sipping of water in order to make oral cavity moist. Sugar-free gum or candies/lozenges may be useful up to a certain extent.[2] Parasympathomimetic agents such as pilocarpine hydrochloride or neostigmine bromide can provide sympathetic relief.[3] Artificial saliva and salivary substitutes provide immediate relief in patients with xerostomia. Aqueous solutions made up of the mineral salts constitute artificial saliva, which are similar to that of salts in human saliva. The hollowed lingual flange of a mandibular denture serves an intraoral saliva reservoir to provide artificial saliva and sometimes even palatal reservoir does the same.[4] Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist. It acts on muscarinic cholinergic receptor by stimulating the function of gland including salivary glands. There have been reports of >90% improvement in completely edentulous patients with xerostomia. Bethanechol, which is an acetylcholine analogue, is usually resistant to rapid destruction by cholinesterase and thus has prolonged activity.[5] This study was conducted to assess efficacy of pilocarpine and bethanechol in xerostomic denture wearers. MATERIALS AND METHODS The Department of Prosthodontics, Crown Bridge, and Implantology, Patna Dental College and Hospital, Patna, Bihar carried out this in vitro study in 60 complete denture wearers of both genders. Approval was obtained from the institutional ethics committee. All participants in the study were informed about outcome of the study and consent was obtained in written form. Data pertaining to each patient were recorded, such as name and age. A thorough oral examination was performed in all patients. History of symptoms, severity, and duration of xerostomia were recorded. For assessment of salivary flow, pre-weighed wide-mouth centrifuge tubes were used to collect resting saliva and stimulated saliva. Patients were split into two groups consisting of 30 patients each. Pilocarpine was given to patients in group I and patients in group II received bethanechol. Salivary flow was measured at baseline, after 2 weeks, and after 4 weeks. Statistical analysis The result thus obtained was entered in MS Excel sheet. The data were evaluated using SPSS, version 21.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL). Salivary flow was measured by paired t test, and results were considered statistically significant when P value was less than 0.05. RESULTS In group I, 20 male and 10 female patients were included [Table 1]. In group II, there were 16 male and 14 female patients. Patients in group I were given pilocarpine and patients in group II received bethanechol. Table 2 shows that mean whole resting saliva (WRS) in patients of group I was 0.61 mg/mL and in group II it was 0.65 mg/mL. The mean whole stimulated saliva (WSS) in patients of group I was 1.35 mg/mL, and in group II it was 1.51 mg/mL. Paired t test showed nonsignificant difference in both groups (P > 0.05). Graph 1 shows that mean WRS after 2 weeks in patients of group I was 0.83 mg/mL, and in group II it was 0.92 mg/mL. WSS in patients of group I was 1.67 mg/mL, and in patients of group II it was 1.86 mg/mL. The obtained difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Graph 2 shows that mean WRS after 4 weeks in patients of group I was 1.23 mg/mL, and in group II it was 1.43 mg/mL. WSS in patients of group I was 1.98 mg/mL, and in patients of group II it was 2.04 mg/mL. The difference was statistically significant as P value was less than 0.05.Table 1: Distribution of patientsTable 2: Assessment of salivary flow at baseline in both groupsGraph 1. Assessment of salivary flow after 2 weeks in both groupsGraph 2. Assessment of salivary flow after 4 weeks in both groupsDISCUSSION Xerostomia presents as a local symptom and is characterized by decreased salivary flow from salivary glands. Systemic diseases such as diabetes, Sjogren's syndrome, and alcoholism may cause this condition. It may result from various medications.[6] Radiation therapy for malignancies of head and neck can also affect salivary glands, resulting in decreased salivary outflow in these patients. Most often dry mouth is a regular complaint in edentulous patients with xerostomia associated with other issues such as difficulty in normal functions such as speaking, eating, and swallowing. Denture wearers commonly complain of discomfort for which they seek frequent intervention.[7] The management of xerostomia depends on the etiological factors. If it is induced by some medication, alteration of dose and drug is mandatory. Some cases need symptomatic treatment such as changes in dietary pattern, sipping water frequently, and administering of artificial salivary substitutes.[8] This study was conducted to assess the efficacy of pilocarpine and bethanechol in xerostomic denture wearers. In this study, there were 60 denture wearers of both genders. All were diagnosed of xerostomia. Patients were split into two groups comprising 30 patients in each group. Patients in group I were given pilocarpine and patients in group II received bethanechol. In group I, there were 20 male and 10 female patients and in group II, there were 16 male and 14 female patients. Muralidharan et al.[9] conducted a study on xerostomic edentulous denture wearers to assess the role of pilocarpine and bethanechol as useful saliva substitutes. Thirty xerostomic complete denture patients were reported to the clinic. Collection of WRS and WSS was performed in a test tube for 2 min following which the sialagogue drug is administered for 2–3 weeks' course. There was significant increase in mean salivary production of both the drugs, which are pilocarpine and bethanechol, respectively, during the first week. On crossover, pilocarpine was found to be more efficient than bethanechol with respect to both WRS and WSS, respectively. We found that mean WRS in patients of group I was 0.61 mg/mL, and in that of group II was 0.65 mg/mL. The mean WSS in patients of group I was 1.35 mg/mL and in group II was 1.51 mg/mL. There was significant increase in mean WRS after 2 weeks in both groups. It was 0.83 mg/mL in patients of group I and 0.92 mg/mL in patients of group II. WSS in patients of group I was 1.67 mg/mL and in patients of group II it was 1.86 mg/mL. The clinical efficacy of sialogogues and their adverse effects were evaluated by Chainani et al.,[10] who studied the role of pilocarpine, bethanechol, and cevimeline in patients with xerostomia. Measurement of WSS and unstimulated saliva was conducted in all the patients who showed increased salivary flow and decreased symptoms. Increase in stimulated saliva to a greater extent was seen by the use of bethanechol over pilocarpine. Patients experienced increased sweating, which was frequently seen with pilocarpine and not with bethanechol or cevimeline. Hence, authors concluded that sialogogues treatment in intermittent manner as an alternative to treatment with sialogogues in continuous manner. We found that mean WRS after 4 weeks in patients of group I was 1.23 mg/mL and in group II was 1.43 mg/mL. WSS in patients of group I was 1.98 mg/mL and in patients of group II was 2.04 mg/mL. Saliva is essential for retention of the complete denture thereby ensuring patient's comfort. The chances of cases of denture stomatitis increases if there are symptoms of xerostomia.[11] Other common ailments seen in these patients are oral ulcers, which are due to the excessive force applied by the complete dentures over the denture-bearing mucosa. Therefore, saliva secretion should not be affected in denture wearers.[12] Both pilocarpine and bethanechol are effective pharmacological agents in increasing the salivary production in patients with xerostomia. The limitation of the study is that sample size selected is quite small and needs to be ascertained in larger one. CONCLUSION Authors found that both agents were effective in increasing salivary secretions. However, pilocarpine is a more effective sialagogue as compared to bethanechol in completely edentulous patients with xerostomia. Management of xerostomia is important to ensure success of complete denture in edentulous patients. Financial support and sponsorship Nil. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.",

Despite its availability, the drug is banned for human consumption as it is toxic and can have fatal consequences. We present the case of a 23-year-old man who regularly consumed 2,4-dinitrophenol to generate fat loss without apparent ill effect. He was involved in a high-speed road traffic collision and sustained limb-threatening injuries. The combination of emergency surgery, trauma and 2,4-dinitrophenol consumption culminated in deterioration under anaesthesia, with subsequent death from multiorgan failure in the intensive care unit 48 h later. Previous cases have reported death from 2,4-dinitrophenol toxicity alone. We believe this is the first reported case of 2,4-dinitrophenol toxicity triggered by the additional physiological stress of polytrauma and emergency surgery.",

These vitamins (retinol, calciferol, pyridoxine) can be used safely at an RDA level but should only be administered at higher dosage under medical supervision to avoid dose escalation.",

      "title": "[Diet and drugs in the therapy of nonorganic dyspepsia: the hypothesis and factual data].",
      "abstract": "Non-organic dyspepsia, although not frequently reported, is still a disorder which is difficult to classify in nosographic and physiopathological terms, a fact which inevitably influences the indications for its treatment. Non-pharmacological treatment of non-organic dyspepsia includes changes in dietary and behavioural habits which, even if established on empirical grounds, play a far from ancillary role. When considered appropriate, pharmacological treatment must be formulated solely on the basis of controlled clinical trials vs placebo given the well-known significance of the placebo effect in this and other so-called \"functional\" diseases. The therapeutic strategies which are most subject to verification are based on the one hand on the neutralisation or inhibition of gastric acid secretion and, on the other, on the improvement of gastrointestinal motility. Surprisingly, the widely used antacid drugs are among those which have been less well studied and show the lowest efficacy. Among the anti-secretory drugs, pirenzepine is approximately 25% more effective than placebo. H2-antagonists, the drugs which have been most closely studied both in terms of the number of trials and the size of the sample populations studied, produce contradictory results. However, a meta-analysis of the trials shows an overall 18% improvement in efficacy compared to placebo. The overall results of studies on prokinetic compounds are \"good\" in meta-analytical terms, with an improved efficacy of 50% compared to placebo. This is not necessarily due to the superiority of prokinetic compared to anti-secretory drugs and can be explained by the reduced placebo effect in trials using prokinetic drugs or a greater presence in the latter of dyspepsia which is physiopathologically correlated to motor discord. Among the future drugs still being studied, it is particularly worth mentioning fedotozine, a specific K opioid receptor agonist which appears to have provided extremely interesting results in preliminary studies. The role of barrier drugs, such as sucralfate and colloidal bismuth, continues to remain unclear and in particular the latter might be of increased use if evidence of a relationship between Helicobacter pylori and non-organic dyspepsia were reinforced; this relationship may in fact not exist in all dyspeptic patients but only in a subgroup. Lastly, the problem of the duration of pharmacological treatment still remains unsolved, as do the questions of whether longterm treatment should be conceived once acute symptoms have disappeared and whether it is possible to hypothesise differentiated pharmacological treatment depending on the clinical variants of functional dyspepsia which have been defined with greater attention over the course of the past decade.",

      "abstract": "“Bath salts” is a term often used to describe a number of novel psychoactive substances (NPS) including synthetic cathinones. The abuse of “bath salts”/synthetic cathinones has recently been observed in Kazakhstan. In the present paper, the case of “bath salts” use disorder in a 20-year-old woman is presented. Patient’s history of substance use met the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria of cathinones-induced disorder. The course of disease was observed for 2 months in the period of post-acute withdrawal in the frame of an inpatient withdrawal unit. During this time, recurrent episodes of craving characterized by heterogeneous severity and symptoms were observed. The emergence of delusional symptoms represented a clinical challenge for differential diagnosis. The case provides the opportunity to discuss the craving profiles possibly associated with the recreational use of cathinones «Соли для ванн» - понятие, относящееся к группе новых психоактивных веществ, включая синтетические катиноны.

There are many occasions, however, when the so-called antibiotics will not be helpful. Organisms become resistant to the effects of penicillin, and especially to streptomycin. These agents rapidly lose their potency when not kept under refrigeration, particularly when in solution. Some patients acquire hypersensitivity to penicillin or streptomycin. In any of these predicaments the substitution of one of the sulfonamide drugs might be beneficial.

      "abstract": "Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for the treatment of acute gout and inflammation. However, its use is limited due to side effects. Acemetacin is a prodrug of indomethacin that exhibits better gastric tolerability in preclinical and clinical trials. The aim of this study was to examine if the systemic administration of acemetacin involved the sequential participation of nitric oxide (NO) or K+ channel pathways to confer its antinociceptive effect, as compared to indomethacin. The antinociceptive effect of both drugs was studied with the formalin test. Equimolar doses of acemetacin or indomethacin were administered orally. The intraplantar administration of either L-NAME, glibenclamide, apamin or charybdotoxin plus indomethacin or acemetacin was studied using the formalin test and the anti-inflammatory and antihyperalgesic effects were measured. The antinociceptive effect of acemetacin or indomethacin was not significantly different when pretreatment with L-NAME, glibenclamide, apamin or charybdotoxin was done. The antihyperalgesic and antiinflammatory effects were also similar for both indomethacin and acemetacin. Our results suggest that the antinociceptive effect of indomethacin or acemetacin is not mediated by NO or K+ channel activation.",

It is rather recently that very active thrombolytic substances have been purified and made available for parenteral use in man. Although the therapeutic use of the thrombolytica is being widely explored it is still difficult to define the indications. The first indication seems to be acute arterial occlusions not older than 48 hours and located in—or more distal to the brachial or iliac artery. Acute occlusions of the deep veins of the legs, acute arterial emboli and lung infarct are other indications which are better defined than myocardial infarction and cerebral thromboembolism. Many questions remain unsettled, particularly concerning the route of administration (intravenous or intraarterial), dosage (priming dose or continuous perfusion) and associated medication (hydrocortison, phenylbutazone, chlortrimeton, heparin, coumarin...",

Bismuth salicylate, when injected intramuscularly, is such a drug, and is worth trying either at the onset of treatment or after other methods have failed.

The operation was always done through dilatation and curettage and lasted about 5-20 minutes. An important aspect of the association of the 2 drugs is that a lower dosage is required than other combinations, and peaks of hypertension and of tachycardia during narcosis are almost eliminated. More importantly, flunitrazepam, thanks to its relaxing action on the muscles, depressive action on the autonomous nervous system, and anticonvulsant action, completely eliminates, at waking, the undesirable side effects usually associated with ketamine, i.e. psychological disturbances, hallucinations, anxiety, and sudden and uncontrollable movements of the limbs. At waking, patients immediately respond to easy verbal commands, and are able to return to a completely conscious state without any trauma. The total absence of postanesthetic side effects permits the rapid discharge of patients.",

Fosphenytoin, a new phenytoin prodrug, can be safely administered through the IM route, and, because of the physical characteristics of its formulation, it offers advantages over phenytoin for IV administration. Clinical studies with IV and IM fosphenytoin demonstrate that the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of this drug are similar in 5- to 18-year-old children and in young adults.

      "title": "Mirtazapine: A One-Stop Strategy for Treatment of Opioid Withdrawal Symptoms",
      "abstract": "Public health efforts to reduce the opioid overdose epidemic and treat opioid use disorder (OUD) have met with challenges associated with current non-standardized approaches to managing opioid withdrawal symptoms, such as itching, jitteriness, anxiety, depression, craving, vomiting, diarrhea, insomnia, and anorexia. These symptoms pose substantial obstacles to the safe initiation of medications for OUD, maintenance of long-term sobriety, and prevention of relapse. In clinical practice, multiple medications (polypharmacy) are prescribed to manage these withdrawal symptoms, including ondansetron and promethazine for vomiting and nausea, loperamide and Lomotil for diarrhea, hydroxyzine and doxepin for pruritus, benzodiazepines, the Z-drugs, and melatonin for insomnia, and benzos, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and various serotonergic agents for anxiety. This polypharmacy is associated with an increased risk of adverse drug-drug interactions and adverse drug events, increased medical costs, and increased odds of medication non-adherence and relapse. We propose an alternative single medication, mirtazapine, a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic receptor antagonist, that can be used for myriad symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Case series, clinical studies, and clinical trials have shown mirtazapine to be effective for treating nausea and vomiting resulting from multiple etiologies, including hyperemesis gravidarum and chemotherapy-induced emesis. Other evidence supports the salutary effects of mirtazapine on itching and craving. Research findings support mirtazapine’s beneficial effects on diarrhea and anxiety, a consequence of its modulating effects on serotonergic receptors mediating mood and gastrointestinal symptoms. There is also evidence supporting its efficacy as a potent and non-addictive sleep aid, which presents itself as a solution for insomnia associated with opioid withdrawal. The current review presents evidence from extant literature supporting mirtazapine as a one-drug strategy to treat the variety of symptoms of opioid withdrawal. This one-drug strategy has much potential to decrease polypharmacy, adverse drug events, relapse, and healthcare cost and increase the likelihood of prolonged sobriety and better quality of life for people living with OUD.",

      "title": "Nandrolone Decanoate: Use, Abuse and Side Effects",
      "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Androgens play a significant role in the development of male reproductive organs. The clinical use of synthetic testosterone derivatives, such as nandrolone, is focused on maximizing the anabolic effects and minimizing the androgenic ones. Class II anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS), including nandrolone, are rapidly becoming a widespread group of drugs used both clinically and illicitly. The illicit use of AAS is diffused among adolescent and bodybuilders because of their anabolic proprieties and their capacity to increase tolerance to exercise. This systematic review aims to focus on side effects related to illicit AAS abuse, evaluating the scientific literature in order to underline the most frequent side effects on AAS abusers’ bodies. Materials and Methods: A systematic review of the scientific literature was performed using the PubMed database and the keywords “nandrolone decanoate”. The inclusion criteria for articles or abstracts were English language and the presence of the following words: “abuse” or “adverse effects”. After applying the exclusion and inclusion criteria, from a total of 766 articles, only 148 were considered eligible for the study. Results: The most reported adverse effects (found in more than 5% of the studies) were endocrine effects (18 studies, 42%), such as virilization, gynecomastia, hormonal disorders, dyslipidemia, genital alterations, and infertility; cardiovascular dysfunctions (six studies, 14%) such as vascular damage, coagulation disorders, and arteriosus hypertension; skin disorders (five studies, 12%) such as pricking, acne, and skin spots; psychiatric and mood disorders (four studies, 9%) such as aggressiveness, sleep disorders and anxiety; musculoskeletal disorders (two studies, 5%), excretory disorders (two studies, 5%), and gastrointestinal disorders (two studies, 5%). Conclusions: Based on the result of our study, the most common adverse effects secondary to the abuse of nandrolone decanoate (ND) involve the endocrine, cardiovascular, skin, and psychiatric systems. These data could prove useful to healthcare professionals in both sports and clinical settings.",

The detailed mechanism of action differs from that of cocaine, but the overall stimulant effect of methamphetamine is similar. Methamphetamine effects, however, persist for hours, whereas cocaine effects are over in minutes. Ice is, therefore, just another agent for abuse by those seeking psychostimulation and, as with cocaine, compulsive abusers of amphetamines consume the drug repeatedly and continuously.

Cromolyn inhibits the degranulation of sensitized mast cells that occurs after exposure to specific antigens, and inhibits the release of histamine and SRS-A. The manufacturers of cromolyn, and investigators, advise a starting dose of 20 mg (one capsule) four times a day by inhalation, for children 5 years old and over.<sup>1</sup>The manufacturers' brochures state that \"the dose for adults and children 5 and over is the contents of one Aarane capsule inhaled four times daily at regular intervals....\" Dykes<sup>2</sup>specifies the minimum dosage that is found effective. For this reason, the following case illustrates an important point. <h3>Report of a Case.—</h3> A 5-year-old white boy gave a three-year history of asthma, and had been wheezing almost daily for two years.

      "abstract": "Sildenafil citrate (Viagra) is the first effective, orally administered agent for the management of erectile dysfunction (ED). It is a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the predominant isoform found in human corporal smooth muscle. Sexual stimulation releases, in the penis, the neurotransmitter nitric oxide, which in turn increases cyclic GMP (cGMP) within the smooth muscle cell. Cyclic GMP produces penile smooth muscle relaxation, which increases blood inflow and entrapment within the penis. The inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil increases the duration and activity of cGMP and thus amplifies the effect of sexual stimulation. Sildenafil has demonstrated significant efficacy (57-83%) regardless of the etiology (organic, psychogenic, mixed), age, or baseline severity of the ED. The adverse events related to sildenafil include headaches, flushing, dyspepsia, and nasal stuffiness. In over 50 million patient administrations in the field since FDA approval, sildenafil has maintained this safety and efficacy profile. It has dramatically impacted the field of sexual health care, not only medically but also societally and economically.",

      "title": "Metrizamide: a review with emphasis on drug interactions.",
      "abstract": "The pharmacology, side effects, and possible drug interactions of metrizamide, a water-solulbe contrast medium for myelography, are reviewed. Metrizamide concentration in the brain reaches maximal levels two to six hour after lumbar injection, depending on dose and patient positioning, and is largely (55-96%) excreted from the body after 24 hours. Its lower neurotoxicity, compared with other water-soluble contrast agents, can be attributed in part to its undissociated, non-ionic nature. Common side effects, which include headache, nausea, and vomiting, occur to the same degree as with other myelographic contrast media. Reported data suggest that convulsions, which have occurred in a very small percentage of patients, are related to the amount of contrast medium reaching the brain which, in turn, is largely a factor of dose and examination technique. Although the risk of seizures is small, it is recommended that drugs that lower the seizure threshold (phenothiazine derivatives, butyrophenones, tricyclic antidepressants, and MAO-inhibitors) should be avoided 48 hours before metrizamide administration (if possible), should not be used to control nausea, and should not be resumed for 24 to 48 hours after the myelographic procedure. The value of premedication (e.g., with diazepam) to prevent seizures has not been established and is not recommended.",

We conducted a review of the literature, based on our in-house methodology, to determine the risk-benefits of treatments used in this setting. (2) Placebo-controlled trials show that sodium cromoglicate relieves symptoms, especially if it is used before symptoms appear. Adverse effects are rare with sodium cromoglicate nasal solutions and eye drops. (3) Nasal steroids have well-documented efficacy. Beclometasone is the best choice. Adverse effects include epistaxis, nasal irritation and, occasionally, systemic disorders. (4) Oral antihistamines are less effective than nasal steroids. They also provoke adverse effects, especially drowsiness. Nasal azelastine seems to have a similar efficacy as oral antihistamines. (5) The adverse effects of systemic steroids must not be overlooked, especially with long-term use. Oral administration is an alternative for severe symptoms that do not respond to other treatments, although this is rarely the case. Long-acting intramuscular steroids carry an increased risk of adverse effects. (6) Despite evaluation in several randomised controlled trials, there is no firm evidence that homeopathic preparations have any specific efficacy in allergic rhinitis. (7) Vasoconstrictors, ipratropium and montelukast, have negative risk-benefit balances in hay fever. (8) When a single allergen is responsible (grasses, ragweed, birch), clinical trials suggest that specific desensitisation can provide a modest improvement. However, this treatment carries a risk of local adverse effects, as well as a risk of rare but severe anaphylactic reactions, especially in patients who also have unstable severe asthma. (9) Sublingual desensitisation seems to be even less effective than subcutaneous desensitisation in adults. Follow-up is too short to know whether there is a risk of severe anaphylactic reactions. The results of paediatric studies are even less convincing. (10) In practice, when drug therapy is needed to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis, sodium cromoglicate is the first-line treatment. If a nasal steroid solution is chosen, it should be used for the shortest possible period.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Over the past four decades, there have been dramatic improvements in survival for patients with thalassemia major due in large measure to improved iron chelators. Two chelators are approved for use in the United States and Canada, parenteral deferoxamine and oral deferasirox. Three are available in much of the rest of the world, where oral deferiprone is also approved (in the United States, deferiprone is only available in studies, for emergency use, or on a “compassionate-use” basis). Many trials and worldwide clinical experience demonstrate that each of the three drugs can chelate and remove iron, and thereby prevent or improve transfusional hemosiderosis in thalassemia patients. However, the chelators differ strikingly in side-effect profile, cost, tolerability and ease of adherence, and (to some degree) efficacy for any specific patient. The entire field of chelator clinical trials suffers from the fact that each drug (as monotherapy or in combination) has not been tested directly against all of the other possibilities. Acknowledging the challenges of assessing chelators with diverse properties and imperfect comparative data, the purpose of this review is to summarize the last 4 years of studies that have improved our understanding of the applications and limitations of iron chelators in various settings for thalassemia patients, and to point out areas for much-needed future research.",

Some steroids have been taken orally. However, with the exception of various oestrogenic preparations and adrenal cortical steroids and such compounds as methyl testosterone or androstenediol and pregneninolone, oral application has resulted in significantly inefficient utilization. The ingested steroid is usually rapidly metabolized by the liver or excreted, poorly absorbed, via the intestines, so that it is only 1/10 or 1/30 as active as when given parenterally (Miescher & Tschopp, 1938; Emmens, 1939; Emmens & Parkes, 1939; Foss, 1939). Nevertheless, to maintain a prolonged and continuous physiological effect, repeated oral administration is necessary. In an attempt to formulate a preparation exhibiting greater duration of action, Butenandt (1931) and, subsequently, other investigators demonstrated that esterification of free oestrogen with fatty acids would prolong markedly the action of parenteral",

      "title": "The 5% Lidocaine-Medicated Plaster: Its Inclusion in International Treatment Guidelines for Treating Localized Neuropathic Pain, and Clinical Evidence Supporting its Use",
      "abstract": "When peripheral neuropathic pain affects a specific, clearly demarcated area of the body, it may be described as localized neuropathic pain (LNP). Examples include postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy, as well as post-surgical and post-traumatic pain. These conditions may respond to topical treatment, i.e., pharmaceutical agents acting locally on the peripheral nervous system, and the topical route offers advantages over systemic administration. Notably, only a small fraction of the dose reaches the systemic circulation, thereby reducing the risk of systemic adverse effects, drug–drug interactions and overdose. From the patient's perspective, the analgesic agent is easily applied to the most painful area(s). The 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster has been used for several years to treat LNP and is registered in approximately 50 countries. Many clinical guidelines recommend this treatment modality as a first-line option for treating LNP, particularly in frail and/or elderly patients and those receiving multiple medications, because the benefit-to-risk ratios are far better than those of systemic analgesics. However, some guidelines make only a weak recommendation for its use. This paper considers the positioning of the 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster in international treatment guidelines and how they may be influenced by the specific criteria used in developing them, such as the methodology employed by randomized, placebo-controlled trials. It then examines the body of evidence supporting use of the plaster in some prevalent LNP conditions. Common themes that emerge from clinical studies are: (1) the excellent tolerability and safety of the plaster, which can increase patients' adherence to treatment, (2) continued efficacy over long-term treatment, and (3) significant reduction in the size of the painful area. On this basis, it is felt that the 5% lidocaine-medicated plaster should be more strongly recommended for treating LNP, either as one component of a multimodal approach or as monotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Docetaxel is a semisynthetic taxane indicated for the treatment of advanced breast, prostate, and non-small cell lung cancers; it is also used for the treatment of various other solid tumors. The standard intermittent dosage of docetaxel is 60-100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. At this dose and schedule, myelosuppression is common and neutropenia is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. Weekly administration of docetaxel 20-42 mg/m2 is being tested in the treatment of advanced solid tumors in order to improve patient tolerance by reducing the interval dose and to maintain therapeutic efficacy by increasing overall dose intensity. Asthenia and peripheral neuropathy can limit continued administration of weekly docetaxel. Epiphora (excess tearing due to narrowing or blockage of the lacrimal outflow passages) is associated with repeated weekly administration of docetaxel. This adverse effect can interfere with activities of daily life and negatively affect quality of life. Epiphora may be an underreported adverse effect of treatment because of underrecognition by clinicians and patient embarrassment with respect to seemingly uncontrolled tearing. The use of weekly docetaxel administration is expanding; therefore, patients should be educated to recognize and report signs and symptoms of epiphora. It is important for clinicians participating in the care of patients undergoing treatment with docetaxel to monitor for excess tearing and signs of eye irritation to ensure timely management of treatment-related epiphora.",

In fact, diphenylhydantoin has been recommended for the treatment of a vast array of neurological disorders and neuropsychiatric symptoms (1). One of the hydantoins, Nirvanol® (5-ethyl-5-phenylhydantoin), was used in the 1920s for the treatment of Sydenham's chorea, but they did not come into widespread clinical use until the late 1930s, when Merritt and Putnam introduced diphenylhydantoin as an anticonvulsant.

Each single suppository is clearly marked with both the batch number and the expiry date. Goldshield's Econac™ suppositories, however, are individually embossed on the reverse with either the batch number, the expiry date or the words ‘USE BY’ (Fig. 8). As these suppositories are routinely used singly, this could leave the two remaining suppositories with no indication as to their expiry date and therefore whether they are safe to administer. VoltarolTM suppository. Lot number, ‘USE BY’ text, and use by date embossed on individual EconacTM suppositories. In our current economic climate, enormous pressures are continuously being exerted to reduce healthcare costs. Significant savings are often expected by adopting generic drugs from cheaper manufacturers rather than continuing with the main one. However, the money likely to be saved could, as in this case, result in up to two-thirds of the product being unusable and wasted. More worryingly, the need to cut costs can compromise safe drug use and patient safety. We have taken a note of the contents of the letter and would like to convey our sincere appreciation to Dr Kitsberg and Dr Belavadi for their feedback and constructive suggestion regarding Econac (diclofenac) suppositories. We would like to assure the doctors that from the subsequent manufacturing cycle (2004) we will incorporate their very valid suggestion by including batch and expiry details on the reverse pack of every suppository.

      "title": "The science and art of treating acne in adolescence",
      "abstract": "QUESTIONS: A 16-year-old adolescent boy is in the office for a physical examination before participating in a sports program. He would also like his acne treated (see figure 1). What type of acne does this patient have and how would you approach his treatment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA 14-year-old boy is in the office for acne treatment (see figure 2). He reports having used an over-the-counter preparation containing benzyl peroxide without any success. What type of acne does this patient have and what agents would you use to treat his acne?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANSWERS: It is important to classify the types of lesion in order to choose the most effective therapy.\r\n\r\nThe 16-year-old boy has comedonal or obstructive acne (figure 1). Open and closed comedones are visible but there is no evidence of inflammatory lesions. The pathophysiologic mechanism here is the obstruction of the sebaceous follicle by increased turnover and cohesiveness of the cells that line the follicle. The most effective treatment involves using comedolytic agents, such as retinoid or azelaic acid (see box), which can reduce the increased turnover and cohesiveness of the follicular epithelium and stop acne production.\r\n\r\nExplain to the adolescent that this treatment will not work overnight and, in fact, the acne may worsen for 2 weeks before it gets better. If the patient understands this explanation and trusts in the care provided, he may succeed in getting the long-term benefits of the topical retinoid (tretinoin [Retin-A] or adapalene [Differin]). If use of a single agent does not lead to a good response, coupling the use of a retinoid with benzoyl peroxide or with azelaic acid can have a synergistic effect.\r\n\r\nThe 14-year-old boy has inflammatory acne (figure 2). In addition to comedones, he also has papules, pustules, and nodules. These lesions are produced by the proliferation of Propionibacterium acnes, which produces free fatty acids that irritate the distended follicular wall. The follicle wall is disrupted and the extrusion of Propionibacterium acnes, hair, and cells into the dermis induces the inflammatory response and leads to the development of inflammatory lesions.\r\n\r\nEffective treatment requires killing the Propionibacterium acnes microorganisms as well as reducing the comedonal obstructions. This boy's acne is moderately severe and has not responded to a single topical agent. Therefore, it is reasonable to prescribe an oral antibiotic to reduce the overgrowth of Propionibacterium acnes. Oral antibiotics for acne include tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, and erythromycin. Benzamycin, a topical gel that contains benzoyl peroxide and erythromycin, was prescribed. When this therapy did not work adequately, a topical retinoid was added to his treatment regimen. If these medications do not produce adequate results within 6 months, the patient may be a candidate for isotretinoin (Accutane) therapy.\r\n\r\nA 17-year-old girl who is using a topical retinoid in the evening and taking doxycycline orally in the morning to treat acne has erythema across her cheeks from a day at the beach (figure 3). Increased sun sensitivity is a common reaction to both doxycycline and topical retinoids. Because adolescents often spend time in the sun and may not use protective sunscreens and clothing, it is essential to discuss this reaction and be prepared to modify their therapy if needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther therapeutic options available for this adolescent include changing the oral antibiotic to erythromycin or minocycline, which are not associated with sun sensitivity, or changing the topical medication to Benzamycin. Because the patient's underlying acne is inflammatory, it needs to be treated with some maintenance medication that is bacteriocidal. Another treatment option is the birth control pill; it is useful for adolescent girls that are sexually active and have acne. The birth control pill can improve acne by reducing sebum production (see p 166).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcne therapy by severity*\r\n\r\nObstructive or comedonal acne - mild\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTretinoin or adapalene (Retin-A or Differin) azelaic acid (Azelex)\r\n\r\n\r\nBenzoyl peroxide\r\n\r\n\r\nNo place for oral antibiotics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMild papulopustular acne\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTopical antibiotics and benzoyl peroxide (Benzamycin)\r\n\r\n\r\nMay add oral antibiotics if topical agents are not effective\r\n\r\n\r\nTretinoin or adapalene (Retin-A or Differin)\r\n\r\n\r\nAzelaic acid (Azelex)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nModerate papulopustular acne\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay start with topical antibiotic, benzoyl peroxide, and oral antibiotic\r\n\r\n\r\nOral antibiotics are often essential at this stage\r\n\r\n\r\nTretinoin or adapalene (Retin-A or Differin)\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider stopping oral antibiotics when topical agents are working well\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider birth control pills in females\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider isotretinoin (Accutane), if other therapies are not working in 6 months\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSevere nodular or nodulocystic or scarring acne\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMay try combinations of agents above\r\n\r\n\r\nIsotretinoin (Accutane)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdapted from Usatine R, Quan M, Strick R.\r\n\r\nAcne—a treatment update.

It is helpful to explain the pathogenesis of acne and the rationale behind its treatment so adolescents can feel like active participants in their care.",

It induces light sleep 1/2 to 2 min after injection, and anterograde amnesia. It has minimal hemodynamic and respiratory effects. We administered midazolam by intravenous injection in a dose of 3-7 mg to 100 patients about to undergo esophago-, gastro-, or duodenoscopy. The patient became quiet and relaxed, falling into a light sleep but remaining capable of following simple instructions. After completion of the endoscopy, the patients were half awake, and listened attentively to the report. They subsequently usually slept for 1-2 h, afterwards remembering nothing of the procedure. Two (at most, 3) hours after injection, the patients were again completely awake and able to go home or back to work. In some cases, concentration was slightly impaired for the rest of the day. Compared with other premedications , midazolam is better suited for use in endoscopy, owing to its rapid onset and short duration of action.",

The effectiveness of this drug in the treatment of depression was initially described by Kuhn,<sup>1</sup>and later confirmed by others.<sup>2-3</sup>The mechanism of action of the drug has not been established, but structurally it is similar to drugs with a phenothiazine base. During the treatment of several mildly diabetic patients who were also depressed, we observed a diminution of glycosuria concomitant with the administration of imipramine, with a return to premedication levels of glycosuria when use of the imipramine was discontinued. We have now noted this effect in 5 subjects, 4 of whom were depressed, while the 5th was not. These clinical observations seemed sufficiently important to warrant further study, especially since it is only in the past",

      "abstract": "SummaryFumagillin, a new antibiotic, was tried in daily doses varying from 60–200 mg. in the treatment of acute amebic dysentery. The course was given usually for a period of 8–10 days. In the maximum daily dose of 200 mg., the drug was found effective in the symptomatic cure of the disease, while the Entamoeba usually disappeared from the stools 3–6 days after the start of treatment. Doses smaller than 100–150 mg. daily were inefficient.Fumagillin was found however less effective than oxytetracycline or chlortetracycline, while the relapse rate after treatment was higher. Fumidil®, another drug of the same structure as fumagillin, was found more effective than fumagillin even when given in smaller doses. A dose of 60 mg. daily for a 10 day course was almost equal to 200 mg. daily dose of fumagillin given for a similar period. It is probable that Fumidil as used in this work was found more potent than fumagillin because the latter lost its potency by storage before use. Refrigeration is required to retain potency.Side effects after both drugs are uncommon but include skin rashes and dermatitis, possibly of allergic origin.Neomycin, another antibiotic, was found ineffective in the treatment of acute amebiasis when used in a daily dose of 4 grams for a period of 6 days. Its addition to fumagillin proved slightly better than either drug used alone.The trial of a combination of fumagillin with oxytetracycline was found more promising and will be continued.",

While oral treatments are often used first-line to treat nail infections, these systemic antifungals are not appropriate for all patients, and no oral treatments are approved for use in children in the USA. Given this need, topical antifungals were developed, which can be used as monotherapy or in combination with oral drugs.Efinaconazole 10% solution is an azole antifungal indicated for topical treatment of toenail onychomycosis in pediatric and adult patients. This qualitative literature review summarizes available chemical, pharmacological, efficacy, safety, and post-marketing surveillance data of efinaconazole 10% topical solution. Efinaconazole 10% has been shown to be safe and efficacious regardless of disease severity/duration at baseline; patient gender, ethnicity, or age (including pediatrics); or comorbidities such as diabetes or tinea pedis. Overall, efinaconazole is a safe and effective clinical option for the treatment and management of onychomycosis.Efinaconazole is the first new antifungal approved for onychomycosis in 10 years in the USA. It has comparable efficacy to systemic antifungal agents such as itraconazole, and a favorable adverse events profile with minimal systemic exposure and no drug-drug interactions.",

After oral administration, lacosamide is rapidly and completely absorbed. An elimination half-life of 13 hours allows for twice-daily dosing. Lacosamide has a low potential for drug-drug interactions. Both oral and intravenous formulations of lacosamide are being developed. In completed placebo-controlled clinical trials, lacosamide has demonstrated efficacy as adjunctive therapy for reduction of seizure frequency in patients with uncontrolled partial-onset seizures, and has been generally well tolerated. For patients treated with lacosamide, the most frequently reported adverse events in placebo-controlled trials include dizziness, headache, nausea and diplopia. When used as short-term replacement for oral lacosamide, intravenous lacosamide has a comparable safety profile to oral lacosamide. Results from clinical trials to date suggest that lacosamide may be a useful pharmacological treatment option for patients with partial-onset seizures.",

      "title": "Lorcaserin, phentermine topiramate combination, and naltrexone bupropion combination for weight loss: the 15-min challenge to sort these agents out",
      "abstract": "Obesity is a substantial and increasing contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide. Somatic and psychiatric complications allied to obesity are common. Diet, lifestyle and psychological interventions are recommended treatments, but often fail. Consequently medication interventions, and increasingly bariatric surgery, are viewed as supplementary mechanisms to manage the problem 1. Numerous pharmaceutical interventions have been devised to treat obesity 2. However, the history of orexigenic drugs has been plagued with problems. A bevy of weight loss drugs have exited the marketplace because of safety concerns – usually as a result of cardiovascular and/or psychiatric adverse events – and include fenfluramine phentermine combination (‘fen-phen’), rimonabant, and sibutramine 3. Replacing them are three new prescription agents available for oral administration for long-term use: lorcaserin 4, phentermine topiramate combination 5, and naltrexone bupropion combination 6. Are they effective? Are they safe? Let's take the 15-min challenge to sort some of these issues out. Step 1. Obtain the prescribing information from the web 4-6. Construct a table of pertinent information regarding indications, contraindications, bolded boxed warnings, dosage recommendations, drug interactions, and most commonly encountered adverse effects (incidence ≥ 5%) (Table 1). Although all of the interventions have essentially the same indication (adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic weight management in adults), they differ in mechanism of action, and for the combination medication products, represent the re-purposing of agents that have already been available for quite some time. Two of the products are classified as Category IV by the US Drug Enforcement Agency because of a potential of abuse, however, naltrexone bupropion combination is not (other examples of Category IV medications include benzodiazepines). All three products are contraindicated in pregnant women. The combination products have longer lists of additional contraindications, and naltrexone bupropion combination has an additional bolded boxed warning regarding suicidality (a warning that is found in the product labels of all agents that have been approved as antidepressants). Lorcaserin does not require titration but is taken twice daily. Phentermine and topiramate combination is taken once daily but requires titration. Naltrexone and bupropion combination requires both titration and twice daily dosing. Drug interactions can occur with any of these agents, with a longer list present for the combination products, especially for naltrexone bupropion combination. All of the agents have their own distinct adverse event profile. Step 2. Extract the efficacy information regarding the achievement of a ≥ 5% or 10% reduction from baseline body weight and calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) vs. placebo (Table 2). The most robust effect sizes are observed with phentermine topiramate combination, with the 95% confidence intervals of the NNT free of any overlap with those for the other products. Step 3. Extract the safety and tolerability information regarding the proportion of patients who discontinued the clinical trial(s) because of an adverse event and calculate the number needed to harm (NNH) vs. placebo. Do the same for the incidence of the most common adverse event (Table 3). Lorcaserin appears to be the best tolerated based on the NNH vs. placebo for patients discontinuing because of an adverse event, and in terms of the NNH for the adverse event most commonly observed with that agent (headache). Step 4. Compare and contrast. The concept of likelihood to be helped or harmed (LHH) can be helpful here, provided that you select a relevant harm to contrast with the anticipated benefit 7. Table 4 provides the NNT for response, NNH for discontinuation because of an adverse event, and the resultant LHH. Lorcaserin is almost 11 times more likely to result in ≥ 5% weight loss than a discontinuation because of an adverse event. LHH for these outcomes for phentermine and topiramate combination is 6, and for naltrexone and bupropion combination, almost 2. LHH values are lower (less favourable) when the bar for weight loss rises to a 10% threshold. LHH values are also lower when the calculation is made using the NNH for the most commonly encountered adverse event (Table 5). For naltrexone and bupropion combination the LHH in this instance is less than 1. Thus, one would expect to encounter the adverse event (nausea) more often than weight loss. However, this does not necessarily eliminate naltrexone and bupropion combination from further consideration if the nausea is mild, temporary, and easily managed. There are several important caveats. The data presented are from carefully conducted registration trials that enrolled subjects who fulfilled restrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria. Such patients may differ from persons encountered in routine clinical practice. Thus pragmatic clinical trials that are more generalizable will help place these weight loss agents into clinical perspective for their use in the ‘real world’. In addition, the data presented are regarding the highest approved dose for each product. Not mentioned in this mini-review is orlistat 8, a reversible inhibitor of gastrointestinal lipases, also approved for obesity management with a similar indication as for the products discussed here, and available by prescription since 1999, and now also over-the counter in lower dose strengths. The threshold of a 5% reduction in body weight is arbitrary and just a start. To achieve desired reductions in blood pressure, plasma lipids, and improvements in insulin resistance, greater weight loss will likely be important. Prior to prescribing any of these agents, attention should be paid to potential drug–drug interactions that can impact on safety and tolerability. Adoption of healthier lifestyles that include regular exercise and more wholesome diets will also be necessary to optimise the management of obesity.

Glucocorticosteroids may be used systemically with different routes of administration (oral, i.m. and i.v.), in different doses and for different periods of time. The effectiveness of glucocorticosteroids in reducing inflammation in the short term has been shown for oral treatment in a dose of 7.5 mg prednisolone daily or more, for i.m. pulses (120 mg methylprednisolone every 4 weeks) and for i.v. methylprednisolone pulses. For longer periods of treatment, the evidence suggesting effectiveness of low-dose oral glucocorticosteroids is more limited. Some data suggest that different regimens of glucocorticosteroids may retard the development of erosions in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The toxicity of short-term treatment is relatively low. For long-term treatment, the development of osteoporosis is a serious problem. Concomitant therapy with either calcitriol or bisphosphonates may reduce this risk.",

      "title": "The Effects of Sildenafil Citrate on the Liver and Kidneys of Adult Wistar Rats (Rattus norvegicus) – A Histological Study",
      "abstract": "Sildenafil citrate is widely used as an effective and safe oral treatment for erectile dysfunction of various etiologies (Goldstein et al., 1998; Cheitlin et al., 1999; Benchekroun et al., 2003). It is a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 enzymes that acts to break down cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (Boolell et al., 1996). The medication amplifies the effect of sexual stimulation by retarding the degradation of this enzyme. Sildenafil has been found effective in several subpopulations of men with erectile dysfunction, including sufferers from diabetes (Basu and Ryder, 2004), hypertension (Feldman et al., 1999), spinal cord injuries (Hultling et al., 2000; Deforge et al., 2006), multiple sclerosis (Fowler et al., 2005), depression (Seidman et al., 2001; Rosen et al., 2004; Tignol et al., 2004; Fava et al., 2006), PTSD (Orr et al., 2006), and schizophrenia (Aviv et al., 2004; Gopalakrishnan et al., 2006), men after resection of the prostate or radical prostatectomy (Nandipati et al., 2006), after renal transplant (Sharma et al., 2006), men on dialysis (Dachille et al., 2006), and men aged 65 years and older (Wagner et al., 2001; Carson, 2004). Psychogenic erectile dysfunction (ED) patients are excellent candidates for sildenafil citrate therapy due to the intact neurovascular pathway. Nevertheless, the drug has been reported to be effective only in about 78% of patients with psychogenic ED (McMahon et al., 2000). It is likely that performance anxiety and sympathetic overtone are the cause of this unresponsiveness to sildenafil citrate during awakening, though data supporting this assumption are lacking (Rosen, 2001). The drug has been found to be effective and well tolerated in men with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction of no clinically identifiable organic cause (Eardley, 2001). With the presence of PDE5 in choroidal and retinal vessels sildenafil citrate increase choroidal blood flow and cause vasodilation of the retinal vasculature. The most common symptoms are a blue tinge to vision and an increased sensitivity to light (Kerr and DaneshMeyer, 2009). Adverse effects include headache, visual and retinal disturbances, dizziness and pupil-sparing third nerve palsy (Monastero et al., 2001). There have been reports of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy and serous macular detachment in users of PDE5 inhibitors; although a causal relationship has not been conclusively shown.

This standard application is no different for percutaneous absorption, and most absorption values are for single doses. There are few one-dose magic bullets in pharmaceutics. Therefore, it becomes important to view multiple topical dosing, especially if that is the standard procedure with which a topical drug is used or if such exposure occurs for a hazardous environmental chemical. In actual clinical use, the multidose regimen is probably the more widely practiced treatment. Two types of experimental designs have been tested. The one of a single daily dose over the course of a few weeks probably does not affect percutaneous absorption unless the skin is compromised by disease or if some key ingredient in the formulation is an absorption enhancer, such as Azone, and Azone seems to have only influenced the early part of the dosing period.",

Among NPS, Camfetamine has been rediscovered as recreational drug in 2011. Very little information is still available in the scientific literature on its nature and potential health risks.Data in scientific literature were integrated with a multilingual qualitative assessment of a range of online resources over the period of 32 months (May 2011-January 2014).N-Methyl-3-phenyl-norbornan-2-amine (Camfetamine) may act as an indirect dopaminergic agonist in the central nervous system and may have mild-moderate opioid activity too. There are no current epidemiological data about recreational use of Camfetamine; our research shows that it is indeed used especially by individuals with a history of recreational polydrug misuse. It facilitates mental alertness, induces relaxation, and, unlike many other stimulants, seems not to be associated with severe physical effects. Valid causes for concern issued in our research may be Camfetamine intravenous or intramuscular administration as well as its use in conjunction with other psychoactive substances.It is here highlighted that more large-scale studies need to be carried out to confirm and better describe both the extent of Camfetamine misuse and possible psychotropic/adverse effects.",

Data Sources: English language literature identified by PubMed search of terms including monoamine oxidase, phenelzine, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazide, selegiline, rasagiline, linezolid, methylene blue, serotonin syndrome, hypertensive crisis. Articles were selected primarily from the last 10 years of published journals with a selection of classical older articles. Exclusion criteria were not applied because of the interest in including case reports of drug interactions. Data Extraction: type, frequency, and severity of drug interactions. Results: Classical irreversible non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) (phenelzine, tranylcypromine, and isocarboxazid) have been minimally utilized due to fear of dietary and drug interactions. Moclobemide and transdermal selegiline offer greatly improved safety and comparable psychiatric efficacy, while non-psychiatric MAOIs such as linezolid, methylene blue, oral selegiline and rasagiline have similar potential drug interactions. The most hazardous MAOI drug interactions involve SSRI and SNRI antidepressants, meperidine, tramadol, dextromethorphan and sympathomimetics while the food interactions involve high tyramine aged fermented foods. Conclusions: Awareness of hazardous MAOI drug interactions is essential both in using these drugs for treatment of depression and in general medical consultation.

Milacemide is particularly effective in inhibiting the convulsions induced by bicuculline. The ED50 is 5.7 mg/kg by oral route and the activity lasts for more than 48 hr. It is less active against pentylenetetrazol and only marginally active against electroshock. It has not be found active against the other types of convulsions. Milacemide has a low toxicity (LD50: 2585 mg/kg in the mouse) and alters the behaviour of mouse, rat and monkey, only at high doses (greater than or equal to 1000 mg/kg). Milacemide seems to be specially free of sedative potential.",

      "abstract": "The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse reactions, drug interactions, and dosage of ranitidine are reviewed; specific comparisons are made of this new H2-receptor antagonist with the older agent, cimetidine. Ranitidine is a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion whose chemical structure lacks the imidazole group previously believed to be essential for H2-receptor blocking activity. The new agent does not bind substantially to the cytochrome P-450 mixed-function oxidase system and does not penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid appreciably. Peak serum ranitidine concentrations occur within one to two hours after oral administration; approximately 50% of an oral dose reaches systemic circulation. There are at least three metabolites of ranitidine, but substantial fractions of both i.v. and oral doses are recovered unchanged in the urine. Ranitidine's duration of action is 8-12 hours. Controlled clinical trials have shown ranitidine to be effective in the treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and prophylaxis against aspiration during anesthesia. Ranitidine has been effective in patients unresponsive to or intolerant of cimetidine. In clinical trials, the incidence of adverse effects from ranitidine has been low; certain rare but serious side effects that have been noted with cimetidine have not been associated with ranitidine therapy. There is no evidence thus far that certain drug-drug interactions observed with cimetidine therapy will occur with ranitidine. Oral adult daily doses of ranitidine are likely to be 300 mg given as the hydrochloride salt in two divided doses. Ranitidine is similar to cimetidine in efficacy but has an apparently safer adverse-effects profile. Ranitidine is likely to be the preferred agent in certain clinical situations.",

This literature review aimed to bring together in vivo studies and clinical trials related to the use of phenolic compounds, mainly tannins, flavonoids, and metabolites from the phenolic acid class to combat hair loss. The bibliographic search was carried out in the PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases, using keywords such as “flavonoids”, “tannins”, “phenolic acid” and “hair loss”. Regarding the clinical trials included, three types of study were used (randomized, double-blind, and placebo control). All the compounds evaluated were obtained from medicinal plants, three tannins and one flavonoid. The formulations evaluated were three hair tonics and one lotion, and phenolic compounds from procyanidin class were present in almost all articles (n=3). The use of these compounds was related to the reported potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, which favor the anagen phase of hair, reducing reactive oxygen species and inflammation of hair follicles. Therefore, more studies are needed to promote and discuss the use of phenolic compounds for hair loss, mainly through randomized clinical trials. To contribute to the research and development of new medicines, polyphenols have several benefits and have a similar action to conventional medicines.",

A potential problem with the increasing use of quinolone-type antibiotics for systemic illness is the chelation and inactivation of these compounds by several cations. One outcome of these potential interactions is a possible reduction in bioavailability and effectiveness of quinolone compounds.

We searched MEDLINE for English-language literature dating from 1966 to April 2001 using the following subject headings: (1) diabetes and botanical, herb, and supplement, (2) neuropathy and botanical, herb, and supplement, and (3) diabetic neuropathy and botanical, herb, and supplement. <i>Results:</i> Our search found agents that might improve symptoms of neuropathy (eg, evening primrose oil, alpha-lipoic acid, capsaicin) without affecting glucose control. Botanicals and dietary supplements involved in only one RCT or associated with little clinical benefit were reviewed in brief. <i>Conclusions:</i> Evening primrose oil, alpha-lipoic acid, and capsaicin have received the greatest attention for their use in diabetic neuropathy, but further studies are needed to confirm their efficacy. Patients using these products need to be informed of potential drug interactions and side effects.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter reviews the 26 antidepressant drugs currently available in Europe and/or the United States from the perspectives of their clinical efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, structure‐activity relationships, metabolism, and mechanisms of action. The older nonselective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (e.g., phenelzine, tranylcypromine) have largely been replaced by compounds that selectively inhibit monoamine oxidase A (e.g., moclobemide) or by inhibitors of norepinephrine/serotonin monoamine transporter reuptake mechanisms. The first generation of such drugs, the tricyclic antidepressants, suffered from a number of dangerous and unpleasant adverse side effects caused by their many other pharmacological actions on the heart and on cholinergic and other monoamine receptors in the brain. Most of the current generation of antidepressants are serotonin‐selective reuptake inhibitors, which possess a safer side‐effect profile. These drugs have gained widespread use in the treatment of depression and a number of related psychiatric conditions. Some agents that act as norepinephrine‐selective reuptake inhibitors (e.g., reboxetine) are also clinically effective and there is considerable overlap between noradrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms in the CNS. Monoamine selectivity can also be altered by the formation of active metabolites in vivo . All antidepressants require several weeks of treatment before the maximum clinical benefit is seen. This may be attributable to drug‐induced alterations in the expression of receptors in brain (e.g., downregulation of 5‐HT 1A receptors) and/or alterations in the expression of neurotrophic factors (e.g., brain derived neurotrophic factor). New approaches to future antidepressant drug discovery include antagonists for glutamate NMDA receptors, substance P NK1 receptors, or corticotrophin releasing factor receptors.",

      "abstract": "Many minor surgical and diagnostic procedures may only require an animal to remain calm and motionless under the influence of standing sedation or chemical restraint for a short period of time. Xylazine is frequently used alone or in combination with other drugs to produce standing sedation and chemical restraint. A combination of low doses of xylazine and ketamine can be used for chemical restraint. IV xylazine (0.05 mg/kg) and ketamine (0.2-0.4 mg/kg) or IM xylazine (0.0250.05 mg/kg) and ketamine (2 mg/kg) produce chemical restraint with recumbency in combative or unruly ruminants. A mixture of Telazol (500 mg), ketamine (250 mg, 2.5 ml), and xylazine (250 mg, 2.5 ml) is developed to produce chemical restraint and anesthesia in pigs. Azaperone is the tranquilizer approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in swine. In general, ruminants and camelids have a tendency to assume sternal recumbency when they are sedated.",

      "title": "Single dose oral dexamethasone versus multi-dose prednisolone in the treatment of acute exacerbations of asthma in children who attend the emergency department: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Asthma is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality. In acute exacerbations of asthma, corticosteroids reduce relapses, subsequent hospital admission and the need for ß 2 -agonist therapy. Prednisolone is relatively short-acting with a half-life of 12 to 36 hours, thereby requiring daily dosing. Prolonged treatment course, vomiting and a bitter taste may reduce patient compliance with prednisolone. Dexamethasone is a long-acting corticosteroid with a half-life of 36 to 72 hours. It is used frequently in children with croup and bacterial meningitis, and is well absorbed orally. The purpose of this trial is to examine whether a single dose of oral dexamethasone (0.3 mg/kg) is clinically non-inferior to prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day for three days) in the treatment of exacerbations of asthma in children who attend the Emergency Department. Methods/design This is a randomized, non-inferiority, open-label clinical trial. After informed consent with or without assent, patients will be randomized to either oral dexamethasone 0.3 mg/kg stat or prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for three days. The primary outcome measure is the comparison between the Pediatric Respiratory Assessment Measure (PRAM) across both groups on Day 4. The PRAM score, a validated, responsive and reliable tool to determine asthma severity in children aged 2 to 16 years, will be performed by a clinician blinded to treatment allocation. Secondary outcomes include relapse, hospital admission and requirement for further steroid therapy. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat and a per protocol basis. With a sample size of 232 subjects (105 in each group with an estimated 10% loss to follow-up), we will be able to reject the null hypothesis - that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with a probability (power) of 0.9. The Type I error probability associated with this test (of the null hypothesis) is 0.05. Discussion This clinical trial may provide evidence that a shorter steroid course using dexamethasone can be used in the treatment of acute pediatric asthma, thus eliminating the issue of compliance to treatment.

Conclusion:The oral and dental benefits of sugar-free chewing gum have been confirmed by the International Dental Associations, Authorities, and Federations.Clinical implication: Adding sugar-free chewing gum to routine oral care of brushing with fluoridated dentifrice and interdental cleaners can reduce the risk of caries and gingivitis.",

At least three different biochemical effects have been defined for meclofenamic acid. It is a potent inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase, thereby inhibiting the production of prostaglandins. It also inhibits the release of 5-HETE and LTB4 from human neutrophils stimulated with calcium ionophore and antagonizes the response of tissues to certain prostaglandins. These mechanisms may explain in part the pharmacological profile and clinical effectiveness of this compound. The rapid onset of activity of meclofenamic acid and its duration of action may be the result of its pharmacokinetic profile. Sodium meclofenamate is completely bioavailable from capsules relative to an oral suspension dosage form. Maximum meclofenamic acid plasma concentrations are achieved in 0.5–2 h following doses of capsules. Meclofenamic acid is extensively metabolized. One of the metabolites, metabolite 1, is approximately 20% as active as the parent compound in inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity in vitro. This metabolite accumulates in plasma during repeated dosing. It is possible that this metabolite may contribute to at least some of the activity observed following administration of sodium meclofenamate.",

      "title": "High dose insulin is an inodilator, not an antidote in the poisoned patient!",
      "abstract": "Abstract High dose insulin therapy has become an increasingly popular treatment for poisonings over the last two decades. It is often mistakenly considered an antidote for poisonings of multiple drug classes, including beta‐blocker and calcium channel blocker overdose. This misconception has encouraged overzealous and, at times, inappropriate use, particularly in patients who have vasoplegic shock following poisonings from drugs such as dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. High dose insulin is not an antidote, but rather an inodilator. Its relatively slow onset of action, compared to catecholamine‐based inotropes, of 15–60 min makes it best suited to second‐line therapy for cardiogenic shock in poisonings. It has no role in isolated vasoplegic shock where it may exacerbate toxicity. It should be used concurrently with noradrenaline to counteract insulin‐induced vasodilation. High dose insulin has predictable adverse effects of hypoglycaemia and electrolyte disturbances, particularly hypokalaemia, which can persist long beyond cessation.",

At that time, Arnold et al. 1 provided the first convincing evidence of ipecac's effectiveness, pointing out, in the process, the superiority of ipecacinduced emesis over gastric lavage in ridding the stomachs of dogs of ingested acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin). Nevertheless, controversy persists concerning the advisability of the use of ipecac. Certainly ipecac is less time-consuming and more convenient to use than is gastric lavage—possibly accounting for its popularity in many poison control centers. Objections to it focus on ( a ) the reported long delay between administration of ipecac and onset of emesis; ( b ) the possibility of aspiration during emesis, and ( c ) the potential toxicity.

Epidurals are the most effective means of pain relief with the highest levels of maternal satisfaction, but require skilled administration – with staff and cost considerations – and can result in complications, instrumental delivery and a prolonged second stage of labour. Many of these drawbacks can be overcome but extra staffing and monitoring are required. An alternative would be advantageous, such as a patient-controlled analgesic agent that could be delivered intravenously with a very rapid onset and an ultra-short duration of action. Remifentanil is a synthetic opioid with these characteristics and is suitable for a woman to administer according to her needs. Typically, it is given as 40 μg boluses with a 2-minute lock-out. A trial from the UK involving 400 women in 14 maternity units compared pethidine on request with self-controlled remifentanil for their pain relief in labour. All participants had rescue epidural intervention available and the crux of the study was to assess how many women resorted to epidurals as a measure of their suboptimal pain relief by pethidine or remifentanil (Wilson et al. Lancet 2018;392:662–72). The researchers found that half as many women in the remifentanil group than in the pethidine group opted for epidural rescue (Figure 1). They also reported that ‘There were no serious adverse events or drug reactions directly attributable to either analgesia during the study’. Source: Wilson et al. Lancet 2018;392:662–72. With remifentanil allowing less frequent resort to epidural intervention than pethidine, the conclusion is that it is the more effective form of pain relief. The authors claim that their findings are sufficiently robust to state ‘This finding challenges routine pethidine use as standard of care in labour’. Intramuscular carbetocin (an oxytocin receptor agonist) has been compared with oxytocin as a heat-stable uterotonic agent for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) and shown to have similar outcomes (Widmer et al. NEJM 2018;379:743–52). It now needs to be tested for the induction of labour and other uses, as well as cost and sustainable production issues investigated. Another approach to PPH prevention – the prophylactic administration of tranexamic acid at delivery – has been investigated as a primary prevention measure (Sentilhes et al. NEJM 2018;379:731–42). The researchers gave 1 g tranexamic acid intravenously (or placebo) in addition to routine intramuscular oxytocin and measured blood loss objectively. The active intervention did not reduce PPH rates as judged by 500-ml blood loss. This does not diminish the potential for tranexamic acid for the treatment of PPH and the importance of swift use when haemorrhage occurs. Perhaps it will have a place in the primary prevention of PPH in high-risk women, especially those who are anaemic. A trial along these lines is already planned (Shakur-Still & Roberts NEJM 2018;379:790–2). Whether intravenous or intramuscular oxytocin is more efficient in preventing PPH has also been studied, with results that are interesting. In a trial in Ireland, the intravenous route had a small advantage in preventing haemorrhage as reflected in PPH of 500 ml of blood but significantly reduced severe PPH, the need for transfusion and high-care management (Adnan et al. BMJ 2018;362:k3546). The prevention of PPH with syntocinon (synthetic oxytocin) or syntometrine (syntocinon plus ergometrine) is still a matter of policy in most units rather than clear-cut clinically proven practice. Carbetocin and the most advantageous route of administration of uterotonic drugs are areas ripe for greater research. More and more American women are delivering their babies during the 39th or 40th week of gestation. Specifically, the trend over the past quarter century has been to induce labour so pregnancies do not continue past 41 or 42 weeks. The most recent data show that 7% of all women in the USA deliver at 41 weeks or later and 0.4% at 42 weeks or later. Perinatal mortality at 41 weeks plus is six per 1000, which is high. This figure has risen over the last decade. The optimal time to delivery statistically is between 39 and 40 weeks but for elective induction to be implemented in uncomplicated pregnancies at this gestation would take a change of mindset in the public and professional sectors, as well as the reallocation of resources (Greene NEJM 2018;379:580-581). To assess the consequences of induction at 39 weeks in healthy singleton pregnancies in the USA, a trial was conducted in which consenting women were induced in the early days of their 39th week or allocated to expectant management. The latter group were reassessed at 41 weeks when local policies were applied (Grobman et al. NEJM 2018;379:513–23). In this study, over 55 000 women were screened and 1600 declined to participate. Eventually just over 6000 took part and there were fewer unfavourable outcomes in the induced group than in those managed expectantly (4.3% versus 5.4%). There were also fewer caesarean sections in the intervention group (19% versus 22%) which was probably why the conservatively managed group had a longer stay in hospital (20 versus 14 hours). An increased time in the labour/delivery unit would have staffing and cost implications. Whether women with normal pregnancies would accept a major intervention on statistical grounds is highly doubtful but the trial does give some scientific clarity to the potential outcomes of large-scale induction policies. Aromatase inhibitors have a crucial role in the management of breast cancer. They provide long-term (5–10 years) hormone therapy that has lengthened disease-free intervals and improved survival rates thereby changing the prognoses of post-menopausal breast malignancies. However, the drugs – anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole – do have adverse effects in about half of patients, one of the most troublesome being arthritis-like joint pain. This can affect a woman's lifestyle and cause her to abandon treatment with the loss of clinical benefit. One remedy that some people recommend is acupuncture but its efficacy has not been proven in trials of sufficient quality. In an attempt to resolve any uncertainty, a study was conducted in the USA comparing true acupuncture with sham acupuncture and no intervention (Hershman et al. JAMA 2018; 320:167–76). The researchers pre-set the level of significant outcome as a reduction in pain of 2 points in a self-recorded scale from 0 to 10 over a 6-week period. More than 200 women participated and their mean baseline pain index was 6.6. True acupuncture reduced pain by two points, whereas sham acupuncture and the untreated controls had 1-point reductions over the same period. The authors state that this was a statistically significant effect but its clinical importance is ‘uncertain’. In this columnist's view, the writers’ interpretation of their results is generous. The study did not achieve its pre-set level of a two-point reduction in pain compared with controls and therefore must be interpreted not as uncertain but as not proven. Failure to achieve an agreed endpoint means their hypothesis was not supported by the experiment. According to their results, acupuncture does not work for this indication and they should report that. Intellectual rigour in alternative therapies is as important as in conventional medicine.

Available online at www.who.int This UNAIDS report provides an overview of progress made so far to reach the 2020 fast-track targets (for investment, removing barriers and expansion of HIV services) set at the 2016 United Nations General Assembly. The comprehensive publication states that the number of deaths related to AIDS is at its lowest this century, that three of every four people living with HIV now know their HIV status and that 21.7 million individuals are receiving treatment worldwide. However, the report highlights that these successes in diagnosis and treatment have not been matched with regard to prevention. Consisting of three main sections, the report covers progress towards fast-track commitments, barriers to ending AIDS and regions in focus. Part I includes a section on eliminating mother-to-child HIV transmission that highlights that half of infants exposed to HIV receive testing before 8 weeks of age, that the mother-to-child HIV transmission rate is 20.2% in western and central Africa, and that it is estimated that 93% of women living with HIV had started antiretroviral therapy or were already receiving treatment during their pregnancy in 2017 in eastern and southern Africa. This section also reports on the Start Free Stay Free AIDS Free initiative and discusses emerging evidence and innovations regarding integrating HIV with maternal and child health care. Part III focuses on individual regions (eastern and southern Africa, western and central Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America, the Caribbean, the Middle East and North Africa, eastern Europe and central Asia, western and central Europe, and North America) providing an at-a-glance overview and detailed information on epidemic transition measures, stigma and discrimination, combination HIV prevention, HIV testing and treatment, elimination of mother-to-child transmission, investment and a laws and policies scorecard. Available online at www.unaids.org This Statistical Brief produced by the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) provides detailed data regarding trends and disparities in delivery hospitalisations for severe maternal morbidity (related to 21 indicators) in the USA between 2006 and 2015. The briefing highlights that the rate of severe maternal morbidity at delivery increased by 45% from 2006 to 2015, was highest among women aged 40 years or above, and that the most common indicators of severe maternal morbidity were blood transfusion, disseminated intravascular coagulation and hysterectomy. Figure 1 provides an overview of trends in delivery hospitalisations involving severe maternal morbidity in 2006–2015, with figure 2 focusing on percentage of deliveries involving blood transfusion or hysterectomy among deliveries with a condition indicating severe maternal morbidity in 2015 and figure 3 providing information on the distribution of race/ethnicity among delivery hospitalisations, according to whether the delivery involved any severe maternal morbidity in 2015. Table 2 provides a useful overview of the characteristics of deliveries with and without any severe maternal morbidity in 2015. Available online at www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov This WHO guidance document focuses on the planning and reviewing of research studies addressing sexual and reproductive health in adolescents with regard to the commonly occurring ethical and legal challenges that research involving this age group (stated as young people between the ages of 10 and 19 years) poses. Aimed at researchers, research ethics committee members, programme planners and sponsors, the guideline highlights key ethical and legal aspects that should be considered and suggests ways to address these challenges. The key challenges highlighted in the document are based on a survey of 34 experts from various stakeholder groups and countries. The guidance is divided into four parts: defining the study population; autonomy, consent and assent; reconciling conflicting ethical and legal obligations with regard to adolescent research participants; and information sharing. Case scenarios and resolutions are provided for each section to help illustrate the ethical and legal aspects being discussed and a useful glossary of key terms is provided.

A recent ruling by the Court of Protection in the UK has granted permission for the extraction, storage, and use posthumously of a man's sperm following a fatal injury. The man and his wife had begun infertility treatment at a clinic before he was fatally injured in an accident. However, not all the required clinic forms had been signed at the initial appointment and the extent of his injuries meant that he could no longer provide consent. The Court of Protection ruled using powers under s16(2)(a) of the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MC Act 2005) to allow a relative to sign the consent required by paragraph 1(2) of Schedule 3 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 (HFE Act 1990) for the storage and posthumous use of his sperm.

      "abstract": "Paclitaxel has emerged as one of the most active anticancer agents in clinical oncology. Hypersensitivity reactions encountered in the clinical development of this drug prompted the implementation of premedication regimens and prolonged infusions, later amended to a 3-hour infusion schedule. Now that paclitaxel is frequently used in outpatient therapy, optimum efficiency in delivery is an issue. A 1-hour drug infusion is more efficient for both the patient and the clinic staff and can help reduce administration costs. This article reviews the current experience with 1-hour paclitaxel infusions.Published studies using 1-hour paclitaxel infusions, including weekly studies, trials of combination chemotherapy, and combined-modality studies, were reviewed. Studies were evaluated for both efficacy and toxicity.Paclitaxel administered by 1-hour infusion as part of weekly or every-3-week treatment regimens is active in a variety of tumors, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer and carcinoma of unknown primary site. Leukopenia, the most common serious toxicity, is usually manageable without hematopoietic growth factor support. The frequency of neurotoxicity appears comparable for 1-hour and 3-hour regimens, and there is no increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions. Infusion duration has been suggested to be an important predictor of response in some tumor types. Evaluation of this issue using a 1-hour paclitaxel infusion as reference is reasonable. One-hour infusions of paclitaxel should simplify outpatient administration, reduce administration costs, and reduce clinic time for patients. Practical information regarding administration of paclitaxel by 1-hour infusion is provided.",

      "title": "Erythromycin and motilin as gastrointestinal prokinetic agents",
      "abstract": "Erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, was introduced into clinical use in the early 1950s and it has been widely used because of its efficacy and its minimal side effects [1]. However, it had been recognized that erythromycin often caused gastrointestinal symptoms [2,3]. The mechanisms of the gastrointestinal symptoms had not been known until 1984 when two groups of researchers independently found that erythromycin strongly contracted the gastrointestinal tract in the dog [4,5]. They also found that at lower doses, erythromycin initiated the interdigestive migrating motor complexes, strong gastric contractions that migrate into the intestine [4,5]. These findings have led to a great interest in searching for a possible use of erythromycin as a gastrointestinal prokinetic drug. The interdigestive migrating motor complex (MMC), a typical gastrointestinal activity that occurs during the interdigestive (fasting) state, is a cyclical motor pattern which usually originates in either the stomach or duodenum, and migrates to the terminal ileum [6]. The MMC consists of three main phases: after a period of quiescence (phase 1), an irregular spiking activity occurs (phase 2), which is taken over by intense bursts of action potentials (phase 3 or activity front) [6]. Several substances are known to induce an MMC-like pattern: morphine, met-enkephalin, pancreatic polypeptide and somatostatin [7–10]. Although these substances induce contractions in the small intestine, they do not induce contractions in the stomach [7]. Motilin, a 22-amino acid peptide, is also known to induce an MMC-like pattern. Unlike other substances, motilin can initiate the MMC in the stomach. Injection of exogenous motilin induces gastric contractions which migrate to the intestine, contractions which are indistinguishable from natural MMCs [4]. In addition, injection of a motilin antiserum disrupts the natural MMC until plasma motilin concentration returns to the physiological level [11]. Furthermore, during the interdigestive state, plasma motilin concentration fluctuates, and there is a close correlation between the peak plasma motilin concentration and the occurrence of the MMC [12]. Interestingly, plasma motilin concentration increases only when phase 3 occurs in the stomach; the concentration decreases when phase 3 originates in the duodenum [12]. It is also known that motilin receptors are abundant in the stomach [13]. From these findings, motilin is considered to be involved in initiating the natural MMC in the stomach. Erythromycin, at therapeutic doses (500–1000 mg), induces strong and continuous gastric contractions which do not migrate to the small intestine [5,12,14,15]. In contrast, at lower doses (up to about 200 mg), it induces intermittent contractions in the stomach, and the contractions migrate into the intestine [12,14]. The frequency and amplitude of these co-ordinated gastrointestinal contractions are similar to those of a natural MMC [4,12,14]. This led to a hypothesis that erythromycin induces the MMC as a motilin receptor agonist. Binding studies have confirmed that erythromycin indeed displaces the binding of a radiolabelled motilin [16]. The stimulatory effect of erythromycin is decreased in animals tolerant to motilin [17,18]. Moreover, injection of erythromycin increases plasma motilin concentration in dogs [4], although it is not clear whether it is so in humans [12,14]. It has been known that motilin might accelerate gastric emptying [19,20]. It was a natural sequence to postulate that erythromycin might also speed up gastric emptying. This postulation was first shown to be true in healthy people as well as in patients with gastroparesis as a result of diabetes mellitus [21]. A number of subsequent studies have confirmed that erythromycin accelerates gastric emptying of both liquids and solids in patients with delayed gastric emptying because of several pathological reasons [22,23]. Erythromycin may also be effective in those patients in whom other gastric prokinetic drugs, such as metoclopramide or bethanechol, were ineffective [21,22]. Several other prokinetic effects of erythromycin have been reported. It increases the lower oesophageal sphincter tone, dilates the pylorus, and stimulates gallbladder emptying [18,23]. Patients with gastroparesis or with pseudo-obstruction of the intestine have several gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating and distension of the colon [22,23]. Erythromycin, at lower doses also reduces gastrointestinal symptoms in these patients [23]. In contrast to the potent prokinetic effect of erythromycin on the stomach, its effect on the intestines is weak [16,24]: erythromycin may either have no effect or even delay the intestinal transit [25]. One possible reason for the weak effect of erythromycin on the intestine is because of the distribution of the motilin receptor in the gastrointestinal tract. The concentration of the motilin receptor decreases aborally in the gastrointestinal tract [13]. Thus, the stimulatory effect of erythromycin may also decrease aborally. Another possibility is that erythromycin produces a prokinetic effect by inducing the phase 3 of the MMC. Strong contractions which occur during phase 3 expel remaining debris in the gastrointestinal tract distally, and they are thus called the interdigestive 'housekeeper' of the small intestine [6,26]. This 'housekeeper' function expels materials from the stomach, but it may not speed up the transit of food in the small intestine [27]. Therefore, if erythromycin produces the prokinetic effect by inducing the MMC, it would not markedly increase the transit time in the small intestine. Is erythromycin useful during the peri-operative period and in the intensive care unit? There may be several potential uses for the drug; however, the efficacy of the drug in these situations is still not clear and there are some limitations to its routine use. First, erythromycin may be given to accelerate gastric emptying peri-operatively or in critically ill patients. One of the useful features of erythromycin is that the onset time for the prokinetic effect is very short [21–23,25]. It may thus effectively reduce gastric contents in patients with full stomachs who are to undergo emergency surgery. However, erythromycin sometimes fails to accelerate gastric emptying (and also sometimes fails to induce the MMC) even in healthy subjects [14,22,23]. In addition, the drug may not be effective at all in some groups of patients. One study showed that in children with intestinal pseudo-obstruction, erythromycin induced the MMC in most patients in whom spontaneous MMC had been present, whereas it almost always failed to induce the complex in patients in whom a spontaneous MMC had been absent [28]. It may also not reverse the delayed gastric emptying caused by injection of morphine [29]. Accelerated gastric emptying caused by erythromycin is not physiological. Normally, the rate of gastric emptying of liquids, digestible and indigestible solids are markedly different [30]: both liquids and digestible solids are emptied from the stomach during the digestive state, and liquids leave the stomach more rapidly than digestible solids which usually remain in the stomach until they are broken down [30]. In contrast, large indigestible solids remain in the stomach until both liquids and digestible solids have left; these indigestible solids are expelled from the stomach by phase 3 of the MMC during the interdigestive state [30,31]. Erythromycin accelerates gastric emptying of both liquids and solids, and expels these two components at a similar speed [21]. It also accelerates gastric emptying of indigestible solids even when food is in the stomach (digestive state) [32]. Therefore, erythromycin may expel food that is only partly broken down into the intestine [33]. This may cause indigestion and the dumping syndrome. In fact, one study showed that in healthy humans, erythromycin effectively increased gastric emptying, but it also caused abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhoea and sweating, typical symptoms of the dumping syndrome [34]. Erythromycin may accelerate the recovery from post-operative ileus [35,36], but conclusions regarding its efficacy are still premature. In one study, either erythromycin or saline was given intravenously every 6 h starting 3 days after pancreaticoduodenectomy [35]. Although the duration of the necessity for nasogastric drainage was not different, the incidence of re-insertion of a nasogastric tube was significantly lower in patients in whom erythromycin was given. Gastric emptying of both liquids and solids was also significantly increased when examined on the tenth post-operative day [35]. However, the time to discharge from the hospital did not differ between the two groups. In another study, either erythromycin 250 mg or saline was given every 8 h after abdominal surgery [36]. There was no difference in the time to recovery from the post-operative ileus between the groups [36]. A recent report showed that an erythromycin derivative shortened the post-operative ileus in patients who had undergone cholecystectomy [37]. A motilin derivative also increases post-operative motility in dogs [38]. Hypomotility of the gastrointestinal tract is a major problem in critically ill patients [26,39]. The MMC is often impaired in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients [39]. When the frequency of the MMC is reduced, bacterial overgrowth is likely to occur in the intestine [26,40]. One study showed that all patients, with either sparse or no MMC activity, had bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine [26]. In rats, disruption of the MMC by either morphine or phenylephrine resulted in bacterial overgrowth; recovery of the MMC reduced the number of bacteria in the intestine [40]. It seems reasonable to hypothesize that in critically ill patients, a low dose of erythromycin, which produces no antibiotic effects, inhibits bacterial overgrowth by inducing the MMC. There have been no studies in which this hypothesis has been assessed. One limitation of the routine use of erythromycin is that the dose range for the prokinetic effect may be narrow. Erythromycin dose-dependently increases the frequency of the MMC when the dose is relatively low; however, when the dose is increasesd further, it causes only strong gastric contractions that do not migrate to the intestine. These strong gastric contractions may thus only cause gastrointestinal discomfort, such as abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting [5,15]. The incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms caused by a therapeutic dose of erythromycin may be higher in young people then older people [3], although this has not been studied formally. It is thus possible that the effective dose of erythromycin as a prokinetic drug may also vary between different age groups. If this is so, erythromycin at doses which acts as a prokinetic drug in elderly people, could merely induce gastrointestinal symptoms in younger people. It is also not clear whether erythromycin loses its gastrointestinal prokinetic effects during long-term use [21,22]. Acute tachyphylaxis to motilin, erythromycin and their derivatives have been shown in in vitro studies [17]. Concurrent administration with other prokinetic drugs may prevent excessive doses of erythromycin, may produce greater prokinetic effects, and may reduce tolerance, if any, to each drug. There is no doubt that the gastrointestinal prokinetic effect of erythromycin and motilin is potentially useful in clinical practice, and it seems that erythromycin is being used in the intensive care unit. At the moment, we are utilizing a side effect of erythromycin; what we need now is an erythromycin derivative which produces a more potent prokinetic effect but is devoid of antibacterial activity. Such erythromycin derivatives as well as motilin derivatives have already been developed [14,17,37,38]. Questions still remain as to whether erythromycin increases gastrointestinal motility entirely through the motilin receptor: there is no similarity in the structures of erythromycin and motilin, and there are several differences in their effect. It may be possible that erythromycin induces gastrointestinal symptoms through mechanisms other than the motilin receptor. The optimal structure of this group of drugs will be found through studies not only on erythromycin and its derivatives but also on motilin itself. T. Asai Cardiff, UK and Osaka, Japan",

Preparations can be purchased over the counter with no prescription necessary. It is considered a safer and more acceptable form of anesthetic than hypodermic injections; however, there have been reports of fatalities following its application. Above certain serum lidocaine concentrations, patients may experience effects of toxicity such as lightheadedness and paraesthesia; these effects can progress to seizures and cardiorespiratory depression, which can ultimately lead to death. The active metabolite of lidocaine, monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX), can be almost as potent as lidocaine in terms of toxicity.",

      "abstract": "(1) Patients frequently complain of occasional bowel movement disorders, associated with abdominal pain or discomfort, but they are rarely due to an underlying organ involvement. Even when patients have recurrent symptoms, serious disorders are no more frequent in these patients than in the general population, unless other manifestations, anaemia, or an inflammatory syndrome is also present; (2) There is currently no way of radically modifying the natural course of recurrent irritable bowel syndrome; (3) The effects of antispasmodics on abdominal pain have been tested in about 20 randomised controlled trials. Pinaverium and peppermint essential oil have the best-documented efficacy and only moderate adverse effects. Antispasmodics with marked atropinic effects do not have a favourable risk-benefit balance; (4) Tricylic antidepressants seem to have only modest analgesic effects in this setting. In contrast, their adverse effects are frequent and they have somewhat negative risk-benefit balances. Nor has the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants (SSRIs) been demonstrated; (5) Alosetron and tegaserod carry a risk of potentially life-threatening adverse effects and therefore have negative risk-benefit balances; (6) Seeds of plants such as psyllium and ispaghul, as well as raw apples and pears, have a limited impact on constipation and pain. Osmotic laxatives are effective on constipation. Symptomatic treatments for constipation can sometimes aggravate abdominal discomfort; (7) Loperamide has been poorly assessed in patients with recurrent irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhoea. It modestly slows bowel movement but does not relieve pain or abdominal discomfort; (8) Dietary measures have not been tested in comparative trials. Some patients are convinced that certain foods provoke a recurrence of irritable bowel syndrome, but restrictive diets carry a risk of nutritional deficiencies; (9) Various techniques intended to control emotional and psychological disturbances have been proposed, including relaxation, biofeedback, hypnosis, and psychotherapy. The results of clinical trials are not convincing; (10) Oral products containing live bacteria, designed to change the equilibrium of intestinal flora, have been tested in 13 placebo-controlled trials, with inconsistent results. A few cases of septicaemia have been reported; (11) The six available trials of acupuncture (versus sham acupuncture) showed no more than a placebo effect; (12) In practice, patients who have recurrent irritable bowel syndrome but with no other signs of a condition warranting specific treatment should be reassured as to the harmless nature of their disorder if a careful physical examination and basic laboratory tests are negative. The only available treatments have purely symptomatic effects and only limited efficacy. It is best to avoid using all treatments and additional diagnostic investigations that carry a risk of disproportionate adverse effects.",

      "title": "The Effects of Drugs Used by Children with Chronic Systemic Diseases on the Oral Cavity: Traditional Review",
      "abstract": "Children with chronic diseases are prescribed various drugs by pediatricians. In children with chronic systemic disease, daily use of pediatric liquid form medications may be routine. Drugs such as analgesics, antibiotics, antihistamines, antiepileptics, multivitamins and antitussives are chronically prescribed to children. Sweeteners and sugars are added to make the flavors of the drugs prescribed by pediatricians in suspension forms acceptable to pediatric patients. The high sugars such as sucrose and glucose in the content of these drugs cause the dissolution of tooth enamel by lowering the pH of the dental biofilm as a result of bacterial fermentation. These drugs can cause tooth erosion due to their acidic properties and reducing saliva flow as a side effect. In addition to their corrosive and cariogenic properties, pediatric drugs also have side effects such as periodontal disease, changing orthodontic tooth movement, decreasing or increasing saliva flow, and causing tooth discoloration. Various recommendations can be made to parents, dentists and pharmaceutical companies in terms of preventive measures related to chronic drug use. In children with chronic drug use, rinsing the mouth with water after taking these drugs may not be enough to prevent tooth damage. Regular topical fluoride applications and the addition of calcium, fluoride or phosphate to drug formulations can be recommended for these patients as reduce the risk of dental caries and erosion. The aim of this review is to evaluate the effects of frequently used drugs on oral and dental health in pediatric patients based on current literature research.",

It was therefore decided to investigate the frequency of cystitis associated with tiaprofenic acid and to see whether this association is typical of tiaprofenic acid or also occurs with other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.The Medicines Adverse Reaction Monitoring Centre has been monitoring drug related events/reactions since 1965. An analysis of the spontaneous adverse reaction reports received at this centre during the period 1965-92 was carried out.Haemorrhagic cystitis was reported to be associated with tiaprofenic acid (n = 3) and indomethacin (n = 3). In addition 11 other reports of haematuria (not associated with any coagulopathy and/or hepatic disorders) in relation to other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, such as diclofenac, ketoprofen, naproxen and piroxicam were received. Five patients who were rechallenged with the suspect drug, suffered from recurrence of cystitis/haematuria.In addition to tiaprofenic acid, cystitis appears to be associated with indomethacin and possibly also with other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. An allergic or immunological mechanism is probably responsible for this reaction. Although our centre received the first report of cystitis in relation to indomethacin in 1966, judging by the number of reports received, this association appears to be poorly recognised.",

Overdoses of up to 9 g have produced minimal symptoms and full recovery.

It is rapidly absorbed when administered through the intramuscular (1-5 min), nasal (5-10 min), and oral (1520 min) routes. Extensive rst-pass metabolism in the liver and intestine is largely accountable for the low bioavailability of ketamine when given orally (17%) or rectally (25%). The bioavailability after nasal, intravenous, and intramuscular administration is approximately 50%, 100%, and 93%, respectively (Malinovsky et al. 1996). Upon administration, ketamine is converted to norketamine via biotransformation in the liver, which is then eliminated via the hepatic route into conjugated hydroxyl metabolites to be excreted renally. Ketamine (5-11 days), norketamine (6-14 days), and dehydronorketamine (10 days) can be detected in the urine within a fortnight after administration (Adamowicz and Kala 2005; Parkin et al. 2008).",

      "abstract": "Sleeping sickness (causal agent, Trypanosoma sp. parasite) causes huge morbidity and mortality in Africa (both human and livestock) in particular and zoo animals worldwide. Three of the four currently approved drugs (Pentamidine, Melarsoprol, Eflornithine, and Nifurtimox) were developed over 50 years ago. Current therapies are unsatisfactory due to unacceptable level of side effects. Pentamidine, an aromatic diamidine, safest so far, inhibits mitochondrial enzymes. Furthermore, it is effective only in early stages of infections and not on the later stage. Melarsoprol, practically insoluble in water, is very toxic and it is given intravenously (i.v.) for later stage infections only. Other drugs like eflornithine and nitfurtimox are also unsatisfactory for various reasons. Human serum derived high-density lipoprotein (HDL; not mouse or any other mammalian HDL) shows trypanolytic effect in vitro and in vivo on T. brucei. But the mechanism of action of human HDL is far from clear. In the absence of novel drug leads, nanodrugs might be valid options as nanoparticles show better accessibility to cells, supramolecular interactions due to enormous increase in surface area to volume ratio, altered partition coefficient, etc. Surface-modified hydrophobic microsilica (FS), mixture of micro- and nanosilica (Dsethvasan) and nanosilica (AL) were characterized by UV–Vis, DLS, SEM, EDAX, AFM, and XRD. Trypanosoma evansi collected from infected horses were injected in mice. Control infected mouse (n = 30) showed 100% mortality within 72±24 h of injection. Dsethvasan-treated mice (n = 30) survived for 192±24 h. FS-treated mice (n = 30) survived for 120±24 h but the AL-treated mice (n = 30) died within 72±24 h of inoculation like infected control. Hydrophobic Dsethvasan which consists of pure amorphous forms of micro- and nanosilica works better than FS (AL is not at all effective). Therefore, micro- and nanomixture of amorphous silica is best suited for treating Trypanosoma infection in mice. The possible role of ratio of higher to lower size class has been discussed.",

      "title": "Propofol-Opioid Mixtures During Prolonged Infusions",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Alfentanil and fentanyl are commonly mixed with propofol and administered to patients by continuous infusion for maintenance of general anesthesia, as well as for sedation during monitored anesthesia care. However, propofol is emulsified in a lipid, but fentanyl and alfentanil are relatively lipid insoluble. It is therefore possible that, during prolonged infusions (or if the pump remains inactive for a period of time), the two drugs may separate, creating an inhomogenous mixture. Clinically, this is important as excessive infusion of one or the other substance may have undesired effects (e.g., respiratory depression with excess opioid). We designed a simple in vitro study to determine whether during a prolonged infusion the beginning and ending opioid concentrations were significantly different. Eleven 60-mL syringes containing 40-mL (10 mg/mL) of propofol and 8 mL of either fentanyl (50 micro gram/mL) or alfentanil (500 micro gram/mL) were prepared. The syringes (propofol-opioid mixture) were thoroughly mixed and then placed vertically into identical infusion pumps (MedFusion, Inc., Deluth, GA) and allowed to remain undisturbed for a period of 2 h. An infusion of 15 mL/h was then instituted. The initial 2 mL of each mixture was obtained and assayed for opioid concentration (MedTox Laboratories, St. Paul, MN). After 3 h of continuous infusion, the final 2 mL of each mixture was also analyzed for opioid concentration. We assumed a difference between initial and final opioid concentrations of greater than 15% to be clinically relevant. A two-sided Student's t-test was used to compare beginning and ending concentrations for each opioid. A prospective power analysis revealed an 83% probability of detecting a statistically significant difference with the sample size used in this laboratory study. The results of our assays are shown in Table 1 (one alfentanil sample was discarded because of a packaging error). Each entry represents the value of the final minus the initial opioid concentration. There were no statistically significant differences between the beginning and ending concentrations of opioid. Therefore, clinicians can be reassured that mixtures of propofol with either alfentanil or fentanyl, as commonly used in clinical practice, remain homogenous for at least 5 h.Table 1: Results of Opioid Concentration AssaysAhmed F.

Many of these agents have, however, failed in early development for various reasons, including dose-limiting side effects when administered orally and lack of sufficient activity when inhaled. Indeed, only one selective PDE4 inhibitor, the orally active roflumilast-n-oxide, has to date received marketing authorization. The majority of the compounds that have failed were, however, orally administered and non-selective for either PDE3 (A,B) or PDE4 (A,B,C,D) subtypes. Developing an inhaled dual PDE3/4 inhibitor that is rapidly cleared from the systemic circulation, potentially with subtype specificity, may represent one strategy to improve the therapeutic index and also exhibit enhanced efficacy versus inhibition of either PDE3 or PDE4 alone, given the potential positive interactions with regard to anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator effects that have been observed pre-clinically with dual inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4 compared with inhibition of either isozyme alone.

      "title": "Efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in the treatment of Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (experience of the Svt. Luka’s Association of Medical Institutions)",
      "abstract": "Background . Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS) is a classic developmental and epileptic encephalopathy with a debut in childhood, characterized by resistance to therapy, a severe course, and an unfavorable prognosis. Due to the existing difficulties in treatment of LGS, hopes are pinned on development of new antiepileptic drugs with fundamentally different mechanisms of action, aimed specifically at the treatment of this severe form of epilepsy.Rufinamide (Inovelon®) is a new antiepileptic drug registered in the Russian Federation for use in the adjunctive therapy of LGS in patients older than 1 year. The main mechanism of action of rufinamide is the restriction of neuronal discharges associated with the blocking effect on sodium channels (regulation of sodium channels activity by increasing duration of their inactive state), and stabilization of neuronal membranes. The drug has a number of advantages concernung pharmacokinetic parameters and efficacy (including a wide spectrum of antiepileptic activity, good oral absorption, absence of active metabolites, urinary excretion, low affinity for plasma proteins, biotransformation without cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, low risk of drug interactions) and fairly good tolerability. The daily dose of rufinamide varies from 600 mg (with simultaneous administration of valproate) to 1000 mg (if the patient does not take valproate) in children over 4 years of age with a body weight of less than 30 kg and up to 2200–3200 mg in children over 4 years of age with a body weight of more than 30 kg and in adults; in children under 4 years of age, the maximum daily dose in combination with valproate is 30 mg/kg, and without valproic acid – 45 mg/kg. Aim . To analyze the efficacy and tolerability of rufinamide in the treatment of epilepsy based on the long-term experience of using the drug in the Svt. Luka’s Association of Medical Institutions. Materials and methods . We observed 64 patients aged from 1.5 to 26 years (44 men, 20 women) treated with rufinamide (Inovelon®). Among them, the structural etiology LGS was diagnosed in 36 patients, the genetic and presumably genetic etiology LGS – in 28. In all cases, rufinamide was used in accordance with approved indications as an additional antiepileptic drug, more often in combination with valproate, topiramate, levetiracetam or lamotrigine. Titration of the drug was carried out according to the recommendations in the instructions for use, up to a therapeutic dose that ranged from 200 to 1600 mg/day (in most cases from 400 to 1200 mg/day), depending on age and concomitant therapy. Results and conclusion . Remission of all types of seizures was registered in 17 (26.6 %) patients, and a decrease in the incidence of seizures by more than 50 % was recorded in 28 (43.8 %) patients. Of them, 13 patients demonstrated reduction in seizures frequency by more than 75–90 % and remission of one of several types of seizures. In general, the therapeutic effect (reduction of seizures frequency by at least 50 %) was achieved in 45 (70.3 %) of 64 patients. A decrease in seizures frequency of by at least 50 % was observed in 8 (12.5 %) patients; in 10 (15.6 %) patients, rufinamide therapy was not effective; in 1 (1.56 %) case an aggravation of bilateral convulsive seizures was noted when rufinamide was administered.In most cases, rufinamide is well tolerated. Our patients had side effects in 10 (15.6 %) cases. Only in 2 (3.1 %) cases, rufinamide was withdrawn directly due to side effects (the reason for withdrawal in these cases was an allergic reaction and psychosis).The retention rate for therapy lasting 1 year or more is 65.6 % (42 of 64 patients).Thus, our data have demonstrated efficacy and good tolerability of rufinamide in treating epileptic seizures associated with LGS, confirming numerous literature data. However, in our analysis, a higher rate of seizure remission was obtained, although we have included patients with mainly resistant forms of epilepsy in the analysis.",

The efficacy of proton pump inhibitors has not been demonstrated in the treatment of irritability and excessive crying in otherwise healthy infants younger than 3 months of age. Conversely, while PPIs are generally well tolerated, there is some evidence to link the use of PPIs with increased susceptibility to acute gastroenteritis, community-acquired pneumonia, and disorders of nutrient absorption and utilization.

      "title": "Two More Cases of Pregabalin Dependence",
      "abstract": "Sir, Pregabalin (PGR) is a well-known drug used to treat chronic pain conditions; however, it underscores its potential for abuse and dependence. In patients without a prior abuse history, there are very few cases with gabapentinoid-related behavioral dependence symptoms as per International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).[1] Here, we try to present two cases of PRG dependence with comorbid opioid dependence. CASE REPORTS First case PS, 23-year-old, single, farmer presented to Drug Deaddiction outpatient with high dose PRG use. He was primarily dependent on injection heroin for the past 2 years. He attempted to quit heroin with buprenorphine, obtained from his friend. He was told about the analgesic effect of PRG, which he bought over the counter. He used the combination of buprenorphine and PRG to relieve heroin withdrawal symptoms. He started with 150 mg/day PRG and gradually increased the dose up to 1125 mg/day over one year. He reported euphoria, increased self-confidence, increased sociability with PRG. Moreover, he would perceive PRG and buprenorphine potentiating each other's effect. Within couple of months of initiation, he would have intense desire for PRG on the particular time of the day and could differentiate it from the desire for buprenorphine, categorically. He would suffer from trembling, palpitations, sweating, sleeplessness, and inability to concentrate on any work when he would not take the usual dose of PRG, even for 24–48 h. These symptoms would be distinct from buprenorphine withdrawal and would be relieved only with PRG. He had several failed attempts to quit PRG. Second case DD, 37-year-old, married, working in the packaging division of a pharmaceutical factory, presented to the Drug Deaddiction outpatient clinic for discontinuation of PRG use. On exploration, he was found to have opioid dependence (natural opioids) in the past, currently abstinent from the last four years. He started PRG two years back to 'get relief' from his work-related stress and reported its effect to be pleasurable and relaxing at the same time. Initially, he would take PRG 75–150 mg/day. He claimed PRG would enhance his 'stamina' and he would be able to work till late at night, at a stretch. He progressively increased the dose and frequency of use and would report craving and preoccupation for the same. Within the next 2 years, increased the dose up to 1500 mg/day to obtain the same effect. On the insistence of his family, when he attempted to quit, he experienced restlessness, increased heart rate, diaphoresis, sleeplessness, and dysphoric mood and was unable to do so. Hence, he sought for the same. DISCUSSION Both the cases described above fulfill the diagnosis of PRG dependence, as per ICD-10 and had either preexisting or ongoing opioid dependence. Given the common indication as analgesic, the possibility of concomitant prescription of both these groups of drugs is high on the cards, and in such a scenario, the reinforcing effects on one another might result in double jeopardy. The abuse potential of PRG indicating its modulatory effects on the GABA and glutamate systems, leaving room for abuse potential.[2] From India, there are few published case reports so far, which has discussed abuse of prescribed PRG.[3,4,5] We believe the two cases of PRG dependence in the substance misusing population reported by us are the first of its kind from the Indian subcontinent. The Drug Controller General of India and Central Drugs Standard Control Organization has given approval of PGN use in various pain symptoms, including diabetic neuropathy, as it is used more frequently by the physician in India (http//:www.cdsco.nic.in).[6] This possibility looks sinister given the lack of legal restriction on PRG availability in India, as PRG is a schedule H drug and effectively, like many other drugs in this category. Hence, there might be the need for more stringent legal restrictions, and the physician needs to be more cautious about its use. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "title": "The Rise of Remimazolam: A Review of Pharmacology, Clinical Efficacy, and Safety Profiles",
      "abstract": "Anesthesiologists often use benzodiazepines (BZDs) due to their remarkable amnestic and anxiolytic capabilities. Because of this, they are perfect for use during the perioperative phase, when patients' anxiety levels are already high. Remimazolam has replaced certain commonly used intravenous (IV) anesthetics due to its excellent safety profile, rapid onset of action, and short half-life. The four classes of BZDs, 2-keto-benzodiazepines, 3-hydroxy-benzodiazepines, triazolobenzodiazepines, and 7-nitro-benzodiazepines based on chemical structure, provide various levels of drowsiness, forgetfulness, and anxiolysis. Based on their elimination half-life, short-acting BZDs typically have a half-life ranging from one to 12 hours, e.g., oxazepam; intermediate-acting BZDs have an average elimination half-life of 12 to 40 hours, e.g., alprazolam; and long-acting BZDs have an average elimination half-life of more than 40 hours, e.g., diazepam. The chloride ion channel is conformationally shifted by the benzodiazepine molecule resulting in central nervous system (CNS) inhibition and hyperpolarization. Each type of benzodiazepine has a favored use. For example, diazepam is used to treat anxiety. Midazolam is used for its anxiolytic and anterograde amnestic effects during the perioperative phase. Anxiety and epilepsy are two conditions that lorazepam effectively treats. There are now phase II and III clinical studies investigating remimazolam. It is not sensitive to alterations in its surroundings and has a brief half-life so that it may be removed rapidly, even after extensive infusion. Being a soft drug means the body easily breaks it down via metabolism, which explains many features. Remimazolam is hydrolyzed into methanol and its carboxylic acid metabolite CNS 7054 by esterase metabolism. Therefore, remimazolam has a shorter onset time and faster recovery than other BZDs. Remimazolam is metabolized independently of any particular organ. Patients with hepatic and renal problems will not see any changes in metabolism or excretion since the drug's ester moiety makes it a substrate for general tissue esterase enzymes. Like its predecessor, midazolam, it has a high potential for addiction. Some side effects that could occur during infusion include headaches and drowsiness. In clinical trials, hypotension, respiratory depression, and bradycardia were noted in participants. BZDs are helpful when used in conjunction with anesthesia. Remimazolam stands out, thanks to its unique pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety profile, and potential medical applications. Its desirable properties make it a potential surgical premedication and sedative in the critical care unit. Anesthesiologists and other doctors could have access to more consistent and safer medication. However, additional comprehensive clinical trials are necessary to understand remimazolam's advantages and disadvantages.",

      "abstract": "The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosage of diclofenac sodium are reviewed. Diclofenac, the first nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAID) to be approved that is a phenylacetic acid derivative, competes with arachidonic acid for binding to cyclo-oxygenase, resulting in decreased formation of prostaglandins. The drug has both analgesic and antipyretic activities. Diclofenac is efficiently absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; peak plasma concentrations occur 1.5 to 2.0 hours after ingestion in fasting subjects. Even though diclofenac has a relatively short elimination half-life in plasma (1.5 hours), it persists in synovial fluid. The drug is metabolized in the liver and is eliminated by urinary and biliary excretion. In clinical trials, diclofenac was as effective as aspirin, diflunisal, indomethacin, sulindac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen in improving function and reducing pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. For treatment of osteoarthritis, diclofenac was equivalent in efficacy to aspirin, diflunisal, indomethacin, sulindac, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, flurbiprofen, mefenamic acid, and piroxicam. Diclofenac was as effective as indomethacin or sulindac in treating ankylosing spondylitis. The most frequent adverse effects reported for diclofenac were gastrointestinal, but these effects were fewer and less serious than occurred with aspirin or indomethacin; in addition, diclofenac caused fewer central nervous system reactions than indomethacin. Diclofenac is administered in divided doses with meals. The recommended total daily dosage is 100 to 150 mg (osteoarthritis and ankylosing spondylitis) or 150 to 200 mg (rheumatoid arthritis). Diclofenac is effective, but no more so than other NSAIDs. It is structurally distinct and offers another choice in the treatment of rheumatological conditions.",

Psychologic conditioning theory offers more satisfactory explanations. Methadone programs are effective, it is proposed, not because addicts have any \"biochemical need\" for opiates, but for straightforward pharmacologic and psychologic reasons. Methadone hydrochloride abolishes the periodic withdrawal sickness experienced by the active addict. By producing cross-tolerance, it diminishes the rewarding (reinforcing) effects of heroin. Thus methadone allows the motivated addict to discontinue heroin use without discomfort. A methadone program should strengthen that motivation by providing a nonpunitive environment within which self-help and peer help can operate to alter life style. A methadone temporary support program is outlined, as an alternative to methadone maintenance of indefinite duration.",

This review compares the three currently licensed PDE5 inhibitors: sildenafil citrate (sildenafil), vardenafil HCl (vardenafil) and tadalafil. All three drugs have similar efficacy and toxicity profiles. Sildenafil and vardenafil have similar molecular structures, but tadalafil is structurally different, which is reflected in its pharmacokinetic profile. With regard to the onset of action, achievement of an erection that leads to successful intercourse has been reported for 35% of patients treated with sildenafil within 14 min, 21% of patients treated with vardenafil within 10 min and 16% of patients treated with tadalafil within 16 min. Sildenafil and vardenafil both have half-lives of approximately 4 h but the half-life of tadalafil is 17.5 h. Another difference between the PDE5 inhibitors is that food, especially fatty food, affects the pharmacokinetic profiles of sildenafil and vardenafil, but not that of tadalafil. These pharmacokinetic differences among the PDE5 inhibitors may underlie patient preference, an important and emerging aspect of ED therapy.",

However, despite 40–50 years use of hydroquinone for medical conditions, there has not been a single documented case of either a cutaneous or internal malignancy associated with this drug.

      "abstract": "The intestinal diseases of bacterial aetiology are characterized by high prevalence and a severe course, especially at a young age, concomitant immunity suppression or chronic diseases of the gastrointestinal system. Therefore, it is expedient to search for the new antimicrobial drugs, and it seems promising to use known antimicrobial agent decamethoxinum for the development of peroral medicinal forms, such as “Decasan” that is 0.02% decamethoxinum solution for peroral use worked out by “Yuria Pharm.” This study aimed to determine the parameters of acute toxicity of decamethoxinum substance and “Decasan,” as well as to study the possible toxic effects of the latter in chronic administration. The experiments on rats have shown that “Decasan” at the maximal allowable dose of 20 ml/kg does not cause lethality in rats. For decamethoxinum substance LD50 equals 586 (484:588) mg/kg in intragastric administration, corresponding to the IV class of low toxic substances (500 mg/kg&lt;LD50&lt;5000 mg/kg). The single intragastric administration of decamethoxinum substance at a dose of 400 mg/kg after 2 days causes moderate reversible changes in the gastrointestinal system, in the thymus and adrenal glands. “Decasan” intragastric administration at doses of 3 ml/kg and 30 ml/kg for a period of 30 days to male and female rats does not causes pathological changes in biochemical parameters of the blood (only the decrease in content of albumins is seen in male rats receiving the drug at both doses) as well as in histological structure of the internal organs and functions of the kidney, heart, and CNS.",

They also may be of use in combination with an aminoglycoside in the management of secondary septicaemia infections. Outside of these indications which are dependent on the bacteriological findings, their use should be limited even when there is an absence of organisms that are Cefalotine sensitive on the antibiogram. This careful approach (which applies particularly for cefotaxine) may be abandoned once a certain quantity of resistant strains have emerged. For the time being, the second generation cephalosporins ought to be used only for specific indications, and as a general rule should not be first line antibiotic treatment.",

Preliminary results have suggested that selegiline may also alleviate the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease [7, 8].

A patent was registered for this drug in 1990, which expired in 2010. Since expiration, the drug has been marketed under various trade names or as generic drugs. Numerous clinical trials have been conducted addressing the effectiveness of the drug for erectile dysfunction (ED) and its safety regarding the presence or absence of specific comorbidities. After over 20 years in the market, we need to ask: has the scientific community reached a general consensus as to the overall efficacy and safety of the drug? Can we firmly state that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks? This review suggests that sildenafil is an effective and easily manageable treatment for erectile dysfunction, both in the absence and in the presence of comorbidities. After two decades of the emergence of sildenafil as a drug of choice for the treatment of ED (and the numerous studies and clinical trials undertaken during this time span), it is now possible to state that the benefits of the drug do outweigh the risks, and represent an significant improvement in the quality of life in men with ED.",

Analgesic, antipyretic, especially anti-inflammatory activity occurs in high therapeutic doses. In low-dose acetylsalicylic acid is used to block production of thromboxane A2. Big epidemiological data suggest that low-dose of acetylsalicylic acid, even taken chronically, is safe for mother and fetus. However, animal and various human data have shown that high doses of the drug could produce different congenital malformations. The current literature suggests that acetylsalicylic acid should be given in pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Anti-inflammatory doses should be stopped in the third trimester of gestation or given if the drug is needed in life-threatening situation or for serious disease for which safer drugs can not be used or are ineffective.",

The drug is highly hydrophobic and slightly soluble in water. Cyclodextrins are widely used to improve the physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties such as solubility, stability, and bioavailability of poorly soluble drug molecules.Cyclodextrins can molecularly encapsulate various drugs into their hydrophobic cavity without forming any covalent bonds. Cyclodextrin (CDs), especially ß-Cyclodextrin (ß-CD), are widely used in the pharmaceutical field due to its ability to stabilize drug molecules and taste masking purposes.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phase solubility study was performed according to the method of Higuchi and Connors by adding the fexofenadine hydrochloride in excess to different concentrations of cyclodextrin solutions. Phase solubility study records show that the stability constant and complex stoichiometry of FFN-CD complexes increases linearly with CD concentration. Also, an increase in the concentration of β-cyclodextrin leads to an increase in the aqueous solubility of FFN. Complexes were analyzed by UV-VIS spectroscopy using the calibration curve of FFN. Also, UV-VIS spectra indicate a bathochromic shift which proves that complex formation has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solid inclusion complexes of fexofenadine/β-cyclodextrin and its derivatives were prepared at the molar ratios of 1:1 by the physical mixing method.

Confirmation of the teratogenicity of drugs in humans is difficult; the risk can be estimated from results of cohort studies and case-control studies. The possible teratogenicity of Bendectin (doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride) was studied thoroughly; although the risk was minimal, the drug was withdrawn from the U.S. market. Whether phenothiazines are teratogenic has still not been conclusively determined. A large number of epidemiological studies have not shown meclizine to be teratogenic in humans. More information about metoclopramide is necessary before it can be safely recommended for use during pregnancy. The risks of using dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine appear to be low. Pyridoxine is considered safe for use during pregnancy, but its efficacy in treating nausea and vomiting has not been determined. The relative efficacy of these agents has not been determined. The available data suggest that meclizine and dimenhydrinate are the antiemetics that present the lowest risk of teratogenicity; meclizine is the drug of first choice.

Ophthalmic drug delivery is one of the most interesting and challenging endeavors facing the pharmaceutical scientist.

A significant challenge to the formulator is to circumvent the protective barriers of the eye without causing permanent tissue damage. Development of newer, more sensitive diagnostic techniques and novel therapeutic agents continue to provide ocular delivery systems with high therapeutic efficacy. The preparation may have any several purposes like therapeutic, prophylactic or palliative. The versatility of dosage form enables therapeutic agent to be suitable for function of preparation. Therapeutically active formulation may be designed to provide extended action for either convenience or reduction in dose frequency, improved bioavailability of an agent or improved delivery to target tissue. The residence time of an ocular preparation may range from few seconds (ophthalmic solutions) to hours (gel, ointments), to months or years (intra ocular or periocular dosage forms).

      "abstract": "There exist a large number of drugs belonging to the benzodiazepine family. These include the 1,4-benzodiazepines such as diazepam, temazepam and oxazepam, the often more potent diazolo- and triazolo-groups represented by alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam etc. These drugs represent a large range of potencies from submilligram doses to over 100 mg and a range of polarities. Consequently, blood or plasma concentrations associated with prescribed use range from sub-nanogram per mL to near-microgram per mL. Their medical use varies, but they are predominantly used as hypnotics and sedatives. Some members are also used in the treatment of post-traumatic stress and obsessive-compulsive disorders, alcohol withdrawal, muscle spasm, and seizures. Recreationally, drug users favor these drugs to reduce the symptoms of withdrawal and unpleasant effects of heroin and cocaine. They are also commonly used as \"date-rape\" drugs to render a victim incapable of resisting an attack. Benzodiazepines elicit a large number of physiological and psychological responses in humans that often can lead to significant behavioral changes and adverse effects on skills required for safe driving. These include reduced lane control, increased reaction times, reduced hand-eye coordination and cognitive impairment. Impairment can exceed that seen with 0.05 g% ethanol. In high doses benzodiazepines can cause persons to exhibit classical features of CNS-depressant drugs such as nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, and impaired divided attention skills. As one would expect with hypnotics and sedatives, any sleep deprivation, or situations involving monotonous driving can lead to a reduced ability to concentrate and maintain vigilance. Adverse effects on REM and NREM sleep patterns will exacerbate fatigue-related components to driving. Persons with sleep abnormalities, e.g., sleep apnea, may be more likely to be affected by benzodiazepines than those with normal sleep patterns. Ethanol and narcotic analgesics also affect sleep patterns and may compound any CNS-depressant effects associated with the use of benzodiazepines.",

Levofloxacin should probably be administered twice daily in serious, life-threatening infections. The acquisition cost of ciprofloxacin is currently higher than the newer agents, but a lower acquisition cost does not necessarily mean a lower overall cost of treatment. A cheaper agent which is less effective or safe just shifts costs to other areas by creating further clinical problems with their attendant costs. The total costs associated with treatment with newer agents are as yet undefined. Restricting the prescription of a particular antibiotic may result in the increased use of an alternative regimen which may cost the same or even more than the original ('cost shifting'). This interesting observation needs to be substantiated with future research. Ciprofloxacin is available in both intravenous and oral formulations and suitable for sequential intravenous-oral therapy with its attendant benefits. It is currently the gold-standard quinolone in the hospital setting for a broad range of infections, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.

      "title": "Treating with esketamine nasal, will increase blood pressure?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Esketamine had been rised as a potential treatment for Resistant Depression, becoming an alternative for the use of Electroconvulsive Therapy. In Spain since 2020, it has been applied for compassionate use but is not widely used. Although Esketamine is defined safe and effective in preliminary studies, there are common side effects which could reduce it use. Objectives Increasing blood pressure has been found commonly in ederly population treated with Esketamine Nasal. Studies showed as very common side effect (10% or more) increasing systolic and diastolic blood pressure which is higher in elderly people. Our aim is to show that esketamine is well tolerated and safe in ederly people without increasing blood pressure, although is combinate with oral antidepressant therapy. Methods Presenting female 65-year-old with 4 years of treatment maintaining a moderate-severe symptoms. Althougt numerous pharmacological strategies have been attempted, with optimal time and maximum doses, which have been progressively withdrawing showing lack of efficacy or appearance of adverse effects. Among the drugs used we find; 11 antidepressants, 3 antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and even lithium, without response after 6 weeks of treatment. Futhermore, patient refusal to receive Electro-Convulsive Therapy. Treating with Esketamine nasal and applying the established guidelines. Results Assess the response to Esketamine Nasal with Montgomery-Asberg depression scale (MADRS) we found that decrease the initial score in 26 points. Evaluating blood pressure before and after each time with no increased value. Conclusions Concluding esketamine is well tolerated and safe in ederly people without increasing blood pressure. These findings and results should be confirmed with futher studies.",

      "abstract": "A 50-year-old woman with serious rheumatism was effectively treated with a combination administration of high doses of estrogens. Presomen (1st-12th day, 3 times daily at 1.25 mg, 13th-23rd day 0.6 mg) and Primosiston (13th-23rd day, 1 tablet 3 times daily) were used. It was inquired as to whether in regard to this particular hormonal substitution there was a contraindication due to the risk of genital carcinoma, and how long such a treatment could be safely undertaken. In response, the author, on the basis of his own clinical experience, considers that conjugated doses of estrogens are generally well taken. The 1.25 mg of Presomen in the first 12 days is considered to be rather high. The risks which are to be seriously considered through the administration of these type or preparations in women during this period are thromboembolism (adiposia, hyperlipidemia, nicotine abuse, operations, and immoblizations being the primary backgrounds). From time to time examinations must be undertaken and the dosage of estrogens reduced.",

In Britain it is used in doses of 1 mg. or 2 mg. daily for the relief of anxiety, but American reports indicate that the drug is also of value in psychotic illnesses (Darling, 1959; Niswander and Karacan, 1959; Taylor, 1959, 1960; Darling et al., 1960; Holt and Wright, 1960). Encouraging results were also obtained in a preliminary study conducted in Britain in a group of patients of whom most were psychotic, and daily doses of 2 or 3 mg. appeared to be effective in relieving anxiety and agitation in a considerable proportion of these cases (Gillman and Sutherland, 1961). In reviewing the human and animal pharmacology of fluphenazine, Heseltine (1961) commented on its differences from earlier drugs like chlorpromazine and triflupromazine. The increased potency of the new drug, which in many pharmacodynamic properties may be about 40 times as potent as chlorpromazine, is associated with a rapid and prolonged action, relatively little sedative activity and little or no increase in autonomic and haemodynamic effects. A trial was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of fluphenazine in the treatment of schizophrenic patients.",

The primary mechanism of action is DNA cross-linking, by irreversibly binding an alkyl group to the guanine base of DNA. This leads to the inhibition of DNA replication and cell division. Cyclophosphamide causes immunosuppression by affecting T-cell–mediated and humoral immunity, mainly proliferating B-lymphocytes. The main use of cyclophosphamide is in combination with other agents in the treatment of lymphomas, leukaemias and solid tumours. Cyclophosphamide is commonly used in conjunction with systemic corticosteroids. Cyclophosphamide should be given early in the day and a high fluid intake should be maintained throughout the day to encourage frequent bladder voiding. The risk of toxicity may be potentiated if cyclophosphamide is used concomitantly with any drug with similar toxicities, such as myelosuppression.",

Although some cocaine- dependent patients will respond well to drug counseling, for many, standard psychosocial treatment is inadequate. Therefore, the development of an effective medication for the treatment of cocaine dependence is a research priority. However, despite many years of research, no medication has emerged as consistently effective for the treatment of cocaine dependence. Progress in the understanding of the neurobiology of cocaine dependence has led to the discovery of several promising medications that have already shown encouraging results in controlled clinical trials. Among more severely addicted patients, propranolol may be helpful in promoting an initial period of stable abstinence. For the prevention of relapse, medications that block cocaine euphoria or reduce cocaine craving have shown promise. Potential relapse-prevention medications include GABAergic medications, such as baclofen, tiagabine, and topiramate, and the glutamatergic medication, modafinil. Surprisingly, an old treatment for alcohol dependence, disulfiram, may also have efficacy for cocaine relapse prevention. Finally, a vaccine capable of stimulating the production of cocaine specific antibodies has shown promise in preliminary studies for the prevention of relapse to cocaine use.",

      "abstract": "There are a substantial number of adverse reactions attributable to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy, particularly of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The stomach is most commonly affected, although injury may occur from esophagus to colon. The incidence of developing serious GI toxicity seems to be three times as great in users compared with nonusers of NSAIDs. Age greater than 60 years, history of GI problems, previous corticosteroid use, and recency of NSAID use seem to increase the risk of toxicity. Short-term studies have found differences in ulceration or bleeding caused by various NSAIDs. However, there are insufficient long-term clinical trials involving adequate numbers of patients to demonstrate substantial advantages for any particular NSAID based on its toxicity profile. Prostaglandin inhibition seems to be one mechanism responsible for the GI toxicity of NSAIDs, but it is probably not the only mechanism. When serious GI bleeding occurs, the NSAID use must be stopped, although omeprazole and misoprostol have been used successfully to treat gastroduodenal ulcerations in patients while continuing NSAID therapy. Misoprostol and possibly omeprazole have effectively prevented GI ulceration associated with NSAID therapy, but questions remain regarding patient selection, length of therapy, and their utility in preventing serious GI bleeding. At this time, routine prophylaxis for patients receiving long-term NSAID therapy cannot be recommended.",

This effect results in a number of clinically important interactions with other drugs, which are now being appreciated. Other effects of cimetidine, such as raising of gastric pH, alteration of liver blood flow, or alterations in renal secretory mechanisms, may also contribute to or result in clinically significant interactions. Current data document appreciable alterations in the metabolism or excretion of warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, lidocaine, certain beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, certain benzodiazepines, and probably narcotic analgesics and procainamide. Thus, effects of these drugs and serum levels, where available, should be more closely followed when used in combination with cimetidine. Cimetidine appears to exacerbate the myelosuppressive effects of the nitrosoureas, and may also significantly alter the absorption of ketoconazole. Though other drugs may affect the absorption or elimination of cimetidine, the clinical implication of these effects is uncertain.",

      "abstract": "Acute pain caused by musculoskeletal disorders is very common and has a significant negative impact on quality-of-life and societal costs. Many types of acute pain have been managed with traditional oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (coxibs). Data from prospective, randomised controlled clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance indicate that use of oral traditional NSAIDs and coxibs is associated with an elevated risk of developing gastrointestinal, renovascular and/or cardiovascular adverse events (AEs). Increasing awareness of the AEs associated with NSAID therapy, including coxibs, has led many physicians and patients to reconsider use of these drugs and look for alternative treatment options. Treatment with NSAIDs via the topical route of administration has been shown to provide clinically effective analgesia at the site of application while minimising systemic absorption. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic potency of the traditional oral NSAID diclofenac, along with its physicochemical properties, makes it well suited for topical delivery. Several topical formulations of diclofenac have been developed. A topical patch containing diclofenac epolamine 1.3% (DETP, FLECTOR(®) Patch), approved for use in Europe in 1993, has recently been approved for use in the United States and is indicated for the treatment of acute pain caused by minor strains, sprains and contusions.

Measurements of the serum concentration are part of the quality control in the pharmacological part of the treatment. Consequently it is also important when the laboratory assess the test results that the requests indicate whether the patient takes oral contraceptives preferably including the name of the medication. It is a common phenomenon that women omit the use of oral contraceptives when asked about other medications they may be taking as they dont consider oral contraceptives to be an actual medication. Therefore it is useful to ask the patient explicitly if she takes oral contraceptives. (excerpt)",

      "abstract": "One of the main disadvantages of orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances is the formation of demineralisations around the brackets. These demineralisations develop because the brackets produce an increased number of plaque retention sites and a change in the oral environment, resulting in a different plaque composition. To prevent the formation of these demineralisations several methods are used during orthodontic treatment. Using additional fluoride is the best solution, for example, rinsing daily with a fluoride mouthwash, applying a fluoride varnish during every scheduled check-up, or using toothpaste with a high concentration of fluoride. The last 2 methods are less effectively incorporated in daily practice in the Netherlands due to financial or time factors. Additional measures, like using fluoride-releasing adhesives, CPP-ACP(F) or a chlorhexidine rinse appear to be less effective in reducing demineralisations. It is also important to provide specific oral hygiene and dietary instructions, based on an individual risk assessment.",

      "abstract": "Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic that has been used as a topical, oral, or injectable formulation for over five decades. It exhibits a narrow spectrum of microbiologic activity, primarily against gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. In dermatology, clindamycin has been used primarily as a topical agent, usually for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Despite questions surrounding antibiotic resistance and/or its relative contribution to antibiotic treatment efficacy, a large body of data support the therapeutic value of topical clindamycin for acne vulgaris. As a systemic agent, clindamycin is used orally to treat a variety of cutaneous bacterial infections, and sometimes for acne vulgaris, with oral treatment for the latter less common in more recent years. The modes of action of clindamycin are supported by data showing both its anti-inflammatory and antibiotic mechanisms, which are discussed here along with pharmacokinetic profiles and structure-activity relationships. The diverse applications of clindamycin for multiple disease states, its efficacy, and safety considerations are also reviewed here, including for both topical and systemic formulations. Emphasis is placed on uses in dermatology, but other information on clindamycin relevant to clinicians is also discussed.",

      "title": "Pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation.",
      "abstract": "Nicotine dependence and the role of various pharmacotherapeutic adjuncts in the medical management of nicotine withdrawal and smoking cessation are reviewed. Nicotine has been shown to be the drug in tobacco that causes addiction. The nicotine withdrawal syndrome is primarily characterized by craving, irritability, frustration, anger, anxiety, poor concentration, restlessness, weight gain, and decreased heart rate. Pharmacotherapeutic interventions can be classified into four groups: therapy that (1) replaces nicotine, (2) antagonizes nicotine, (3) provides symptomatic treatment for nicotine withdrawal, and (4) deters smoking. Nicotine replacement therapy with nicotine polacrilex gum has had minimal effect on increasing-smoking cessation among patients seen in a general medical practice setting. It is most effective in nicotine dependent smokers when it is used concomitantly with behavioral or psychological counseling. Nicotine antagonist therapy with mecamylamine may be useful in recalcitrant cases of nicotine dependence. Clonidine, in both oral and transdermal forms, has been shown to be effective for reduction of symptoms and craving associated with smoking cessation. Research on using the tricyclic antidepressants imipramine and doxepin to promote smoking cessation by reducing withdrawal symptoms is in its preliminary phases. Lobeline, an alkaloid with effects similar to those of nicotine, is an FDA Category III drug (i.e., safe, but of unknown efficacy) and is available without prescription. Silver acetate chewing gum deters smoking by producing an unpleasant metallic taste on concomitant ingestion of the agent and tobacco. It is an FDA Category III drug and is available without prescription. Drugs used in therapy of nicotine withdrawal include nicotine replacements, nicotine antagonists, agents to lessen the symptoms of withdrawal, and smoking deterrents. None of the drugs is completely effective. Successful drug use for smoking cessation involves consideration of the psychological, as well as physiological, aspects of nicotine addiction.",

      "title": "Exenatide-Induced Eosinophil-Rich Granulomatous Panniculitis",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Recently, we read with interest the case reported by Shan and Guo,1 in which an eosinophilic sclerosing lipogranuloma was described at the injection site of exenatide. Exenatide LAR is a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, which offers the potential of 24-hour glycemic control, weight reduction,2 and shows benefits on lipid profile and blood pressure3 with a novel once-weekly treatment. Exenatide is encapsulated in microspheres of poly-(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG), which after their subcutaneous injection form an amalgam, hydrolyze into lactic acid and glycolic acid, and finally are eliminated as carbon dioxide and water, while the drug diffuses out slowly in 1–2 weeks.4 Its most common adverse event affects the gastrointestinal tract such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, as well as headache.5 The predominant injection site reactions are bumps and itching, which resolve in a few weeks. A 50-year-old overweight woman with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia was admitted into the Dermatology Service with nodules and pruritus on her lower abdomen. Physical exploration showed 3 erythematous firm nodules of 1 or 2 cm in diameter at the site of exenatide injection (Fig. 1), which started 1 month earlier. The most recent lesion that appeared 3 days after the last injection was excised. The specimen revealed a mixed lobular and septal panniculitis, fat necrosis, and granulomatous inflammation with numerous eosinophils and scattered foreign body–type giant cells.1–6 Numerous nonpolarizable rounded structures corresponding to the injected material (microspheres of PLG with exenatide) were identified (Fig. 2).FIGURE 1: Three erythematous firm nodules at the site of exenatide injection on patient's lower abdomen.FIGURE 2: A, Lobular and septal eosinophil-rich granulomatous panniculitis. B, Granulomatous inflammation with numerous eosinophils and scattered foreign body–type giant cells. C, Nonpolarizable rounded structures corresponding to the injected material (microspheres of PLG with exenatide). D, An amalgam of microspheres of PLG slightly refractile lowering condensator. Hematoxylin-eosin stain, original magnifications: A, ×10; B, ×400; C, ×200; D, ×200.Only 2 cases of exenatide-induced panniculitis have been previously described.1–6 Before Shan and Guo's description, Boysen and Stone6 reported 1 case of eosinophil-rich granulomatous panniculitis caused by exenatide injection. As in our patient, both cases showed a lobular or mixed lobular and septal panniculitis with an inflammatory infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils.1–6 We present a novel case of exenatide-induced eosinophil-rich granulomatous panniculitis and the first one in which the injected material was identified. Previous cases did not show the injected material, probably because of its early reabsorption. This is the first report describing the histopathologic appearance of the microspheres of PLG, which form a capsule around exenatide, allowing a slow release of the injected drug. The morphology of those particles is quite characteristic, so it should be known by dermatopathologists as a new foreign body substance that may be microscopically identified. Differential diagnosis includes other granulomatous reactions with rounded foreign bodies,7 especially dermal fillers8 such as silicone (round empty vacuoles of different sizes and translucent angulated foreign bodies), paraffin (subcutaneous fat with Swiss cheese appearance, cystic spaces of variable size, and sclerotic collagen bundles \"sclerosing lipogranuloma\"), polymethylmethacrylate microspheres in bovine collagen gel (rounded vacuoles of similar shape and size that mimic normal adipocytes, involvement of dermis and subcutaneous fat), hyaluronic acid with dextran microspheres [suppurative granuloma, basophilic amorphous material (hyaluronic acid), and spherical dark bluish particles (dextranomer)],9 and alginate fillers (spherical structures with basophilic material).10 Although it has been speculated that the eosinophilic reaction might be associated with lack of enzyme to the PLG,1 in our opinion, an allergic reaction to exenatide could not be excluded as the pathogenic mechanism because PLG microspheres are converted into lactic and glycolic acids, substances widely distributed throughout the human body. In conclusion, we report the first case of exenatide-induced eosinophil-rich granulomatous panniculitis in which the injected material can be identified as numerous nonpolarizable rounded structures corresponding to the microspheres of PLG with exenatide.",

      "abstract": "Exendin-4 has been clinically exploited for treating type 2 diabetes, but the short circulation half-life and multiple daily injections limit its widespread application with respect to poor patient compliance, low efficacy, and high treatment cost. In this study, a potent long-acting release system based on biomimetic mineralization was constructed for biocompatible and sustained exendin-4 delivery. Similar to natural biomineralization, exendin-4 can be mineralized to form nanosized mineral solids by means of the reaction between acidic amino acid residues and calcium ions in a supersaturated environment with negligible influence on peptide bioactivity. Mineralized exendin-4 particles may be spontaneously absorbed by a living body under physiologically supersaturated conditions, resulting in gradual dissociation and sustained drug release. In such a way, the glucose level of diabetic mice may be effectively controlled for a long period of time by mineralized exendin-4 without obvious side effects. We believe this biomimetic formulation can serve as a promising candidate for future clinical applications for type 2 diabetes therapies.",

Oral drug delivery has been known for decades as the most widely utilized route among all the routes that have been employed for the systemic delivery of drug via various pharmaceutical products of different dosage forms. The reasons that the oral route achieved such popularity may be in part attributed to its ease of administration, belief that by oral administration of the drug is well absorbed. All the pharmaceutical products formulated for systemic delivery via the oral route of administration irrespective of the mode of delivery (immediate, sustained or controlled release) and the design of dosage forms (either solid dispersion (or) liquid), must be developed within the intrinsic characteristics of GI physiology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and formulation design to achieve a systemic approach to the successful development of an oral pharmaceutical dosage form. Fexofenadine hydrochloride is a H1 receptor antagonist and used in urticaria and rhinitis. It is available in market as film coated tablet forms having poor release drug profiles. In this study it was tried to formulate fexofenadine hydrochloride film coated tablet by wet granulation, to improve the drug release profiles. \r\n\r\nA total of nine trials of fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets were formulated by wet granulation method.

Based on the preliminary studies various formulation trials (F1-F9) were carried out with different concentration of diluents, disintegrants, and binder. From the various formulations, the formulation F9 was finalized as the ideal formula, based on the different parameters which were compared with innovator, which proved to be successful. So it was planned to develop a new fexofenadine hydrochloride film coated tablet by using hydroxypropyl methylcellulose film polymer in aqueous based solvent system and this coated formulation was evaluated for disintegration test, assay, drug release studies and short term stability studies. When subjected to accelerated stability studies the tablet were found to be stable. Hence stable tablets with an improved drug dissolution profile were suceesfully formulated.",

Levetiracetam is an adjunctive treatment for partial-onset epileptic seizures. This drug inhibits seizure activity via a mechanism that does not involve excitatory or inhibitory neuronal pathways. Oral bioavailability is about 100%, and food does not alter absorption. Levetiracetam is minimally plasma protein bound (10%). Peak time to absorption after oral administration is one hour, and steady state is achieved in two days with twice-daily administration. Three clinical studies have demonstrated levetiracetam's ability to reduce seizure frequency in patients with partial-onset epilepsy. The most commonly reported adverse effects in clinical trials were somnolence, dizziness, infection, and asthenia. The potential for interactions with medications that are hepatically metabolized is minimal. The starting dosage is 500 mg twice a day; the maximum dosage is 3000 mg/day within four weeks. Levetiracetam is effective as an adjunctive treatment of partial-onset epilepsy with or without secondary generalization.",

      "abstract": "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is one of the common cause of abnormal vaginal discharge which enhances the acquisition and transmission of a range of sexually transmitted infections. The currently available antibiotics for BV must be administered to patients for 5 to 7 days and studies have shown that nearly 50% patients do not comply with this lengthy treatment regimen. Secnidazole, a second-generation 5-nitroimidazole is developed in a novel oral granule formulation with a broad spectrum of activity against anaerobic bacteria. Based on the phase II and phase III data this molecule received its US FDA approval in September 2017. Secnidazole oral granules offers a valuable advantage since it has longer half-life (∼17 hours) which makes it suitable for single-dose therapy and also has a novel method of administration where the granules taken orally by sprinkling onto yogurt or pudding, without regard to the timing of meals. Also, it does not interfere with combined oral contraceptive and spares lactobacilli, a characteristic which is desirable in drugs used to treat BV. The complexity of current treatment regimen can decrease the patient’s compliance and a single dose treatment option with secnidazole oral granules may improve treatment adherence, which may be beneficial for both patients and health care practitioners. Secnidazole is the first new oral antibiotic to treat BV in more than a decade and will provide physicians with a new treatment option. This review was conducted by searching the databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for articles.",

      "abstract": "Summary Various techniques have been explored to prolong the duration and improve the efficacy of local anaesthetic nerve blocks. Some of these involve mixing local anaesthetics or adding adjuncts. We did a literature review of studies published between 01 May 2011 and 01 May 2021 that studied specific combinations of local anaesthetics and adjuncts. The rationale behind mixing long‐ and short‐acting local anaesthetics to hasten onset and extend duration is flawed on pharmacokinetic principles. Most local anaesthetic adjuncts are not licensed for use in this manner and the consequences of untested admixtures and adjuncts range from making the solution ineffective to potential harm. Pharmaceutical compatibility needs to be established before administration. The compatibility of drugs from the same class cannot be inferred and each admixture requires individual review. Precipitation on mixing (steroids, non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs) and subsequent embolisation can lead to serious adverse events, although these are rare. The additive itself or its preservative can have neurotoxic (adrenaline, midazolam) and/or chondrotoxic properties (non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs). The prolongation of block may occur at the expense of motor block quality (ketamine) or block onset (magnesium). Adverse effects for some adjuncts appear to be dose‐dependent and recommendations concerning optimal dosing are lacking. An important confounding factor is whether studies used systemic administration of the adjunct as a control to accurately identify an additional benefit of perineural administration. The challenge of how best to prolong block duration while minimising adverse events remains a topic of interest with further research required.",

However, recent evidence has shown that the behavioural effects of zolpidem are generally similar to those of BDZs. Flumazenil is usually considered to be a BDZ antagonist. Nonetheless, in chronic BDZ users, it acts as a partial, bland agonist. We describe two cases of zolpidem dependence that were detoxified by the use of flumazenil infusion. BDZ dependence is usually treated with tapering of the medication. As an alternative, abrupt discontinuation of the medication and rapid detoxification using flumazenil has been used. Flumazenil may represent an alternative to detoxification treatment by employing a tapering approach, or by replacement therapy with BDZs with a long half-life, particularly where patients are hard to treat or have low compliance to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: To review the history of clinical use of corticosteroids with particular reference to adjunctive therapy for severe pediatric sepsis and, in this context, to provide an overview of what is known, what is not known, and what research questions are particularly relevant at this time. Data Source: Literature review using PubMed, cross-referenced article citations, and the Internet. Conclusions: The history of corticosteroid use in clinical medicine has been colorful, noisy, and always controversial. Therapeutic corticosteroid indications that initially seemed rational have frequently been refuted on closer, rigorous clinical trial inspection. Although it may be prudent to provide stress-dose steroids to children with septic shock who are clinically at risk for adrenal insufficiency (chronic or recent steroid use, purpura fulminans, etomidate or ketoconazole administration, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal disease), the safety and efficacy of stress-dose steroids as general adjunctive therapy for pediatric septic shock have not been established. Glucocorticoid administration does add potential risk to critically ill children. In particular, although adjunctive corticosteroids may hasten resolution of unstable hemodynamics in septic shock, this may occur at the metabolic cost of hyperglycemia. Clinical practice that fosters innovative therapy (off-label use) over research probably represents bad medical and social policy. Accordingly, pediatric critical care researchers have a responsibility to generate pediatric-specific evidence-based medicine for adjunctive corticosteroid therapy for severe sepsis in children.",

      "title": "Penicillamine",
      "abstract": "In the last ten years there have been a number of placebo-controlled studies of penicillamine in rheumatoid arthritis. All of these show it to be better than placebo. Prospective controlled studies and uncontrolled evaluations of the drug in clinical practice show that it reduces the degree of acute synovial inflammation, reduces the elevated ESR of active disease, and also lowers other acute-phase changes. It has more debatable effects on immunological abnormalities and other variables such as glutathione and sulphydryl levels, but these all show some evidence of improvement. There is little direct evidence that it reduces the chronic progressive joint destruction of rheumatoid synovitis, which can be measured radiologically. It often causes adverse reactions, is often ineffective, and although it improves many variables these do not often return completely to normal. There is minimal evidence that it actually changes the long-term outcome in rheumatoid disease. Interpretation of the studies indicates that penicillamine is a useful antirheumatic drug. The question is how to improve upon therapy. There are several methods open, including the use of combinations of second-line drugs, or starting treatment with drugs like penicillamine very early in the course of the disease. Will further placebo-controlled trials help resolve these questions or do we need another type of approach? As all the traditional studies have a very high dropout rate their conclusions have certain limitations and there is a need for a different type of study. The value of the traditional approach to testing drugs like penicillamine is clearly very limited.",

Management can be extremely challenging, with evidence base for therapy extremely limited, and a spectrum of symptomology that can be severely debilitating.<sup>1</sup> Nabilone is a synthetic cannabinoid designed to mimic the activity of delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Nabilone is a partial agonist of both CB1 and CB2 receptors, and is licensed, and indicated by NICE guidance, for use in adults as adjunctive therapy alongside standard anti-emetic for chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting. It has also been used widely in paediatrics for the same indication, despite not being licensed for use in children.<sup>2</sup> There has been significant interest in the use of medical cannabis to treat the spectrum of symptomology that manifest in gut dystonia yet limited published work in reporting the effectiveness of nabilone in treating gut dystonia. However, there is emerging anecdotal and case reports from clinical practice suggesting a role for nabilone.<sup>1</sup> <h3>Method</h3> From October 2022 to June 2023, patients referred and accepted to the Great Ormond Street Hospital palliative care service, for end-of-life care, were considered for use of nabilone to manage gut dystonia that had proven resistant to normal dystonia management strategies (e.g., optimisation of gabapentin, clonidine, baclofen etc.). Nabilone was initiated following approval for use by trust DTC and in discussion with the neuro-disability team. Families of patients commenced on nabilone were requested to complete a dystonia diary and reviewed weekly assessing for effectiveness and toxicity. Notes and charts were reviewed in triplicate by consultant in paediatric palliative, specialty registrar and specialist pharmacist, to ensure consensus agreement on the effectiveness of nabilone as well as any potential incidence of toxicity. <h3>Results</h3> One patient was initiated on nabilone for gut dystonia during the study period. Weight at initiation of nabilone was 16.45 kg. Weight after 9 months (June 2023) was 19.45 kg. Observed dystonia and feed tolerance improved significantly, enabling the child to return to school, and there was a significant reduction in number of dystonic breakthrough medications required, from daily use of chloral hydrate to infrequent use at night. Following optimisation of nabilone, gabapentin has been weaned with no observed increase in dystonic episodes. Additionally, despite increased weight there has been no requirement to increase doses of clonidine. There were no parenteral or professional observations of any adverse effects associated with nabilone initiation or titration. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Nabilone can be safely initiated for children with gut dystonia that has proven resistant to other conventional medications used for dystonia management. Use of nabilone has demonstrated a subjective and objective improvement in tone and an increase in ability to tolerate feeds with weight gain, that has persisted despite weaning of other concomitant medications. <h3>References</h3> McConnel N, Beattie LM, Richards CE, Protheroe S, Barclay AR.

This resistance may be prevented, among others, by combined treatment with gentamicin and an antibiotic of the beta lactam group. When gentamicin is used correctly, it will have few toxic side-effects. Thus, 3 mg/kg of body weight three times daily will usually be indicated to ensure an optimum therapeutic effect. Parenteral administration of gentamicin would only appear to be useful in cases of bacteraemia and/or bacterial infection of the kidney and/or urinary excretory ducts; in the last-named case, the dose given at one time may be reduced by fifty per cent. Local treatment, the most recent method of which consists in administration by I(ntra-)T(racheal) route, apparently offers more prospects.",

It appears that it can be added safely to diazepam therapy over an extended period, though it is unknown whether the combination is better than benzodiazepines alone. As no serious adverse effects have been noted, flumazenil may be tried in benzodiazepine-tolerant patients. Although reversal of tolerance has not been demonstrated clearly, flumazenil is not likely to decrease the efficacy of the benzodiazepines. Patients unresponsive to conventional antiepileptics, including those with generalized seizures, may benefit from adjunctive flumazenil therapy. Previously untreated patients should be given benzodiazepines or other standard therapy until more studies are performed. Currently, no adequately designed long-term trials have been conducted on treatment of epilepsy using flumazenil, rendering evaluation of its use as a single-agent antiepileptic difficult. Without such controlled studies, flumazenil's effects in the clinical setting can only be speculated.",

The techniques employed to micronize the powder, the polymers used, and the main results have been classified according to the type of release required in different categories, such as delayed, immediate, prolonged, sustained, and targeted release formulations. Indeed, depending on the pathology to be treated, it is possible to achieve specific therapeutic objectives, ensuring that the drug is released at a higher or lower dissolution rate (if compared to conventional drugs) and/or at a different time and/or in a specific site of action.",

      "abstract": "Modern methods of drug delivery have been in development since the 1950s. The first of these was the Spansule ®, which was a sustained drug release capsule capable of delivering a drug for up to 12 hours after oral administration. The 1980s saw the introduction of longer acting injectable and implantable drug delivery options with time ranges of days to months or even years. The improvements in the timespan over which drugs could be released were accompanied by developments in the classes of drugs that could be administered. Initially, only small molecules could be released by such systems but the introduction of PEGylated proteins and drug-polymer complexes in the '70s and '90s made protein and peptide based drugs feasible [1]. Despite the many benefits of long term drug delivery systems, many of these systems still fall prey to the drawbacks of nonspecific drug delivery. Mainly, these are: a lack of drug affinity for the target site, a need for a large drug dose in order to achieve a high local concentration of drug, and nonspecific toxicity and other adverse side effects arising from large drug doses [2]. Researchers have increasingly sought to mitigate these undesirable effects by creating drug delivery systems with better targeting capabilities.",

      "abstract": "In the study of a large series of phenyl propylamines several members of the group were found to possess greater bronchodilator activity than ephedrine with little or no pressor action. According to stability and activity the methoxyphenylisopropylamines seemed most interesting. The intravenous toxicities, pressor actions, and bronchodilator properties of 14 of these amines are reported. Ortho-methoxy-β-phenylisopropyl methylamine hydrochloride (‘Orthoxine’), because of its relatively high activity and low toxicity, was investigated further with the following results:\n\n1. In perfusion experiments with isolated lungs using pilocarpine, histamine, or acetyicholine as the constrictor agents, ‘Orthoxine’ was found to be on the average a much more effective agent than ephedrine for relieving bronchoconstriction. Against pilocarpine and histamine it is more than twice as effective as ephedrine and about 1/5 to 1/20 as effective as epinephrine.\n\n2. When tested for activity in relieving intestinal smooth-muscle spasms, using isolated strips of jejunum or ileum, ‘Orthoxine’ was found to be 4 to 8 times as effective as ephedrine against the spasmogenic agents, histamine, acetylcholine and barium chloride. Compared to epinephrine, ‘Orthoxine’ is about 1/10 as effective a barium chloride antagonist. In quieting the normal contractions of the unstimulated intestinal muscle, ‘Orthoxine’ is 5 times as effective as ephedrine. On the non-pregnant uterus, ‘Orthoxine’ is only 1/2 as active as ephedrine in stimulating the muscle to contraction.\n\n3. ‘Orthoxine’ produces little or no pressor response, possessing at most in this regard 1/2000 the activity of epinephrine and 1/8 that of ephedrine. Four times as much ‘Orthoxine’ as ephedrine must be administered to normal dogs to produce the bradycardia characteristic of the latter.\n\n4. Inhibition of histamine bronchoconstriction, vasodepression, and smooth-muscle spasm shows that ‘Orthoxine’ possesses antihistaminic properties. The intestinal smooth-muscle tests indicate that the order of activity is 1/20 that of ‘Benadryl’ but is much greater than that of ephedrine.\n\n5. Except for a higher intravenous toxicity, acute and chronic toxicity tests in rats, rabbits and guinea pigs show that the toxicity of ‘Orthoxine’ is of the same order as that of ephedrine. No pathological changes were found after the continuous daily administration of either 20 or 100 mgm. per kgm. doses for 21 days.\n\n6. The pharmacological properties of ‘Orthoxine’ suggest that it may be of value in the treatment of asthma, for which it is presently being clinically evaluated.",

      "abstract": "Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, ethoxzolamide and dichlorophenamide were and still are widely used systemic antiglaucoma drugs. Their mechanism of action consists in inhibition of CA isozymes present in ciliary processes of the eye (such as CA II, IV and XII), with the consequent reduction of bicarbonate and aqueous humour secretion, and of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) characteristic of this disease. Since CA II/IV/XII are present in many other tissues/organs, generally, systemic CAIs possess undesired side effects such as numbness and tingling of extremities; metallic taste; depression; fatigue; malaise; weight loss; decreased libido; gastrointestinal irritation; metabolic acidosis; renal calculi and transient myopia. In order to avoid these undesired side effects, recently, topically effective CAIs have been developed. Two drugs are available clinically: dorzolamide and brinzolamide. Both these drugs are applied topically as water solutions/suspensions, alone or in combination with other agents (such as β- blockers, prostaglandin derivatives, etc) and produce a consistent and prolonged reduction of IOP. Furthermore, recent reports show both the systemically as well as topically acting sulfonamide CAIs to be effective in the treatment of macular oedema and other macular degeneration diseases, for which pharmacological treatment was unavailable up to now. Much research is in act in the search of even more effective topically acting CAIs, free of the inconveniences and side effects of the presently available drugs. For achieving this goal, a recently reported strategy, the tail approach, was extensively applied for the synthesis of large numbers of derivatives possessing various physico-chemical properties. Many such new sulfonamides showed promising antiglaucoma activity in animal models of the disease.

Esta especie del filo Basidiomycota, originaria de Mesoamérica, produce alcaloides como la psilocibina y su derivado desfosforilado, la psilocina. Se ha estudiado el potencial de estos compuestos en el tratamiento contra distintas enfermedades como la depresión, la ansiedad, el trastorno de déficit de atención, el estrés postraumático y el trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo. Los hongos que acumulan psilocibina no suelen ser tóxicos para el consumo, pero sí pueden tener efectos colaterales como náuseas, vómito, dolor de cabeza, aumento del ritmo cardíaco y de la presión sanguínea.

Dosage forms are made of liquid (such as sprays), and dosage forms in a variety of sizes of tablets, wafers, films, patches dose forms that are partially solid (such as gels and drops), and tablets. Standard dosage types include. The biological factors are frequently impacted, which can decrease the formulation’s proximity to the skin. A mucosa could cause unpredictably high medication retention. Numerous things have happened for composition improvements to increase the utilization and retention of medicines in the buccal area and the sublingual area. The physiologic components that will be covered in this primer the development of nanoparticulate delivery systems for drugs, and how it affects buccal and sublingual administration of drugs ways to administering sublingually and buccally therapeutic advancement pathways with compositions that have passed testing for clinical approval will also be covered.",

      "title": "Efficient methods of therapy of pediatric functional constipation",
      "abstract": "Constipation holds an important place among the functional gastrointestinal disorders. The following are among the main reasons for the development of functional constipation: alimentary factors, impaired nervous and endocrine regulation (functional immaturity of the colon, perinatal injury of the central nervous system, endocrine disease), psychosomatic factors, hypodynamia, previous intestinal infections, iatrogenic effects, food allergies and anorectal pathology, genetic predisposition. Treatment of constipation should be comprehensive and include lifestyle maneuvers, dietary recommendations, dietary fibres and water schedule, pharmacotherapy, biofeedback, and surgical methods. Stimulant laxatives (sodium picosulfate, bisacodyl) are effective drugs among the medications used to treat constipation. A sodium picosulfate drug is an effective stimulant laxative, which has a triple effect: stimulation of bowel movements, reduction of the evacuation time and softening stools. The efficacy and safety of the drug was studied in a multicenter, parallel, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in patients with chronic constipation. The article presents our own experience – a clinical observation – of the use of sodium picosulfate. 26 children with chronic constipation aged from 1 to 7 years, who had stool retention from 3 to 7 days, were observed. The inclusion of a stimulant sodium picosulfate laxative in the comprehensive functional chronic constipation therapy in children aged 1 to 7 years at age-specific dosage variances for 7 days showed high clinical efficacy, which resulted in the normalization of stool in 76.9% of children, facilitating bowel movements and improvement of children’s well-being. This drug can be recommended in the comprehensive therapy of functional constipation in children.",

      "title": "Importance of pharmaceutical composition and evidence from clinical trials and pharmacological studies in determining effectiveness of chondroitin sulphate and other glycosaminoglycans: a critique",
      "abstract": "Chondroitin sulphate (CS) has attracted much interest over the past two decades or so as a biological agent for use in the relief of pain and joint symptoms in osteoarthritis. Earlier clinical investigations produced variable, if encouraging results. This variability was partly due to limitations on the study designs and the lack of availability of standardized CS. Recently, high quality and fully standardized CS (Condrosulf) has become available and its effects have been studied in large-scale osteoarthritis trials, which are discussed here.There is now evidence for symptom- and structure-modifying (radiologically-observed) effects. These studies show that CS (a) has slow onset of response and that relief of pain may not be like that of the direct analgesic actions of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), (b) there are indications of reduced need for intake of analgesics (e.g. NSAIDs) in patients taking CS, and (c) quality of life and cost-benefits may be associated with use of CS. Safety evaluations show that the incidence of adverse reactions is low. Pharmacokinetic studies indicate that although oral absorption is relatively fast CS has moderate oral bioavailability (15-24%) and that depolymerised and degraded CS that is evident after absorption, together with CS itself, may take some time to accumulate in target joints. The pharmacodynamic actions of CS indicate that it has anti-inflammatory effects that include multiple actions involving reduction of catabolic reactions and enhanced anabolic (proteoglycan) synthetic reactions in cartilage and may block osteoclast activation in bone. Further studies are required to (a) establish the effects of depolymerised and degraded CS on degradation of cartilage and bone in vitro, and (b) MRI and other investigations of the effects in osteoarthritis of long-term CS treatment.The findings from this review show there may be potential value of CS in reducing the dependence on intake of NSAIDs and analgesics in patients with osteoarthritis, while at the same time having favourable safety.",

      "title": "Formulation and Evaluation of Levofloxacin Oral Dispersible Tablets",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:Oral disintegrating tablets are solid single unit dosage forms that are placed on\r\ntongue, allowed to disperse or dissolve in saliva without the need of water, frequently\r\nreleasing of the drug for quick onset of action. Oral disintegrating tablets are well\r\naccepted by wide range of population especially as pediatric and geriatric patients\r\nwho have difficulty in swallowing of conventional dosage forms. Some drugs are\r\nabsorbed from mouth, pharynx and esophagus as saliva passes down to stomach. The\r\nbioavailability of such drug will be increase due to first pass metabolism1.\r\nConsumer satisfaction is the buzzword of the current millennium, and\r\nmovement to achieve it has already begun in the pharmaceutical industry. An inability\r\nor un willingness to swallow solid oral dosage forms such as tablets and poor taste of\r\nmedicine are some of the important reasons for consumer dissatisfaction.AIM AND OBJECTIVE:F or the past two decades, there has been enhanced demand for more patient\r\ncompliance dosage forms. As a result, the demand for their technologies has been\r\nincreasing three fold annually. Since the development cost of a new chemical entity is\r\nvery high, the pharmaceutical companies are focusing on the development of new\r\ndrug delivery systems for existing drug with an improved efficacy and bioavailability\r\ntogether with dosing frequency to minimize side effects.\r\nThis results in slower dissolution and absorption rates on oral administration\r\nand is one of the causes of gastro intestinal side effects\r\nImprovement in drug solubility expected to enhance its bioavailability and\r\nreduce local side effects\r\nDifficulty in swallowing (dysphasia) is a common problem of all age groups,\r\nespecially the elderly and pediatrics, because of physiological changes associated with\r\nthese groups. Other categories also several problems in using conventional oral\r\ndosage forms include the mentally ill, uncooperative patients suffering from nausea,\r\nsudden episodes of allergic attack or coughing. Sometimes it may be difficult to\r\nswallow conventional products due to nonavailability of water. These problems led to\r\nthe development of levofloxacin as mouth dissolving tablets. Which disintegrate and\r\ndissolve in saliva without the need of drinking water. The saliva serves to rapidly\r\ndisperse the dosage form and the dissolved medicament is swallowed along with\r\nsaliva in normal way. As the dissolved medicaments along with saliva passes down\r\ninto stomach, they are absorbed from the mouth, pharynx, and oesophagus. Therefore\r\nthe bioavailability of levofloxacin is significantly greater than those observed from\r\nconventional levofloxacin dosage forms.SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: Oral dispersible Tablets of Levofloxacin were prepared with two different\r\nsuperdisintegrants and evaluation of blend powder, tablets evaluation studies, IR\r\nspectral studies, dissolution studies and stability studies were performed .The\r\nsummary are presented.\r\nPreformulation studies such as angle of repose, bulk density, tapped density,\r\ncompressibility index and hausner ratio were performed and the results\r\nshowed that all the parameters are within the acceptable limits.\r\nTablets were prepared by direct compression method and evaluated for general\r\nappearance, hardness test, uniformity of weight, friability, wetting time,\r\ndisintegration time, drug content estimation and in vitro release study. All the\r\nformulations were found to be good appearance without showing any\r\nchipping, capping and sticking defects and all other parameters were passed\r\nthe test.\r\nIR spectroscopic studies indicated that the drug is compatible with all the\r\npolymers and there was no drug-polymer interaction.\r\nWhen comparing all the formulations, F7 shows a better drug release of\r\n96.10% at the end of 15 minutes.\r\nAll the formulations were subjected for stability studies for 45 days at\r\ndifferent temperatures such as room temperature, fridge temperature and\r\naccelerated temperature (45°C±2°C). At 15 days interval upto 45 days, the\r\ndrug content and dissolution studies were carried out. There was no significant\r\nchange in the drug content and invitro drug release.\r\nThe main objective of the present study was to develop Oral dispersible tablet\r\nformulation containing 150mg of Levofloxacin for the treatment of a number of\r\ninfections including infection of Joints and bones, respiratory tract infections, urinary\r\ntract infections, skin structural infections and typhoid fever etc. In the present work it\r\nhas been observed from all formulations of precompression and post compression\r\nstudies were given within the limit of values. The in vitro dissolution data, FLOT-\r\n7(combination of different superdisintegrants) formulation was found that the drug\r\nrelease is best and the cumulative % of drug release was 96.10 % respectively, when\r\ncompared to other formulation.",

      "title": "Stability problems of pediatric parenteral nutrition solutions",
      "abstract": "Parenteral nutrition (PN) must be considered an intravenous medication, containing over 50 ingredients and additives. Thus, the stability of the final product is always under risk. PN can be received in two ways: from a ready-to-use bag or from an individually tailored bag, both in adults and in pediatric patients. Pediatric PN admixtures are more susceptible than adult PN admixtures due to their nature. Patients who receive PN often need to receive parenteral medications concomitantly, and separate administration is challenging most of the time. Here we report two problems with stability encountered with pediatric PN bags. In the first case, the main focus is on the compatibility of heparin with PN. Compatibility of the medications via the Y-site or a three-way stopcock must be examined in such cases. If the medication is incompatible with PN, administration via the Y-site or addition into the PN mixture should be avoided. Emulsion disruption caused by heparin is a known example of incompatibility for pediatric PN. In the second case, the main focus is on the additives and their amount in the pediatric PN mixture. Compounding pediatric PN is mixing numerous additives in a small volume, which results in a highly concentrated solution that often causes calcium–phosphate precipitation. This may lead to serious consequences, including death. All the possible causes of instability, even the temperature of the environment, must be considered. In pediatric PN solutions, the cooperation between physicians and pharmacists is necessary for maintaining safe nutritional treatment.",

      "title": "Single total dose infusion of ferumoxytol (1020 mg in 30 minutes) is an improved method of administration of intravenous iron",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: In June, 2009, ferumoxytol, a paramagnetic iron formulation originally designed as a magnetic resonance contrast agent, was approved for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. The labeled method of administration was a single vial consisting of 510 mg in 17 mL, administered as fast as one mL/s or as fast as 17 seconds. As is the case with all formulations of intravenous iron, a varying amount of labile free iron is released upon administration.1 Labile free iron is associated with a host of different infusion reactions consisting of transient flushing and myalgia with or without urticaria, the so called Fishbane reaction, or other minor infusion reactions.2 These reactions are self-limited, resolve without therapy and may be due to complement activation related pseudoallergy.3 Unfortunately, these reactions are often mistaken for severe hypersensitivity with resultant treatment with vasopressors and/or antihistamines, converting the minor infusion reaction to a hemodynamically significant serious adverse event, ostensibly attributable to the intravenous iron. True, severe hypersensitivity reactions due to mast cell activation are extremely rare and occur in fewer than 1:200 000 administrations.4 Given concerns about possible serious adverse events, albeit rare from postmarketing reports, in 2015 the label was modified to include a boxed warning to highlight the potential for serious adverse events and ways to possibly mitigate them. In addition, the approved rate of infusion was changed from the 17 seconds bolus administration to at least a 15 minutes infusion for the 510 mg dose. In our practice we administered the first 90 doses over the approved 17-second interval and observed three episodes of self-limited hypotension.5 The infusion rate was subsequently reduced to ∼three minutes and the next 4000 doses were administered without a hypotensive episode or other clinically significant adverse event. Whether the mechanism involved clearance of labile free iron, or so called \"anaphylactoxins\" C3a and C5a induced by complement activation, it was apparent fewer adverse reactions occurred with the slower rate of administration.2, 6, 7 From our experience and from published evidence, it became readily apparent that the dose of ferumoxytol was not related to the presence or absence of adverse events. Subsequently in 2012 we performed a prospective study under an investigator IND (112001) to administer a total dose infusion (1020 mg) at a single administration.8 Sixty iron deficient patients 18 years old or greater received 1020 mg of ferumoxytol over 15 minutes. All responded and no serious adverse events were observed. Efficacy data was consistent with reported outcomes seen with 510 mg administered twice. One complained of swelling of the lips which resolved without therapy. The authors concluded that the higher dose demonstrated improved ease of administration and represented an improvement in convenience for both physicians and patients at decreased cost without a decrement in efficacy or safety. To address concerns about serious adverse events, especially true hypersensitivity, which is very rare, AMAG Pharmaceuticals, ferumoxytol's manufacturer initiated a program of studies to assess safety and efficacy. The largest of these was a 2000 patient double blind, randomized comparison of the FDA approved administration of 1020 mg of ferumoxytol (two vials) to 1500 mg of ferric carboxymaltose (two vials), also FDA approved administration.9 Both formulations were administered over two visits 1 week apart. At five weeks no difference in safety or efficacy was observed and in February 2018, a broad label was granted across all conditions associated with iron lack in adults who were intolerant of, or had an inadequate response to oral iron. After thousands of administrations of 510 mg of ferumoxytol in our practice, based on our previously published data,8 we approached the insurance carriers of the bulk of our population. Blue Cross Blue Shield Care First, Cigna, MedStar Family Choice, and Priority Partners all agreed to pay for a single infusion of 1020 mg of ferumoxytol over 20 to 30 minutes. While more convenient for both physician and patient, the well-considered decision was undoubtedly fomented by the savings of ∼$100 per patient per treatment obviating the second, unnecessary visit. To date, we have performed more than 400 of these infusions. Herein we present the data on the first 184. The population for this report consisted of 184 consecutive, nonselected patients who attended our outpatient hematology clinic and infusion center insured by one of the approving carriers, from May 14, 2018 to February 26, 2019. All received 1020 mg of ferumoxytol as a single infusion over ∼30 minutes. Pre-infusion parameters consisted of serum creatinine, complete blood count, and iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, percent transferrin saturation, and serum ferritin). All parameters were obtained within the preceding four weeks of the infusion. Any reaction to the infusion and action taken was recorded along with any premedication given (intravenous methylprednisolone and ranitidine for those with multiple drug allergies or asthma, known to be at increased risk for infusion reactions). Postinfusion parameters, when available at time of data collection included complete blood count and iron parameters, all at least four weeks and less than six months, after the date of the infusion. The data was extracted from OncoEMR based on review of clinic lab results, outside laboratory reports, clinic visit notes and nursing medication administration notes. Accuracy of data entry was verified by the senior author (MA). The results were tabulated and analyzed using simple quantitative methods. One hundred seventy-six, consecutive, nonselected, iron deficient patients whose insurance carriers (Blue Cross Blue Shield, Care First, Cigna, MedStar Family Choice, Priority Partners) approved a total dose infusion of ferumoxytol, received 184 infusions of 1020 mg of ferumoxytol in 250 mL of normal saline over 20 to 30 minutes. Twelve received multiple infusions, 11 received two and one received three. Premedication with methylprednisolone and/or ranitidine was administered to 29 for a history of multiple drug allergies (>1) or asthma, consistent with our practice standards. The demographic characteristics and baseline laboratory values are shown in Table S1. One hundred sixty-one (91.5%) were female. The most common diagnosis was menorrhagia in 76 (41.3%), followed by 33 in the second and third trimester of pregnancy (17.9%), and 26 after gastric bypass (14.1%). The mean hemoglobin at presentation was 10.7 g/dL (SD 1.7), MCV 80.1 (SD 11.6), TSAT 11.3 (SD 7.6), and serum ferritin 12.0 (Median Interquartile range 12.0 [SD 8.0-25.]). The mean serum creatinine was 0.7 (SD 0.2). Thirteen (7.4%) reported minor infusion reactions, all of which subsided without residua (see Table 1). Following cessation of the infusion, treatment with methylprednisolone and ranitidine was administered and all received the originally planned dose 15 minutes after resolution of symptoms. Only one of the 13 had received premedication. These observations are consistent with our experience with ferumoxytol and published evidence with other intravenous iron formulations. The mean hemoglobin increment was 1.9 g in those individuals in whom follow-up laboratory testing was available. The mean increments in MCV, TSAT, and ferritin were 5.3 femtoliters, 12.4%, and 100.6 ng/mL, respectively. Values for SD and confidence intervals are reported in Table S2. The felicitousness of a total dose infusion of intravenous iron as a single, short infusion adds convenience and decreased cost to the treatment of iron deficiency.10 Based on the preponderance of published evidence, there is neither an increase in toxicity nor decrease in efficacy with single dose iron repletion compared with multiple administrations to achieve the same dose. By administering ferumoxytol in one visit, not only is the chance for an infusion reaction or extravasation of the intravenous line halved, a savings of ∼$100 (cost of visit and infusion) per patient per treatment is enjoyed. Multiple insurers throughout the country now approve this improved method of treating iron deficiency. Appropriate approval will obviate payment denials and add efficiency to infusion centers. Over the conduct of the study period we treated ∼200 Medicare patients with 1020 mg of ferumoxytol administered as two 510 mg infusions. At current reimbursement rates, in this practice alone, 20 000 dollars of additional costs were generated for an unnecessary second visit, in addition to exposing the patient to a second intravenous line insertion with the resultant, albeit small, chance for an infusion reaction and extravasation. Total dose infusion of ferumoxytol is more convenient for patients and providers, likely associated with fewer infusion reactions and extravasations when administered over two visits, is cost saving and represents and improvement in the management of iron deficiency anemia.

Unfortunately, there are conflicting opinions as to its efficacy. This is evidenced in part by the existing disagreement in the literature and likewise by the lack of uniformity of directions for dosage and administration. Several children have been admitted to the wards of Queens General Hospital with advanced pyogenic diseases of various types after ineffective oral treatment with penicillin at home. The causative organisms in these cases frequently are made more resistant to penicillin administered parenterally by inadequate oral treatment. This form of treatment does more harm than good. Preparations of penicillin for oral administration are being used for the initial treatment of these patients, despite the fact that the Food and Drug Administration has approved oral use of this drug only for cases in which the disease is already \"under control\" after parenteral",

In particular, mouthrinses can support conventional tooth brushing in reducing accumulation of oral plaque. Effect : Antimicrobial mouthrinses are used as part of daily oral care to reduce plaque and gingivitis. Mouthrinses contains fluoride could help remineralization of enamel and dentin. The most common molecules contained in mouthrinses are chlorhexidine, essential oils, cetyl pyridinium chloride, triclosan, hyaluronic acid. Currently, chlorhexidine is the most efficacious compound, with both antiplaque and antibacterial activities. Similar results are reported for essential oils and cetyl pyridinium chloride, although with a somewhat reduced efficacy. Considering the adverse effects of chlorhexidine and its time-related characteristics, this molecule may best be indicated for acute/short term use, while essential oils and cetyl pyridinium chloride may be appropriate for long-term, maintenance treatment. Conclusion and suggestion : Antimicrobial mouthrinses are safe and effective, and when used in conjunction with brushing and flossing, they are an important method of reducing plaque and gingivitis. To improve compliance, dental health care professionals should adapt oral health care recommendations to fit patients’ specific needs.",

      "title": "THE PHARMACOLOGY OF BENZYL-IMIDAZOLINE (PRISCOL)",
      "abstract": "The pharmacodynamic relationships of Priscol are very complex. In some of its actions Priscol resembles the sympathomimetic agents, in others it resembles histamine or acetylcholine, and in still others Priscol resembles the sympatholytic substances such as ergotamine or ergotoxine. Each of Priscol9s diverse effects will be considered individually. 1. Peripheral vasodilation. Priscol produces general vasodilation and increased venous return in dogs and cats (and probably humans). This dilation is not prevented by atropine or by sympathomimetic agents and therefore is probably not due to acetylcholine-like or histamine-like action. This peripheral vasodilating effect of Priscol appears to be a sympathomimetic effect in a manner similar to other sympathomimetic substances including 3-4-dioxyephedrine and ethyl epinephrine (23), ethyl-norsuprarenin (22) and 1-(p-hydroxyphenyl) -2- isopropylamino ethanol (24). (Another indication of the essential sympathomimetic nature of Priscol is the fact that certain chemical modifications of the Priscol type structure produce very active sympathomimetic pressor agents such as Privine (3, 20, 25).) 2. Cardiac stimulation. Priscol stimulates the intact or isolated heart of dogs and cats. We have shown that this cardiac stimulation is capable of producing a pressor response in many dogs by increasing the cardiac output; the increase in cardiac output being sufficient to increase the arterial pressure even in the face of general peripheral vasodilation. This cardiac effect of Priscol is probably sympathomimetic in nature and appears to be due both to a direct myocardial effect and to active coronary dilation. 3. Pressor action in rabbits. The arterial pressure of rabbits is usually increased by Priscol. This action is apparently histaminic in nature since there is a correlation between the intensity of the histamine pressor action and the Priscol pressor action in the same animal. Pulse contours show that Priscol (and histamine) increases the total peripheral resistance in rabbits. In dogs and cats the total peripheral resistance is diminished. 4. Cardiac depression in rabbits. On the isolated or intact rabbit heart, Priscol produces two different types of transient depression. One is acetylcholinelike in nature since it is prevented by atropine. The other occurs only with large doses and is apparently histaminic since it occurs in the presence of atropine but is prevented by epinephrine or ephecirine. 5. Castro-intestinal action. The principle action of Priscol on the gastrointestinal musculature is stimulation. In the intact animal the stimulation is prevented by atropine but on the isolated gut atropine does not prevent the stimulation. The stimulant action of Priscol on the isolated gut appears to be histaminic in nature since the histamine sensitive ileum (guinea pig) is also more sensitive to Priscol. Priscol also produces some inhibition of the gastrointestinal musculature. This inhibition precedes the stimulation phase in the isolated gut and follows the stimulant phase in the intact animal. With some segments of isolated ileum only inhibition is noted. During the inhibitory phase in the intact animal, especially following large doses of Priscol, the gut appears to be resistant to further Priscol stimulation. This inhibitory action of Priscol could be sympathomimetic in nature. 6. Stimulation of the uterus. Priscol stimulates the intact uterus (pregnant or non-pregnant) of the dog and the isolated uteri of cats, rabbits and guinea pigs. Atropine does not prevent this stimulation. Although this action of Priscol resembles that of histamine in the intact animal the stimulation is much less marked. 7. Sympatholytic action. Priscol effectively blocks the pressor action of epinephrine in experimental animals. This effect is produced by blocking the peripheral vasoconstricting action of epinephrine since it has been shown that epinephnne following Priscol is an active vasodilator (26) and that Priscol does not prevent the cardiac stimulation produced by epinephrine. Priscol also blocks the excitant action of epinephrine on the uterus. This allows the uterine inhibitory action of epinephrine to become apparent. The sympatholytic action of Priscol is similar to that of the ergot alkaloids, ergotoxine and ergotamine. However, in its cardiovascular effects Priscol is entirely dissimilar in action. The ergot alkaloids produce a pressor effect by vasoconstriction. This usually results in a diminished cardiac output. Priscol, on the other hand, increases cardiac output and thereby produces a pressor effect in many dogs. 8. Sympathomimetic anti-pressor action. Priscol selectively blocks the pressor effects of the sympathomimetic amines. It has no effect on the pressor actions of Pitressin, angiotonin, renin or histamine. The amount of amine which is blocked by Priscol varies with the pressor potency of the amine. Only those amines which possess some masked depressor action (epinephrine and tyramine) show reversal after Priscol. The depressor amines lose whatever pressor action they may possess but retain their characteristic depressor action. Priscol has great value as a physiological and pharmacological tool. By blocking the vasoconstricting actions of sympathomimetic substances, their vasodilating effects are unmasked and therefore become apparent. In the past. most of the studies on the correlation of chemical structure with pharmacological activity of the sympathomimetics have been on comparative pressor activities. It is becoming more apparent that the sympathomimetic substances are also potential vasodilators and that this action should also be considered in comparative studies. Because Priscol has so many different pharmacological actions it must be used with care therapeutically. When used as a vasodilator its side actions such as cardiac stimulation, gastro-intestinal and uterine stimulation should be kept in mind. Undesirable increase in blood pressure or gastro-intestinal distress may result. The effectiveness of Priscol as an adrenolytic agent in humans has not yet been demonstrated.",

Mifepristone prevents 92–100% of pregnancies with an acceptable side-effect profile on oral intake of a 10–600-mg dose within 72 h of unprotected intercourse. A single dose of 10 mg mifepristone resulted in a pregnancy rate of 1.5%, similar to a 1.5-mg single dose or two doses of 0.75 mg levonorgestrel 12 h apart, administered within 120 h (current standard) of unprotected sexual intercourse. Mifepristone and levonorgestrel do not differ in efficacy as emergency contraceptives. The mode of action of emergency contraception (EC) with mifepristone or levonorgestrel is primarily associated with inhibition of ovulation rather than prevention of implantation. Different doses of mifepristone appear to have similar effects. However, delay in the onset of subsequent menstruation caused by mifepristone is dose dependent and is reduced with a lower dose without affecting its efficacy. Patient acceptability of mifepristone as EC is high. However, the optimum standard dose of mifepristone is yet to be established for its application as an effective and acceptable emergency contraceptive drug for ordinary clinical use or practice.",

      "abstract": "Background: Hydroxyzine hydrochloride is a piperazine derivative antihistamine that is used in the treatment of anxiety. Its tendency to cause somnolence makes it an attractive option for patients with anxiety-induced insomnia. Despite its antihistamine activity, hydroxyzine is noted to have alpha-adrenergic antagonism activity. Other alpha-adrenergic inhibitors have been implicated in medication-induced priapism, including risperidone. Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic that primarily blocks serotonin and dopamine receptors, while also inhibiting alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors with high affinity. Objective: We report a case of a first-of-its-kind case report of a patient who was stable on risperidone and presented with priapism after taking hydroxyzine nightly for the previous 10 days. Results: A 35-year-old male with a past psychiatric history of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, schizoaffective disorder, presented to the emergency department with priapism for 15 hours that required intracaveronsal phenylephrine hydrochloride and manual drainage to achieve detumescence. The patient was on a stable dose risperidone but reported taking hydroxyzine 50 mg nightly for anxiety and insomnia 10 days prior to emergency department admission. Upon resolution of the priapism, the patient stopped hydroxyzine, but continued risperidone. The patient had another prolonged erection 10 days after stopping hydroxyzine; however, he reported that it resolved spontaneously without intervention after 4 hours. Conclusion: This case report demonstrates the risk of addition of hydroxyzine to antipsychotics which can result in an increased risk of priapism or prolonged episodes.",

This review summarizes and evaluates the publications from preclinical and clinical peer-reviewed experiments that have investigated the safety and effectiveness of ziconotide in combination with a variety of other drugs.Eleven relevant publications were identified through a systematic search of multiple databases.In preclinical studies, additive or synergistic antinociceptive effects were discovered when ziconotide was used in combination with morphine, clonidine, or baclofen; however, no additional antinociceptive effects were observed when bupivacaine was added to ziconotide therapy. Safety data from animal studies revealed that ziconotide did not exacerbate morphine-induced respiratory depression, or clonidine-induced hypotension or bradycardia; however, ziconotide did potentiate morphine-induced hypotension and inhibition of gastrointestinal tract motility. Results from 2 open-label trials indicated that combination ziconotide and morphine therapy produced greater analgesia than was produced by the use of either drug alone. Preliminary support for the use of ziconotide in combination with morphine, baclofen, or hydromorphone was provided by case studies.Although clinical and preclinical studies provide some support for the use of ziconotide in combination with morphine, hydromorphone, clonidine, or baclofen, strong evidence-based data are limited. Controlled, long-term clinical trials are warranted.",

Several open-labelled studies have shown good results on treatment with modafinil. However, only a few randomised controlled clinical trials exist. These have methodological weaknesses and their results are contradictory. If modafinil is used in highly selected patients with severe fatigue its potential interactions with antidepressants must be borne in mind.

      "abstract": "For the treatment of chronic ocular diseases such as glaucoma, continuous instillations of eye drops are needed. However, frequent administrations of hypotensive topical formulations can produce adverse ocular surface effects due to the active substance or other components of the formulation, such as preservatives or other excipients. Thus the development of unpreserved formulations that are well tolerated after frequent instillations is an important challenge to improve ophthalmic chronic topical therapies. Furthermore, several components can improve the properties of the formulation in terms of efficacy. In order to achieve the mentioned objectives, we have developed formulations of liposomes (150–200 nm) containing components similar to those in the tear film and loaded with the hypotensive melatonin analog 5-methoxycarbonylamino-N-acetyltryptamine (5-MCA-NAT, 100 µM). These formulations were combined with mucoadhesive (sodium hyaluronate or carboxymethylcellulose) or amphiphilic block thermosensitive (poloxamer) polymers to prolong the hypotensive efficacy of the drug. In rabbit eyes, the decrease of intraocular pressure with 5-MCA-NAT-loaded liposomes that were dispersed with 0.2% sodium hyaluronate, 39.1±2.2%, was remarkably higher compared to other liposomes formulated without or with other bioadhesive polymers, and the effect lasted more than 8 hours. According to the results obtained in the present work, these technological strategies could provide an improved modality for delivering therapeutic agents in patients with glaucoma.",

      "abstract": "Cephalexin remains an effective and highly useful antibiotic for the treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal skin infections. Twelve years of experience have not diminished its efficacy, and cure rates of 90% or higher continue to be achieved. Its resistance to degradation by gastric acid and its uniform absorption ensure its bioavailability, and its efficacy in twice-daily dosages enhances medication compliance. The suspension formulation is well accepted by young children, and side effects have generally been mild and infrequent. Cephalexin is comparable to erythromycin, clindamycin, dicloxacillin, cloxacillin, and other cephalosporins in the treatment of streptococcal and staphylococcal infections. Because many of these antibiotics are similar in their efficacy, palatability, and adverse reactions, cost factors may play an important role in choosing one over the other. Penicillin remains the drug of choice for streptococcal skin infections. If the cure rates of the mixed streptococcal-staphylococcal lesions continue to decrease with penicillin, cephalexin and the other alternative antibiotics may assume a more important role in the primary treatment of these infections in the future.",

However, ketamine also has powerful hallucinogenic, psychedelic and stimulant properties which have resulted in increased non-medical use over the past two decades. The drug affects many different systems in the brain, including glutamate, dopamine (with effects closely resembling cocaine, including the blockade of dopamine reuptake), serotonin, opioid, noradrenalin, cortisol and other systems. Users are broadly divided into hospital and veterinarylinked staff and their friends who have access to the drug and are more likely to inject the liquid, resulting in primarily psychedelic effects, and users primarily linked with the dance culture who takes ketamine powder by the intranasal route, resulting in more stimulant effects. This paper will consider the history of ketamine since its invention in 1962, the effects for which it is taken in a non-medical context including reproduction of the near-death experience, how these effects may arise, the neuroscience of ketamine, the nature of ketamine-using populations, and the psychological and physical adverse effects that may result from this use, including the growing problem of ketamine dependence.",

      "title": "Physostigmine: is there a role for this antidote in pediatric poisonings?",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review Ingestion of anticholinergic medications is common in pediatrics. Toxicity may result in symptoms such as severe agitation requiring physical restraint. Physostigmine, an antidote for anticholinergic poisoning, could be useful in this situation. Many physicians are hesitant to use physostigmine after case series suggested its use in tricyclic antidepressant overdose was associated with asystole. This paper reviews the anticholinergic toxidrome and pathophysiology, recent literature on the efficacy and toxicity of physostigmine, and its dosing, indications, and contraindications. Recent findings Recent articles suggest that toxicity associated with physostigmine consists mostly of seizures and cardiac arrhythmia, and occurs when used in the absence of anticholinergic symptoms. Despite potential complications, physostigmine has been shown to be useful in cases of confirmed anticholinergic poisoning by controlling agitation and reversing delirium, and appears to be safer and more effective than benzodiazepines in this situation. Summary In the proper clinical situation such as pure anticholinergic overdose with severe symptoms, physostigmine can be beneficial. The potential for side effects is not insignificant, and the antidote should be used with caution in any patient with unknown ingestions or those with cardiac conduction defects. More research is needed, especially involving children, before we will fully understand the indications and toxicities associated with physostigmine.",

      "abstract": "The transdermal route of drug delivery has been used for the effective administration of therapeutic agents for more than a decade. The most important consideration in selecting a drug for transdermal delivery is the potential for improving therapeutic efficacy. The development of a transdermal fentanyl system provided an opportunity to add fentanyl to the armamentarium of strong opioids available for the treatment of cancer pain. The transdermal route of administration has advantages over both the oral and parenteral routes. In addition, patient and caregiver factors allow improved acceptance of and compliance to strong opioids and therefore improved analgesic outcome. Four transdermal fentanyl systems are available, providing delivery rates ranging from 25–100 μg/h; higher rates can be achieved by multiple system application. The system releases fentanyl continuously for 3 days when applied to the skin. Concentrations of fentanyl in the blood are measurable within a few hours of system application. Fentanyl serum concentrations increase gradually, generally levelling off after 12–24 h and remaining relatively constant for the remainder of the 3-day period. Steady state serum concentrations are reached by the second application. Clinical trials have established the efficacy and safety of transdermal fentanyl for the treatment of cancer pain. Transdermal fentanyl is not licensed for the treatment of acute pain, e.g. postoperative pain, and should not be prescribed for this purpose.",

These agents have various combinations of estrogen and progestin, and different effects on the length of women's menstrual cycles. Usually they shorten the duration of menses, decrease the frequency of menses to 4 times/year, or completely eliminate menses. These new oral contraceptives are given in the following regimens: 24 days followed by placebo for 4 days (24/4), 84 days followed by placebo for 7 days (84/7), or continuously (without placebo). These agents contain ethinyl estradiol 20 microg-drospirenone 3 mg (24/4); ethinyl estradiol 20 microg-norethindrone 1 mg (24/4); ethinyl estradiol 30 microg-levonorgestrel 150 microg (84/7); ethinyl estradiol 30 microg-levonorgestrel 150 microg (84/7) with very low-dose ethinyl estradiol (10 microg/day) for 7 days; and ethinyl estradiol 20 microg-levonorgestrel 90 microg continuously. Clinical trials have demonstrated that extended- and continuous-cycle oral contraceptives are as effective in preventing pregnancy as traditional oral contraceptives. These new agents also have similar adverse effects; however, the only significantly different adverse effect compared with traditional oral contraceptives in clinical trials was change in bleeding pattern. These oral contraceptives are associated with more breakthrough bleeding and spotting than the traditional pills. Long-term effects on efficacy and safety are not known, as these new products generally have been used for only 1-2 years. Extended- and continuous-cycle oral contraceptives are a new option for women desiring decreased menses or for whom decreased menses may alleviate symptoms of coexisting medical conditions.",

      "title": "“Doctor, We Have No Saline Today”: The Curious Case of the Generic Injectable Drug Shortage",
      "abstract": "Emergency physicians across the nation have increasingly struggled with the inability of their institutions to obtain many of the common drugs used in our daily practice. The past decade has seen a huge increase in the number of drugs in short supply.1 Most of these are time-honored, well-established, and critical drugs for our practice. These are not rare or “orphan” drugs. These are not new or complex agents that require cutting-edge technology to produce. Recently, these have included shortages of such staples as injectable nitroglycerin, succinylcholine, propofol, 50% dextrose, and even normal saline.1 These are drugs that we have manufactured for decades. These are drugs we use every hour of every day in our collective practice. They have a huge and predictable market. So why then is that market failing us? It is, perhaps, telling that the problem is largely limited to sterile, generic, injectable medications. What are the unique characteristics of this market that have led us to this place? This is a “disease” that is having a huge detrimental effect on our practice and is undoubtedly harming our patients. To understand that disease, we must understand the environment in which it developed. One thing seems certain: to date we have largely only addressed the symptoms of this disease and not the root cause. The FDA and Congress have held hearings, mitigation strategies have been suggested, Congress has acted, and hands have been wrung. Yet the disease marches on and on. This issue of Academic Emergency Medicine includes a special contribution that has expertly chronicled and framed the problem.2 The authors correctly state that the problem has been frequently described as “multifactorial.” But is it really? Something seems to have abruptly changed to lead us to this point. Yes, sterile production lines are complex and expensive and break down frequently. Yes, there have been quality control problems and an increase in regulatory oversight. Yes, there have been problems with the supply of raw materials.3 But each of these problems is identical to problems facing the nongeneric, branded, sterile medication market, yet we see few such shortages within that market segment. Why is that? Certainly, we must learn to predict and report impending shortages promptly and develop mitigation strategies when they occur. But that is treating the symptoms of the “disease” and not the true cause. We simply must ask, “What is the etiology of this illness, and how can we cure it”? To answer, we must first identify how the generic injectable market is unique. Mazer-Amirshahi and colleagues4 have correctly pointed out that there has been a dramatic contraction in the number of manufacturers of generic injectable drugs.4 But, by definition, there is typically only one manufacturer for each proprietary injectable drug. Yet we don't see shortages in that market segment. Another unique aspect of the injectable drug segment is that compared to generic oral medicines, there is a relatively constrained number of purchasers. Most of these drugs are only given in a hospital or EMS setting. There are 5,000 or so hospitals and 10,000 or so advanced life support EMS agencies that make up the total potential market.5 But in reality, there are actually only a handful of purchasers. Perhaps it is no coincidence that, in the same time frame that saw the development of this drug shortage problem, hospitals were moving increasingly to a group purchasing model. Currently a very few of the largest group purchasing organizations (GPOs) are responsible for over 90% of hospital drug purchases.6 A similar situation exists within the EMS market. GPOs have been embraced by hospitals to control skyrocketing costs. The federal government has encouraged this by granting those GPOs special “safe harbor” protections from federal antikickback laws.7 GPOs are judged by hospitals almost solely on their ability to keep the prices for drugs low. That is how they lure hospitals into contracts. They are very good at it. As Mazer-Amirshahi and colleagues have pointed out, this has resulted in small profit margins for generic injectable drugs. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 has further constrained the ability of the price of those medications to “float” to appropriate levels for profitability, by limiting how much those prices can fluctuate within a given time frame.8 The result is that the price cannot adjust rapidly to changes in production or demand. The unintended consequence of hospital group purchasing has been the creation of a monopsony—or more accurately, an oligopsony. A monopsony (or oligopsony) is the opposite of a monopoly (oligopoly). It is a buyer's monopoly. Instead of one, or a few, producers controlling the price, a monopsony (or oligopsony), occurs when one, or a few, purchasers have so much power that they can control the price. An example would be the current situation where large warehouse retail stores have become so powerful as purchasers that they can dictate prices to suppliers.9 A monopsony can cause just as much distortion to free-market forces as a monopoly, but is less well understood by the public. Perhaps this is the true cause of our ongoing drug nightmare. Perhaps this is what has changed to lead us to this point. The timeline certainly fits this assertion. One of the more interesting aspects of this problem is that both the manufacturers and the purchasers (GPOs) are relatively silent on this issue. The purchasers (GPOs), of course, would be reluctant to acknowledge their own role in this problem. They simply turn to the hospitals they purchase for, and say, “Sorry, that drug is not available.” Perhaps if the GPOs were judged not just by price, but by their ability to obtain the drugs, the price could “float” to where it needs to be to assure a sustainable profit margin. More interesting to some of us is that the producers have also been relatively silent. Why are they not screaming for higher prices and therefore higher profit margins? Perhaps it is because the pharmaceutical producers have to sell their higher profit, branded, injectable drugs to the same handful of GPOs. Perhaps it is because the GPOs have “safe harbor” protections from federal antikickback laws that serve to potentially pervert the free-market economy. Under that exemption the GPOs make a significant portion of their money by collecting “administrative” fees directly from the producers.7 In another setting, those could be interpreted as kickbacks. Through those fees, the pharmaceutical industry might very well be able to manipulate GPO purchasing patterns and steer them toward higher-priced, nongeneric drugs. One thing is certain. We will not solve this problem until we have a national, nonpartisan, in-depth discussion of the root cause(s) of this problem. The FDA can't fix this. The drug companies and the GPOs have not been willing to fix this. Perhaps it is time for the medical community to show some leadership and host a consensus conference that seeks to illuminate the true origins of this problem. Only then will we be able to craft a cure for this pernicious disease and end our collective, recurring nightmare.",

      "abstract": "Several placebo-controlled trials have shown that milnacipran, 100 mg/day in two doses, is an effective antidepressant in both the ambulatory and hospital settings. Comparative trials against tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine and clomipramine) failed to show that milnacipran was any more effective. Milnacipran has not been compared with specific or non specific MAOI antidepressants. As regards non tricyclic-non MAOI antidepressants, milnacipran has been compared only to two specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors, fluvoxamine and fluoxetine. The trials cannot convince us of a difference in efficacy between the two types of treatment. The claimed superiority of milnacipran over serotonin reuptake inhibitors is not based on firm evidence of better efficacy or fewer adverse effects. The overall tolerability of milnacipran is similar to that of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine. Relative to the tricyclic antidepressants, milnacipran has fewer atropinic effects (sedation and sweating). In contrast, it cause more dysuria, and cannot, therefore, replace tricyclics in elderly men with prostate disorders. Tricyclics remain the preferred first-line antidepressant drugs. When they are contraindicated or poorly tolerated, many other antidepressants with well-documented risk-benefit ratios are available.",

      "abstract": "For various reasons we became interested in the possibility that nicotinic acid or nicotinamide might be of some benefit to the chronic schizophrenic. Many workers have noticed clinical similarities between the acute schizophrenias and the encephalopathies of nicotinic acid deficiency (4). Nicotinic acid is known to be of value in pellagra (2) and in the treatment of delirium tremens and allied states (1), and Osmond and Hoffer have had promising results with these substances in the treatment of schizophrenia in its acute phase (3). There seemed therefore to be sufficient reason for an investigation of their effects in the schizophrenic in the chronic phase, for, as far as we are aware, the therapeutic possibilities have not been explored. Since patients often respond strikingly to the giving of any tablet, regardless of its contents, we also gave similar tablets of an innocuous substance, here referred to as Placebo. For convenience the three preparations employed will be referred to in future as A (Nicotinic Acid), M (Nicotinamide) or P (Placebo).",

Improved pharmacokinetic properties of newer azoles have shortened and simplified treatment of the mucosal forms of candidiasis for which a single dose of fluconazole (150 or 200 mg) or a short course with two doses of itraconazole (2 x 100 mg) are recommended. For patients with an uncorrectable predisposition to thrush, guidelines are provided for prophylaxis or self-initiated therapy. Whenever possible dermatophytoses should be treated topically to avoid long-term exposure to the new keratinotropic azoles and allylamines, for which insufficient long-term toxicological data are at present available. Ketoconazole should be avoided for these indications because of its potentially serious hepatotoxicity. For many indications requiring prolonged treatment griseofulvin remains the favoured systemic drug due to its extensive safety record.",

To determine whether this agent offered clinical benefits over other available drugs that would justify its significantly greater cost, a systematic review of 16 clinical trials was undertaken. The review suggested that immediate‐release and controlled‐release preparations of oxycodone have similar efficacy and comparable side effect profiles. Controlled‐release oxycodone has the advantage of less frequent dosing than immediate‐release oxycodone; however, other agents may be dosed infrequently at much lower costs. For patients requiring a controlled‐release opioid treatment, controlled‐release morphine and methadone should be considered because they appear to be as effective as oxycodone and cost considerably less. Controlled‐release oxycodone may be appropriate for some patients, particularly if they cannot tolerate other controlled‐release or long‐acting opioid analgesics.",

      "abstract": "analgesics, pain management, opioids: No benefit is seen in relieving musculoskeletal pain in the ED by adding a small dose of codeine (30 mg), hydrocodone (5 mg), or oxycodone (5 mg) to a combination of ibuprofen (400 mg) plus acetaminophen (1000 mg). It is most logical to use an adequate dose of an opioid right at the start. Opioid addicts are not created in the ED by simply administering an appropriate dose of an opioid for a painful condition.FigureA basic mission of the ED is to alleviate pain, a mandate we attempt to fulfill with numerous analgesics, including opioids, nonopioids, or a combination thereof. The potential for misuse, dependence, and diversion has spurred efforts to eliminate or decrease the use of opioids. Such efforts, however, are often misdirected. Some opioids and nonopioids are given daily by emergency physicians, but only a few truly scientific studies compare the efficacy of various medications. A recent trial, though, compared the efficacy of common oral analgesics, primarily a combination of a small dose of opioids or nonopioids combined with acetaminophen. A Randomized Trial Comparing the Efficacy of Five Oral Analgesics for Treatment of Acute Musculoskeletal Extremity Pain in the Emergency Department Bijur P, et al. Ann Emerg Med. 2021;77(3):345 This randomized, double-blind trial compared the efficacy of five frequently prescribed oral analgesic combinations, either an opioid or acetaminophen combined with ibuprofen, at one and two hours after baseline in ED patients with acute musculoskeletal pain in one or more extremities. The painful conditions were vaguely described as acute musculoskeletal extremity pain, consisting of sprain, strain, fracture, muscle pain, or contusion. Patients were given pain medicine while awaiting imaging and subsequent care. The choice of analgesics was randomized and are listed in the table. Following an initial dose, patients could receive rescue analgesics based on the emergency physician's discretion or the patient's own request. Rescue medication was 5 mg of oral oxycodone that could be administered at any point during the two-hour study period. The initial and subsequent pain levels were assessed on a standard 0-10 pain scale. Pain was recorded immediately before receiving the study medication, immediately before receiving rescue medication, and at one and two hours after baseline. The patient's satisfaction with pain relief and time to satisfaction were also recorded. A total of 600 of 4112 interviewed ED patients aged 21 to 64 were included in the study. The mean overall decrease in the numerical pain scores from baseline to one hour following analgesic administration was between 3.0 and 3.4 on the pain scale. The decrease in pain for those with an initial pain score of 10 was 3.7 to 4.8. A change of 1.3 units on the scale was generally considered clinically meaningful. The change in pain was not significantly different for any treatment, including the opioid addition. Only 1.3 percent of the patients received a rescue medication by one hour, and the specific initial analgesic medications used did not prompt the rescue medication. Twenty-five percent had little pain relief from baseline to the one-hour evaluation. The portion of patients satisfied with pain relief, the time to control the pain, and preference for the analgesic in the future did not vary among the treatment groups. Nausea and vomiting were more common in patients who received rescue opioid analgesics, but that was only 6.7 percent. The authors said they used relatively low doses of opioid analgesics, but such doses are now considered standard. They concluded that no difference was seen in the efficacy of the opioid and nonopioid combination analgesics in pain relief and patient satisfaction. These authors did not find that increasing the dose of ibuprofen over 400 mg resulted in better pain relief, which has been noted in similar studies. A quarter of the patients reported less than a two-point decrease in pain from baseline at one hour, indicating that many patients initially did not have adequate analgesia. No analgesic combination was more effective than another at one or two hours, and the pain relief achieved by the doses and medications used was less than adequate in more than 25 percent of the patients. Comment: The observations of this study underscore that opioids are not a universally better choice for acute musculoskeletal pain than ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but the superiority of either combination was not proven. I found the choice and dose of all medications to be rather modest, and these are not analgesics or doses that I believe most emergency physicians would initially choose for treating acute pain in the ED. Patients come to the ED for relief of pain, and choosing a small dose of a nonopioid medication does not make much sense to me. The change in the pain scale rating was modest and minimally significant. Simply stated, these analgesics were almost worthless. Ibuprofen is commonly a first-line analgesic for mild pain, and it's important for clinicians to realize that administering more than 400 mg ibuprofen does not result in better pain relief. There is likely no reason to administer 800 mg ibuprofen for pain because it is not more effective than 400 mg for treating musculoskeletal pain in the ED. (Ann Emerg Med. 2019;74[4]:530.) This ceiling effect of ibuprofen is difficult for many physicians to appreciate, and I commonly see them opting for higher doses of ibuprofen when the pain is more severe, even though this results in no better analgesia and only more side effects. About 50 percent of the patients in all groups of this study had an initial pain intensity score of 9-10, a further indication that the choice of a medication with minimal analgesic effect would not be appropriate. Further emphasizing the fact that the choice of analgesics in this study was less than appropriate is that 25 percent of the patients received rescue medication between baseline and two hours. If you are going to relieve pain, choose an appropriate drug and a large enough dose that will accomplish analgesia with the first dose; don't wait to see if another dose is required. - Pain Relief in the ED for Sprains, Strains, Fractures, and Contusions Efficacy of pain relief intensity with various oral analgesics Point decrease in pain on 1-10 pain scale at one and two hours Decrease in pain at two hours in patients with fractures Decrease in pain at two hours with initial pain rating of 10 Ibuprofen 400 mg plus acetaminophen 1000 mg 3.0/4.3 3.0 3.7 Ibuprofen 800 mg plus acetaminophen 1000 mg 3.0/4.6 4.9 4.8 Codeine 30 mg plus acetaminophen 300 mg 3.4/4.4 3.7 4.2 Hydrocodone 5 mg plus acetaminophen 300 mg 3.1/4.5 4.1 4.5 Oxycodone 5 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg 3.3/4.7 4.5 4.6 This shows pain relief on a standard 0-10 pain scale by various analgesic combinations commonly used in the ED. A change of 1.3 points indicated a clinically significant change in pain intensity and a clinically significant difference. The medications and doses used barely meet this criterion. No statistically significant change in pain score was seen with any medication. Rescue medication was used in fewer than four patients in each group between baseline and one hour, but about 25 percent received rescue medication by two hours. No benefit was shown by adding these opioids to ibuprofen, but they do add to opioid complications. The patients had no preference for any of these analgesics. Source: Ann Emerg Med. 2021;77(3):345. The patient's satisfaction with treatment was less than desired. Only about three-quarters were satisfied with the degree of pain relief or time to pain relief, and only 65-80 percent said they would prefer the same analgesic in the future. This is not a great accolade for the analgesics prescribed in this study. Opioids are still the gold standard treatment for severe pain, and initial treatment given in the ED does not necessarily dictate addiction. If one gives an adequate dose of hydromorphone (Dilaudid) for pain relief, it is not required in a prescription upon discharge. I see no reason, however, not to aim for better pain relief than achieved in this study. About 80 percent of patients had an initial pain intensity score of 9-10, and the minimal dose of medications given for this amount of pain seems ridiculously low. Even the dose of opioids chosen, 5 mg of hydrocodone and 5 mg of oxycodone, is quite low, certainly too low to provide adequate analgesia for a fracture with a 9-10 pain scale rating. This study is an example of how the use of analgesics in the ED has been markedly misinterpreted. Failing to use medications strong enough to relieve acute pain because of the fear of creating opioid addiction is certainly the wrong way to proceed. Our use of opioids has clearly decreased, but skimping on analgesics for the initial relief of pain makes no sense. Believing that 400 mg ibuprofen and 1000 mg acetaminophen will adequately treat the pain of an acute fracture is bordering on clinical lunacy. CME for InFocus!

      "abstract": "Practicing physicians need to have practical techniques to help patients who want to stop using benzodiazepines. I have developed three approaches that usually work. The first, and most widely applicable, is gradually reducing the dose without adding any other medicine. Failing this, use one of the following two approaches, occasionally combining them: switch to a longer-acting, cross-tolerant medication (usually clonazepam or phenobarbital) or use medications to suppress the withdrawal symptoms, usually carbamazepine, propranolol, or clonidine. If this fails, use inpatient detoxification. Chemically dependent patients, including those abusing alcohol and taking higher than recommended doses of sedative-hypnotics, require special care during discontinuation. Aftercare is important for all long-term benzodiazepine users if they are to remain drug-free and live relatively comfortable lives.",

      "title": "Transdermal Ketamine: A Rising Star in Pain and Inflammation",
      "abstract": "Ketamine is a powerful dissociative anesthetic with a rich history in medicine due to its remarkably complex, dose-dependent pharmacology. Originally synthesized in 1962 as a safer and more effective alternative to phencyclidine (PCP), ketamine has expanded its clinical applications to include analgesia and immunomodulation. Approximately 11–40% of adults in the United States report suffering from chronic pain, affecting more people than diabetes, heart disease, and cancer combined. Current therapies such as opioid agonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), gabapentinoids, antidepressants, and topical anesthetic agents are first-line treatments for various pain conditions. However, prolonged use of such medications can lead to debilitating side effects ranging from tolerance or dependence (physical and psychological) to exacerbation of other chronic health conditions, making it essential to explore alternative interventions. This approach creates clinical opportunities for ketamine’s use as a monotherapy and multimodal agent due to its unique qualities. From its origins as a potent anesthetic and analgesic agent to its current exploration as a novel treatment in psychosomatic disorders, ketamine’s pharmacology continues to be an area of active research and development",

The compound is absorbed more rapidly than ampicillin, with peak absorption occurring 45 min to 1 hr after administration of the drug, whereas the peak after administration of the parent compound is at 2 hr. Peak levels of drug in serum after a 400-mg dose of bacampicillin (molar equivalent, 278 mg of ampicillin) are 6–8 µg/ml. Peak levels after an 800-mg dose of bacampicillin (molar equivalent, 556 mg of ampicillin) are 11–14 µg/ml. These peak levels are twofold greater than those achieved with equimolar doses of ampicillin. Ingestion of bacampicillin with food does not decrease or delay absorption of the drug. Recovery of ampicillin in urine after ingestion of bacampicillin is 75% vs. a recovery of 45% after ampicillin. Ampicillin appears earlier in tears, saliva, bronchial and maxillary sinus secretions, middle ear fluid, skin blisters, lymph, and urethral and cervical secretions, and the levels obtained in these tissues are greater after ingestion of bacampicillin than after ampicillin. The pharmacokinetics of bacampicillin and ampicillin in the period 2.5–8 hr after their ingestion is virtually identical at equimolar doses.",

      "abstract": "Vancomycin is one of the older antibiotics that has been now in clinical use close to 60 years. Earlier on, vancomycin was associated with many side effects including vestibular and renal, most likely due to impurities contained .in early vancomycin lots. Over the years the impurities have been removed and the compound has now far less vestibular adverse effects, but still possesses renal toxicity if administered at higher doses rendering trough serum levels of >15 mcg/Ml or if administered for prolonged periods of time. Vancomycin is effective against most gram-positive cocci and bacilli with the exception of rare organisms as well as enterococci that became vancomycin resistant (VRE), mostly Enterococcus faecium. The major use of vancomycin today is for infections caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) and amoxicillin-resistant enterococci . In its oral form vancomycin is used to treat diarrhea caused by Clsotridium difficile. With Staphylococcus aureus there are only a handful of vancomycin-resistant strains. Nevertheless a 'vancomycin creep' that is slow upward trending of vancomycin MIC from Vancomycin has been a very important tool in our therapeutic armamentarium that remained effective for many years it, isl likely remain effective as long as resistance to vancomycin remains controlled.",

In recent years, ketamine has been investigated in the treatment of depression and chronic pain. Given ketamine’s addictive potential, increasing medical use poses the risk of misuse or addictive use following medical exposure. This risk may be higher in patients with co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD). We present the case of a patient with opioid use disorder well-controlled on buprenorphine who was exposed to ketamine in the emergency department (ED), then relapsed by misusing ketamine. He procured it from the darknet to “self-medicate his depression.” After using heavily for 15 days, he experienced debilitating withdrawal syndrome requiring intensive care unit admission. Ketamine use should be in the differential of any young patient who presents to the ED with agitation and visual hallucinations or nystagmus. Moreover, the benefits of therapeutic ketamine use should be weighed carefully against the risk of misuse or addictive use. In cases where ketamine use is absolutely necessary for high-risk patients, we recommend that dosing be limited to the sub-dissociative range (0.2-0.5 mg/kg). We also recommend the use of a slow infusion rather than bolus. For patients with ketamine withdrawal, benzodiazepines and/or anti-glutamatergic anticonvulsants may be helpful to alleviate symptoms.

The proportion of dental diseases has developed to a great extent in current years. Around 70% of inhabitants suffer from dental problems. The human population is exaggerated by foremost of oral diseases. To treat dental problems such as pain due to dental caries, periodonitis, gingivitis, and other gum infections, painkillers alongside with antibiotics and various dental paints are the generally prescribed drugs by dentists as primary mode of treatment. However the general side effects of most of the painkillers are hyperacidity and gastric annoyance upon oral administration. On the other hand, nearly all antibiotics due to measured onset of action and hepatic “first-pass” consequence fail to construct prompt and extend actions. Furthermore, most of the dental formulations are washed out by saliva inside a few hours of application. To conquer the above-mentioned problems, a soft polymeric mold containing antibiotic and anasthetics drugs and having a suitable constancy to stick to the tooth, was developed for continued drug release to endow with improved relief in dental patients. Carbopol 934, Ethyl cellulose, Gum tragacanth, Hydroxy propyl cellulose, and PEG 400 were used to organize the formulation containing Lidocaine hydrochloride and doxycycline hyclate individually and in combination, by addition and solvent evaporation technique. Dissimilar physicochemical characterization studies such as mucoadhesion test and swelling index were conceded out. In vitro drug release studies showed sustained release of Lidocaine hydrochloride and doxycycline hyclate in simulated saliva for 24 h. Additional studies are necessary to succeed with these formulations in humans. Upon accomplishment, this type of dosage form may open up new avenues towards dentistry.",

This article summarizes available data on the use of bilastine in the treatment of allergic disorders in different age groups, including younger and older adults, and school-age children and adolescents.Methods: A PubMed literature search (\"bilastine\") was conducted on 25 February 2019. Additional literature known to the authors and identified from the reference lists of cited publications was included.Results: Bilastine is administered orally at a dose of 20 mg once daily in adults and adolescents aged ≥12 years and 10 mg once daily in children aged 6 to <12 years. Clinical trials have demonstrated its efficacy at improving nasal and ocular symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis, and wheals and itching in patients with urticaria. It has a rapid onset of action and long duration of action. Bilastine does not undergo significant metabolism and does not interact with the CYP450 system, which limits its potential for drug-drug interactions. No dosage adjustments are required in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or in the elderly. Bilastine is generally well tolerated, even when administered at above-standard doses. It does not exhibit anticholinergic effects or cardiotoxic effects, shows no central nervous system penetration and has minimal sedative properties. It has been shown to improve health-related quality of life.Conclusions: Bilastine is a suitable option for the treatment of patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis or urticaria across age groups from school-age children to elderly patients.",

The efficacy of these drugs depends on motivation: Pearl indexes vary from 1.17-3.72 for norethisterone .9-4.4 for d-norgestrel and .8- 2.2 for lynestrenol. Some physiologic effects of minipills possibly related to their mode of action are impermeable cervical mucus and low levels of progesterone pregnanediol estrogen and LH. The side effects influencing dropout most are spotting (40-55% in the first cycle) polymenorrhea (about 10%) and amenorrhea (about 5-10%). Some transient estrogenic side effects such as nausea headaches and breast pain may be due to estrogenic metabolites from lynestrenol and norethisterone.

In each of the animal models used the analgesic potency of pemedolac was defined by an ED50 of 2.0 mg/kg p.o. or less. Significant analgesic activity was detected in rats at 16 hr after administration of 1 mg/kg p.o. (paw pressure test) and at 10 hr after administration of 10 mg/kg p.o. to mice (p-phenylbenzoquinone writhing). Inasmuch as pemedolac was inactive in the hot plate and tail-flick tests; and its analgesic activity was not antagonized by naloxone (1 mg/kg s.c.), and tolerance did not develop upon multiple administration; this drug does not exert its analgesic effects through an opiate mechanism. Pemedolac differed from standard nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in that the doses which produced analgesia were much lower than those required for either anti-inflammatory or gastric irritant effects. In acute anti-inflammatory tests, pemedolac exhibited only weak activity as evidenced by an ED50 approximately 100 mg/kg p.o. in the carrageenan paw edema procedure. This demonstrates for pemedolac a separation of at least 50-fold between the acute analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities, which was greater than that observed with reference NSAIDs. The compound also had a low ulcerogenic liability with an acute UD50 = 107 mg/kg p.o. and a subacute UD50 estimated to be 140 mg/kg/day p.o. In contrast, the reference NSAIDS (piroxicam, indomethacin, naproxen and ibuprofen) exhibited similar dose-response relationships for the analgesic, anti-inflammatory and gastric irritant effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The proposed therapeutic regimen consists of doxycycline (an antimicrobial having also anti-inflammatory properties, probable antioxidant and possible some antiviral effects), and pentoxifylline, a hemorheological compound used in occlusive arterial diseases but also having proven anti-inflammatory properties. Doxycycline is included in the WHO&amp;rsquo;s list of essential medicine being an effective, safe, widely available, and inexpensive medication and widely accessible. It will be administered at a dosage of 100 mg orally twice daily for ten days. Pentoxifylline, in clinical use since 1972, and also widely accessible, will be given at a dosage of 400 mg orally, also twice daily, for ten days. The primary outcome measures are: 1) Progression of disease to a severe form requiring intensive care admission and mechanical ventilation; 2) Fatality rates and 3) Time to clinical recovery.This proposal was presented to the National Directors and Core Leads meeting of the Canadian Trials Network (CTN) on May 6, 2020.

The distinguishing features of tranquilizing drugs in contrast to conventional sedatives is that they calm without producing sleep and that their site of action in the central nervous system is predominantly subcortical. The principal sites of action are important regulating centers of the brain: thalamus, hypothalamus, reticular activating system and portions of the limbic system. Phenothiazine derivatives, besides being the most effective tranquilizers for treating severe emotional disorders, are also clinically useful for potentiating other analgesic or anesthetic drugs and for controlling vomiting. This rapidly growing group of drugs is of major importance in present-day psychopharmacologic therapy. Newer derivatives, especially of the piperazine type, appear to be highly effective as tranquilizers in low doses. They also produce fewer major complications from treatment. Rauwolfia alkaloids have decreased in importance in psychiatric use, but are still the basic drugs for treating hypertension. The substituted propanediols or butanediols are generally used as mild sedatives for less serious emotional disorders. The diphenylmethane derivatives, while chemically related, have a variety of pharmacologic actions which include sedation, stimulation, antihistaminic and anticholinergic effects. The ultimate role of these agents in the treatment of major emotional disorders, such as schizophrenic reactions, still is uncertain. However, the impetus these drugs have given to improved treatment of psychotic patients in mental hospitals has unquestionably been beneficial. The intensive attempts to determine their modes of action will very likely yield important advances in the understanding of possible neurophysiologic bases for mental illness.",

Most of these signs and lesions are similar to those observed in nicotine poisoning. Levamisole causes vasopressor and panting effects which are blocked by ganglionic blocking agents hexamethonium and mecamylamine but are not blocked by atropine. The vasopressor effect of levamisole is blocked by α-adrenergic antagonists phentolamine and dibenamine; however, the respiratory effect of levamisole is not affected by these α-adrenergic antagonists. Repeated iv injections of levamisole cause a tachyphylactic response. With levamisole-induced tachyphylaxis, the effects of other ganglionic stimulants dimethylpiperazinium and nicotine are also abolished. Levamisole causes an electroencephalographic arousal which is antagonized by atropine sulfate and mecamylamine. There is also a structural similarity of levamisole to nicotine. These studies suggest that levamisole is a nicotine-like compound. Possible treatment of levamisole poisoning is discussed. Drug interactions of levamisole with organophosphates and anthelmintics, eg, pyrantel, methyridine, and diethylcarbamazine, are also discussed.",

The investigation may be carried out with surface anaesthesia in the pharynx in well-informed and mentally stable patients but accept of renewed endoscopy is increased significantly when sedation is employed. Patients with an absolute requirement for sedation may be selected possibly employing a brief personality test. Employment of diazepam is extensively employed but diazepam interacts with cimetidin among other drugs, has a relatively long half-life and can cause secondary sedation. Midazolam has a more rapid effect, a briefer half-life, provides deeper sedation and results in more amnesia than diazepam. The oxygen tension decrease during endoscopy regardless of the sedative employed. Other sedatives, opioids, atropin or anaesthetics are not indicated under normal circumstances. Sedation can be abolished immediately after endoscopy with the bendzodiazepin-antagonist, flumazenil.",

To control the wearing-off phenomenon, it is useful to administer L-dopa before eating because absorption of L-dopa is less when competing with amino acids. Administration of L-dopa four or five times a day is also useful. Dopamin agonists(e.g., bromocriptine, pergolide, talipexole, and cabergoline), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors(e.g., selegiline) control the wearing-off phenomenon, and may also suppress its occurrence. As a specific method for controlling the wearing-off phenomenon, continuous administration of anti-parkinsonian drugs by the intra-alimentary tract or a subcutaneous injection is useful. It is important to avoid early wearing-off phenomenon when treating patients with Parkinson's disease.",

      "title": "MORPHINE AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CODEINE AFTER ENT SURGERY: EVALUATION OF SAFETY AND EFFICACY",
      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> Codeine has long been considered the weak opioid of choice in children and was frequently used to treat pain after tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy. However, in 2013 the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) stated codeine to be contraindicated in children aged less than 12 years and in those younger than 18 years who have undergone tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy for obstructive sleep apnoea. Other weak opioids are not considered suitable alternatives, so low-dose oral morphine is often now used instead. Some concerns have been expressed about increased use of strong opioids in the paediatric population. This study aimed to determine the opioid requirements of patients who had undergone ear, nose and throat (ENT) procedures and assess the efficacy and safety of a 200 microgram/kg dose of oral morphine given every 4 hours as needed when given alongside regular non-opioid analgesics. <h3>Methods</h3> Parents of children under the age of 16 who were to undergo planned tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy were approached to participate. If consent was given, they were asked to record pain scores, sickness scores and doses of analgesics administered for seven days postoperatively. Parents were also asked to report any constipation or nausea experienced by the child. A follow-up telephone call was conducted to obtain the recorded data from parents. <h3>Results</h3> 37 paediatric patients (21 adenotonsillectomy; 4 adenoidectomy; 12 tonsillectomy) participated in the study; age range 2–16 years (mean 6.4). Mean pain intensity scores (using a numerical rating scale) were highest on the second postoperative day for each of the surgical procedures: 8.4/10 for tonsilellectomy, 7.1/10 for adenotonsillectomy and 5.5/10 for adenoidectomy. Tonsillectomy patients experienced more severe pain throughout the postoperative period as compared to adenotonsillectomy or adenoidectomy patients and on the final day of observation mean pain scores were 3.4, 2.1 and 1/10 respectively. Four (10.8%) patients had pain scoring 6/10 or greater on the 7th post-operative day. Patients all received paracetamol and ibuprofen for the full 7 days post-operatively. Tonsillectomy patients needed more doses of morphine than those who had undergone adenotonsilectomy; none of the adenoidectomy patients required morphine to relieve pain. Use of morphine reduced as their mean pain scores decreased over time. One (2.7%) patient sought additional medical help for analgesia. Unwanted effects were observed in 13 (35.1%) patients: constipation (six patients), drowsiness (four patients), mild nausea (two patients) and vomiting (one patient). One patient sought additional medical help for morphine-related side effects. Mean parent satisfaction score recorded was 8/10. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Pain following tonsillectomy and adenotonsillectomy was significant and not controlled by paracetamol and ibuprofen alone. Morphine was a safe and effective alternative to codeine.",

      "title": "Management of Hypertension With a Fixed‐Dose (Single‐Pill) Combination of Bisoprolol and Amlodipine",
      "abstract": "Hypertension is currently one of the greatest global health care challenges. Although many effective drugs are available, combinations of 2 or more medications are often required to meet clinical targets. Combination therapy has several advantages over monotherapy: lower doses of each drug can be used to achieve therapeutic goals; lower doses may lead to fewer adverse events, facilitating patient adherence; and using multiple drugs with different modes of action may be more effective in treating multifactorial diseases, including hypertension. Adherence is an important consideration when requiring patients to self-administer multiple medications; as the number of concurrent medications increases, patient adherence tends to decrease. Recent evidence suggests that fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) may be more effective than free-dose combinations, as they provide all necessary medications in a single convenient tablet/single-pill combination. Among combinations of hypertension medications, a β-blocker such as bisoprolol with a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine is an effective combination therapy for hypertension, with distinct and complimentary modes of action. With advantages over free-dose combinations, the FDC of bisoprolol/amlodipine is thus an effective and convenient treatment for hypertension, allowing more patients to achieve their therapeutic goals, while potentially reducing the burden of hypertension on health care systems.",

      "abstract": "Tiamulin hydrogen fumarate is a semisynthetic derivative of the diterpene antibiotic pleuromutilin used in poultry medicine to treat mainly Mycoplasma- and Brachyspira-related diseases. Its use over 30 yr has not generally increased the development of resistance to these pathogens but occasionally resistant isolates are encountered. Tiamulin administered at therapeutic levels is relatively quickly absorbed, metabolized in the liver, and eliminated from the body of the bird after a withdrawal period of 72 h, and as a result, meat products can be safely consumed. A zero withdrawal period for eggs has been granted in several European Union states. When administered with different drugs, tiamulin has been shown to have an enhanced activity with the tetracyclines. There is a strong interaction, even death, with the ionophore anticoccidials monensin, narasin, and salinomycin when tiamulin is used at therapeutic levels, but this is dose-related and low doses do not interact. It is thought to be caused by the preferential metabolism of tiamulin in the liver resulting in a build up of the ionophore leading to clinical signs of overdosage. Tiamulin shows a milder interaction, such as temporary growth depression, with maduramicin and semduramicin but is compatible with lasalocid. Although tiamulin shows small benefits in improving performance in healthy animals, its main production benefit is in the face of infection, as a true therapeutic antibiotic.",

The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the nature and the risks associated with 25C-NBOMe, which has recently appeared in the drug market. Methods . A systematic analysis of the scientific literature and a qualitative assessment of online and media resources (e.g., e-newsgroups, chat-rooms, and e-newsletters) in 10 languages were carried out. Results . 25C-NBOMe is sold online as legal LSD or as research chemical with different designations such as “Boom,” “Pandora,” “Holland film,” or “N-bomb.” It is a partial agonist of 5-HT2A receptors. It is usually ingested orally/sublingually and, less commonly, nasally, through injection, vaginally, rectally, and smoked. Its effects include sublingual numbing, stimulation, “body high,” hallucinations, dissociation, and anxiety. 25C-NBOMe presents high risk of overdoses; acute toxicity and fatalities have been reported. Conclusions . 25C-NBOMe consumption represents an emerging phenomenon with potential harmful effects. Its use is increased by its online availability at low costs. Health and other professionals should be informed about this new trend of substance use.",

      "title": "Zonisamide-induced acute kidney injury",
      "abstract": "Zonisamide is a new generation anticonvulsant indicated for the adjunctive management of partial seizures in adults [1]. The anticonvulsant activity of zonisamide is predominantly related to the inhibition of voltage-gated sodium action potentials and reduction of T-type calcium-channel currents. Because of its broad mechanism of action, zonisamide is used for many types of epilepsy and in patients whose epilepsy is resistant to other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) [2,3]. There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate the superior clinical effectiveness of zonisamide compared to other adjunctive AEDs; however, its long half-life of 63 h supports convenient once- or twice-daily dosing. In vitro studies have demonstrated antioxidant and neuroprotective properties at therapeutic doses, suggesting that zonisamide may protect against ischemic damage and recurrent seizure activity [4].\r\n\r\nTherapy is generally well tolerated; the most common reported adverse events include somnolence in 17% of patients and dizziness and anorexia in 13% of patients. Zonisamide may be an alternative in some patients over agents associated with weight gain, such as valproate or pregabalin [5,6]. Zonisamide is metabolized by acetylation to N-acetyl zonisamide and reduction to 2-sulfamoylacetyl phenol (SMAP) by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4. Zonisamide primarily undergoes renal excretion with 62% recovered from urine and 3% from feces following multiple doses [1,7].\r\n\r\nThe package insert was recently updated to reflect a risk of hyperchloremic, nonanion gap metabolic acidosis due to weak inhibition of carbonic anhydrase and increased renal excretion of bicarbonate. Furthermore, according to the manufacturer's label, zonisamide is not recommended for use in patients with renal failure (defined by the manufacturer as an estimated GFR < 50 mL/min); use of this agent in patients with renal insufficiency, defined as having a GFR < 60 mL/min according to the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, requires slower titration and more frequent clinical monitoring for toxicities and adverse effects. Avoidance of use of zonisamide in individuals with end-stage kidney disease (e.g., GFR < 15 mL/min or on dialysis) is prudent based on manufacturer recommendations. Zonisamide has been associated with a statistically significant 8% mean increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen in clinical trials; however, this effect dissipated after therapy was discontinued. Of note, a case report has demonstrated hypersensitivity syndrome with acute kidney injury due to zonisamide; however; acute kidney injury has not been previously reported as an adverse event of zonisamide [7]. We present a case report that suggests that such an association exists as demonstrated by acute kidney injury in a patient on two separate occasions.",

Sodium pentobarbital acts similarly for tripelennamine and diphenhydramine in rats but not for chlorprophenpyridamine. In rats overdosed orally with tripelennamine or diphenhydramine, the death rate is not significantly affected by sodium pentobarbital, although convulsions are aborted in part and survival time may be increased. It is suggested that the degradation products of the antihistamine, which are present in greater amounts after oral administration, may enhance the actions of sodium pentobarbital and contribute to the over-all toxicity. It is recommended that should the attempt be made in the clinic to antagonize antihistaminic overdosage with a barbiturate, immediate treatment and removal of any unabsorbed material are prime requisites in addition to the usual supportive therapy. The pharmacologic basis for such measures has been discussed.",

The most serious error is the use of a mixed type of penicillin for intramuscular treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis. Mixtures of procaine and benzathine penicillin have been roundly condemned by every leading authority in the field and should never be used for streptococcal pharyngitis because (1) there is usually an inadequate quantity of benzathine penicillin, and (2) the procaine penicillin is needless. Studies by Stollerman and others have demonstrated beyond question that benzathine penicillin alone reaches a streptococcallethal level as rapidly as does any type of injected penicillin. Many pediatricians and other clinicians persist in the use of these mixed preparations, to the detriment of their patients. Two milliliters of the various mixtures of procaine penicillin and benzathine penicillin contain 600,000 units of benzathine penicillin—a quantity simply not adequate for many patients—particularly older,",

      "abstract": "Incapacitating and irritating agents produce temporary disability persisting for hours to days after the exposure. One can be exposed to these agents occupationally in industrial or other working environments. Also general public can be exposed in special circumstances, like industrial accidents or riots. Incapacitating and irritating agents discussed in this review are chloropicrin and capsaicinoids. In addition, we include sulfur mustard, which is an old chemical warfare agent and known to cause severe long-lasting injuries or even death. Chloropicrin that was used as a warfare agent in the World War I is currently used mainly as a pesticide. Capsaicinoids, components of hot pepper plants, are used by police and other law enforcement personnel as riot control agents. Toxicity of these chemicals is associated particularly with the respiratory tract, eyes and skin. Their acute effects are relatively well known but the knowledge of putative long-term effects is almost non-existent. Also, mechanisms of effects at cellular level are not fully understood. There is a need for further research to get better idea of health risks, particularly of long-term and low-level exposures to these chemicals. For this, exposure biomarkers are essential. Validated exposure biomarkers for capsaicinoids, chloropicrin and sulfur mustard do not exist so far. Metabolites and macromolecular adducts have been suggested biomarkers for sulfur mustard and these can already be measured qualitatively, but quantitative biomarkers await further development and validation. The purpose of this review is, based on the existing mechanistic and toxicokinetic information, to shed light on the possibilities for developing biomarkers for exposure biomonitoring of these compounds. It is also of interest to find ideas for early effect biomarkers considering the need for studies on subchronic and chronic toxicity.",

Naloxone is currently the recommended treatment for reversing opioid poisoning; however, it has limitations, such as a shorter half-life than most opioids, which can lead to renarcotization. Multiple nanoparticle (NP) formulations have addressed this limitation by exhibiting a longer half-life as well as successfully antagonizing the effects of opioids. This review explores the polymer-, lipid-, and peptide-based NP formulations, which have been studied as alternatives for naloxone.

      "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are usually prescribed either locally (topical forms) at the first stage, or orally at the second stage, if the effect of local pain relief when using NSAIDs has not been achieved. The combined use of different forms with the same NSAID molecule will enhance and prolong the anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect, reduce the dosage of the oral drug, and thereby reduce the risks of adverse events (AE). Nimesulide is a representative of the sulfonanilide class among NSAIDs, refers to drugs that inhibit mainly the enzyme cyclooxygenan-2 (COX-2), and has no effect on COX-1. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are significantly less likely to cause the development of NSAID-gastropathies. Nimesulide is characterized by a low range of relative risks (RR) compared to other commonly prescribed NSAIDs: &lt;2 for rofecoxib, celecoxib, nimesulide; from 2 to &lt; 5 for naproxen, ibuprofen, diclofenac, etoricoxib, meloxicam; and ≥ 5 for ketoprofen, piroxicam, ketorolac. The anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect of nimesulide is achieved by inhibiting the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), histamine, inhibiting the formation of reactive oxygen species, releasing matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), and inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis. The clinical effectiveness of the analgesic effect of nimesulide has been proven in pain syndrome in patients with osteoarthritis (OA), lower back pain (LBP), gouty arthritis. The anti-inflammatory effect of nimesulide is manifested in the suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nimesulide has a low level of AE from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), therefore it can be recommended for elderly patients.",

      "title": "Intraoperative metamizol as cause for acute anaphylactic collapse",
      "abstract": "EDITOR: The pyrazolone derivative metamizol is used clinically for its analgesic, antipyretic, anti-inflammatory or spasmolytic properties [1,2]. Metamizol is commonly used throughout Europe and South America. In contrast, metamizol is not used in other countries (e.g. the USA) due to the ongoing controversy regarding its potential to precipitate allergic agranulocytosis [3]. Only little is known about the potential of metamizol to precipitate acute anaphylactic reactions. In fact, a study on the risk of anaphylactic reactions associated with the in-hospital application of frequently used medications demonstrated only a relatively low risk of acute anaphylactic reactions associated with metamizol, similar to paracetamol [4]. However, some very recent reports on the use of metamizol during the perioperative period describe severe allergic reactions associated with its intravenous (i.v.) application [5-7]. Similarly, we here report two patients in whom intraoperative use of i.v. metamizol was immediately followed by cardiocirculatory collapse. Such reports suggest that the risk of metamizol associated severe anaphylactic reactions may be underestimated. Case report Case 1. A 58-yr-old male patient presented to the hospital for revision of an intracranial neurostimulator that had been implanted previously in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. His past medical history was only remarkable for Parkinson's disease. He had no known drug allergies accept a skin reaction associated with the use of oral tilidin. Prior to the operation, the patient was premedicated with midazolam and anaesthesia was induced with sufentanil 15 μg and propofol 175 mg. Tracheal intubation could be performed easily after muscle paralysis was obtained with rocuronium 40 mg. Prior to the incision, the patient received cefuroxime 3 g. At the end of the operation, 2500 mg of metamizol were given i.v. as a short infusion to prevent postoperative pain. Immediately after completion of the infusion, the patient became hypotensive (blood pressure (BP) 50/30 mmHg), bronchospastic and developed generalized erythema. As the patient became pulseless, chest compressions were initiated and i.v. epinephrine, 1 mg every 2 min was given. After 15 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), an episode of ventricular fibrillation could be converted to sinus rhythm with electrical defibrillation. At this point, the patient had a palpable pulse and a BP of 90/60 mmHg. Epinephrine was continued as an infusion and the patient was transported to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a stable condition. Further investigations ruled out myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. Shortly after, he was extubated and subsequently transferred to a ward and discharged home in good condition. An allergic study showed dramatically elevated tryptase plasma levels (32.4 μg L−1 at 6 h after exposure) and skin prick testing showed a strong reaction to metamizol (0.5 cm skin wheal) at a dilution of 1:1000. All other substances tested (normal saline, all anaesthetic and antibiotic medications used during the perioperative period) did not provoke a skin reaction. Case 2. A 52-yr-old male presented to the hospital with a herniated disk and was scheduled to undergo lumbar discectomy. His past medical history was significant for transient ischaemic attacks and vascular encephalopathy. The patient was not aware of any previous allergic reactions. For the operation, the patient was premedicated with midazolam, 1 mg i.v. and anaesthesia was induced with sufentanil 15 μg and propofol 200 mg. After muscle paralysis was obtained with rocuronium 30 mg, tracheal intubation could be performed easily and anaesthesia was maintained throughout the operation with isoflurane. The patient was placed in a prone position and received i.v. cefuroxime 3 g as perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. At the end of the surgery, metamizol 2500 mg was given as an i.v. infusion to decrease postoperative pain. Within minutes, the patient became hypotensive (BP 51/31 mmHg), developed bronchospasm and generalized erythema. He was immediately turned on his back and resuscitated with epinephrine 1.5 mg and rapid i.v. volume infusion (2500 mL of hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4). In addition, the patient received prednisolone 1000 mg, dimetindenmaleat 8 mg and cimetidine 400 mg. Subsequently, the bronchospasm and hypotension resolved and the patient was transported to the ICU. An investigation for pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction was negative. The patient could be extubated after 6 h and was subsequently transferred to a ward. Neurological investigations were unremarkable. Again, the allergic study showed a severe skin reaction to metamizol while all other substances (normal saline and all anaesthetic and antibiotic medications used perioperatively) tested negative. Discussion Metamizol is frequently used in several European and South American countries as an antipyretic and analgesic medication [4]. In contrast, the Food and Drug Administration in the USA has not approved metamizol due to its potential to elicit an antibody related bone marrow depression causing agranulocytosis [3,8]. In addition, cutaneous allergy to metamizol has been reported previously [9]. However, very recent reports on the perioperative use of i.v. metamizol also suggest, that acute allergic reactions leading to cardiovascular collapse may be related to this medication [2,5,7]. Similarly, we report here two patients who received surgery in our hospital within a time period of only 6 months in both of whom we observed an acute anaphylactic collapse immediately after a metamizol infusion. These recent reports suggest, that the potential of metamizol not only to cause a chronic form of allergy (agranulocytosis) but also to cause acute allergic reactions may have been underestimated. If such reports continue, perioperative physicians should consider alternate means of controlling pain or fever other than i.v. metamizol. The development of an acute allergic reaction results from a release of preformed granulocyte-associated mediators, membrane-derived lipids, cytokines and chemokines, when an allergen interacts with immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies bound to mast cells or basophils [10]. Therefore, patients with an IgE-mediated acute allergic reaction have usually had previous exposure to the allergen or a structurally related antigen, thus inducing the formation of IgE antibodies. Similarly, both patients reported previous exposure to metamizol within the last 6 months. However, there are no data available to conclude after which time following a previous exposure, the risk of allergic reactions is decreased. Therefore, it appears critical to follow further publication of acute adverse reactions to i.v. metamizol. If such reports continue, the safety of i.v. metamizol needs to be reconsidered. In the meantime, careful observation as well as readiness for treatment of acute allergic reactions seem justified if i.v. metamizol is given in the perioperative period. T. Eckle N. Ghanayim M.

      "abstract": "Pediatric patients present changing physiological features. Because of the lack of land suitable for commercial management, pediatric specialties very often need to prepare extemporaneous formulations to improve the dosage and administration of drugs for children. Oral liquid formulations are the most suitable for pediatric patients. Clonidine is widely used in the pediatric population for opioid withdrawal, hypertensive crisis, attention deficit disorders and hyperactivity syndrome, and as an analgesic in neuropathic cancer pain. The objective was to study the physicochemical and microbiological stability and determine the shelf life of an oral solution containing 20 µg/mL clonidine hydrochloride in different storage conditions (5 ± 3 °C, 25 ± 3 °C, and 40 ± 2 °C). Using raw material with excipients safe for all pediatric age groups, two oral liquid formulations of clonidine hydrochloride were designed (with and without preservatives). Solutions stored at 5 ± 3 °C (with and without preservatives) were physically and microbiologically stable for at least 90 days in closed containers and for 42 days after opening. Two oral solutions of clonidine hydrochloride 20 µg/mL were developed for pediatric use from raw materials that are readily available and easy to process, containing safe excipients that are stable over a long period of time.",

      "title": "Calcium antagonists: past, present and future - a personal view",
      "abstract": "Calcium antagonists are now widely used in the management of patients with a variety of cardiovascular disorders, including angina pectoris and hypertension. The prototype of the group – the phenylalkylamine-based verapamil – lacked tissue specificity within the cardiovascular system. Its introduction triggered the search for other calcium antagonists with improved tissue selectivity and resulted in the introduction of a variety of dihydropyridine based compounds including nifedipine, nisoldipine, nitrendipine and felodipine. These drugs exhibited improved tissue selectivity relative to verapamil, but possessed unfavourable pharmacokinetic profiles resulting in short duration of action, short plasma half-lives and rapid onset of action. The resultant unfavourable side effects limited the efficacy of these compounds and although the introduction of slow release formulations attenuated some of the problems encountered during their use the search for a tissue selective calcium antagonist with an intrinsically favourable pharmacokinetic profile continued, resulting in the development of amlodipine. Although a dihydropyridine, amlodipine differs from its predecessors in having a strongly ionized side-chain and an ability to insert directly into membranes lipid bilayers. This therefore provides the prototype of a third generation of calcium antagonists characterised by possessing a favourable pharmacokinetic profile (slow onset and prolonged duration of action coupled with a long plasma half-life) due to its own molecular structure. For purposes of classification verapamil can be regarded as the prototype of the first generation of calcium antagonists, nifedipine as the prototype of the second generation (improved tissue selectivity) whilst amlodipine is the prototype of a third generation (retained tissue selectivity with an intrinsically favourable pharmacokinetic profile). Clinically amlodipine is an effective blood pressure lowering agent in hypertensives, where it also reverses left ventricular hypertrophy. Surprisingly amlodipine’s safety extends to its long-term use in hypertensives with severely compromised left ventricular function – including chronic heart failure associated with non-ischaemic, dilated cardiomyopathy.

Medical management of benzodiazepine withdrawal is typically undertaken with benzodiazepines either through loading dose with gradual taper or symptom triggered treatment, though adjuvant anxiolytics and anticonvulsants are often used. Ketamine, increasingly utilized as an adjunct in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal, may represent an effective medication in the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal. In this case report, a 27-year-old male with a history of benzodiazepine and opioid abuse presented to our emergency department with a chief complaint of drug withdrawal. Despite standard treatment with large amounts of benzodiazepine, barbiturate, opioid, and adjunctive medications, the patient remained with severe withdrawal syndrome until an infusion of ketamine (0.5mg/kg in 30 minutes) was administered resulting in significant improvement of the patient symptoms. This case demonstrates the potential role of ketamine as an adjunct medication in the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal.",

As with many widely used drugs, some serious and potentially hazardous reactions to therapy have been documented. This article reviews and analyzes major reported reactions and interactions from both published and unpublished sources. Incidence rates have been calculated for pulmonary, hepatic, neurological, and hematological responses. Calculated rates of occurrence were very low, and ranged from 0.001 percent of courses of therapy (all types of pulmonary reactions combined) to 0.0007 percent (neurological reactions). Reports on interactions of nitrofurantoin with alcohol, antacids, and oral contraceptives are unfounded and anecdotal. Interactions with nalidixic and oxolinic acids are not clinically significant, and only one case of interaction has been reported with phenytoin. Bioavailability is enhanced by food or propantheline.

Congestive heart failure, edoema, and renal failure are among the disorders for which the diuretic melphenidate hydrochloride is prescribed. Because of their exceptional stability, polymeric nanoparticles are an excellent substrate for long-term release. In other words, the half-life of methylphenidate hydrochloride (2.4 hours for children, and 2.1 hours for adults) is so short that it is only effective for a very short duration. Nanoparticles are the primary subject of this investigation. Using Eudragit RL 100 as a release retardant is possible. Therapeutic effectiveness is increased by maintaining a consistent plasma concentration of Methylphenidate Hydrochloride from nanoparticles.

      "abstract": "Abstract Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), or sleeping sickness, is currently on the rise. HAT develops in two stages, the first involving the hemolymphatic system, and the second, the neurological system. Left untreated, HAT is invariably fatal. There have been no therapeutic advances in more than 40 years. Stage 1 can be treated with pentamidine and suramin, but stage 2 can only be treated with melarsoprol, a toxic arsenic derivative that has a 2–12% incidence of fatal side‐effects (encephalopathy). Eflornithine has never achieved widespread use because it is difficult to administer under field conditions. Nifurtimox has been used successfully in the treatment of American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease, but only in small studies or as a compassionate use treatment. There is little research and development for new drugs in this area: only one prodrug is in the clinical development phase, a pentamidine analog that offers hope for the replacement of injectable pentamidine with an orally administered drug. Current efforts appear to be focused on reevaluating older drugs. A course of treatment with melarsoprol for 10 days at 2.2 mg/kg/day is now in the multicenter evaluation phase. Orally administered eflornithine is also slated for reevaluation. In addition, studies of drug combinations are recommended to determine possible combined or synergistic effects and find ways to reduce toxicity.",

      "abstract": "Aim: The term modified-release drug product is used to describe products that alter the timing and/or the rate of release of the drug substance.Objective: The objective of the present study was to formulate and evaluate the sustained release matrix tablet of venlafaxine hydrochloride.Methods: Venlafaxine hydrochloride is a structurally novel antidepressant for oral administration. It is widely prescribed for the treatment of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Venlafaxine hydrochloride is currently available as immediate release tablet and as an extended release capsules under the brand names of Effexor (WYETH AYERST) and Effexor XR (WYETH AYERST). The biological half-life of venlafaxine very short (5 h) and the dose is to be taken 2–3 times a day and the recommended maximum daily dose is 75–450 mg/day. Venlafaxine hydrochloride is an antidepressant and so it is to be taken for quite a long period. Hence, to reduce the dosing frequency, simple, lower cost sustained release tablets of venlafaxine were preferred for the development.Conclusion: The venlafaxine hydrochloride sustained release matrix tablets shown controlled release profile as per the release profile ofthe innovator is EffexorTm_XR. The sustained release of this matrix tablet reduces the dosing frequency and reduces the side effects, bywhich in a long-term therapy, it may be useful as a product with patient compliance for the treatment of major depression disorder.",

      "abstract": "There is a host of pharmaceutical formulations of diclofenac, which ensures that it can be used orally, rectally, intrarectally, or topically. Objective - to comparatively analyze the pharmacokinetic parameters and time course of changes in the serum concentration of diclofenac potassium after oral administration in a dose of 50 mg as sachets or sugar-coated tablets. Results. There is evidence that patients tolerate both its sachets and tablets equally well, as confirmed by subjective and objective observations. There are neither marked side effects nor considerable changes in laboratory tests and in the values of vital functions. Diclofenac potassium as early-action tablets (50 and 100 mg) exerts a very good analgesic effect in treating migraine since the plasma concentration of the drug peaks on an average of an hour of administration (range 0,33-2 hours) and the analgesic effect developed following 60-90 min. Conclusion. By comparing the rate of absorption, it may be concluded that diclofenac potassium as sachets will produce a much rapider analgesic effect. Thus, the high solubility of diclofenac potassium and its very good absorbability (as sachets in particular) make the drug a superior analgesic that has a rapid analgesic activity.",

Venotonic drugs have specific indications limited to functional impairment: heavy feeling in the legs, pain and impatience in the evening. There are different categories of venolymphatic drugs. Flavonoids have various pharmacological actions, most notably an increase in venous tone, reduction of capillary permeability and increase of capillary resistance. Choice of a venotonic drug is funded on knowledge of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the molecule, critical evaluation of clinical studies, physician's personal experience and drug cost.

Severe damage occurred not only in the inner ear but also in the kidney when both furosemide and aminoglycoside antibiotics were administered to rabbits. Kanamycin concentration after a single injection of kanamycin with furosemide was much higher not only in the perilymph but also in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum than that after a single injection of kanamycin alone. The ototoxic interaction following the combined use of furosemide and aminoglycoside antibiotics seems to be caused mainly by the inhibitory effect of furosemide on the excretion of aminoglycoside antibiotics from the kidneys.",

      "title": "Tetrahidrokanabinol kao doping",
      "abstract": "Doping is one of the major problems of modern sport. It is defined as a violation of one or more anti-doping rules defined by the World Anti-Doping Code. Tetrahydrocannabinol is also among doping substances, according to the three WADA criteria. It origins from the plant Cannabis sativa, Cannabinaceae. It is a psychoactive cannabinoid with the strongest activity. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic mechanisms are responsible for his actions. Depending on the method of application the absorption varies from faster by inhalation to slower by oral ingestion. THC significantly binds to proteins ( 98 % ) and the volume of distribution ( Vd ) is 10 L / kg. THC is metabolized in the liver by hydroxylation, and his half-life is 25 to 57 hours. The hydroxylated forms is the active form . The most part gets secreted in urine as conjugated glucuronic acid. THC binds to cannabinoid receptors ( CB1 and CB2 ). This fact is responsible for the effects on memory, emotion, cognition and movement. It also causes euphoria, relaxation, changes in perception, time distortion and intensifying of normal sensory experiences. Short-term memory and attention, motor skills and reaction time are skills that are affected by THC use. This fact has been confirmed by studies on the impact of THC on sporting ability and performance. They are mostly based on epidemiological studies, studies of performance, driving and flight in the simulator, and closed / open studies of driving on the track. Nevertheless, they are easily transfered to sports, since it is confirmed that the perceptual features are significantly altered, and the user of THC may have difficulty in maintaining concentration and attention which are all important for high performance sport and performance excellence. The main conclusion of most studies is that if the level of THC in blood goes over 5 ng / mL significant negative effects of THC are beginning to prevail. WADA, as the main organization responsible for maintaining the equality of all athletes on the competition (in terms of purity of doping), fair play and the health of athletes, determined the threshold value above which THC must not be found in urine. It used to be the value of 15 ng / ml, but the new decision from year 2013. is 150 ng / ml. This is not only for athletes protection, but also teammates and opponents, becouse an athlete under the influence of THC does not meet the criteria of sober athletes who can rationally judge and duly respond. That is why athletes need to take responsibility to make sure that the substance does not reach their body for which they could be punished, because that punishment is going to leave consequences for them and their career, there are often consequences of their clubs, teammates and the people around them.",

      "title": "The postfinasteride syndrome; an overview",
      "abstract": "As a 5-α reductase inhibitor, Finasteride has proven effective in ameliorating two conditions documented to be androgen dependent, namely male androgenic alopecia and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Therapeutic results are maintained as long as the drug is administered, with treatment cessation generally leading to the return of symptomatology for each condition. In addition, during the therapeutic phase, several adverse effects have been reported, some of which persist long or indefinitely after treatment cessation, known as “post-finasteride syndrome.” Herein we present and discuss the most common finasteride side effects, along with a psycho-neuroendocrine rationale that could explain the persistence of many adverse effects after treatment cessation. Moreover, we argue that finasteride adverse effects occurring during finasteride administration should be delineated from postfinasteride side effects (encountered after treatment cessation), suggesting the need to be addressed separately within a therapeutic perspective. Until a tailored therapeutic approach of postfinasteride syndrome becomes available, we have noted that hand preference and sexual orientation seem to be useful as possible predicting factors for finasteride side effects and postfinasteride syndrome. Finally, even though finasteride administration is considered relatively safe, literature data urges prudence. Specifically, recent studies report that some subjects receiving finasteride develop severe depressive episodes including suicidal thoughts, in part due to persistent sexual side effects.",

      "title": "Lactic Acidosis during Propofol–Remifentanil Anesthesia in an Adult",
      "abstract": "PROPOFOL became available for commercial use in the current lipid emulsion formulation 20 yr ago.1Its superior properties in terms of anesthetic recovery were quickly recognized, and its use became widespread.2The drug has a remarkable safety record in anesthetic practice when used as an intravenous induction agent or for intravenous maintenance of anesthesia. The widespread use of propofol for short-term (< 24 h) sedation in intensive care units (ICUs) has led to an increased interest in long-term use (> 72 h).3The use of propofol in this context, particularly at high doses (e.g. , for cerebral metabolic suppression in brain trauma), has been associated with a range of toxic reactions, including metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, myocardial failure and death.4–6The role of propofol in these reactions has been debated vigorously in the literature.7–9We present the case of a severe nonfatal metabolic acidosis related to short-term propofol administration during anesthesia in an adult patient.A 64-yr-old, 71-kg man was scheduled to undergo laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for treatment of prostatic adenocarcinoma. The patient had a history of an uneventful, bilateral, inguinal hernia repair during general anesthesia. He had recently been treated with 40 mg pantoprazole daily for a gastric ulcer and was taking 80 mg gliclazide twice daily for mature-onset diabetes. The patient was in excellent condition before surgery. The usual preoperative test results were strictly normal.The evening before surgery, the patient received 20 mg hypodermic enoxaparin and 0.5 mg oral alprazolam. On the morning of surgery, he took his 40 mg oral pantoprazole and received an intramuscular injection of 5 mg midazolam.The patient was anesthetized with a total intravenous technique using 1% propofol (Diprivan-prefilled syringes, sealed until use; produced by AstraZeneca S.p.A., Caponago, Italy, and packaged by AstraZeneca UK Limited, Macclesfield, Cheshire, United Kingdom) and remifentanil, with muscle relaxation being achieved by continuous administration of mivacurium (total amount of propofol: 2500 mg; total amount remifentanil: 6 mg, both infused over approximately 4.5 h).Surgery went on without any problems, but, after approximately 3 h of anesthesia, the patient suddenly became tachycardic (100–110 beats/min) although his heart rate had been between 45 and 60 beats/min until then. The blood gases, then realized, showed the following: pH, 7.43; partial pressure of oxygen (Po2), 210 mmHg; partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Pco2), 36.9 mmHg; lactate, 1.45 mm; bicarbonate (HCO3−), 25.1 mm; base excess, 1.6 mm; glucose, 113 mg/dl; hemoglobin, 13.0 mg/dl.The surgical procedure continued uneventfully. The patient remained stable hemodynamically, and no arrhythmias were noted. The patient was normothermic (36.5°C), was not bleeding actively, and had a diuresis of approximately 1.5 ml · kg−1· h−1.The subsequent blood gases, tested 1 h later, showed a moderate metabolic acidosis: pH, 7.28; Po2, 177 mmHg; Pco2, 43.5 mmHg; lactate, 6.99 mm, HCO3−, 20.8 mm; base excess, −5.1 mm; glucose, 136 mg/dl; hemoglobin, 12.1 mg/dl.Acidosis increased in the following hour despite volume administration with crystalloids (1 l normal saline) and colloids (1 l hydroxyethyl starch, 6%). The blood gases were as follows: pH, 7.26; Po2, 155 mmHg; Pco2, 41.9 mmHg; lactate, 8.2 mm; HCO3−, 19.1 mm; base excess, −6.9 mm; glucose, 125 mg/dl; hemoglobin, 10.7 mg/dl.By that time, surgery had ended, and because the source of the acidosis was unclear, transesophageal echocardiography was performed, which showed good left and right contractility, adequate ventricular filling, and an adequate cardiac output of approximately 8.5 l/min. Furthermore, the abdominal cavity was searched for any septic source or hepatic necrosis, without success. It was then decided to transfer the patient, sedated and intubated, to the ICU. The last blood gases showed the following: pH, 7.28; Po2, 162 mmHg; Pco2, 39.6 mmHg; lactate, 8.57 mm; HCO3−, 18.9 mm; base excess, −6.7 mm; glucose, 129 mg/dl; hemoglobin, 10.7 mg/dl. The total amount of fluids given during the procedure consisted of 3 l normal saline and 1 l hydroxyethyl starch, 6%.Because the source of the lactic acidosis was believed to be the propofol infusion, in the ICU, the mode of sedation was changed to intravenous midazolam. Morphine was added to treat postoperative pain. The patient experienced mild pyrexia during the following hour. Blood cultures were taken, and antibiotic therapy was started empirically (2 g intravenous amoxicillin clavulanate every 8 h and 500 mg intravenous amikacin every 8 h).No alterations in blood parameters were observed except the metabolic acidosis (lactate, 8.9 mm); there were no signs of rhabdomyolysis (creatine kinase, 149 U/l [normal, 0–190 U/l]), no signs of heart ischemia (creatine kinase MB < 15 U/l [normal, 0–24 U/l]; troponin I < 0.4 U/l [normal, 0–0.4 U/l]), no alterations in hepatic enzymology (aspartate aminotransferase, 20 U/l [normal, 0–53 U/l]; alanine aminotransferase, 26 U/l [normal, 0–53 U/l]), no signs of sepsis, and no ketone bodies in the urine.During the subsequent hours, the clinical condition of the patient improved, and the acidosis resolved completely without any other particular treatment than a change in the mode of sedation and discontinuation of the propofol infusion. The patient was then allowed to wake up, and the trachea was extubated approximately 6 h after admission to the ICU. He made a complete recovery. The results of the blood cultures taken during the ICU admission were negative.Since 1990, multiple reports in the pediatric literature have raised questions as to whether propofol, given as a long-term infusion, has been responsible for the death of certain pediatric patients.4–6In 1992, five cases of metabolic acidosis, bradyarrhythmia, and fatal myocardial failure were reported in children receiving intensive care treatment for upper respiratory tract infections necessitating positive-pressure ventilation.4The patients were aged 4 weeks to 6 yr and had received average propofol infusion rates of 7.5–10 mg · kg−1· h−1for 66–115 h. The total dose of propofol administered over a prolonged period was well outside of past experience with propofol in the anesthetic setting, and the role of propofol in causing death versus the usually ascribed sepsis or viral myocarditis in sick patients was intensely debated.4,7,8Other correspondence has attempted to discount the reports of adverse effects of propofol.9One study demonstrated that propofol in lower dosages (not exceeding 67 μg · kg−1· min−1) could safely be used for sedation of critically ill children.10Nevertheless, there seem to be a lethal \"syndrome\" associated with prolonged (> 24–48 h), high-dose (> 150 μg · kg−1· min−1) propofol infusion in children. This propofol infusion syndrome is defined as sudden, or relative sudden, onset of marked bradycardia, resistant to treatment, with progression to asystole plus one of the following: (1) the presence of lipemia, (2) a clinically enlarged liver secondary to fatty infiltration, (3) the presence of severe metabolic acidosis, or (4) the presence of muscle involvement with evidence of rhabdomyolysis or myoglobinuria.11However, until recently, there have been few reports of propofol infusion syndrome in adults. In 1996, Marinella12reported the case of a 30-yr-old woman with asthma exacerbation complicated by acute respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation and sedation that was achieved by intravenous infusion of propofol. After only 2 h of infusion, the patient showed a worsening anion gap, metabolic acidosis, and increased serum lactate. Propofol was discontinued because it was believed that it might have caused metabolic acidosis. Serial measurements showed that pH, HCO3−, and anion gap values subsequently normalized, and the patient was extubated without any problems.In 2000, Perrier et al. 13reported what was believed to be the first case of death related to propofol infusion in an adult. An 18-yr-old man involved in an automobile accident required sedation with propofol. Based on his weight, he received propofol infusion at a rate of 5.8 mg · kg−1· h−1for the first 39 h and 7.6 mg · kg−1· h−1for the remaining 59 h of his ICU stay. On posttrauma day 3, the patient's creatine kinase was increased. On posttrauma day 5, he had atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Soon after, a left bundle branch block with bradycardia developed. Clinical status was complicated by progressive metabolic acidosis, lipemia, and an increased serum potassium concentration. Myocardial failure ensued, and the patient died secondary to pulseless electrical activity and asystole.Another report described a dose-dependent association between long-term propofol infusion and cardiac failure in critically ill adults.14In 2001, Badr et al. 15reported a case of metabolic acidosis associated with the use of a new formulation of propofol. The generic propofol used in this case was different in formulation (pH and preservative) than the Diprivan brand we used in our case.During a recent pediatric case in the ICU setting,16important metabolic analysis were performed. The hypothesis to explain this propofol infusion syndrome is consistent with an impairment in free fatty acids oxidation, namely reduced mitochondrial entry of long-chain acylcarnitine esters due to inhibition by propofol of the transport protein carnitine palmityl transferase I, and failure of the respiratory chain at complex II, resulting in an imbalance between energy demand and supply, which may lead to lactic acidosis and ultimately to cardiac and peripheral muscle necrosis.The so-called propofol infusion syndrome mimics the mitochondrial myopathies, in which there are specific defects in the mitochondrial respiratory chain associated with specific mitochondrial DNA abnormalities, resulting in a abnormal lipid metabolism in cardiac and skeletal muscle. These individuals, who are probably genetically susceptible, remain well until stressed by infection or starvation, although subclinical biochemical abnormalities of mitochondrial transport can be demonstrated. During the management of their critical disease, diversion of metabolism to fat substrates may cause \"propofol infusion syndrome.\" Because adults have larger carbohydrate stores and require lower doses of propofol for sedation, this may account for the relative rarity of this syndrome in adults. It is unclear whether the dose or duration of propofol infusion alters this effect.No metabolic analyses were performed in the current patient to try to explain the propofol-related metabolic acidosis.To our knowledge, this is the first case report of severe nonfatal metabolic acidosis probably due to propofol administration in a previously healthy and non–intensive care patient anesthetized with relative low doses of propofol for a short period of time in the perioperative period.",

      "title": "Use of Oral and Implantable Naltrexone in the Management of the Opioid-Impaired Physician",
      "abstract": "Doctors are at an increased risk for prescription drug use, particularly opioids and benzodiazpines. This use can interfere with work function and has major potential negative implications for patient safety. Oral naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, has been used as part of a management strategy for opioid-dependent physicians. While some patients stabilize on oral naltrexone, others relapse to opioid use. An alternative method of naltrexone maintenance involves the injection or surgical insertion of a sustained release preparation of naltrexone. This approach dramatically improves compliance, removing the onus from the previously opioid impaired physician to use daily oral naltrexone. This article describes the cases of four opioid-impaired doctors who received naltrexone (either oral or implant) as part of their management. The authors conclude that monitoring daily oral naltrexone use and detecting early opioid relapse is difficult, placing both the opioid impaired physician and their patients at risk. In contrast, by using implantable naltrexone, compliance is assured and opioid abstinence can virtually be guaranteed for five months. It is argued that naltrexone implants offer a level of protection not achieved with any previous treatment. It is recommended that management should involve early and close collaboration between the treating doctor and the Medical Board, with initial treatment, ongoing monitoring and follow-up being a Medical Board requirement for registration.",

      "abstract": "‘‘Rhinitis medicamentosa (RM) is a drug induced, nonallergic form of rhinitis that is associated with prolonged use of topical vasoconstrictors, i.e. local decongestants.’’ 1 Rhinitis medimencatosa and drug-induced rhinitis are differentiated in this Clinical Pearls article, with the former being caused by sympathomimetic amines and imidazolines and the latter associated with antihypertensives, erectile dysfunction drugs, hormones, nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs, psychotropic drugs, and cocaine. The adverse effects associated with these latter drugs usually occur immediately, whereas exacerbation associated with chronic nasal obstruction from topical decongestants might take days. Similarly, discontinuing oral medications that cause drug-induced rhinitis results in almost immediate relief of symptoms, whereas discontinuing nasal decongestants might not relieve chronic nasal obstruction for prolonged periods of time. All over-the-counter topical decongestants have a general warning that they should be discontinued after several days of use, even though the cumulative dose or time period to cause rhinitis medimencatosa has not been conclusively determined. This disease is usually characterized by nasal congestion with or without an underlying upper airway problem. Rhinitis medimencatosa occurs most commonly in young and middle-aged adults of both sexes and has an incidence range from 1% to 9% of visits to otolaryngology clinics or allergy clinics. Nasal decongestants are also commonly started after a viral upper respiratory track infection leading to the syndrome. The appearance of the nasal mucosa cannot distinguish rhinitis medimencatosa from infectious or other types of rhinitis. Most individuals who have overused topical nasal decongestants do so because of chronic nasal obstruction, a clinical problem that can complicate one’s social interactions, reduce the capacity to smell and taste, cause avoidance of exercise, and, in particular, exacerbate or cause snoring and even be involved in the causation of sleep apnea, insomnia, or both. Rhinitis medimencatosa might predispose to chronic sinusitis, otitis media, nasal polyps, and atrophic rhinitis. 2,3 Sympathomimetic amines mimic the actions of the sympathetic nervous system, ultimately stimulating the a receptors and resulting in vasoconstriction. They also are mild b receptor agonists and cause rebound nasal dilatation after the a effect has waned. The imidazolines are primary a2-agonists, causing vasoconstriction.

      "abstract": "Initially used as an analgesic and anesthetic, ketamine has unfortunately been abused as a popular recreational party drug due to its psychotropic effects. Over the last decade, ketamine has also emerged as an effective rapid-onset anti-depressant. The increasingly widespread use and misuse of the drug in infants and pregnant women has posed a concern about the neurotoxicity of ketamine to the immature brains of the developing fetuses and children. In this review, we summarize recent research findings on major possible mechanisms of perinatal ketamine-induced neurotoxicity. We also briefly summarize the neuroprotective effects of ketamine in the presence of noxious stimuli. Future actions include implementation of more drug abuse education and prevention campaigns to raise the public’s awareness of the harmful effects of ketamine abuse; further investigations to justify the clinical use of ketamine as analgesic, anesthetic and anti-depressant; and further studies to develop alternatives to ketamine or treatments that can alleviate the detrimental effects of ketamine use, especially in infants and pregnant women.",

      "abstract": "<b>Abstract ID 102132</b> <b>Poster Board 498</b> Cases of fatal opioid overdose and opioid use disorder have drastically increased in the past decade. One key contributor to this epidemic is the increase in heterologous drug mixtures consisting of different opioids (e.g., heroine, fentanyl) with non-opioids. Recently, xylazine has infiltrated the drug supply market, prompting the United States Office of National Drug Control Policy to declare mixtures of xylazine and fentanyl an emerging threat to the United States. Despite the exponential increase in use of xylazine and fentanyl mixture, interactions between these drugs in the context of overdose and substance use disorder are not well-characterized. To better understand both the physiological effects of xylazine and nature of the interactions between xylazine and fentanyl, this study investigated the cardiopulmonary and antinociceptive effects of xylazine and fentanyl alone, and in a mixture in rats. Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered subcutaneous xylazine (0.1 mg/kg – 10 mg/kg) or fentanyl (0.01 mg/kg – 0.32 mg/kg). Heart rate, breath rate, oxygen saturation, and thermal antinociceptive effects were measured every 10-minutes for 2 hours. Subsequently, mixtures of xylazine and fentanyl were administered to investigate the nature of the interactions with regard to cardiopulmonary and antinociceptive effects. Fentanyl produced significant dose-dependent decreases in heart rate, oxygen saturation, and thermal nociception, lasting approximately 50 minutes prior to returning to baseline. Xylazine produced significant dose-dependent reduction in heart rate and breath rate but was without effect on oxygen saturation and thermal nociception. Bradycardia and reductions in breath rate persisted for at least 2 hours post xylazine administration. Preliminary interactions between xylazine and fentanyl were largely additive in nature, with individual differences observed. These data demonstrate the cardiopulmonary and antinociceptive effects of xylazine and fentanyl, contributing to growing body of literature describing the abuse-related effects of these drugs. Future studies will determine the presence of pharmacokinetics interactions between xylazine and fentanyl, as well as develop and evaluate candidate therapeutics to help treating users of these drug mixtures with the goal of preventing lethality due to drug overdose.",

Consistent with its high affinity for muscarinic M3 receptors and low affinity for M1 and M2 receptors, darifenacin reduces the unwanted effects of nonselective antimuscarinic compounds. Darifenacin requires no metabolism to become active; its elimination half-life with oral, prolonged-release formulations is 6.7–18.5 h and it is metabolized by the liver. The recommended starting dose of once-daily, oral, prolonged-release darifenacin is 7.5 mg, and peak plasma levels are reached approximately 5.5–11.5 h after ingestion. Darifenacin is generally safe, with a tolerability profile (in terms of discontinuation rates due to adverse events) that is similar to placebo and a favorable dosing schedule, which together may improve convenience and, potentially, patient compliance.",

      "abstract": "Formaldehyde is a relatively common naturally occurring substance which can result also from manmade sources. Formaldehyde is a chemical that is quickly broken down in the environment and human body. Formaldehyde is a well established chemical that has been used for preservation of specimens and cadavers in gross Anatomy laboratory and museums for many decades. Its use does not limit itself in medical school but even towards industrial workshops. Medical students, medical faculty, embalmers, histo-pathological technicians are continuously but unknowingly exposed by inhalation to the pungent, acrid and toxic vapors of formaldehyde within their working arena. The ill effects of formaldehyde may be short term or even long term depending on the extent of exposure, the concentration of the chemical and form of the agent used (solid, liquid or gas) . Researchers have proved that short term effects of that agent include nausea, headache, and ocular irritation causing excessive lacrimation and a burning sensation in the throat. Dramatic long-term exposure to formaldehyde can cause contact dermatitis, congenital defects, and even cancer. This article gives a comprehensive analysis and commentary of formaldehyde exposure hazards and human health effects. The implications on embalmers and medical professionals and techniques for reduction of drastic exposure effects are delineated. Everyone benefits when managers and employees work in harmony. Hence this overview throws ample light on alternative methods for reduction of adverse effects so that educational programmes for the betterment of public health can run smoothly without any risk of occupational hazard. The article encourages that these alternative regulatory methods may be legally enforced for the betterment of the subject of Anatomy as a whole.",

Treatment options include cognitive behavioral therapy as well as pharmacologic therapy. Benzodiazepine receptor-agonist modulators are considered first-line therapy in the treatment of chronic insomnia. A nonbenzodiazepine receptor-modulator option to improve sleep latency is ramelteon. Low-dose sedative antidepressants, such as quetiapine or olanzapine, may be used in the treatment of comorbid insomnia. Over-the-counter and herbal agents are not recommended.Numerous medications being used in the management of insomnia have side effects that can limit their use and have a potential for drug interactions. Furthermore, some medications used in the treatment of insomnia do not have clinical trial data to support their use. Future studies are warranted to define second- and third-line agents in the management of insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Background: Cinchonine is one of the Cinchona alkaloids that is commercially extracted from the Peruvian bark of Cinchona officinalis L. (Family: Rubiaceae). It is also obtained in much lower quantities from other species of Cinchona, such as Cinchona calisaya, Cinchona succirubra, and Cinchona pubescens, and in some other plants, such as Remijia peruviana. Cinchonine has been historically used as an anti-malarial agent. It also has a wide range of other biological properties, including anti-cancer, anti-obesity, anti-inflammatory, anti-parasitic, antimicrobial, anti-platelet aggregation, and anti-osteoclast differentiation. Aim and Objective: This review discusses the pharmacological activity of cinchonine under different experimental conditions, including in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. It also covers the compound's physicochemical properties, toxicological aspects, and pharmacokinetics. Methodology: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on multiple online databases, such as PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar. The aim was to retrieve a wide range of review/research papers and bibliographic sources. The process involved applying exclusion and inclusion criteria to ensure the selection of relevant and high-quality papers. Results: Cinchonine has numerous pharmacological properties, making it a promising compound for various therapeutic applications. It induces anticancer activity by activating caspase-3 and PARP-1, and triggers the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. It up-regulates GRP78 and promotes the phosphorylation of PERK and ETIF-2α. Cinchonine also inhibits osteoclastogenesis, inhibiting TAK1 activation and suppressing NFATc1 expression by regulating AP-1 and NF-κB. Its potential anti-inflammatory effects reduce the impact of high-fat diets, making it suitable for targeting obesity-related diseases. However, research on cinchonine is limited, and further studies are needed to fully understand its therapeutic potential. Further investigation is needed to ensure its safety and efficacy in clinical applications. Conclusion: Overall, this review article explains the pharmacological activity of cinchonine, its synthesis, and physicochemical properties, toxicological aspects, and pharmacokinetics.",

      "abstract": "Fendiline is an anti-anginal agent for the treatment of coronary heart disease. Together with other diphenylalkylamines it is sub-classified in the group of lipophilic calcium antagonists. It binds to the calcium channel and to calmodulin with rather similar affinities. Pharmaco-dynamically, it exerts the typical calcium as well as calmodulin antagonistic actions: inhibition of the transmembrane calcium current, smooth muscle relaxation, negative inotropism, cardioprotection, inhibition of calmodulin-activated myosin light-chain kinase and phosphodiesterase. Pharmacokinetics reveal slow onset of action and a long half-life. The anti-anginal and anti-ischaemic efficacy of fendiline has been proven in several placebo-controlled, double-blind trials. It does not interfere with digoxin therapy. Direct comparison with other calcium antagonists by means of controlled studies revealed that its potency is at least equal to that of nifedipine but, in contrast to nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem, its anti-anginal action increases during chronic therapy, reaching a steady state of action after 2 to 3 weeks. In addition, the anti-ischaemic and anti-anginal potency is about equal to that of isosorbide dinitrate but fendiline has the advantage of lacking tolerance development. Nevertheless, the data presented indicate that a combination of fendiline with low doses of ISDN may be beneficial. Adverse cardiac and haemodynamic actions, such as increase or decrease in heart rate, disturbance of AV nodal conduction, impairment of cardiac contractile performance or considerable decrease in arterial pressure in hypotensives and normotensives, are lacking.",

The acronym PCP stems from its organic name 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl) piperidine, which alludes to its relatively simple production from the arylcyclohexylamine piperidine. 1, 2 More than 60 designer analogs more toxic than PCP, but able to escape clinical detection, were common before the sale of piperidine and its derivatives became illegal in the United States in 1978. Ketamine is the only one authorized for medical use, and it was often stolen from veterinary offices for its PCP- like effects. 3 Like ketamine, PCP was formerly used as a preinduction anesthetic and animal tranquilizer, hence it has street eponyms such as “horse tranquilizer,” hog,” and “elephant”. 4, 5 It was prized for its ability to provide anesthesia and analgesia without triggering cardiorespiratory depression, but was soon recalled when patients experienced psychosis, agitation, and dysphoria post-operatively. 6 PCP has re-emerged as a drug of abuse in this decade since its decline after the 1980s. In 1979, 12.8% of twelfth graders had used PCP, whereas in 1997 only 3.9% had used this drug. 1 However, phencyclidine continues to be found in PCP-laced marijuana cigarettes (“whacko tobacco”), and has been detected in up to 24% of street marijuana samples. Regrettably, exposure to the smoke and butts of these cigarettes has resulted in many cases of occult pediatric PCP intoxication. 3 Pharmacology PCP is available as a white crystalline powder (“angel dust”), tablet (“PeaCe Pill”), crystals, and liquid (“whack”); with these varied forms, it can be snorted, smoked, ingested or injected intravenously or subcutaneously. 1, 7, 8 A typical PCP-laced marijuana cigarette contains 1 to 10mg of the drug. The average tablet varies in weight from 1 to 6 mg. 3, Only 0.25 mg of IV solution is required to produce sedation, compared to 10mg required via ingestion or inhalation. 10 Inhalation accounts for 70% of usage, however, because onset of action occurs in 2-5 minutes, without the complications of injection. Effects may take 15 to 60 minutes when ingested orally. 3, 6, 11, 12 Phencyclidine is a weak base that is lipid, water, and alcohol soluble, giving it an extraordinary volume of distribution of 6.2 L/kg. 12 Thus, the relationship between dose, serum level, and effects varies depending upon body habitus, nutritional state, and alcohol coingestion. 3, 13, 14 Walberg et al. did not find any direct relationship of serum concentration of PCP and the clinical pattern of intoxication in a case series of 216 patients with “pure” PCP intoxication. 15 This lack of correlation of plasma concentration and clinical effects of PCP is poorly understood. Additionally, no relevant data or literature could be found to correlate PCP concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with the clinical effects of the drug. In animal experiments PCP-binding antibodies actually increased serum concentrations of PCP, indicating that they simply alter its distribution. 16 PCP levels are highest in adipose tissue, and because of its slow, uneven release from lipid stores, the half-life of PCP is believed to be three days. 3, 13 Due to the brain’s high lipid content and ion trapping, cerebral levels of PCP may be nine times serum levels, allowing its CNS effects to last from seven hours to as long as seven days in chronic users. 17 Regardless of the method of administration, significant amounts of the weakly basic PCP are actively secreted into the acid milieu of the stomach, accumulating to levels up to",

      "abstract": "Background: Children’s aversions to poor and mostly bitter tastes and their inability to swallow tablets and capsules are major challenges in pediatric medicine. Sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB) is a lifesaving waste nitrogen, alternative to urea nitrogen, for individuals suffering from urea cycle disorders. A major issue in the use of NaPB is its highly foul taste, which often leads to children being unable to consume it, resulting in ineffective treatment, or alternatively, necessitating the application of the drug through a nasogastric tube or gastrostomy. Methods: This study reviews the published data on a novel formulation of NaPB, Pheburane ® granules, which begin to release their NaPB after a lag time of ~10 seconds followed by a slow release over several minutes. Results: The taste-masked granule formulation of NaPB dramatically improves the acceptability of the drug by children and appears in initial studies to be both safe and effective. Conclusion: While more studies are needed to substantiate and enrich these initial trials, the available data provide a telling example where masking the drug taste of medicine for children can sometimes be the difference between life and death.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION Las fluoroquinolonas son antibioticos bactericidas de amplio espectro de accion. Son derivados del acido nalidixico. El acido nalidixico comenzo a utilizarse a partir de 1962 en el tratamiento de infecciones urinarias en ninos y adultos sin observarse mayores efectos adversos. Fue la primera quinolona utilizada en pacientes pediatricos con infeccion urinaria complicada. Bailey et al fue el primero en 1972 en reportar artralgia reversible en una mujer que tomaba acido nalidixico que ceso con la discontinuacion del tratamiento. En casi 3 decadas de uso no se han reportado efectos musculoesqueleticos severos secundarios al acido nalidixico que es la quinolona que demostro mayor toxicidad articular en modelos animales. A partir de la decada del 80, se desarrollaron las nuevas quinolonas con mayor actividad y espectro. De ellas, la ciprofloxacina es la mas usada en pediatria. El mecanismo de accion se basa en la inhibicion de la DNA girasa, lo que imposibilita la replicacion del ADN bacteriano. Tienen muy buena absorcion y son los unicos agentes activos por via oral para el tratamiento de Pseudomonas aeruginosa. El uso de quinolonas en ninos ha sido limitado por su potencial efecto adverso de inducir artropatia secundaria a las alteraciones del cartilago. Esto fue observado en animales jovenes en tratamiento con quinolonas. Los viejos y nuevos componentes de las quinolonas demostraron inducir artropatia en animales inmaduros (especies de conejos, perros, cerdos, ratas, etc.). Se constato que afectaba a las grandes articulaciones y que evolucionaba en dias a semanas. Las lesiones histopatologicas en animales jovenes incluian fisuras, osteoporosis, efusion en el espacio intraarticular, etc. Experimentos posteriores demostraron que esta posibilidad de artropatia podria ser especie especifica y dosis dependiente. Aun no se conoce en detalle el mecanismo exacto por el que se produce la artropatia. Esa toxicidad animal relacionada con la edad fue extrapolada al ser humano por lo que se contraindico su uso en ninos, embarazadas y en periodo de lactancia. Han sido utilizadas en distintos tipos de infecciones en pacientes adultos, pero esta cuestionado su uso en pediatria. La Food and Drug Administration (EE.UU), solo aprobo su uso para el tratamiento de infeccion urinaria complicada o para el tratamiento de la inhalacion accidental de Bacillus anthracis. En los ultimos anos esta conducta se replanteo y en “estados de necesidad”, cuando las quinolonas constituyen la unica opcion terapeutica, se admitiria su administracion en la edad pediatrica.",

      "title": "Is Meperidine the Drug That Just Won't Die?",
      "abstract": "Meperidine, the first synthetic opioid, was developed by German chemists as an antispasmodic; its analgesic properties were not identified until several years later in 1939.1 Its rapid onset, short duration of action, and potential antispasmodic benefit in patients with pancreatitis or cholecystitis have long been cited as reasons for its use, but there is now substantial evidence that meperidine provides no greater analgesia or antispasmodic effectthan other opioids. Over the past quarter century, a growing number of case reports and clinical studies describing meperidine's adverse effects have changed opinion on the role of this drug in clinical practice. The rapid onset and short duration, initially thought to be of benefit in providing prompt analgesia, are now believed to result in more rapid development of tolerance and dependence than that seen with other opioids. The ability of meperidine to inhibit dopamine and norepinephrine transporters, similar to cocaine, may not only be responsible for its greater euphoric effect and negative effects on cognition, but may also lead to a greater likelihood for abuse.2 In addition to these drawbacks, meperidine inhibits the presynaptic uptake of serotonin, placing patients at risk for serotonin syndrome, especially in those patients receiving concomitant therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), linezolid, or other compounds that increase serotonin concentrations.The most significant risk from meperidine, however, lies with its elimination. Meperidine is metabolized by N-demethylation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 to normeperidine, a potential neurotoxin.3 Both meperidine and normeperidine are then hydrolyzed to inactive meperidinic acid and normeperidinic acid. These metabolites undergo conjugation with glucuronic acid. All metabolites, as well as a small percentage of the parent compound, are excreted in the urine. While the half-life of meperidine is only 2 to 5 hours, the normeperidine metabolite has a half-life of approximately 15 to 30 hours in adults. The half-life in patients with renal impairment is prolonged, up to 35 to 40 hours. With repeated dosing, or in patients with kidney disease, accumulation of normeperidine may produce anxiety, hallucinations, tremors, myoclonus, and seizures.Little is known about the risk for normeperidine accumulation in pediatric patients. In 1978, Caldwell and colleagues4 reported a slow rate of normeperidine accumulation in infants whose mothers received meperidine during delivery, possibly the result of a reduced rate of hepatic metabolism at birth. That report was supported by the work of Pokela and colleagues,5 who found an average meperidine half-life of 10.7 hours in their sample of 21 infants.5 With age, however, the rate of metabolism rapidly increases. In a study by Hamunen and colleagues6 of 20 4- to 8-year-old children, meperidine pharmacokinetic parameters were found to be similar to those reported in adults, with an average half-life of 3.0 hours. Unfortunately, normeperidine concentrations were not evaluated in either of those studies. Although we lack information about normeperidine pharmacokinetics in children, it may be assumed that any infant or child with renal dysfunction, or those treated with large doses or over a prolonged period of time, would be at risk for accumulation. Cases of normeperidine toxicity have been reported in patients of all ages, including children. It should be kept in mind, however, that neurotoxicity may be particularly difficult to assess, as early symptoms of anxiety and hallucinations are likely to be missed in preverbal and nonverbal patients and tremor or seizures may be ascribed to other causes.7–10Despite its relative lack of benefit compared to other opioids and increasing reports of toxicity, meperidine continues to be used.11 In 1992, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, became the first of many professional health care organizations to call for placing restrictions on prescribing meperidine.12 Among the recommendations from these groups were setting a maximum daily dose (600 mg/day in adults) and limiting duration to 48 hours, as well as eliminating the use of oral meperidine. These policy statements, as well as early quality initiatives,13 influenced the Joint Commission's Pain Management Standards, which recommend limiting meperidine to the short-term treatment of acute pain and the prevention or treatment of drug or blood product-induced rigors or postoperative shivering.14 Compliance with these recommendations has subsequently become an indicator of quality care. Over the past decade, a number of health care organizations have published their experiences with monitoring and restricting meperidine prescribing in adult patient populations. In this issue of the Journal of Pediatric Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Benner and Durham15 add to the literature with the first publication describing meperidine restriction in a children's hospital.While it has been a decade since the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Pain Society published a joint recommendation that meperidine not be used as an analgesic for infants and children, there has been a slow acceptance of this change.16 Although most pediatric institutions have significantly reduced their use of meperidine, few institutions have completely eliminated its availability. Some of the prescribing may stem from pediatric health care providers who are reluctant to change from the routine use of meperidine for procedural sedation, as in the old \"DPT cocktail\" consisting of meperidine (Demerol), promethazine (Phenergan), and chlorpromazine (Thorazine), despite studies showing improved outcomes with agents like ketamine and midazolam.17 Other providers, as described in this issue,15 may continue to prefer meperidine for managing abdominal pain associated with pancreatitis, clinging to a belief in the superiority of meperidine in preventing spasm of the sphincter of Oddi. Clinicians may also fail to appreciate the significance of normeperidine toxicity due to the relative scarcity of pediatric case reports compared to those in adults. In addition, pediatric health care providers continue to receive mixed messages about meperidine use.18,19 While several newer review articles on pediatric analgesics omit meperidine entirely, other articles still list it as a therapeutic option. This is illustrated by a 2009 review of postoperative analgesia in children, which highlighted the risk for normeperidine toxicity and serotonin syndrome in the text but then included recommendations for meperidine in the article's drug dosing tables.20Benner and Durham15 saw a substantial decrease in meperidine prescribing after the implementation of a restriction policy. The authors found that the need to complete even a simple request form can dissuade prescribers when the perceived advantage of the drug is small. The drop in prescribing by orthopedic surgeons suggests that that the group may not have had a strong preference for meperidine but may have been ordering it based on traditional practice patterns. In contrast, the gastroenterology service wrote fewer orders but continued to choose meperidine as an analgesic for children with abdominal pain associated with pancreatitis. Evaluating the effectiveness of their meperidine restriction policy gave the authors information about current prescribing patterns and identified areas for future health care provider education. By publishing their experience, they have provided a useful guide for other children's hospitals facing similar challenges. While meperidine use may never completely die away, with controlled prescribing and health care provider education, we may minimize the number of children who experience its adverse effects.",

Glucocorticoids are proven effective in decreasing inflammatory activity of this disease and in retarding the progression of erosive joint damage. However, they also have multiple possible adverse effects, which are depending on dose and duration of treatment. Due to increasing treatment options (i.e. biologic and targeted synthetic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs) the use of glucocorticoids is subject of debate. The GLORIA study recently showed that addition of 5 mg prednisolone during 2 years is an effective treatment strategy in elderly patients with rheumatoid arthritis, without a substantial risk of adverse events. So, low dose prednisolone remains an attractive treatment option due to its effacacy, ease of use, safety and low cost.",

In an ongoing study, now in its 12th year, L-deprenyl has been administered 1. as monotherapy or 2. in combination with levodopa, to previously untreated patients in the early phases of the disease; 3. added to an existing regimen of levodopa when optimal therapeutic results are not being obtained. This report reviews our experience in each of these three treatment categories. Results obtained to date, indicate that L-deprenyl administered alone does not prevent the occurrence of signs of Parkinson's disease. It's administration with levodopa, as initial therapy, allows for use of lower dosage and less side effects of the latter agent. When L-deprenyl is added to sub-optimal responders to levodopa, it attenuates fluctuating responses, particularly those of the 'end-of-dose'variety.",

      "title": "Intravenous amisulpride: A safer and possibly effective anti-emetic for postoperative nausea and vomiting",
      "abstract": "Sir, Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common phenomenon after receiving an anaesthetic for surgery. Currently, the prevalence of PONV has been estimated to be 30-40% even after two or three prophylactic antiemetic medications and in patients with all four of the Apfel risk factors for PONV.[1] The most common factors predisposing to PONV are the female gender, history of PONV and/or motion sickness, non-smokers, younger age group patients, volatile anaesthetic with or without nitrous oxide, opioids use. PONV not only adds significant postoperative discomfort and dissatisfaction but also increases the length of hospital stay and overall cost of treatment. Presently the commonly used medications for PONV prophylaxis are dexamethasone, 5 HT3-antagonists (ondansetron, ramosetron, palanosetron), anti-histaminic, neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist aprepitant, scopolamine, and metoclopramide.[23] Amisulpride is a potent and selective dopaminergic D2 and D3 receptor antagonist which was available for clinical use as an atypical antipsychotic since 1970. It became popular due to the lesser incidence of extrapyramidal effects with recommended doses (50-1200 mg) at that time. Recently the United States Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) has approved intravenous (IV) amisulpride for managing PONV. The D2 receptor is notorious for manifesting PONV even in surgical patients. Therefore, it was hypothesised that drugs with D2 receptor antagonist properties can be used as prophylaxis and for treating PONV. Droperidol was developed with this knowledge and was used successfully till it was issued a black-box warning in 2001 due to reports of prolonged QTc and life-threatening arrhythmias like torsade de pointes.[4] QTc prolongation mediated by dopaminergic antagonists is because of binding to the potassium ion channel human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG). Antiemetics like droperidol, haloperidol, and prochlorperazine have a high affinity to hERG channel and thus the higher propensity of developing arrhythmias. Amisulpride has an edge over other agents in this regard because its affinity to hERG channel is less than 100 times weaker. The effect of IV amisulpride on QTc was demonstrated in a study by Täubel et al.[5] Authors compared a 5 mg single dose with a 40 mg IV amisulpride in 40 healthy subjects. They concluded that there is dose-dependent QTc prolongation (with 40 mg dose). However, the recommended dose is 5-10 mg IV which is considered safe. The use of IV amisulpride has not demonstrated any serious drug interactions yet and is devoid of enzyme induction or inhibition of cytochrome liver enzymes. All antipsychotics including amisulpride have a propensity of QTc prolongation therefore caution should be exercised. The initial IV preparation of amisulpride was known by the name APD421. As early as 2013, Kranke et al. conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentric trial by recruiting 215 adult surgical patients with more than 2 Apfel risk factors for PONV undergoing surgery and expected to last more than 1 hour with standardised inhalational anaesthesia.[6] The authors concluded that when administered before surgery, amisulpride i.e., APD421 is safe and effective at reducing PONV in moderate/high-risk adult surgical patients. Several studies followed thereafter and established the safety and efficacy of IV amisulpride [Table 1]. It has been shown in pharmacokinetic studies that after the initial IV dose of 5-10 mg, there are therapeutic levels for at least 24 hours with a terminal half-life of 4-6 hours and a complete clearance from the system in approximately 96 hours.Table 1: Published Papers Which Investigated Efficacy and Safety of Intravenous AmisulprideAmisulpride is presently marketed as BARHEMSYS by Acacia Pharma, United States. US-FDA has approved its use for preventing PONV, either alone or in combination with another antiemetic and also for treating PONV in patients who have received antiemetic prophylaxis with an agent of a different class or those who have not received prophylaxis.It should be used with caution in patients with rhythm disturbances, electrolyte abnormalities (low potassium/magnesium levels), and with other drugs causing QTc prolongation. Future studies could focus on the efficacy of amisulpride in patients undergoing specific surgeries with a high propensity for PONV. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "In situ gelling drug delivery systems have gained enormous attention over the last decade. They are in a sol-state before administration, and they are capable of forming gels in response to different endogenous stimuli, such as temperature increase, pH change and the presence of ions. Such systems can be administered through different routes, to achieve local or systemic drug delivery and can also be successfully used as vehicles for drug-loaded nano- and microparticles. Natural, synthetic and/or semi-synthetic polymers with in situ gelling behaviour can be used alone, or in combination, for the preparation of such systems; the association with mucoadhesive polymers is highly desirable in order to further prolong the residence time at the site of action/absorption. Nasal drug delivery is a better alternative of oral and parental route due to high permeability of Nasal epithelium, rapid drug absorption, avoid Hepatic first pass metabolism, increased bioavailability of drug, minimized local and systemic side effects, Low dose required, Direct transport into systemic circulation and CNS is also possible (passing blood brain barrier), Improved patient compliance, Self-Medication is Possible, prevent Gastro intestinal tract Ulceration. Recently, it has been shown that many drugs have better bioavailability by nasal route than the oral route. Thus, this review focuses on nasal drug delivery, various aspects of nasal anatomy and physiology, nasal absorption mechanism, advantages &amp; disadvantage composition of in situ gel, application and In-situ gels evaluations.&#x0D;",

They are unobtrusively included in daily diet in common products as coffee, tea, energetic drinks, or chocolate.

Theophylline and theobromine are other relevant methylxanthines also commonly available in the aforementioned sources. There are many disseminated myths about methylxanthines but there is increased scientific knowledge to discuss all the controversy and promise shown by these intriguing phytochemicals. In fact, many beneficial physiologic outcomes have been suggested for methylxanthines in areas as important and diverse as neurodegenerative and respiratory diseases, diabetes or cancer. However, there have always been toxicity concerns with methylxanthine (over)consumption and pharmacologic applications. Herein, we explore the structure-bioactivity relationships to bring light those enumerated effects. The potential shown by methylxanthines in such a wide range of conditions should substantiate many other scientific endeavors that may highlight their adequacy as adjuvant therapy agents and may contribute to the advent of functional foods.

      "abstract": "Benzalkonium chloride (BAC) is a quaternary ammonium compound commonly employed as a preservative in several multidose eye drops. Its use is associated with several adverse events, particularly when used chronically. Topically instilled BAC acts not only on superficial structures but also reaches deeper tissues (trabecular meshwork, optic nerve) and can be deleterious in patient under chronic treatment. In glaucomatous patients, BAC is the primary cause of ocular surface disease (OSD), and it can lead to significant morbidity, influence treatment compliance, quality of life, and surgical outcomes. Clinical and experimental evidence demonstrates that BAC causes instability of the tear layer, loss of goblet cells, apoptosis, subclinical neuroinflammation, and antibiotic resistance. Considering the validity of the alternative formulations (alternative preservatives or preservative-free formulations) it is unreasonable to persist in using such toxic compounds and, perhaps it is time for a moratorium on the use of BAC in eye drops.",

      "abstract": "3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP, amifampridine) is the leading treatment for Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), an autoimmune disorder with impaired neuromuscular transmission, for which few effective medications are currently available. 3,4-DAP has been available as a therapy for LEMS in special treatment programmes for approximately 25 years. As an unlicensed drug, doses for oral administration are required to be compounded by local, hospital or other compounding pharmacies from the base chemical. Administering the correct dose of 3,4-DAP is critical; overdosing can increase the risk of seizures and other adverse events, while underdosing can result in a substantial loss of efficacy or even treatment failure. Two recent studies, have shown a wide variation in the 3,4-DAP content of compounded preparations (22.2–125.2 %, n=9) and (53.5–128.5 %, n=21), thereby reflecting the possibility of patients receiving dosages that might be above safety limits or even markedly below efficacy limits. This inconsistency results from the variable quality and instability of the base chemical and compounding errors. A formulation of 3,4-DAP phosphate salt has now been licensed in Europe and the US with orphan medicinal product status and appears to be as efficacious as the base in relieving the symptoms of LEMS.",

      "title": "New and emerging treatments for fungal infections",
      "abstract": "Although several new antifungal drugs have been licensed in the last 5 years, some patients remain difficult to treat. The main reasons for this include intrinsic or acquired antifungal resistance, organ dysfunction preventing the use of some agents and drug interactions. In addition, some drugs penetrate poorly into sanctuary sites including eye and urine, and others are associated with considerable adverse events. Here, we review the preclinical and clinical development progress with four new antifungal agents: isavuconazole, ravuconazole, albaconazole and aminocandin. Isavuconazole and ravuconazole are extremely similar, with a broad spectrum of activity, a very long half-life and large volume of distribution and good in vivo data supporting their efficacy in invasive aspergillosis and candidosis. Both compounds are in early Phase 3 development. Albaconazole has also shown very potent activity against species of Candida, Cryptococcus and Aspergillus. It was well tolerated and effective in women with vaginal candidosis. Aminocandin is an intravenous-only echinocandin with in vivo activity against Candida spp. and Aspergillus spp. Its extended half-life probably permits dosing less frequently than once a day. Overall these new antifungal agents in development offer extended half-lives, possibly reduced drug interaction profiles and good tolerance. Their antifungal spectrum is narrower than posaconazole and probably similar to voriconazole (isavuconazole and ravuconazole) and caspofungin (aminocandin). Licensure and determination of their place in clinical practice requires randomized clinical studies, which are or will be underway.",

The efficacy of these drugs depends on motivation: Pearl indexes vary from 1.17-3.72 for norethisterone, .9-4.4 for d-norgestrel, and .8- 2.2 for lynestrenol. Some physiologic effects of minipills possibly related to their mode of action are impermeable cervical mucus and low levels of progesterone, pregnanediol, estrogen, and LH. The side effects influencing dropout most are spotting (40-55% in the first cycle), polymenorrhea (about 10%), and amenorrhea (about 5-10%). Some transient estrogenic side effects such as nausea, headaches, and breast pain may be due to estrogenic metabolites from lynestrenol and norethisterone. None of the severe estrogenic side effects, such as thrombophlebitis and impaired glucose tolerance and liver function, are characteristic of progestogen pills.",

It is used off-label in pediatric patients due to its efficacy and lack of adverse respiratory effects. Dexmedetomidine may cause severe circulatory complications in adults. Despite its popularity, the safety of dexmedetomidine in the pediatric population has not been extensively studied.Areas covered in this review: This article reviews the current literature (up to 2010) focusing on applications and safety of dexmedetomidine administered to pediatric patients.What the reader will gain: Dexmedetomidine is a useful sedative and anxiolytic drug in the pediatric intensive care unit as well as during diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Deleterious effects of dexmedetomidine include hypotension and bradycardia. Additionally, hypertension may occur during the \"loading dose\" or with high infusion rates. Few studies have been performed to evaluate the safety of dexmedetomidine in pediatrics. The development of tolerance and withdrawal has not been studied in children.Take home message: Despite its favorable respiratory profile, dexmedetomidine may cause deleterious cardiovascular effects. Close monitoring of circulatory dynamics and judicious titration is recommended. Further studies are needed to better define adverse effects following long-term infusions as well as in special populations such as pre-term infants.",

Firstly, the effects of the drug on psychological functioning is discussed. Next, the controversy regarding benzodiazepinea and aggression is examined. Oxazepam appears exceptional here in that it is not associated with paradoxical release of aggression in patients. Finally, the ethical implications of the widespread use of these drugs is commented on, and the problem of dependence, physical and psychological, discussed.

The incidence of duodenal ulcer was found to be no greater than that encountered in the normal population. Thorn tests were done in a large group to determine possible depression of the adrenal gland. Remission or improvement can sometimes be obtained with prednisone in patients whose treatment with cortisone or hydrocortisone has been unsatisfactory because of undesirable effects or diminution in effect.",

In acute overdosage, the main clinical problem is central nervous system (CNS) depression. In Australia, tablets containing scopolamine hydrobromide 0.3 mg are available over the counter in packs of ten. The recommended dose for adults is one to two tablets as a single dose, repeated four to six hours later, if required. The maximum dose stated on the pack is four tablets over a 24-hour period with a caution regarding drowsiness and blurred vision. We describe a patient who presented with symptoms of anticholinergic syndrome secondary to an unintentional overdose of scopolamine. Whilst at work, the patient noticed that he had forgotten his prescribed medication, domperidone, at home; a friend gave him some travel sickness medication which contained scopolamine for relief of nausea. On a previous occasion, he had experienced a similar, less severe reaction with another anticholinergic agent, loperamide. This report highlights the need to consider nonprescription products, ie, over the counter medications, herbal/nutritional supplements as causes of anticholinergic syndrome when a patient presents with symptoms suggestive of this diagnosis.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, adverse effects, and drug interactions of nefazodone, as well as to determine its place among currently available antidepressants. DATA SOURCES: A search of European and American literature using EMBASE and MEDLINE was completed. Nefazodone was the search term. DATA SYNTHESIS: Nefazodone is an antidepressant that blocks serotonin type 2 (5-HT 2 ) receptors in addition to inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, nefazodone demonstrates antidepressant activity at dosages ranging from 400 to 600 mg/d. Sedation, dry mouth, nausea, and dizziness are the more common adverse effects of nefazodone. Nefazodone, an analog of trazodone, has not been associated with priapism at this time, and may have fewer sexual adverse effects than other antidepressants. More studies are needed to determine the potential role of nefazodone in treating anxiety, pain, and premenstrual syndrome. STUDY SELECTION: Only double-blind, placebo-controlled studies designed to establish the efficacy of nefazodone as an antidepressant were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Based on placebo-controlled, double-blind, comparative trials, nefazodone demonstrates greater efficacy than placebo, and equivalent efficacy to imipramine. Somnolence, dry mouth, nausea, dizziness, and constipation are the most common adverse effects. Nefazodone appears to have a milder adverse effect profile than the tricyclic antidepressants, causes fewer sexual dysfunctions than the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors, and may cause less dizziness than trazodone. Nefazodone at dosages of at least 300 mg/d provides another option for the treatment of depression.",

Cadiotoxicity and neurotoxicity following ingestion of venlafaxine is known, however post-mortem studies are very few in literature. This case highlights the toxicity of venlafaxine and escitalopram with its histopathological findings of tissue and various drug interactions.",

      "abstract": "Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) in children is characterized by frequent hospitalizations, multiple comorbidities, and poor quality of life. In the absence of robust data, the treatment of CVS remains largely empiric starting with the 2008 NASPGHAN Consensus Statement recommendations of cyproheptadine for children < 5 years of age and amitriptyline for those ≥ 5 years with propranolol serving as the second-line agent. Comprehensive management begins with lifestyle alterations, and extends to medications, supplements, and stress reduction therapies. Standard drug therapy is organized by the four phases of the illness: (1) interictal (preventative medications and mitochondrial supplements), (2) prodromal (abortive agents), (3) vomiting (fluids/energy substrates, antiemetics, analgesics, and sedatives) and (4) recovery (supportive care and nutrition). Because the response to treatment is heterogeneous, clinicians often trial several different preventative strategies including NK1 antagonists, cautious titration of amitriptyline to higher doses, anticonvulsants, Ca2+-channel blockers, and other TCA antidepressants. When the child remains refractory to treatment, reconsideration of possible missed diagnoses and further mono- or combination therapy and psychotherapy can be guided by accompanying comorbidities (especially anxiety), specific subphenotype, and when available, genotype. For hospital intervention, IV fluids with 10% dextrose, antiemetics, and analgesics can lessen symptoms while effective sedation in some instances can truncate severe episodes. Conclusion: Although management of CVS remains challenging to the clinician, approaches based upon recent literature and accumulated experience with subgroups of patients has led to improved treatment of the refractory and hospitalized patient.",

      "abstract": "Background: Using a clinical case example, we describe and discuss the use of oral naltrexone as a novel treatment strategy for nitrous oxide use. Nitrous oxide is an inhalant drug that is readily available and legally obtained. Though frequency of reported cases of substance use disorder for nitrous oxide is low, previous case reports have described severe neurological and psychiatric harms associated with chronic use. Despite this, evidence for pharmacotherapy is currently lacking. Clinical studies have shown variable efficacy for naltrexone across a number of substances including alcohol, nicotine, and stimulants. Case: We present here a case of a 41-year-old man with a substance use disorder for nitrous oxide who was reportedly using of up to four hundred 8 g canisters of nitrous oxide per day. Oral naltrexone was initiated at 50 mg daily in an attempt to decrease cravings. The dose was subsequently titrated to 100 mg daily, resulting in a decrease in nitrous oxide use to less than sixty 8 g canisters per week over a 1-month timeframe. Discussion: Previous literature surrounding naltrexone provides both a plausible mechanism of action for craving reduction as well as a precedent for its use across a number of substances. To our knowledge, use of naltrexone for nitrous oxide use has not been previously described. While clinical studies are currently lacking, this case highlights naltrexone as a possible treatment strategy for nitrous oxide use, with potential to reduce significant harms associated with chronic use.",

      "abstract": "The use of fixed-combination products in acne is commonplace. Clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide are often used in combination, but benzoyl peroxide can cause irritation and dryness, sometimes limiting use. The true bothersome nature of this concentration-dependent tolerability has only recently been elucidated and is significant. An optimized formulation of clindamycin-benzoyl peroxide containing 2.5% benzoyl peroxide has been shown to be highly effective and well-tolerated when used to treat moderate-to-severe acne. A meta-analysis has shown clindamycin phosphate 1.2%-benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel to be as effective as combinations containing 5% benzoyl peroxide, with possibly greater efficacy in treating noninflammatory lesions. Efficacy in moderate-to-severe and adolescent subpopulations has also been highlighted. Clinical objective assessments, such as lesion counts and physician grading classifications, alone do not adequately capture the impact of acne severity from a patient's perspective. Clindamycin phosphate 1.2%-benzoyl peroxide 2.5% has shown a high level of patient satisfaction and significant improvement in all four acne quality of life domains. This review brings together some of the most recent work on clindamycin phosphate 1.2%-benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel from one of the most extensive clinical programs ever in moderate-to-severe acne.",

      "abstract": "The drug therapeutic indices could be maximized while indices of adverse reactions or side effects could be minimized by regulating the drug release in body in a well-defined controlled manner. Domperidone maleate (Antidopamine) and Cinnarizine (Antihistamine) contribute to the overall efficacy of an agent as an antiemetic. Both drugs have solubility in acidic environment. Half lifes of Domperidone maleate and Cinnarizine are 4-7 hrs and 3-6 hrs respectively. Hence to improve patient compliance and to minimize the frequency of dosage administration, the controlled release floating tablet of drug combination was formulated. This system is also known as hydro dynamically balanced system (HBS/FDDS). Here the density lower than gastric fluid, i.e. their density is less than 1gm/cm 3 and thus the FDDS remains buoyant in the stomach without affecting the gastric emptying rate for a prolonged period of time. Here a formulation of a drug (CIN + DOM) and gel forming hydrocolloids (Hydroxy Propyl Methyl Cellulose and Sodium alginate) meant to remain buoyant on stomach contents. This not only prolongs GI residence time but also maximize the area at which the drug reaching its absorption site in solution and hence ready for absorption while the system is floating on the gastric contents. In the present study Methocel polymers of different viscosity (Methocel K4M, Methocel K15M) were selected as polymer because of their independence from pH or ionic content of the dissolution medium. The tablets were prepared containing various concentrations (20% - 50%) of Methocel polymers. The floating behavior and drug release study was done in 900 ml of dissolution medium (0.1N HCl) at 37±0.5°C at a rotation speed of 50 rpm which conferred the formulation D3 as suitable for dissolution studies as it offered a proper lag time of 10-15 sec and floating time of 12 hours. Sodium bicarbonate (15 mg) and sodium alginate (18 mg) as gas generating agents were essential to achieve in vitro buoyancy of 12 hours so that the formulation is on the gastric surface by 10-15 sec after administration.",

      "title": "[Commentary] BREAKING AWAY FROM A NARROW PRESCRIBING PROTOCOL FOR MEDICINAL NICOTINE",
      "abstract": "Since nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was introduced 30 years ago its full potential has remained underdeveloped and under-researched. A new drug, Varenicline, acting on the same nicotinic receptors, appears to give better efficacy [1]. For those wishing to stop smoking, the NRT marketing licence still indicates a restricted regimen that is the same for those self-treating by buying over the counter and those in the care of specialist clinicians: (i) start using NRT on the day that smoking stops; (ii) use a limited dosage while not smoking; (iii) stop using NRT if smoking resumes; and (iv) use only for 10–16 weeks, regardless of progress. There is no evidence that this protocol is optimally effective at a population level, and it is unlikely to be flexible enough to meet the differing needs of individual smokers. The only options involve a choice of route by which nicotine is absorbed (skin, nose, throat or mouth), and whether nicotine is taken passively/chronically (skin patch) or actively/acutely (gum, lozenge/sublingual tablet, inhalator, nasal spray). Regardless of product or route, nicotine is absorbed far more slowly than when inhaled via cigarettes and in practice nicotine levels from this NRT protocol are, at most, about half those from smoking [2]. Paradoxically, for those who do not wish to stop smoking in the near future, the NRT licence allows long-term use while still smoking as a means of potentially reducing cigarette consumption [3]. The indications for those trying to stop and those not trying to stop, although apparently very different, are both highly conservative in some respects. Neither allows much freedom with dosage nor long-term use after smoking has ceased. Ironically, because there can be no effective control over the dose and duration of NRT use when it is purchased over the counter, smokers have real freedom with medicinal nicotine only when they are not in the care of clinicians. The reason manufacturers and clinicians have tolerated such restrictions, and not explored the potential for improved efficacy through more liberal regimens, probably lies with the influence of some regulators and tobacco control advocates. These, in the past, have viewed smoking as a habit maintained by the force of the tobacco industry, rather than as an addiction to inhaled nicotine, that for many requires clinical intervention on a par with that for other addictive substances. The manufacturers themselves can also be criticized for their timidity in not pressing the regulators to broaden the clinical indications of existing products, and for not developing improved products. In this issue, Shiffman & Ferguson (p. 557) conduct a meta-analysis of four studies where smokers were treated with the nicotine patch prior to their quit attempt, and provide good evidence to support this more flexible use of NRT [4]. The level of ‘dependence’ on smoking is measured most commonly by scores on inventories such as the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence and the Heaviness of Smoking Index [5]. Such measures are weighted towards daily cigarette consumption and early morning smoking, both underpinned by the degree of reinforcement from inhaled nicotine. In numerous cessation studies higher scores on these measures have been associated with failure to quit. Indeed, ‘dependence’ appears to be the most consistent of a relatively small set of antecedent characteristics that predict whether a smoker is likely to succeed or fail in a quit attempt. Others include gender, age, social grade, motivation to stop, partner smoking and self-efficacy. As motivation is usually high prior to a quit attempt, ‘dependence’ may be the easiest predictor to modify ahead of a quit attempt, in the hope of improving the chance of subsequent success. Essentially, this means reducing smoking behaviour and consumption. The practice of encouraging a reduction in consumption before a quit attempt appears to have been discounted prior to the introduction of NRT. This may have been because when smokers try to cut down they tend to smoke the remaining cigarettes more intensively to maintain adequate nicotine intake, and so each cigarette may take on a proportionately higher value and be more reinforcing. Hence, when smokers have to make an unaided effort to cut down there is no effective reduction in ‘dependence’. The alternative is to provide a means by which little or no effort is required to reduce both the habitual behaviour and the reinforcing value of inhaled nicotine without experiencing aversive withdrawal symptoms. As early as 1942 Johnston observed that, by taking nicotine through means other than smoking, both the desire to smoke and tobacco consumption are reduced [6]. Notably, in the three studies under review where cigarette consumption was recorded there was a significant reduction during the period of patch pretreatment. Unfortunately, the potentially more revealing change in nicotine intake from smoking during the pretreatment phase was not reviewed. Notwithstanding the absence of evidence for the mechanism, the effect due to nicotine pretreatment found across the four studies was a twofold improvement in cessation—an effect similar to that for 12 weeks of patch treatment starting on quit day [7]. However, unlike most treatment reviews that demonstrate efficacy, this one does not provide sufficiently homogeneous data to formulate a simple new treatment protocol for clinicians and smokers. The four studies differed with respect to dosage, length of pretreatment period and post-quit treatment, follow-up duration, use of placebo and, most importantly, the inclusion of concomitant treatments (mecamylamine and low-yield cigarettes), both in the pretreatment phase and beyond. Only Schuurmans et al.'s study provides evidence for the efficacy of pretreatment patch use free of the presence of other concomitant interventions [8]. Therefore, we have some way to go before guidance can be given to clinicians as to the optimal NRT pretreatment protocol. Another trial, similar in design to that of Schuurmans et al., would help in this respect. In the meantime, there is no reason why smokers should not be prescribed NRT before they make a quit attempt, just as they can be when trying to cut down.",

It is likely that some of the pathological changes observed are induced by the immune response to the infection. Eosinophilia is present in many cases of infection. Moreover M. perstans filariasis is difficult to be treated. Effective treatment is lacking and there is no consensus on optimal therapeutic approach. The most commonly used drug is diethylcarbamazine (DEC) that is however often ineffective. Although other drugs have been tried (e.g. praziquantel, ivermectin), none has proven to be reliably and rapidly effective.

      "abstract": "<i>Background:</i> 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy), a compound chemically related to stimulant and hallucinogenic drugs, has been found to induce a state of euphoria and increased self-awareness. MDMA has been increasingly used for recreational purposes, especially among college students and other young adults, and has been associated with multiple toxic effects. <i>Methods:</i> Using MEDLINE, the medical literature was searched from 1986 using the key words \"ecstasy,\" \"MDMA,\" and \"designer drugs.\" Articles dating before 1986 were accessed from cross-reference of the more recent articles. A case report is described. <i>Results:</i> MDMA was developed in 1912 as an appetite suppressant but never became commercially successful. It resurfaced in the 1950s as a psychotherapeutic agent. In 1985 MDMA was classified as a schedule 1 drug by the Food and Drug Administration after reports of neurotoxicity in laboratory animals. It again resurfaced in the mid 1980s as a recreational drug used primarily among college students and other young adults. There are a number of case reports describing toxic effects from MDMA, including hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, coagulopathy, and acute renal failure. Little information is available regarding acute management or treatment of toxic ingestions. <i>Conclusions:</i> MDMA ingestion has been associated with severe toxic effects. Although the literature describes numerous cases of toxic ingestion, there are no published recommendations or suggestions to guide physicians in the evaluation and treatment of such cases. By reviewing the history, neurochemistry, and toxicology of MDMA, as well as providing some guidance regarding management of toxic ingestion, we can arm the provider with valuable information for use in the acute setting. In addition, this information will assist providers in counseling young adults regarding the possible consequences of using this substance.",

Therefore, there is a need for alternative safe and effective treatment options for NDO. Intravesical oxybutynin has been successfully used for several years as a prescription drug in adults and children with spinal cord injury and spina bifida. In 2019, VESOXX® (FARCO-PHARMA, Cologne, Germany) became the first registered intravesical oxybutynin product in Germany, which is indicated for the suppression of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in children from 6 years of age and adults, who are managing bladder emptying by clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC), if they cannot be adequately managed by oral anticholinergic treatment due to lack of efficacy and/or intolerable side effects. Overall, there are limited data regarding therapy with intravesical oxybutynin, with the majority of publications being retrospective case series. To date, there are limited data on the efficacy and safety of the newly approved intravesical oxybutynin therapy (VESOXX®) in NDO patients. This noninterventional case series from daily routine treatment which evaluated the physician reports of 38 patients suggests that intravesical oxybutynin effectively improves maximum detrusor pressure (Pdet max) by decreasing it by 59% from 51.94 cm H",

A survey conducted by the National Narcotics Agency and the University of Indonesia in 15 provinces in Indonesia in 2010 found that dextromethorphan abuse was found among adolescents in high schools and even elementary schools. Dectromethorphan contained in komix when used in excessive doses has an effect similar to the use of ketamine. The resulting effects are confusion, dream-like conditions, a sense of loss of personal identity, speech and movement disorders, disorientation, drowsiness. Ketamine is a type of anesthetic drug, which is generally used in the general anesthesia process to reduce the patient's level of consciousness before or during a medical procedure. The Komix type cough medicine is usually used as a cough reliever but among teenagers, the Komix type cough medicine is being abused. The use of Komix cough medicine media is used as a tool to get a hangover effect. Referring to the description and analysis above, what factors can be classified that cause the abuse of komix drugs and torpedo drinks among youth in Simpang Rimba village? Factors The cause of the abuse of drugs and torpedo drinks in the Simpang Rimba village community is due to low education, lack of concern for parents and families for their children, and unhealthy environmental factors.

      "abstract": "In the past three decades, several new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have been marketed across the world, although with a surprisingly modest improvement in overall seizure control. During the same period, the use of AEDs as mood stabilizing or impulse control agents has been trending upwards, due to a notable increase in comorbid mood and behavior disorders in children, and a desire to address these pharmacologically. AEDs have been frequently associated with adverse mood and behavior changes, along with neuropsychiatric effects on attention, memory, and cognition. In this review, we discuss the use and adverse effects of the first- (e.g., barbiturates, carbamazepine, ethosuximide, phenytoin, valproate), second- (e.g., clobazam, felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, pregabalin, tiagabine, topiramate, stiripentol, vigabatrin, zonisamide), and third- (e.g., brivaracetam, eslicarbazepine acetate, lacosamide, perampanel, retigabine, rufinamide) generation AEDs in pediatric mood and behavior disorders. We also address what is currently known about the potential long-term neuropsychiatric consequences of AEDs. The distinction between the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs versus off-label use of these drugs in the pediatric population is also examined.",

      "abstract": "Background: Antibiotics Resistance can be the main problem faced by the specialists in the medical fields. The main reason of such resistance is the improper prescribing of antibiotics. In dentistry this problem must be in concern for 2 reasons, first, limited and outdated knowledge of many dentist in Iraq with recent modalities in the field of therapeutics, so they keep prescribing penicillins, for every odontogenic infection (rationale prescribing), second, the patient who keeps prescribing the same drug for himself every time (i.e. dealing with antibiotic as over-the-counter drug). Aim of the study: This review will clarifies the use of amoxicillin (most prescribed drug in Iraqi dental clinics) vs the use of third generation quinolones (levofloxacin) in an important field of dental practice which is periodontology, with focusing on levofloxacin as it took a privileged position in medical researches. Conclusion: levofloxacin was superior to amoxicillin since it is applied once daily, few nonhazardous side effects, nearly 100 % bioavailability in spite of different rout of administration, and can be applied topically as gels and intra- pocket films. Perhaps this can change a lot among practitioners’ and non- practitioners’ prescribing (habits).",

      "abstract": "Medical management of alcohol use disorders. Psychosocial support remains the key element of treatment of patients with an alcohol use disorder in order to either decrease or cease their alcohol consumption. However two drugs can now be used to reduce alcohol consumption: nalmefene and baclofen. Currently available studies have shown weak to moderate effect sizes in this indication. Four molecules are available to help patients maintain abstinence: acamprosate, naltrexone, disulfiram and baclofen (off-label use). Effect sizes calculated by various metaanalyses are also low to moderate. Disulfiram appears to be more effective when the patient has understood its mechanism of action and when it is used under supervision. However, the use of disulfiram is limited by the risk of rare, but potentially serious adverse effects. Identification of patient subgroups obtaining better responses to certain drugs constitutes a major research challenge, but only a few criteria have been defined to date. However, regardless of the drug considered, heavy drinking and difficulty to maintain abstinence significantly improve the efficacy of the drugs. After an initially promising period, identification of genetic markers has not yet resulted in any clinical applications. Promising molecules currently under evaluation include sodium oxybate and topiramate.Prise en charge médicamenteuse des troubles de l’usage de l’alcool. L’accompagnement psychosocial reste l’élément clé du traitement des patients ayant un trouble de l’usage de l’alcool, qu’il s’agisse de réduire leur consommation ou de l’arrêter. Des médicaments peuvent cependant augmenter son efficacité. Actuellement, deux médicaments peuvent être prescrits pour réduire la consommation d’alcool : le nalméfène et le baclofène ; les études disponibles à ce jour montrent des tailles d’effet faibles à modérées dans cette indication. Par ailleurs, quatre molécules sont disponibles pour aider les patients à maintenir une abstinence : l’acamprosate, la naltrexone, le disulfirame et le baclofène (hors AMM). Les tailles d’effet calculées par les méta-analyses sont également faibles à modérées. L’efficacité du disulfirame paraît intéressante lorsque le patient a compris son mécanisme d’action et qu’il est utilisé avec une supervision. Son utilisation est cependant limitée par un risque d’effets indésirables rares mais potentiellement graves. La caractérisation de sous-groupes de patients répondant mieux à certains médicaments est un enjeu important de la recherche. À ce jour, peu de critères peuvent être retenus. Soulignons cependant que, quel que soit le médicament considéré, une consommation d’alcool élevée et une difficulté à maintenir l’abstinence améliorent de façon significative l’efficacité des médicaments. La recherche de marqueurs génétiques n’a pas pour l’instant débouché sur des applications cliniques pratiques. Des molécules prometteuses sont actuellement en cours d’évaluation, notamment l’oxybate de sodium et le topiramate.",

      "abstract": "Increasing use of oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray devices (i.e., pepper spray, pepper mace, OC, capsaicin) by law enforcement agencies as a means of sublethal force to control suspects has brought into question whether exposure to this noxious irritant (capsaicin) can cause or contribute to unexpected in-custody deaths. Capsaicin stimulates nociceptors in exposed mucous membranes to produce intense pain, particularly involving the conjunctiva, and generates systemic physiologic and behavioral responses consonant with such extreme discomfort. We describe two cases of in-custody death, both associated temporally with the use of pepper spray, to illustrate salient investigative considerations. As with any other in-custody death, a thorough autopsy and toxicologic analysis, coupled with evaluation of the premortem chain of events, postexposure symptomatology, and the extent of natural disease processes, will help to reveal the role of oleoresin capsicum spray as unrelated, contributory, or causative.",

      "title": "Pilocarpine 1.25% for the treatment of presbyopia",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Vuity (pilocarpine hydrochloride 1.25%, Allergan, AbbVie Company, Dublin, Ireland) is a re-engineered formulation of pilocarpine in a proprietary vehicle, which was granted FDA approval in 2021 for the treatment of presbyopia, after phase 3 GEMINI 1 study.[1] Continuous and regular use of pilocarpine 1.25% for the treatment of presbyopia needs to address some of the questions on the adverse effects, which may not become evident at the 30- day endpoint.[1] Pilocarpine-induced miosis begins 15 to 30 min after instillation and lasts for 4–8 h. Hence once a daily dose in the morning will not be sufficient to have its effect on near vision in the evening.[1] Patients with lenticular opacities will have decreased vision in dim illumination and should be warned about the dangers of night driving if they use the eye drop in the evening. There can be changes in distance vision due to fluctuating myopic shifts in refraction and hence one needs to see whether an improvement in near vision is at the cost of compromised distance vision. The direct-acting cholinergic drug can alter lens permeability, leading to a shift in lens cations and water accumulation, causing changes in the intraocular metabolism and its use may accelerate lens opacities formation.[2] Hence, the long-term adverse effect of the drug should be kept in mind. Pilocarpine binds to melanin in the iris and ciliary body and hence, iris color may influence its desired response.[3] Patients with darkly pigmented irides may require a higher concentration of pilocarpine for its maximum effect. The effect of \"Vuity\" on Asian Indian eyes and whether the 1.25% concentration suffices the desired effect on near vision, needs to be studied. Careful examination of the peripheral retina is mandatory before prescribing pilocarpine. This increases the responsibility of the ophthalmologist to perform a thorough examination of the retinal periphery, before prescribing the drug. Increased permeability of the blood–aqueous barrier is another side effect of the drug, which should be kept in mind. Long-term use will cause permanent miosis from the loss of tone in the iris radial muscles and fibrosis of the pupillary sphincter and may result in posterior synechiae, causing difficulty in dilatation for examination of retinal periphery and adequate dilatation for cataract surgery, if the patient requires it in future. Pilocarpine can also precipitate an acute angle closure attack as it causes anterior chamber depth to decrease by 12%, which is of concern in patients with narrow angles.[4] It has been suggested that prolonged therapy with pilocarpine also causes permanent ultrastructural changes in the ciliary muscle and trabecular meshwork.[5] Hence, gonioscopy should also be performed before commencing the treatment and periodically during the follow-up, which is an additional responsibility of the treating ophthalmologist. The aforementioned adverse effects can be disabling, especially in the patients who may instill pilocarpine frequently, to have the desired effect on near work in the evening and hence, should be cautioned and monitored regularly. Future studies may address the adverse effects of long-term use of 1.25% pilocarpine, which may not become evident at the 30-day endpoint. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

Children are at greater risk for systemic side effects because ocular dosing is not weight-adjusted, and infants are especially vulnerable as a consequence of the inability to efficiently metabolize the drug, and/or an immature blood-brain barrier. Four pediatric patients are reported in whom treatment with topical brimonidine, a selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, indicated for the treatment of glaucoma, produced somnolence. Anti-glaucoma eyedrops that are not approved for use in children are still used frequently in pediatrics. Therefore, physicians should be aware of possible systemic side effects of ophthalmic drops.",

      "abstract": "Bisphosphonates are the major treatment of choice for osteoporosis, given that they are attached preferentially by bone and significantly reduce the risk of fractures. Oral bisphosphonates are poorly absorbed (usually less than 1% for nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates) and when taken with food or beverages create complexes that cannot be absorbed. For this reason, they must be taken on an empty stomach, and a period of up to 2 hours must elapse before the consumption of any food or drink other than plain water. This routine is not only inconvenient but can lead to discontinuation of treatment, and when mistakenly taken with food, may result in misdiagnosis of resistance to or failure of treatment. The development of an enteric-coated delayed-release formulation of risedronate with the addition of the calcium chelator, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a widely used food stabilizer, eliminates the need for fasting without affecting the bioavailability of risedronate or its efficacy.",

When preoperative sedation is required, selection of the appropriate drug is imperative to provide adequate anxiolysis whilst minimising unwanted side effects. We review the literature regarding the merits and limitations of the commonly used agents and suggest evidence based practical guidance. For the anxious but cooperative child, oral midazolam is often adequate; however with more anxious younger and uncooperative children, combined oral midazolam and ketamine is more effective. Other oral benzodiazepines and oral clonidine all have their role when used in the appropriate circumstances. Intranasal clonidine is useful in the child refusing oral medication. Intramuscular ketamine should be reserved for extreme circumstances, administered only by anaesthetists experienced in its use, with full monitoring and resuscitative equipment immediately available.",

Part 4 is dedicated to fecal incontinence and chronic constipation. The diagnostic categories are divided according to severity and dysfuntion of bowel and pelvic floor, sphincter and neural control. Therapy is also outlined. Importance is given to patient history, in particular the use and abuse of drugs that stimulate peristalsis and promote constipation. Therapy in the elderly is guided by the maxim: use the most conservative therapy possible, where stool training has considerable importance. Drug therapy based on symptoms can only be recommended when non-drug measures continue to fail. In patients with fecal incontinence: 1) opiates (which reduce colonic motility), 2) loperamide (which has the capacity to dilate the rectum) and 3) anion exchangers which have the capacity to prevent cholonic diarrhea. In patients with chronic obstipation: 1) trial: stool-forming laxatives (ensure intake of sufficient amount of fluids) 2) trial: laxatives with an osmotic effect and 3) trial: stimulating laxatives (beware abuse, do not use in cases of acute abdomen).",

There are also no reports on whether newer generation of anti-psychotic agents contribute to ocular toxicity. We describe a case of ocular toxicity related to anti-psychotic agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of anterior segment pigmentary deposits associated with olanzapine use, 2 years after the cessation of chlorpromazine. We report a case of ocular toxicity in a patient with history of chlorpromazine usage of 100 mg per day for 13 years and subsequently switched to olanzapine 5 mg for 2 years. There were no signs of ocular toxicity while the patient was on chlorpromazine. However, when the patient switched to olanzapine, she developed the ocular side effect as described for chlorpromazine-induced ocular toxicity, with pigmentary depositions on both corneas and the anterior lens surface and decrease in vision. Olanzapine, a newer anti-psychotic agent, may play a role in the ocular pigmentary deposition, either directly causing pigmentary deposition itself or accentuating the effect of chlorpromazine as the 2 drugs act on the same receptors, although further studies are required to support this hypothesis. As patients with psychiatric conditions may not voluntarily complain of visual symptoms, ocular screening could be considered in these patients receiving chronic anti-psychotic treatment, so that any ocular toxicity could be diagnosed in a timely manner.",

      "title": "Strategies in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Over recent years I have been studying whether dopamine agonist treatment alone, or in early combination with levodopa, might institute a better long-term treatment in Parkinson's disease than levodopa alone. Indeed, early combination of levodopa with bromocriptine, pergolide or lisuride has indicated that this kind of treatment results in better management of Parkinson's disease with fewer fluctuations in disability, especially end-of-dose disturbances and dyskinesias, than treatment with levodopa alone. Furthermore, similar results were obtained by using lisuride in combination with selegiline and levodopa. Thus, it appears advisable to initiate the dopaminergic treatment in early Parkinson's disease by using a combination of selegiline, levodopa and a dopamine agonist. There are many ways of building up this kind of treatment. Instead of levodopa, it is possible to use initially a dopamine agonist and to add selegiline and levodopa when the therapeutic response becomes insufficient. Another alternative would be to start with selegiline alone, then to add a dopamine agonist and, finally, levodopa when clinically indicated.",

Although closely related to nalidixic acid, cinoxacin possesses some distinct characteristics: rapid attainment of therapeutic urinary concentrations and greater activity against strains of Enterobacteriaceae that cause urinary tract infections. Biopharmaceutical properties include serum protein binding of approximately 70%, 50–60% excretion of intact drug in the urine of patients with normal renal function, and an elimination half-life of approximately one hour. The elimination half-life is increased in patients with decreased renal function and when probenecid is coadministered. Adverse events occur infrequently and consist of nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and hypersensitivity reactions. The drug compares favorably with standard therapies for the treatment of bacterial cystitis and recurrent urinary tract infections. Initial studies demonstrate that cinoxacin has substantial efficacy as a prophylactic agent for those women who experience recurrent, symptomatic urinary tract infections.",

Toxic manifestations may preclude the use of this life‐saving drug in some patients and discontinuation of penicillamine therapy usually leads to death. We report our experience with Trientine in seven patients, aged 13 to 33 years, with Wilson's disease who developed toxic manifestations with penicillamine that required discontinuation of therapy. These include two with nephrosis, one with neutropenia, two with thrombocytopenia, and one each with a SLE‐like and a Henoch‐Schonlein‐like syndrome. The patients were treated for periods from 6 weeks to 16 years with a dose of 0.5 to 2 g/day. Trientine proved to be an effective alternative copper chelating agent in the treatment of Wilson's disease in patients with penicillamine‐induced neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, SLE, and nephrosis. No serious untoward side effects were noted.",

      "abstract": "Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) were frequently used as polytherapy until evidence from a series of studies in the late 1970s and early 1980s suggested that patients derive as much benefit from monotherapy as polytherapy.1–3 AED polytherapy is increasingly becoming popular again and as much as 30–40% of prescriptions to children are polytherapy.4 ,5 The availability of new-generation AEDs in the last two decades has encouraged polytherapy. AEDs such as lamotrigine, topiramate, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine and zonisamide have been approved for paediatric use and are recommended mostly as adjuncts or as second-line agents.6 Despite the availability of more AEDs, the prevalence of poorly controlled epilepsies still remains the same. About 30% of epilepsies are resistant to treatment.7 Drug-resistant epilepsies almost always require polytherapy, but the question of the best treatment approach when an initial monotherapy fails is still debatable.\n\nRational polytherapy has been suggested for the treatment of epilepsies. It refers to the use of two or more drug combinations with different mechanisms of action. The goal is to achieve synergistic or supra-additive efficacy. A combination regimen is supra-additive when it produces a total effect that is higher than the effects of the sum of individual drugs. Rational polytherapy sometimes aims to attain infra-additive toxicity such that the component drugs in the polytherapy regimen produce a total toxicity less than the sum of the individual toxicities.8\n\nClinical evidence in support of rational polytherapy for epilepsy is sparse. A 1997 multicentre European study, involving 347 adults, reported synergism between sodium valproate and lamotrigine.9 Patients given sodium valproate with lamotrigine add-on had better response rate than those given carbamazepine or phenobarbital with add-on lamotrigine. Another multicentre cohort study in Spain showed that lacosamide, a sodium channel blocker, was more effective (with a higher seizure freedom rate and clinical …",

The aim of this trial was to determine analgesic efficacy of Imigran (sumatriptan) and Famalgin in the treatment of acute attacks of migraine headache. Trial results revealed significant analgesic efficacy of both preparations without significant differences in analgesic effect, with significantly better tolerability of Famalgin.

Naltrexone can be administered on a daily, twice a week or three times a week regimen, based on the clinical needs of the patient, and the therapeutic goals of the patient and therapist. Because naltrexone is unscheduled under the Controlled Substances Act, any licensed physician can prescribe this drug. This decentralized therapeutic approach for the highly motivated patient permits a ready separation between the patient's drug using friends and his or her current activities. The patients most likely to benefit from naltrexone therapy are employed, married, stabilized on low-dose methadone prior to detoxification, or detoxified from their opioid dependency 7 or more days previously, and are highly motivated to be maintained on a nonopioid chemotherapeutic agent. Naltrexone does not cure dependency. It does assist clinicians in dealing with the medical, psychological and economic problems associated with primary opioid abuse. Naltrexone will work well only when it is part of a larger therapeutic regimen which is tailored to the individual needs of the patient.",

      "abstract": "EnglishDepressive disorders have become one of the major public health problems in recent years, not only because of their impact on quality of life, but also because of the partial response or lack of response to antidepressant treatment. Therefore, the rapid and potent antidepressant effect of (R,S)-ketamine (ketamine) is considered one of the most important psychiatric discoveries of the last decades. Although, intravenous administration of ketamine has prevailed in most clinical trials conducted so far, the intranasal route has been considered a useful and safe alternative. Thus, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and the EMA (European Medicines Agency) approved a esketamine nasal spray named Spravato for the use in treatment resistant depression, although clinical trials supporting its marketing are not long-term. In line with this, major long-term safety concerns, such as dependence and cognitive impairment, has not been assessed so far. Therefore, there is an urgent need to investigate the relevance ofrepeated administration protocols on the long-term antidepressant response and safety. In this regard, potential pharmacological interactions between ketamine and some antidepressant drugs and benzodiazepines may impact the antidepressant response. In fact, while in some clinical trials adjunctive antidepressant medication is allowed, in others it is specifically removed, and this pharmacological variability may alter the efficacy of the treatment. Consequently, it is undeniable that in addition to massive long-term clinical trials, post-marketing studies are necessary to ensure the safety and efficacy of long-term ketamine and esketamine use. euskaraNahasmendu depresiboak osasun publikoko arazo handienetako bat bilakatu dira azken urteotan, ez bakarrik bizi-kalitatean duten eraginagatik, baita tratamendu antidepresiboaren erantzun partzial edo erantzun ezagatik ere.

Orain arteko entseguetan ketaminaren zain barneko bidea gailendu den arren sudur bideko administrazioa aukera erabilgarri eta segurutzat jo da. Hori dela eta, FDAk (Food and Drug Administration) eta EMAk (European Medicines Agency) S-ketamina (esketamina) baimendu dute Spravato izen komertzialarekin merkaturatutako sudur-lainoztagailurako soluzio bezala, depresio erresistentea tratatzeko, farmako horren merkaturatze-baimena sostengatzen duten entsegu klinikoak epe luzekoak ez diren arren. Horregatik, epe luzeko segurtasun-profila ikertzea premiazkoa da, eta, testuinguru berean, baita administrazio-protokolo errepikatuen egokitasuna ere. Izan ere, ketaminak farmako antidepresibo batzuekin eta bentzodiazepinekin izan ditzakeen elkarrekintzak ebaluatzea gomendatzen da, tratamenduaren eragin antidepresiboa baldintza dezaketelako.

Another type of interaction of drugs with disposition and effectiveness of estrogens is impairment of their enterohepatic circulation. This may be due to absorption of biliary estrogen conjugates (e.g., by cholestyramine) or to insufficient cleavage of the conjugate by intestinal bacteria, the latter being observed after administration of antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin, neomycin).",

      "abstract": "Buspirone, an azospirone compound, is a nonsedative anxiolytic that has achieved wide usage since its introduction in 1987. Although relatively free of side-effects, there have been several instances of dyskinesia and dystonia associated with the use of buspirone. We report two patients with persistent movement disorders that developed after prolonged treatment with the drug. One patient developed a lasting problem of cervical-cranial dystonia and tremors after treatment with buspirone at a dosage of 40 mg/day for several weeks. Another, receiving 30 mg/day for 6 weeks, experienced an exacerbation of preexisting spasmodic torticollis and tardive dyskinesia as well as the onset of involuntary phonations. As shown by these and other examples, buspirone poses the risk for inducing or exacerbating several types of movement disorders.",

Six cases demonstrating meperidine-induced behavioral toxicity are reported. Toxicity was more likely when meperidine was combined with cimetidine or drugs having anticholinergic activity. Discontinuation of meperidine and substitution of morphine for analgesia were usually successful in treating the delirium. Physostigmine reversed the delirium in one patient. The authors suggest that the delirium results from the excessive anticholinergic activity of meperidine or its only active metabolite, normeperidine.",

When it is administered orally, the inhibitory effect of Darstine diminishes at a slower rate than is the case for methantheline. A lower oral dosage of Darstine than of methantheline is required to prolong significantly the stomach emptying time of a barium meal.\n\nThe inhibitory action of a minimally effective intravenous dose of Darstine or methantheline disappeared rapidly over a period of five to twenty minutes. Over this short period the inhibitory effect of a comparably active dose of atropine remained relatively constant. The corresponding piperidino tertiary amine of Darstine resembled atropine in this respect. Factors that could explain this difference between tertiary and quaternary compounds were discussed.\n\nDarstine and methantheline, when administered intravenously, are comparable in activity in antagonizing vagally stimulated gastric secretion in the acute total gastric pouch of the dog.\n\nGanglionic blocking effects at the superior cervical ganglion of the chloralose-anesthetized cat are comparable for these compounds.\n\nDarstine possesses only about one-fourth the potency of methantheline in antagonizing Mecholyl-stimulated parotid secretion in the dog.\n\nThe anticholinergic potency of Darstine on the cardiovascular system of the barbiturate-anesthetized dog is approximately one-half that of methantheline.\n\nAn intravenous dose of Darstine two to four times greater than that of methantheline is required to produce an equivalent inhibition of cholinergic stimulation of urinary bladder muscle tonus of the trained unanesthetized dog.",

The need for developing new drugs arises from the refractoriness of the negative symptoms, the 10-25% of the patients that are treatment-resistant and the problems of short-, and long-term extrapyramidal side-effects. Thus far, six drugs, differing from the classical antipsychotics, have been licensedfor use: olanzepine, risperidone and quetiapine; the longest registration exists for sulpiride and clozapine while the most recent one is for amisulpride. This review starts with a brief introduction to symptomatology, and takes differences with the classical drugs in pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical aspects and side-effects into consideration. Clozapine, risperidone and sulpiride may be considered for clinical use in refractory patients; these three, olanzapine and amisulpride when extrapyramidal side-effects cause a clinical problem. Amisulpride and sulpiride have a dual therapeutic acion: On negative symptoms at low dose, on positive symptomen at high doses.",

Therefore, extremely careful supportive care is necessary to administer this agent to patients. There are two ways to improve this agent. The first is to improve the activities of this agent, including widening the spectrum. The other is to reduce toxicity. By these two ways, the therapeutic window or efficacy of the agents will be increased. In these two factors in mind, 4 analogues, CBDCA, 254S, DWA 2114R and NK-121 are in clinical trials in Japan. These 4 agents are different from mother compound CDDP, that is the DLF is bone marrow depression with rather mild renal and upper GI toxicities with different degrees among analogues, compared with those of CDDP. Therefore, these 4 agents do not need hydration before and after the administration. The extensive studies of pharmacokinetics and dynamics are studied including plasma levels, protein bindings and urinary excretions. These above studies indicate some correlations in efficacy and toxicity, but not perfectly correlated. The experiences of the above 4 analogues are still too short to predict the possibility of neurotoxicity, however, it seems to be 4 analogues also neurotoxic. Above findings strongly suggests that the more clinical experiences are necessary to evaluate these analogues.",

      "abstract": "Metronidazole is a narrow spectrum antibiotic with undoubted efficacy against common anaerobic bacteria; resistance is unusual. Therapeutic concentrations of the drug are attained throughout most body compartments after either oral or intravenous administration. The limited side effects of metronidazole are generally tolerable, transient, or reversible. Clinically, metronidazole is as effective as clindamycin and probably chloramphenicol against anaerobes. It has a definite advantage over clindamycin in CNS infections since clindamycin does not penetrate the CSF well. Metronidazole has no irreversible hematologic toxicities, nor has pseudomembranous colitis been definitely attributed to intravenous use of the drug. Metronidazole may replace chloramphenicol for use in anaerobic infections since it lacks the predictable hematologic toxicity of the latter drug. It should also be useful in patients who fail to respond to clindamycin or who develop pseudomembranous colitis while receiving clindamycin. Problems with metronidazole include a complicated preparation procedure, and the high cost of the drug. The single major drawback to the use of metronidazole is uncertainty about its carcinogenic potential in humans. Metronidazole is carcinogenic in animals and mutagenic in vitro, but has not increased the incidence of cancer in humans followed for relatively short periods. Thus, the risk appears to be small. Still, the question will not be resolved for years because of the long latency periods involved in carcinogenesis. Until that time, metronidazole should be used conservatively.",

      "abstract": "The objective of the review is to evaluate the scientific evidence of the effectiveness and side effects related to fluoride supplements and to update the clinical recommendations on the prescription of fluoride supplements for caries prevention. The use of fluoride supplements for preventing dental caries first started in late 1940's and was intended as a substitute for fluoridated water for children in non- fluoridated areas. The fluoride supplements come in the form of tablets (chewable or non-chewable), drops and lozenges The effectiveness of fluoride supplements in reducing caries is stated by many studies in the past; although these were questioned by many authors. The evidence supports fluoride's systemic mechanism of caries prevention when it is incorporated into the tooth pre-eruptively. Also, ingested fluoride can exert a topical mechanism of action when it is redistributed to the oral environment by the means of saliva. The ingestion of fluoride by means of supplements may be associated with increased risk of developing enamel fluorosis. The increase in exposure of fluoride from other sources like ingestion of water, toothpastes, beverages, foods and professional dental products may also cause enamel fluorosis. It is concluded that fluoride supplements should be used as directed to maximize their caries-preventive benefit and should be prescribed only to children who are at high risk of developing caries and whose primary source of drinking water is deficient in fluoride. The recommendations when prescribing fluoride supplements emphasize the need for caries risk assessment and consideration of total fluoride intake.",

Spinal additivesSpinal adjuvant drugs have been used since the beginning of subarachnoid anaesthesia.Adrenaline, an alpha2 agonist, was the first drug used to enhance duration of spinal anaesthesia, and morphine was the first opioid injected with eucaine in the lumbar spinal space to relieve vertebral pain.[6] After the first article on spinal analgesia using opioids written by Yaksh and Rudy in 1976, [7] the neuroaxial route to inject opioids as adjuvants drugs grew logarithmically.Morphine, fentanyl, sufentanyl and many more agonist opioids have proven their safety and efficacy to decrease the dose of local anaesthetics, to facilitate a faster recovery, and effective postoperative analgesia.There are many receptors which modulates spinal pain response; however, there are only few FDA approved drugs to be used via subarachnoid as adjuvants or sole medications.Many drugs have being injected into the spinal or peridural space in order to provide analgesia and/or to enhance neuraxial anaesthesia.Nowadays, opioids are the more frequently used spinal additives, but their side effects may limit its use; pruritus, urinary retention and late respiratory depression.There are studies with intrathecal adjuvants that have not been approved to be used in spinal anaesthesia: midazolam, ketamine, neostigmine, magnesium sulphate, calcium channel blockers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, dexmedetomidine, tizanidine, etcetera. Alpha2 adrenergic agonist drugsAlpha2 agonist medications are used as adjuvants in anaesthesia and analgesia.They can be prescribed orally, transdermally, intravenously, perineuraly, or through the neuroaxial route.Beside analgesia and sedation, they decrease sympathetic tone and attenuate the stress response to anaesthesia and surgery.Although adrenaline was the first alpha2 agonist used intrathecally, it is no longer recommended.Nowadays, clonidine is the most used alpha2",

Several small studies report some benefit from use of a hypoallergenic (protein hydrolysate) formula, maternal diet adjustment (focusing on a low-allergen diet), and reduced stimulation of the infant. While dicyclomine has been shown to be effective for colic, there are significant concerns about its safety, and the manufacturer has contraindicated its use in this population. An herbal tea containing chamomile, vervain, licorice, fennel, and balm-mint was also effective in a small RCT, but the volume necessary for treatment limits its usefulness (strength of recommendation: B, inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence).

All subjects had attempted to stop smoking, without success. None of the subjects met<i>DSM-III-R</i>criteria for an anxiety disorder. All subjects completing the six-week trial had substantial reductions in smoking. Buspirone was selected because it, like nicotine, is a nonsedative antianxiety agent and so might oppose the characteristic anxiety, irritability, and fatigue of tobacco withdrawal.

Morphine is one of several known related alkaloids isolated or derived from the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). The pharmacological properties of opium extracts have been recognized for thousands of years, and their ability to dampen the sensation of pain has been used clinically for centuries. Fentanyl and related 4-substituted piperidine opioids were discovered over the last 75 years and have found great therapeutic utility in pain management [2]. While these two classes of opioid ligands produce profound analgesia, their use is also associatedwith some deleterious physiological effects, such as respiratory depression,muscle rigidity, emesis, constipation, and physical dependence [3]. The clinical need for a potent analgesic lacking these harmful and sometimes fatal additional effects continues today, and the search for ligands that meetthis need has been a research focus for pharmacologists and medicinal chemists for decades.",

Pain following third molar extraction was used as a homogeneous acute pain model; with the outcome of at least 50% maximum pain relief over 6 h. For many OTC drugs, there was no information available. For some OTC drugs, there was at least some information available either for the marketed product itself, or from studies that used the same doses of drug or drugs. For acute pain, data from third molar extraction studies showed that several OTC products were highly efficacious, principally non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac) and combination products based on ibuprofen; aspirin and paracetamol-based products were less efficacious. Fixed-dose combinations, especially those with ibuprofen, provided high levels of analgesia. For migraine headache, the outcome used was pain initially moderate or severe becoming no worse than mild pain (no pain, mild pain) at 2 h. Single-dose ibuprofen 400 mg was better than aspirin and paracetamol.",

      "abstract": "Any drug can be abused. Overdosage-taking too much of a drug at one time may cause serious injury or death to the patient. Acetaminophen, the main ingredient in many popular over-thecounter analgesics, is no exception. When taken in a large, single overdose, (about 10 Gm. for an adult), acetaminophen can cause liver toxicity, and occasionally death. These problems have not been associated with the long-term use of therapeutic doses. Acetaminophen is available in tablet, capsule, and liquid form. The formulation may be pure acetaminophen or a combination of drugs. Acetaminophen is an ingredient in many analgesics in cough, cold, and sleep medications, and liquid antipyretics. Because so many products contain acetaminophen, emergency personnel need to be familiar with all ingredients of any drug taken in an overdose. Although acetaminophen has been used since the 1850s, it became popular only in the past 25 years. Its use increased tremendously when the analgesic effects of phenacetin were found to be due primarily to the biotransformation of phenacetin to acetaminophen(l).",

      "abstract": "Benzydamine hydrochloride is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, with medical indication for disorders of the oral and vaginal mucosa [1]. It is available in a number of countries and in different pharmaceuticals preparations, such as pills, vaginal douche preparations, mouthwash, dermal cream and aerosol [2]. In Brazil, it can be purchased for less than US$ 5 a unit. One of the few case reports on the recreational use of this substance was a 22 year-old male who discovered information on the web about its hallucinogenic properties and decided to experiment. The subject described a state of hyperactivity, excitation, visual hallucinations and muscle weakness [3]. Last year our research group published an article describing the use of benzydamine for recreational purposes by 78 children and adolescents in street situation in a national survey in Brazil [4]. They described a dosage use ranged from 100 to 2000 mg of benzydamine; most reports were of use of an oral preparation acquired through a drugstore without a medical prescription. Some of them reported that they had associated this drug with another substance, commonly an alcoholic beverage, in an attempt to enhance its psychotropic effects. Recently we also identified the benzydamine recreational use among 2.3% of a sample of 5208 students of Sao Paulo, the largest city of Brazil. The sample was composed of 12 to 18 year-old students from private schools, with the main characteristic of belonging to the wealthiest socioeconomic status of the country. Most of the cases were high school students, and no differences were found between gender. The students that reported misuse of benzydamine reported more lifetime use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and inhalants (P < 0.01). However, there were fewer users of ecstasy and medications without prescriptions, like benzodiazepines and amphetamines. By accessing a series of social web networks in Brazil, it is easy to perceive how widespread the knowledge is on recreational use of benzydamine. Information is shared on what quantity is necessary to achieve the desired hedonistic effect, the combined use with other drugs to potentiate its effect and even opinions that encourage or discourage its use [5]. This letter serves as an alert to other countries on drawing attention to a cheap substance, readily available and with growing information about its misuse and the potential to be abused by children and adolescents.

We conducted a literature search using PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane central register from 1 January 1980 to 10 November 2021 using keywords 'benzodiazepine,' 'poisoning,' 'toxicity,' 'intoxication,' and 'treatment.'Expert opinion Careful patient selection, ideally by a clinical toxicologist, may decrease the complications of flumazenil and add to its efficacy. The cost-to-benefit ratio should be considered in every single patient who is a candidate for flumazenil administration. In case a decision has been made to administer flumazenil, careful consideration of the possible contraindications is essential. We recommend slow administration of low doses of flumazenil (0.1 mg/minute) to avoid complications or withhold the administration with development of first signs of adverse effects. The main treatment of benzodiazepine toxicity is conservative with administration of activated charcoal, monitoring of the vital signs, prevention of aspiration and development of deep vein thrombosis due to prolonged immobilization, and respiratory support.",

      "title": "Generalized bullous fixed drug eruption due to fluconazole: A report of two cases",
      "abstract": "Fixed drug eruption (FDE) is characterized by the development of well-demarcated erythematous to violaceous plaques, within minutes to hours of the intake of an offending drug. It is known as \"fixed\" because subsequent exposure to the implicated drug leads to the development of lesions at the same sites that were involved at the time of the previous drug exposure. Fluconazole, a widely used antifungal agent, has a good safety profile, and limited data exist on the development of bullous FDE due to fluconazole. Herein, we report a series of two cases presenting with a generalized bullous FDE (GBFDE), following the consumption of fluconazole. A temporal correlation, typical morphological features, symptoms, and a past history of FDE due to fluconazole were essential clues to the diagnosis. Furthermore, we utilized the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale for causality assessment. Discontinuation of the drug was followed by the resolution of lesions in 7–10 days. GBFDE is an uncommon entity and requires immediate diagnosis as well as prompt discontinuation of the offending agent to minimize the complications.",

      "abstract": "Pre-procedural cleansing of the bowel can maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of colonoscopy.Yet,efficacy of the current gold standard colonic preparation method-high-volume oral administration of purgative agents 12-24 h prior to the procedure-is limited by several factors,such as patient compliance(due to poor palatability and inconvenience of the dosing regimen)and risks of complications(due to drug interactions or intolerance).Attempts to resolve these limitations have included providing adjunctive agents and methods to promote the colonic cleansing ability of the principal purgative agent,with the aim of lessening unpleasant side effects(such as bloating)and reducing the large ingested volume requirement.Several promising adjunctive agents are bisacodyl,magnesium citrate,senna,simethicone,metoclopramide,and prokinetics,and each are being investigated for their potential.This review provides an up to date summary of the reported investigations into the potencies and weaknesses of the key adjuncts currently being applied in clinic as supplements to the traditional bowel preparation agents.While the comparative analysis ofthese adjuncts showed that no single agent or method has yet achieved the goal of completely overcoming the limitations of the current gold standard preparation method,they at least provide endoscopists with an array of alternatives to help improve the suboptimal efficacy of the main cleansing solutions when used alone.To aid in this clinical endeavor,a subjective grade was assigned to each adjunct to indicate its practical value.In addition,the systematic review of the currently available agents and methods provides insight into the features of each that may be overcome or exploited to create novel drugs and strategies that may become adopted as effective bowel cleansing adjuncts or alternatives.",

      "abstract": "Clozapine is a second-generation antipsychotic typically used for refractory schizophrenia or otherwise psychotic pathology. There are no FDA or manufacturer guidelines for use of clozapine in pediatric population. We investigated the current state of research concerning the use of clozapine in pediatric patients.We describe consistent calls for more research into the long-term and short-term effects of clozapine use in a young patient population. Despite the strongly supported efficacy, questions concerning clear indications for use and risk-benefit analysis persist. We acknowledge that a more comprehensive meta-analysis would greatly benefit the field. However, this is the first article of its kind for clozapine in recent history, and therefore, serves as a focus and reference point for future, more in-depth analyses.We conducted a search of PubMed, ClinicalKey, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE databases. Keywords used included, in varying combinations: clozapine, off-label, indications, children and adolescent, pediatric, behavioral, suicidality, psychosis, early and very-early onset schizophrenia, side-effect profile, and long-term use. Further criteria and selection are described in Methods below.We describe the documented efficacy of clozapine for the management of refractory psychotic and nonpsychotic symptoms in the pediatric population. The authors highlight the risk of unmanaged early-onset schizophrenia, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and severe nonpsychotic pathology. Unfortunately, these studies are generally small. There is little consistency in when clozapine is prescribed, how long it is administered, and how long patients are followed. Despite the lack of FDA and manufacturer guidelines, clozapine continues to be used for the benefit of young patients.Indications for prescription of clozapine should be revisited, given the data presented in this manuscript of a low risk-benefit ratio for properly chosen patients. Larger studies should be conducted to provide more statistical power and determine clear guidelines for use, risk of side effects, and long-term adverse events that may arise.",

Topical anaesthetic is commonly used by ophthalmologists in clinical practice, and in emergencies to remove corneal foreign bodies. In ophthalmology, proparacaine hydrochloride, also known as 2-(diethylamino) ethyl 3-amino-4-propoxybenzoate hydrochloride, is a common choice for topical anaesthesia.

      "abstract": "Background: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting approximately 1% of the world's population. The currently available anticonvulsants are effective in reducing the severity and number of seizures in less than 70% of patients. Moreover, their use is associated with undesirable side effects, ranging from cosmetic (gingival hyperplasia) to life-threatening (hepatotoxicity or megaloblastic anemia). Therefore, the continued search for safer and more effective anti-epileptic drugs is both urgent and necessary. A survey of the literature reveals that various derivatives of quinazolinone, thienopyrimidine and pyridopyrimidine have shown very promising anticonvulsant activity, along with other pharmacological activities. We therefore decided to concentrate our efforts on screening novel quinazolinone fused with thienopyrimidine/pyridopyrimidine. Results: A novel series of 1,2,9,11-tetrasubstituted-7H-thieno[2´,3´:4,5]pyrimido[6,1-b]-quinazolin-7-ones and 1,3,10,12-tetrasubstituted-8H-pyrido[2´,3´:4,5]pyrimido[6,1-b]quinazolin-8-ones were synthesized by the method reported. The anticonvulsant activity of all the new compounds was evaluated against maximum electroshock-induced seizures and against subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (scPTZ)-induced seizure models in mice. The neurotoxicity was assessed using the Rotorod procedure. All the compounds tested were administered intraperitoneally at a various dose levels ranging from 15 to 175 mg/kg body weight, and the median toxic dose (TD50) and the protection index values were determined. All compounds tested exhibited good activity. The structure–activity relationships based on the results obtained for these series were also studied. Conclusion: This study indicates that fused quinazolinones display very good anticonvulsant activity. In both series, electron-withdrawing substitutions showed more activity. Among all the compounds tested, 10,12-dibromo-1- (4-chloro-phenyl)-3- (4-tolyl)-8H-pyrido[2´,3´:4,5]pyrimido[6,1-b]quinazolin-8-one and 10,12-dibromo-3- (4-chloro-phenyl)-1-phenyl-8H-pyrido[2´,3´:4,5]pyrimido[6,1-b]quinazolin-8-one were found to be the most potent.",

The diagnostic and therapeutic implications of megadose dexamethasone suppression have not been clearly addressed in the medical literature. It is possible that adrenal suppression achieved only with unconventionally high doses of steroids may be predictive of refractoriness to nonsurgical therapy.",

Edrophonium belongs to a family of anticholinesterase agents, producing effects equivalent to continuous stimulation of cholinergic nerves, ie, continuous vagotonia. It is noted for rapid onset and brief duration of action. The principal use has been as a provocative drug for the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis or for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.<sup>1</sup> While observing the intravenous administration of 10 mg of edrophonium chloride for a tachyarrhythmia in a patient postoperatively with protracted severe adynamic ileus, I was struck by the prompt onset of borborygmi and strong peristaltic sounds.

The most common benzodiazepines used for premedication are midazolam, Diazepam and lorazepam. They are usually given intramuscularly or orally in children. The time of use should be correlated with the moment of maximum effect depending on the method of administration. Time varies from twenty minutes for intramuscularly administered midazolam to two hours for peroral administered lorazepam. The choice of a particular Benzodiazepine, used for premedication, depends on its effects, duration of action, active metabolites, and side effects. The dose should be carefully tailored to provide the expected reduction of anxiety and light sedation and to avoid sleep and especially respiratory depression.",

      "title": "Eniluracil: an irreversible inhibitor of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase",
      "abstract": "AbstractOne of the most widely used drugs in cancer chemotherapy is 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). 5-FU is optimally delivered via continuous iv. infusion, which is both cumbersome and expensive. Prolonged oral dosing of 5-FU could mimic continuous infusion with less inconvenience and cost. However, oral administration of 5-FU has been hampered by incomplete and erratic bioavailability due to substantial variability in the activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the rate-limiting enzyme in 5-FU catabolism. Eniluracil (ethynyluracil, GlaxoWellcome, USA), a uracil analogue, which irreversibly inhibits DPD, increases the oral bioavailability of 5-FU to 100%, facilitating uniform absorption and predictable toxicity. Cytotoxicity is enhanced one- to five-fold in cell lines treated with eniluracil plus 5-FU compared with 5-FU alone. Though eniluracil is neither toxic nor active as a single agent in animals, it improves the antitumour efficacy and therapeutic index of 5-FU. In Phase I trials, eniluracil markedly reduced the maximum tolerated dose of oral 5-FU, increased the half-life 20-fold and decreased the clearance 22-fold. DPD is completely inactivated within 1 h of eniluracil administration. Two dosing schedules have been evaluated in combination with oral 5-FU: a 5-day schedule every 28 days and a 28-day schedule every 35 days. The dose-limiting toxicity on the first schedule is myelosuppression with diarrhoea being dose-limiting on the 28-day schedule. Phase II trials employing the 28-day schedule have been completed in cancers of the colon, breast, liver and pancreas. Phase III trials in colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma have been completed and await analysis. Eniluracil is a promising drug, which permits reliable and safe administration of oral 5-FU and has the potential to overcome 5-FU resistance mediated by overexpression of DPD.Keywords5-FUDPDeniluraciloral chemotherapy",

      "abstract": "In comparison to oral NSAIDs, topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for osteoarthritis provide at least equivalent analgesia, improve physical function, reduce stiffness, and have fewer systemic adverse events. Topical diclofenac is one such NSAID. Although topical diclofenac has been shown to be successful in treating osteoarthritis, nothing is known about how long the medication takes to start working, how long it lasts, and what the lowest therapeutic concentration is. Localization and medication penetration are two factors that might affect these values. Diclofenac concentrations in the tissues of the joints are probably more important than those in the plasma. Despite the fact that diclofenac enters and remains in these \"effect compartments\" at the site I.e. The results of our study suggest that topical NSAIDs, like diclofenac, are a generally well-tolerated, safe, and effective first-line treatment option for osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee and hands. This is especially true for older patients, those with comorbid conditions, and those who are at risk for gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, or cardiovascular systemic adverse events that are linked to oral NSAID use, especially when using high doses over an extended period of time of inflammation and medication action, no particular minimum effective concentration of the drug has been found in either synovial tissue or plasma. Recent data indicates that plasma concentrations may not be the most accurate indicator of effectiveness than a decrease in inflammatory markers. This narrative evaluation examines the data that is currently available in these fields and highlights any gaps that require more investigation.",

Pentazocine (40 and 80 mg), tripelennamine (50 and 100 mg), alone and in combination, and placebo were administered in random order to volunteering experienced drug users. Pentazocine alone and tripelennamine alone were identified as opioids and produced euphoria. The large dose of pentazocine produced sedation and dysphoria. Pentazocine and tripelennamine both raised blood pressure; pentazocine constricted pupils, tripelennamine did not. The addition of 50 mg of tripelennamine increased the euphoric effects of pentazocine and attenuated the dysphoric effects seen at higher doses. Adding 100 mg of tripelennamine did not appreciably increase further the euphoric effects and did not alter the dysphoric effects of high doses of pentazocine. The combination significantly increased the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and the increase was at least additive. In combination, pupillary constriction was slightly antagonized. These studies suggest that the antihistamine tripelennamine has abuse potential, and that in combination with pentazocine, the euphoric effects of the opioid are enhanced and its dysphoric properties attenuated.",

Here, we reviewed the research evidence available regarding the use of cannabis and cannabinoids for a set of suggested therapeutical applications, and addressed some of the short- and long-term risks that have been correlated with the use of these substances. We found scarce scientific evidence supporting the use of cannabis-based products for most of the suggested applications, as well as no unmet medical need that is not already tackled by existing medicines (some cannabinoid-based) in the market. In such a scenario, the potential risks associated with the chronic use of these substances may deter their medical use.",

A combination of haloperidol with lorazepam<sup>2</sup>is used routinely at the Wisconsin Clinical Cancer Center, Madison, for the management of nausea associated with various types of chemotherapy. We have found that the intravenous administration of 0.5 to 1.0 mg each of haloperidol and lorazepam 15 minutes prior to the intravenous administration of dihydroergotamine prevents nausea and vomiting. <h3>Report of Cases.</h3> —A 37-year-old woman with a long history of classic migraine headaches and a 1-year history of severe depression was",

      "abstract": "Beta-lactam antibiotics are highly effective against most bacteria causing skin and soft tissue infections. Good tissue penetration further makes beta-lactam antibiotics useful against skin and soft tissue infections. Drugs with a narrow spectrum should be among the first choice. Broader spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics may be needed in reduced bacterial susceptibility. Low molecular weight compounds (monobactams, penems, penicillinase inhibitors) in addition to their high antibacterial effect have shown excellent tissue penetration. In easy and moderately severe anaerobic infections not treatable with conventional oral beta-lactam antibiotics, other oral antibacterial agents (e.g. clindamycin, metronidazole) may be used rather than the parenteral recent acyl-ureidopenicillins or cephalosporins. Due to long duration of skin and soft tissue levels of drugs, it is unnecessary to administer beta-lactam antibiotics more than 2 or 3 times a day. Normal dosage schedules can be employed except in severely compromised elimination when decreased doses may be recommended or in immuno-compromised hosts and other risk patients who may require a 2- or 3-fold increase.",

Many studies have demonstrated the utility of DAP® in the treatment of the separation related problems, sound sensitivity, adaptation to a new environment, transport-related behavior problems and in the protection of dog welfare in the shelter. Some criticisms have been made about method and procedures used, recognized as not appropriate to provide evidence of the effectiveness of DAP®. These criticisms were later countered but it is clear that the study of these particular substances requires careful methodological rigor, as many interfering factors may be present. Since DAP® is not systemically absorbed, there is no toxicity or side effects which allows for its safe use alone or combination with psychotropic drugs.",

This study compared high-dose droperidol and ondansetron in patients scheduled for minor gynecologic surgery. Ondansetron was administered in a dose of 8 mg. Although the safety profile of this dose is the same as the commonly used 4-mg dose, most studies demonstrate little or no additional efficacy; thus more cost and little added benefit is seen with the higher dose. Similarly, droperidol is most frequently administered in doses of 0.625 or 1.25 mg; the 2.5-mg dose used here caused sedation and enhanced the likelihood of undesirable central nervous system side effects. Nevertheless, this study sheds light on the effects of these two drugs at doses that might well be used in patients with persistent nausea and vomiting.

Methods.A retrospective chart review of the patient's presentation, workup, treatment, and follow up was conducted. Results.A 43-year-old male presents for methadone clinic for the third time in his life.At the age of 23 he started to use illicit opiates and heroin.His recently began using a new drug he reports as \"carfentanil.\"He describes it as a powerful sedative and that he uses it as the same dose as he uses fentanyl.Considering that carfentanil has a potency that is 100 times that of fentanyl, the patient would have noticed if he had been taking actual carfentanil.Thus, it was determined that the patient incorrectly named the xylazine mixed fentanyl as \"carfentanil.\"Conclusions.Xylazine mixed fentanyl is an increasingly popular drug combination that is finding its way across the country with potential for fatal consequences.",

Traditional treatments for insomnia have been effective but linked to significant side effects and issues with dependence. Daridorexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist which represents a new class of medication that targets the orexin system. Clinical trials have already demonstrated daridorexant’s ability to improve sleep onset, maintenance, and next day functioning with fewer side effects than current treatments. There is also low potential for abuse which makes it a promising alternative. Daridorexant is available in 25 mg or 50 mg tablets, one of which is to be taken each day. Caution should be taken around drug interactions. Longer term studies show promise and further research should be undertaken in further developing orexin pathway modulators.",

      "title": "Intraurethral alprostadil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a significant and common health disorder affecting males and, indirectly, their partners and families. Largely due to the increased aging population, the incidence of ED is steadily increasing. While ED is not life threatening, it is associated with increased morbidity, representing a disorder that affects an individual’s physical and psychosocial health, and has a significant impact on an individual’s quality of life (QoL), as well as on the QoL of their partners and families. Since the earlier use of a range of suboptimal ED management approaches, the more recent introduction of oral phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors has radically altered the therapeutic approach to ED. However, a growing number of patients with comorbid conditions have become refractory to oral PDE5 inhibitors. Alternative ED management options are therefore required for these patient populations. Alprostadil (a synthetic vasodilator that is chemically identical to the naturally occurring prostaglandin E1), administered intraurethrally or, more invasively, via intracavernosal injection, represents one of the currently available pharmacological ED treatment options. Intraurethral alprostadil is delivered by the Medicated Urethral System for Erection (MUSE; MEDA, Madrid, Spain), a singleuse pellet containing alprostadil suspended in polyethylene glycol, with administration of the pellet via an applicator. This method of administration provides a minimally invasive approach for individuals with ED. The purpose of the current supplement is to provide an updated appraisal of the clinical evidence, as well as the impact on patient preference and acceptance rates, and QoL, relating to the use of intraurethral alprostadil. The papers in the supplement place particular emphasis on the use of intraurethral alprostadil in special patient populations who, for one reason or another, are unable to receive, or no longer respond to, PDE5 inhibitors. While current treatment guidelines position intracavernosal and intraurethral alprostadil as second-line options, Dinsmore and colleagues present an argument for minimally invasive intraurethral alprostadil to be positioned as the first alternative ED treatment in patients for whom PDE5 inhibitor therapy has failed, or special patient populations who can no longer take PDE5 inhibitors for any reason, including patients with soft glans syndrome and those who have undergone prostatectomy.",

That there might be physical means of releasing or forming antihistaminic substances in the skin seemed plausible after the observation of a number of cases of asthmatic episodes (and other conditions in which a histamine action is probable) in which the condition was relieved and stayed relieved for months, after indirect or general radiation of several areas of skin surface with grenz rays.",

      "title": "Pharmacotherapy of erectile dysfunction: Current standards",
      "abstract": "Pharmacotherapy is currently the therapeutic option of choice for erectile dysfunction. Comprising mainly intracavernosal injection therapy using alprostadil or alprostadil combined with phentolamine and/or papaverine and oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, it is safe and effective if appropriately prescribed and administered. The medications in current use produce satisfactory erectile responses by enhancing cavernosal vasodilatation mainly through their ability to promote relaxation of the smooth muscle cells in the corpora cavernosa involving the synthesis and activity of nitric oxide via the cyclic guanosine monophosphate and cyclic adenosine monophosphate biochemical pathways. The main side-effects and complications of intracavernosal injections are postinjection pain, prolonged erections, priapism and penile fibrosis. There may be a variety of side-effects with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition but these are usually inconsequential. Recent serious ill health and the need for ongoing long-acting nitrate therapy or frequent use of short-acting nitrates for angina are absolute contraindications to the use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. Caution has to be exercised in prescribing phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors for patients with impaired renal or hepatic functions or receiving multi-drug therapy for any systemic disease. All patients presenting with erectile dysfunction should be investigated and treated for cardiovascular risk factors. They should also be counseled regarding lifestyle factors particularly healthy balanced diet, regular physical exercise and inappropriate social habits.",

      "title": "Safe Reduction in Administration of Naloxone to Newborn Infants: An Observational Study",
      "abstract": "Naloxone, an opiate antagonist, acts on opioid receptors in the brain where it competitively binds in place of opiate-based drugs. It is widely used during neonatal resuscitation in order to reverse opiate-induced respiratory depression. However, naloxone is capable of inducing a severe withdrawal reaction including seizures in infants whose mothers have misused opiates. Other problems are that absorption of a drug given by intramuscular injection is unreliable, and that the effect of naloxone may decline before opiate is eliminated from the brain. The investigators obtained perinatal data on naloxone administration and respiratory morbidity, both retrospectively before, and prospectively after introducing the “Good Practice” guidelines for properly using naloxone (listed below). Good Practice Guidelines for Properly Using Naloxone Naloxone will only be given if: The mother received an opiate drug less than 4 hour before birth or received two doses less than 3 hour apart during labor. and after: The infant's head has been positioned to open the airway and the airway cleared by suction. Effective bag-and-mask ventilation has been established. The infant is centrally pink and has had a normal heart rate for over 60 s (greater than 120 bpm). Apnea persists for 1 minute after stopping bag-and-mask ventilation. If it is necessary to give naloxone, it will be given: Intravenously (100 mg/kg). If naloxone is administered, the infant will be admitted to the neonatal unit for 6-hour observation. There were 500 and 1000 deliveries, respectively, in the review and prospective parts of the study. Similar proportions of women in the retrospective and prospective groups received opiates during labor. However, the use of naloxone decreased markedly after the guidelines were adopted, from 5% of all newborn infants (11% of those whose mothers received opiates) to 0.1% (0.2% of those whose mothers received opiates). Low Apgar scores did not differ between the two groups after excluding preterm infants and those with specific respiratory disorders. Comparable numbers of infants in the retrospective and prospective groups had evidence of respiratory disorders before being discharged. Most of these disorders could not be related to opiate administration. All but one of eight infants with cyanotic episodes that could have resulted from opiates were seen during the time when naloxone was used less often, but there were indications that, with two exceptions, these episodes did not result from the restricted use of naloxone. None of the affected infants required more than simple stimulation or suction. These findings are the best available evidence that naloxone rarely is needed by newborn infants even when opiates are frequently given during labor. Limiting the use of naloxone does not increase respiratory morbidity.",

Cephalexin binds to penicillin-binding protein (PBP), disrupting cell wall synthesis. Cephalexin decreases ability of the antibiotic to reach the PBP when bacteria decrease porin production, resulting in a decrease of the drug concentration within the cell. Cephalexin is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible strains of organisms: respiratory tract infections, otitis media, skin and skin structure infections, bone infections and genitourinary tract infections. Cephalexin is contraindicated in patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin group of antibiotics. Cephalexin should be used with caution if hypersensitivity exists to penicillin. Cephalexin can be administered with or without food. Probenecid may decrease renal tubular secretion of cephalosporins when used concurrently, resulting in increased and more prolonged cephalosporin blood levels. Cephalexin is adjusted for renal dysfunction.",

      "title": "Postoperative nausea and vomiting in paediatric patients",
      "abstract": "The past decade has witnessed the introduction of several significant innovations to combat POV, particularly the introduction of serotonin antagonists and the use of combinations of drugs for analgesia and control of POV. Based on current knowledge, the anaesthetic plan for a patient with a previous history of severe PONV and undergoing a procedure known to be associated with a high incidence of this problem should include premedication with a benzodiazepine and/or clonidine and the preferential use of regional anaesthetic techniques. If general anaesthesia is essential, anaesthetists should consider the use of propofol for both induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, together with avoidance of nitrous oxide, opioids and neuromuscular antagonists. Pain control is extremely important, and a peripheral regional block should be used if possible. A combination of prophylactic antiemetics such as dexamethasone, a 5-HT3 antagonist and an antiemetic of a different class (e.g. perphenazine or dimenhydrinate) should be administered. Non-pharmacological measures such as acupressure and suggestion should also be considered, together with nursing measures to avoid sudden movement from one position to another during the postoperative period. A quiet environment, adequate i.v. fluids and not forcing the patient to drink before discharge all contribute to decreased emesis. It is possible that the advent of a new class of antiemetic agents, the NKI antagonists, may have major effects on the incidence of this complication. Drugs in this group differ from other currently available drugs in having the ability to effectively block the emetic response to many stimuli in experimental animals. Postoperative vomiting remains a significant problem, resulting in patient suffering and prolonged recovery from anaesthesia. Our aim should be to eliminate this complication in all children who require surgery. It should not be considered merely as the 'big, little problem'.",

One of the most common additives on today’s market is levamisole, an anthelmintic medication used to destroy and expel parasitic worms in animals. The use of levamisole-contaminated cocaine can result in agranulocytosis and vasculitis (inflammation and constriction of small blood vessels). The resulting clotting and decrease in peripheral blood flow lead to cutaneous lesions, particularly on the ears, face, hands, and feet, and in severe cases can cause generalized tissue necrosis throughout the entire body. Treatment is generally supportive, and symptoms typically abate with complete cessation of cocaine use. However, symptoms may recur with subsequent cocaine use and, as this case illustrates, severe neutropenia and extensive vasculitis may lead to overwhelming sepsis and death.",

Meprobamate, which is one of the best-known examples, had been a controlled substance after studies indicating its addictive effects, shortly after its introduction in the 1950 s. Phenprobamate, which has been reported to be similar to meprobamate in terms of effects, side effects, and toxicity, is not a controlled substance and is frequently prescribed as a centrally acting 10 muscle relaxant. To our knowledge, there is only one case report regarding phenprobamate dependence, which is known for its similar mechanism of action to meprobamate.Methods and Results: Here a case study, who is taking 12 grams a day (30 tablets/day), is presented about phenprobamate, which could have an addictive effect similar to some centrally acting muscle relaxants that were reported in the literature.Conclusions: Physicians should investigate non-phenprobamate muscle relaxant options in those with a history of 15 alcohol and substance use disorders, and health policy should prevent over-the-counter drug sales and prevent possible addictions.",

      "abstract": "The fentanyl derivative alfentanil is a potent analgesic characterized by a quick onset time, short duration of action, low toxicity and short elimination time. Alfentanil is mainly used intraoperatively. In minor operations, its intravenous application is sufficient for anaesthesia. In major operations, the need for other anaesthetics can be reduced by the application of alfentanil. The best form of application is the computer-controlled infusion of alfentanil. The advantage of alfentanil over other opioids is the short recovery time of the patient. Alfentanil can also be used postoperatively for pain relief. Used intravenously after abdominal operations, it is approximately ten times more effective than morphine. Applied peridurally its analgesic effect corresponds approximately to that of morphine. Based on the lower amount of alfentanil needed, the patient-controlled application of alfentanil is superior to the use of constant infusion rates. In combination with midazolam, alfentanil can also be used for analgosedation of intensive care patients. Alfentanil is less useful for the treatment of cancer pain since it leads to greater development of tolerance than other opioids.",

      "abstract": "Use of systemic antimicrobial agents in Norway shows a moderate increase from 1980 to 1992, from 13.5 to 16.9 defined daily doses (DDDs) per 1,000 inhabitants per day. Comparing the Nordic countries, the use of these drugs is second lowest in Norway, after Denmark. In relative terms the use of tetracyclines is highest in Norway. Use of co-trimoxazole is also relatively high, while use of macrolides is low. The share of penicillin V and G is highest in Sweden. Several new and important antimicrobial agents have been introduced on the Norwegian market during the period, while almost as many have been withdrawn. Penicillin V and G constitutes the main subgroup. However, the use of tetracyclines is almost as high, for a short period in fact higher. Taking into account the development of drug resistance and adverse events, it is recommended that use of tetracyclines and co-trimoxazole be reduced, mainly to the advantage of penicillins. The use of cephalosporins seems to be reasonable, but penicillins should be considered more often as an alternative. The use of antimycotic and antiviral drugs is low in terms of DDDs. In 1992 the cost of antimicrobial agents for systemic use was in 1992 approx. NOK 400 million, retail price. The largest subgroup, cephalosporins, constituted almost 20%, as against only 2% of DDDs. Antimicrobial agents represent a substantial part of the total drug budget in hospitals. A shift from expensive to cheaper alternatives should be considered as a routine. Moreover, an optimal change from parenteral to oral administration could help to reduce costs.",

      "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction is one of the common sexual adverse effects encountered in male patients treated with antipsychotics. It is associated with prolactin secretion secondary to dopamine antagonism by the antipsychotics. Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant that inhibits the reuptake of dopamine. In this case, we report a 42 year old schizophrenic male, who developed erectile dysfunction after administration of a long acting injectable antipsychotic, namely paliperidone palmitate. The erectile dysfunction did not respond to sildenafil but recovered with the treatment of methylphenidate 10mg. The current finding suggests that clinicians should be aware of the possible emergence of erectile dysfunction among patients on long acting injectable antipsychotics. Methylphenidate may be an alternative treatment option for erectile dysfunction induced by antipsychotics.",

      "abstract": "NSAIDs are anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic agents, and they are typically used chronically to reduce pain, decrease stiffness, and improve function in patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and other forms of arthritis. Additionally, NSAIDs are also used for the more acute treatment of pain including headache, dysmenorrhea, and postoperative pain. However, NSAID use conveys potential significant adverse events that include gastrointestinal ulcers with consequential bleeding, perforation or obstruction, renal dysfunction and consequent renal failure, cardiovascular events, as well as the risk for death. Despite the many available forms of NSAIDs, including injectable as well as topical, oral dosing is the most common route, usually the one route consistently associated with chronic use and thus the one that carries the most risk. In the last several years, several topical NSAIDs including either diclofenac ibuprofen or salicylates for chronic pain have been approved in the United States while similar drugs have been available in Europe for years. One study of a diclofenac topical liquid included an oral diclofenac comparator, and demonstrated no difference in efficacy between the two therapies in treatment for the pain of osteoarthritis in the knee.",

The routinely used antidiarrheal drugs act by either decreasing the secretory function of intestinal mucosa or by reducing the intestinal peristalsis or by both of these mechanisms. Antimotility drugs may not be beneficial in infective diarrhoea. Another limitation of antidiarrheal drugs is short duration of action. Hence, the search for effective and safe drug is in process. The various in vitro methods employed for screening anti-diarrheal drugs are inhibition of acetylcholine, histamine or serotonin-induced contraction on isolated segments of small intestine of rat or rabbit by test drugs. The various in vivo methods evaluate the ability of test drugs to inhibit diarrhoea or enteropooling induced by chemicals, drugs or stress. Other in vivo methods include test drug effect on cecectomised rats and gastrointestinal transit time. In this Chapter, in vivo methods to evaluate antidiarrheal activity of test drugs are discussed in detail.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a component of the yellow powder prepared from the roots of Curcuma longa or Zingiberaceae (known as turmeric) is not only widely used to color and flavor food but also used as a pharmaceutical agent. Curcumin demonstrates anti‐inflammatory, anticarcinogenic, antiaging, and antioxidant activity, as well as efficacy in wound healing. Notably, curcumin is a hormetic agent (hormetin), as it is stimulatory at low doses and inhibitory at high doses. Hormesis by curcumin could be also a particular function at low doses (i.e., antioxidant behavior) and another function at high dose (i.e., induction of autophagy and cell death). Recent findings suggest that curcumin exhibits biphasic dose–responses on cells, with low doses having stronger effects than high doses; examples being activation of the mitogen‐activated protein kinase signaling pathway or antioxidant activity. This indicates that many effects induced by curcumin are dependent on dose and some effects might be greater at lower doses, indicative of a hormetic response. Despite the consistent occurrence of hormetic responses of curcumin in a wide range of biomedical models, epidemiological and clinical trials are needed to assess the nature of curcumin’s dose–response in humans. Fortunately, more than one hundred clinical trials with curcumin and curcumin derivatives are ongoing. In this review, we provide the first comprehensive analysis supportive of the hormetic behavior of curcumin and curcumin derivatives.",

Therefore, this drug is used for weight loss, is mostly sold on internet sites, and is banned for sale owing to its deadly side effects. In this case report, we aimed to report a patient who was admitted to our hospital with DNP poisoning. Case: In the present study, we present a 29-year-old patient who took 200-mg DNP® once a day for 5 days and who applied to our emergency department approximately 6 hours after taking two tablets on the last day. He developed cardiopulmonary arrest 8 hours after admission despite all supportive treatments and died despite effective and adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Conclusion: DNP poisoning can be fatal even in small doses. It is difficult to control because the drug is freely available on the internet, and urgent diagnosis and treatment is critical. In recent times, where sedentary life and obesity are on the rise, people should be better informed about healthy living and the risks associated with weight loss drugs that can be obtained illegally. Preventing the unauthorized sale of these products, which have a limited response to treatment and a high mortality rate, over the internet and early recognition of poisoning by emergency room physicians is the most important preventive measure in DNP poisonings and the most important step in treatment.",

      "title": "Fluoroquinolones for children : filling the gap",
      "abstract": "Fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics, are regularly prescribed to children for treatment and prophylaxis of complex infections. At the moment when ciprofloxacin, which is one of the first fluoroquinolones, was launched in the 1980s, it had not been tested in the pediatric population. This is not uncommon. During traditional drug development processes, the effects and safety of medicines have been studied in adults, given the numerous ethical and practical challenges of pediatric drug research.\r\nExperiments in young animals were performed as an attempt to study the safety of fluoroquinolones in children. Unfortunately, severe cartilage tissue damages and growth deformities were observed in these animals, particularly in beagle dogs. This resulted in a class label warning for the usage of fluoroquinolones in children, in 1995. Nevertheless, during the past two decades, many children have been prescribed a fluoroquinolone. These prescriptions are usually so-called off-label, which means that either the indication for its prescription or its dosage has not formally been studied. Off-label prescribing is undesirable. However, in previous post-marketing studies of children to whom fluoroquinolones were administered, it turned out that fluoroquinolones unlikely result in cartilage tissue lesions and growth deformities in humans. \r\nAt the beginning of this PhD project, there was a gap in knowledge about the working of fluoroquinolones in children. Therefore, the main aim of this thesis was to enhance the pharmacological knowledge of fluoroquinolones within the pediatric population.\r\nIn the first paper, a retrospective drug utilization study, we analyzed for which reasons hospitalized children were prescribed a fluoroquinolone, in the setting of two university hospitals. The most common reasons were central nervous infections, prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia, and soft tissue infections. Furthermore, about 30% of the prescriptions were dosed inadequately, with underdosing being the most frequent. We found that particularly young children were at risk for receiving an underdosed prescription. In the second paper, a prospective population pharmacokinetic study, we investigated which dose of ciprofloxacin is adequate for treating complicated urinary tract infection. We proved that conventional dose recommendations result in a major undertreatment of children whose urinary tract infection was caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Because pathophysiological alterations had a major influence on ciprofloxacin metabolism, in paper 3 we modeled these changes in a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model, in order to better predict ciprofloxacin exposure in these children. This model demonstrated its adequacy in simulating different dosing scenarios for children older than 3 months with complicated urinary tract infection. To provide improved dosing advices for children with both different diseases and other fluoroquinolones, we wrote a systematic review (paper 4), in which pharmacokinetic parameters of systemic fluoroquinolones in children were analyzed. We found multiple disease related characteristics that should be considered when dosing fluoroquinolones for children. \r\nFrom the previous studies it can be concluded that a correct indication and an adequate dose are the cornerstone of an antibiotic prescription. Since children's involvement in clinical trials is often perceived as controversial, we investigated in paper 5 how scientists deal with basic ethical principles in their studies.",

The first step consists in general measures (reduced stress, regular meals and physical exercise) and some modifications in diet habits (greater than 1.5 1 of water a day, vegetables, fruits, whole wheat bread). The pharmacological therapy is based on drugs which act in different ways: a) some contain unabsorbable substances (i.e. cellulose, emicellulose) that increase the volume of the stools: b) unabsorbable sugars (i.e. lactulose, lactose) or salts (Mg-sulphate, citrate and Na-sulphate) that provoke an osmotic effect and stimulate the colonic motility; c) suppositories that stimulate the defecation reflex; d) drugs able to stimulate colonic secretion and propulsive motility (i.e. anthraquinones, oral bisacodyl, phenolphthalein, castor oil, prokinetics). There are many conditions in which medical therapy fails its objective: in these cases it is important to exclude other causes of constipation (i.e. drug-related constipation, endocrine disorders, metabolic diseases, systemic illnesses or lesion of the enteric plexus) in order to obtain an improvement of this symptom.",

      "abstract": "Patients with advanced cancers--particularly breast and prostate cancers--are at high risk for bone metastasis, leading to accelerated bone resorption and clinically significant skeletal morbidity. Bisphosphonates are effective inhibitors of bone resorption and reduce the risk of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases. The standard routes of administration for bisphosphonates used in clinical practice are either oral or i.v. infusion. Oral administration of bisphosphonates is complicated by poor bioavailability (generally <5%) and poor gastrointestinal tolerability. First-generation bisphosphonates, such as clodronate (Bonefos; Anthra Pharmaceuticals; Princeton, NJ), must be administered at high oral doses (1,600-3,200 mg/day) to achieve therapeutic effects, which leads to poor tolerability and compliance with oral dosing regimens. Infusion of bisphosphonates is associated with dose- and infusion-rate-dependent effects on renal function. In particular, high bisphosphonate doses (e.g., 1,500 mg clodronate) can cause severe renal toxicity unless infused slowly over many hours. In contrast, the newer, more potent bisphosphonates effectively inhibit bone resorption at micromolar concentrations, and the small doses required can be administered via relatively short i.v. infusions without adversely affecting renal function. Zoledronic acid (Zometa; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.; East Hanover, NJ) is a new generation bisphosphonate, and the recommended dose of 4 mg can be safely infused over 15 minutes. The 90-mg dose of pamidronate (Aredia; Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.) and the 6-mg dose of ibandronate (Bondronat; Hoffmann-La Roche Inc.; Nutley, NJ) require 1- to 4-hour infusions. Intravenous bisphosphonates require less frequent dosing (once a month) and are generally well tolerated with long-term use in patients with bone metastases. Zoledronic acid has demonstrated the broadest clinical activity in patients with bone metastases.",

      "abstract": "Albendazole is an anthelmintic drug used worldwide for prophylactic or curative treatment. Side effects include diarrhea, abdominal pain, elevated levels of hepatic transaminases, dizziness, neutropenia, and alopecia.The main question of the systematic review is if albendazole administration can cause liver injury or liver failure.Two researchers conducted the search on PubMed and the key words used were: \"albendazole,\" \"anthelmintic,\" \"drug-induced liver injury,\" and \"acute hepatitis.\" Two new case reports were included in the systematic review.Literature search concluded in 10 cases listed on PubMed. Another 2 new case reports from our experience are included in the systematic review. Most common symptoms presented are jaundice, anorexia, and vomiting after the single-use of albendazole or long-term usage. All cases presented high levels of transaminases, with remission after stopping the administration of albendazole. The treatment with albendazole was mostly given for liver hydatid cysts or empirically.Albendazole is a prescription-based drug used by most patients without medical advice, without knowing the risk of side effects. The anthelmintic drug may induce liver injury, even in small doses; in result, practitioners and patients should take this information in consideration.",

It has become one of the most popular antidepressants in use today, largely because of its low incidence of side effects and toxic reactions and its possible earlier onset of action.1-5Our recent experience with a patient who ingested excessive amounts of this drug has alerted us to a yet unreported and potentially lethal complication of amoxapine overdose.

      "title": "A Fatal Drug Interaction Between Oxycodone and Clonazepam",
      "abstract": "A case is presented of a fatal drug interaction caused by ingestion of oxycodone (Oxycontin) and clonazepam (Klonapin). Oxycodone is an opium alkaloid used in long-term pain management therapy. Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine used for the treatment of seizures and panic disorders. The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) has reported an increase of 108% in the last two years of emergency department episodes related to Oxycontin. Six billion prescriptions were written for Oxycontin in the year 2000, an 18-fold increase from four years previous (1). Oxycontin has recently gained enormous notoriety at the local and national levels; however, there are very few previously documented cases of lethal drug interactions between oxycodone and clonazepam. Synergistic effects between these two drugs are postulated to arise from different agonistic mechanisms producing similar physiological changes. It is also theorized that clonazepam may inhibit the metabolism of oxycodone. A 38-year-old white female was found dead in Jefferson County, Tennessee in March of 2001. The deceased had physical evidence of previous drug abuse and positive serological findings of hepatitis B and C. Prescription pill bottles filled under the name of the deceased, as well as another name, were found with the body. Serum, urine and gastric contents from the deceased were screened for numerous drugs and metabolites using a combination of thin layer chromatography and immunoassay techniques (EMIT and FPIA). Analysis of biological specimens from the deceased revealed the presence of: benzodiazepines, opiates (oxycodone), and trazodone metabolites in the serum; cannabinoids, benzodiazepines, opiates (oxycodone), trazodone, trazodone metabolites, nicotine, and nicotine metabolite in the urine; and benzodiazepines, opiates (oxycodone), nicotine, and nicotine metabolite in the gastric contents. Quantitative analyses for clonazepam was performed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and revealed a plasma concentration of 1.41 microg/mL. Plasma oxycodone and urine 11-nor-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol concentrations were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and revealed concentrations of 0.60 microg/mL and 27.9 ng/mL, respectively. The deceased had pathologies consistent with severe central nervous system (CNS) and respiratory depression produced by high concentrations of clonazepam and oxycodone including collapsed lungs, aspirated mucus, and heart failure. The pathologies were sufficient to cause death, which was officially attributed to a drug overdose; however, the manner of death was unknown.",

      "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is a sudden onset of systemic hypersensitivity caused by mast cell and basophil degranulation. Food, Hymenoptera venom, and drug allergy are among the leading causes of anaphylaxis, particularly in adults. We can consider anaphylaxis caused by swallowing food or medication as a form of poisoning. Because in anaphylaxis, just like in poisoning, an allergen entering the body poses a life-threatening risk. Therefore, the allergen should be removed from the digestive system immediately. However, the decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract is not routinely used to prevent further absorption of allergens from the intestine into the systemic circulation. Among the gastrointestinal decontamination methods is the use of activated charcoal. In this article, we present four patients who developed anaphylaxis due to drug and food intake and were administered oral activated charcoal after their primary treatment (on average, 15-45 minutes after the first presentation) was completed. The youngest of the patients was 22 years old, and the oldest was 40. No side effects, prolonged anaphylactic state, and biphasic reactions were observed in the follow-up of the patients. All patients were discharged after 48-72 hours of hospitalization. The routine approach to poisoning treatment includes patient stabilization, toxidrome recognition, antidote administration, and supportive care, as well as measures to enhance toxin elimination. In anaphylaxis caused by oral allergens, the substance that initiates the reaction can be compared to a kind of toxin. Eliminating the allergen and reducing its absorption could be achieved by administering activated charcoal. Activated charcoal should be considered adjunctive therapy in treating food and oral drug-induced anaphylaxis. This treatment, when administered in a timely manner, might prevent the development of biphasic reactions and the prolongation of the allergic process in anaphylaxis.",

      "abstract": "<b><i>Introduction:</i></b> Doxycycline is highly effective, inexpensive with a broad therapeutic spectrum and exceptional bioavailability. However these benefits have been overshadowed by its classification alongside the tetracyclines – class D drugs, contraindicated in pregnancy and in children under 8 years of age. Doxycycline-treatable diseases are emerging as leading causes of undifferentiated febrile illness in Southeast Asia. For example scrub typhus and murine typhus have an unusually severe impact on pregnancy outcomes, and current mortality rates for scrub typhus reach 12-13% in India and Thailand. The emerging evidence for these important doxycycline-treatable diseases prompted us to revisit doxycycline usage in pregnancy and childhood. <b><i>Areas Covered:</i></b> A systematic review of the available literature on doxycycline use in pregnant women and children revealed a safety profile of doxycycline that differed significantly from that of tetracycline; no correlation between the use of doxycycline and teratogenic effects during pregnancy or dental staining in children was found. <b><i>Expert Opinion:</i></b> The change of the US FDA pregnancy classification scheme to an evidence-based approach will enable adequate evaluation of doxycycline in common tropical illnesses and in vulnerable populations in clinical treatment trials, dosage-optimization pharmacokinetic studies and for the empirical treatment of undifferentiated febrile illnesses, especially in pregnant women and children.",

They have the positive anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, hemostatic, healing and analgesic effects; they are not inferior in efficiency of synthetic drugs. At the same time they are safe, accessible and affordable, which is important for the elderly and senile age. In this paper a comparative characterization of the state of oral hygiene and denture in elderly patients with complete and partial loss of teeth is presented. Despite the high clinical and laboratory findings, the prepared tools are often not available for this group of patients for financial reasons. As result these patients not undertake any hygienic measures. The proposed hygienic means for rinsing the oral cavity and treatment dentures have low cost, available for most patients and have a high clinical efficacy, it is confirmed by microbiological methods.",

      "title": "The Effects of Clomiphene in Impotence a Clinical and Endocrine Study",
      "abstract": "Hormone treatment for impotence and impotentia ejaculandi (delayed or absent ejaculation in the presence of normal erections and desire) (Johnson, 1965) is based on two assumptions: namely—that (1) potency in the male is androgen dependent and (2) impotency is due to relative androgen deficiency (Miller, 1968; Margolis et al. , 1967; Sobotka, 1969). The synthetic preparations most frequently used are methyl testosterone, various esters, including the propionate, deconate, enanthate, etc. (Tuthill, 1955; Kupperman, 1967) and more recently a number of testosterone- ‘aphrodisiac’ combinations (Margolis et al. , 1967; Cooper et al. , 1971, etc.). Despite some claims of therapeutic success for the various regimes, the administration of exogenous hormones has several pharmacologic disadvantages. For instance methyl testosterone, which has to be taken sublingually or bucally, may be associated with severe toxic effects such as cholestatic jaundice, etc. (Goodman and Gilman, 1965). Parenterally administered testosterone esters, although less toxic and more certainly absorbed than methyl testosterone, have all the drawbacks of the intramuscular route; also their rate(s) of tissue release may not be optimal for metabolism. Additionally, all these synthetic compounds may inhibit endogenous testosterone formation and spermatogenesis by suppressing pituitary gonadotrophins. Long term administration may result in Leydig cell inactivity and even disuse atrophy. Recently Harkness et al. (1964, 1968) have observed that clomiphene (Fig. 1), a non-steroid triethylene derivative which in females stimulates the anovulatory ovary to secrete oestrogens (Bishop, 1970), significantly raised the levels of urinary steroid metabolites, including testosterone, in a proportion of ‘normal’ and corticosteroid deficient males. This unexpected testosterone elevating effect suggested its possible ‘experimental’ use as an alternative drug treatment in impotence. Accordingly a limited pilot study on five ‘primary’ (non-organic) impotent males was conducted: its main aims were (a) to assess the potential clinical utility of the drug and (b) to study its effects on the ‘pituitary-testes-axis' as reflected by plasma testosterone levels.",

Before the development of the Romansky formula (pencillin in oil and beeswax) in 1944, only short-acting aqueous preparations were available. These had to be given every three hours. However, with the development of the Romansky formula and the later use of procaine penicillin G in oil and in water, it became possible to maintain fairly effective blood levels for 24 hours with a single 300,000-unit injection. A recent advance in the synthesis of long-acting penicillin is the development of an insoluble salt, N,N<sup>1</sup>-dibenzylethylenediamine dipenicillin G (benzathine penicillin G), which is considerably more insoluble than procaine penicillin. A single injection of 600,000 units has been shown to produce a peak of slightly more than 0.1 units per",

It is extensively used for premedication and procedural sedation in both adults and children.\r\n\r\nIn comparison to other benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine drugs, midazolam is equally or more effective for premedication/preoperative sedation. No evidence exists that premedication with midazolam prolongs discharge time from hospital. Its efficacy and safety have been extensively studied in both adults and children. This contrasts its comparator drug, diazepam for which data in children and elderly are scarce or lacking. \r\nMidazolam is also effective for procedural sedation as a single drug or in combination with an opioid. As a single drug, adequate sedation for procedures in the emergency room, is achieved in over 90% of all procedures. Comparative efficacy was shown for propofol. Data are insufficient to determine comparative efficacy for procedural sedation for other drugs. \r\n\r\nWhen administered with the appropriate precautions, e.g. titration to effect, adequate monitoring and personnel to support ventilation, midazolam is very safe. No major adverse events were seen in 847 adults who received midazolam for procedural sedation. Also, adverse effects can be antagonized with an effective antagonist, flumazenil.\r\n\r\nAs midazolam is off-patent, drug costs are relatively low. Drug costs per procedure range from approximately 0.15 US$ to 2.6 US$ in an adult, depending on dose and country, with significantly lower costs in developing countries.",

      "abstract": "Tetracycline derivatives are antibiotics such as minocycline and doxycycline that have been commonly utilized for inflammatory dermatological conditions such as acne and rosacea. Hyperpigmentation of the skin, nails, thyroid, oral mucosa, teeth, and bones is a known but rare side effect of prolonged tetracycline use. The hyperpigmentation typically takes months to years to develop. There may also be residual changes to the skin after discontinuation of the medication. For this reason, the time tetracyclines are used should be minimized and patients should be monitored for the skin findings. Subungual discoloration carries a broad differential including infectious, inflammatory, metabolic, malignant or systemic diseases. Knowledge of this side effect is crucial in order to avoid unnecessary testing in determining the etiology of the subungual discoloration. We report on a case of a patient who has been on long-term minocycline use for adult acne management. He was initially on minocycline for six years, but due to minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation of his ears and fingernails, he had switched to doxycycline. One year later, the skin hyperpigmentation of the ears regressed; however, the blue subungual hyperpigmentation of his hands progressively become more prominent without any other significant symptoms.",

The principal treatment is represented by administration of a medication as needed.Areas covered: In the last years several short onset delivery systems have been developed. In comparison with oral opioids that often do not fit the typical pattern of a BTcP event, fentanyl products have been shown to produce an analgesic effect within 5–15 min after administration and a duration of about 2 h. These characteristics make these products indicated for BTcP, although concerns have been raised regarding the costs. The choice of the dose is controversial with regulatory studies suggesting the need to titrate the dose, and common clinical sense that suggests to use doses proportional to the basal opioid regimen.Expert commentary: The treatment of BTcP should depend on its characteristics. Pharmacokinetics of oral opioids indicate a late analgesic effect that in most cases is not overlapping the temporal pattern of BTcP, unless in determined circumstances. Dosing of fentanyl products is still matter of controversies.",

Scopolamine and other cholinergic blocking agents have long been known to produce bothersome adverse effects such as mydriasis, dry mouth, drowsiness, urinary retention, constipation, and a toxic psychosis manifested as delirium, hallucinations, restlessness, and excitability. For this reason, scopolamine, despite its superior efficacy in preventing motion sickness, has been little used in comparison with the antiemetic antihistamines.

      "title": "Complementary Mode of Action of Rosiglitazone and Metformin in a Single Tablet for the Treatment of Diabetes mellitus Type 2",
      "abstract": "As multi-drug preparations have come past the era of intuitive composition, their value is increasingly recognized. Improved treatment compliance is an accepted advantage, in particular in diseases without overt distress such as earlier-stage diabetes mellitus, type 2, but does not suffice for market authorization. For preparations composed of more than one active substance, the prevailing guidelines rule that each constituent must contribute to efficacy (or improve tolerability); effective and safe doses must be used and pharmacokinetic interactions between the active ingredients must be excluded or clearly defined. In the typical case, the combination must demonstrate enhanced efficacy, with a largely unchanged risk profile, or improvement of tolerability at constant efficiency. These requirements are convincingly met with a recently registered drug, Avandamet®, which is metformin HCl (CAS 1115-70-4) and a thiazolidinedione, rosiglitazone maleate (CAS 155141-29-0), in one tablet. By complementary actions, the two components cover both hepatic and peripheral sites of action to restitute insulin sensitivity. Acting on a variety of targets, rosiglitazone is able to overcome insulin resistance in patients with insufficient response to maximally dosed metformin. For example, adding rosiglitazone (8 mg/day) to an ongoing treatment with metformin (2.5 g/day) resulted in a drop of glycosylated hemoglobin by 1.2 %. Pharmacokinetics of the two constituents fall into the same range and are not altered by coadministration (range 3.4-4.3 h). As the tolerability profiles of the two drugs show little overlap, the drug combination is well tolerated; the risk of hypoglycemia is low (less than 3 %) and precautions and contraindications are largely those of the active ingredients. In sum, the combination of metformin and rosiglitazone in a single tablet displays an improved benefit/risk ratio with regard to its constituents. It is indicated for type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, particularly overweight patients, who are unable to achieve sufficient glycemic control at their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone.",

Erdtman synthetized isogramine and found it to have weak anesthetic properties. He then together with Löfgren synthetized other amino‐amides, but no one of them could compete with the existing local anesthetics of the ester‐type, derivatives of para‐aminobenzoic acid, e.g. procaine. Later Löfgren and Lundqvist followed up these studies and found an amid compound lidocaine (2‐dimethylaminoacet2, 6‐xylidide). Lidocaine represented such a significant advance over procaine in clinical tests preformed by T. Gordh that it was introduced for clinical use. It has now during a half century been the standard local anesthetic drug. All local anesthetics are neurotoxic in high enough doses. Xylocain ®, however, has had an excellent record of safety. Only during the last years have there been reports on possible toxic irritation and damage by Xylocain used for spinal anesthesia. The aetiology is still not clear. In this connection two early observations by Gordh and his coworkers are discussed.",

      "title": "Oral contraceptives and drug interactions. Patient guide.",
      "abstract": "The author responds to questions about drug interactions with oral contraceptives (OC). Method failure can be caused by interactions between such contraceptives and other drugs, although the majority of OC failures involve factors in addition to drug interaction. The chance that even a significant drug interaction will lead to pregnancy remains under 5%. Drug interactions with OCs are, however, most frequently associated with anti-infective and anticonvulsant medications. Although the mechanisms behind such interactions remain a mystery, the resulting decreased effectiveness of OCs is thought to be related to the combined effects of the drugs on the liver enzymes and on the bacteria which normally live in the intestines. The author discusses how Rifampin, Griseofulvin, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Butabarbital, Carbamazepine, Ethosuximide, Mephobarbital, Ampicillin, Tetracycline, antihypertensives, theophylline, and caffeine may adversely affect the OC user. Anticoagulants such as heparin, aminocaproic acid, and troleandomycin should probably not be used at all with OCs. Regarding the alteration of drug dosages when used concurrently with OCs, dosages of imipramine, insulin, diazepam, and chlordiazepoxide may need to be decreased because of the tendency of estrogen to reduce liver activity, while some diabetics may need to increase their dosage of insulin. There are no symptoms which would necessarily indicate a possible drug interaction involving OCs, so it is strongly recommended that individuals tell their physicians and dentists that they are using OCs.",

Mothers taking anticoagulants should not breastfeed because of potential life-threatening hemorrhages in nursing infants. The level of antibiotics in maternal milk is generally so low as to be innocuous. However, the possibility of later allergic reaction in the infant should be considered. Levels of chloramphenicol, erythromycin, naladixic acid, nitrofurantoin, penicillin, streptomycin, and sulfonamides are so low as to be of little significance; however, metronidazole is excreted in breast milk and its effects on newborns are unknown at present; this drug is therefore contraindicated in nursing mothers. No effect on a nursing infant is found with maternal ingestion of alcohol, chlorpromazine, propoxyphene hydrochloride, and diphenylhydantoin; however, codeine, heroin, and morphine, although difficult to find in milk, may cause infant withdrawal symptoms. Phenobarbital and primidone are contraindicated. Oral contraceptives decrease lactation, but transfer effect is unknown. Theouracil is one of the few drugs that is found in higher amounts in mother's milk than in serum. Minute amounts of radioactive products, steroids, anticoagulants, and antineoplastics can cause profound infant effects, and nursing mothers should discontinue nursing if these medications are necessary.",

      "title": "Off-label Use of Antibiotics in Pediatrics",
      "abstract": "Off-label Use O f antibiOtics i n PediatricsAntibiotics are the most commonly prescribed drugs in children and off-label prescription is very common due to various reasons like prescribing for a younger age, prescribing off-label doses, and prescribing at an off-label frequency of drug administration. 7hough few antibiotics have been labeled for use in pediatric patients, many others such as fluoroquinolones, azithromycin, linezolid, or daptomycin are still being prescribed in an off-label manner. 8,9This raises concern in the light of emerging multidrugresistant pathogens.In NICUs, 10-13 around 50% of antibiotic use is off-label, unlicensed use was 11.6 and 78% of off-label use are due to prescriptions outside recommended dose-usually at a higher than recommended dose to ensure efficacy regardless of safety concerns.Another off-label use is for off-label indications and dosing intervals.In the newborn, the most common off-label drugs prescribed were ampicillin and gentamicin.The other antibiotics implicated were cefotaxime, vancomycin, and amikacin.In children, 10,14,15 off-label antibiotic use ranged from 20 to 70% in various studies; off-label dosing was around 20-25% for ceftriaxone and vancomycin in the treatment of LRTI, meningitis, and sepsis, 21-24% for off-label indication while prescribing cefotaxime and cef triaxone for surgical prophylaxis and meningitis. 10Highest off-label use of antibiotics was in children aged <2 years 14,15 and when a child needed in-patient treatment for 6-10 days. 15Overuse of IV antibiotics, antibiotics for URTI, and intrOdUctiOnThe objective of the drug regulatory authority is to ensure that medicinal products which are manufactured in India or imported, are of acceptable quality, safety, and efficacy.The Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) heads the Central Drug Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), which approves and regulates the devices and drugs marketed in India.The drug is finally, on approval, labeled with inserts (i.e., drug monograph), specifying the details for the drug use (i.e., target population, dose, indication, specific use). 1 \"Off-label\" use refers to 2 the use of a drug that is either not included in the package insert for that drug, not recommended for a particular age, route of administration or duration, and/or not detailed in the BNF for children (BNFc) 3 and/or IAP Drug Formulary (IAPDF). 4Very recent changes in recommendations or guidelines may also amount to \"off-label\" use.However, the absence of labeling for a specific age group or a specific disorder, due to lack of pediatric data, does not necessarily mean that the drug's use is improper for that age or disorder. 5Guidelines as in BNFc or IAPDF do not regulate the use of drugs.Therapeutic decision-making is guided by the best available evidence and the importance of the benefit for the individual patient.Many of the antibiotics currently used in the pediatric age group lack documentation regarding dosage, efficacy, and safety due to practical difficulties in performing gold standard clinical trials in this age group.It is bizarre logic, however, to argue that studies in neonates and children are deferred to protect them, only to increase the risks of medicating without proper evidence. 6Off-label use of antibiotics, and publication of data of such use, in neonates, children, and adolescents, is acceptable if it is in the best interest of the child.The article will try to advise involving the use of unlicensed antibiotics or licensed antibiotics for unlicensed uses (\"off-label\" use).Such advice reflects careful consideration of the options available to manage a given condition and the weight of evidence and experience of unlicensed intervention in treating bacterial infectious disease in neonates and children.However, limitations of the marketing authorization should not preclude unlicensed use where clinically appropriate.",

Metoclopramide enhances the rate of gastric emptying by (1) augmenting esophageal peristalsis, gastric antral contractions, and small intestine transit time and (2) increasing resting pressures of the lower esophageal and pyloric sphincters. The drug does not stimulate gastric acid secretions. The injectable form is approved for use to facilitate intubation of the small intestine and the passage of barium into the intestine for radiographic procedures. Tablets are approved for the treatment of symptoms associated with diabetic gastroparesis. The drug has been used in the treatment of vomiting of various etiologies. The side effects of metoclopramide are usually mild, transient, and reversible with discontinuation of the drug. They include drowsiness, GI disturbances, extrapyramidal reactions, and increased lactation. Metoclopramide should not be given in combination with MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, sympathomimetic amines, or to patients with pheochromocytoma, GI hemorrhage, obstruction, or perforation. Metoclopramide appears to be an effective drug in stimulating the mobility of the upper gastrointestinal tract without increasing gastric secretions. Further studies are needed to assess its value in the treatment of vomiting secondary to anesthesia and chemotherapy, and to assess its precise role in the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis.",

      "title": "Enoxacin: a new fluoroquinolone.",
      "abstract": "The chemistry, mechanisms of action and resistance, pharmacokinetics, antimicrobial spectrum, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and drug interactions of enoxacin are reviewed. Enoxacin is a new fluoroquinolone compound structurally related to nalidixic acid. Its antimicrobial spectrum and activity are comparable to those of the fluoroquinolones norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. It has a broad spectrum of activity against gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms, but like the other fluoroquinolones it is less active against gram-positive micro-organisms. Anaerobic organisms are generally resistant to enoxacin. It is rapidly and nearly completely absorbed after oral administration and is distributed widely in body fluids and tissues. The drug is predominantly excreted via the kidney, with a relatively long serum elimination half-life of approximately five hours. Serum and urinary concentration of enoxacin exceed the minimum inhibitory concentrations for most gram-negative and many gram-positive pathogens. Clinical trials have shown enoxacin to be effective for the treatment of gonorrhea, cystitis, complicated urinary-tract infections, and skin and skin structure infections. There is some evidence that enoxacin may be useful for treatment of lower-respiratory-tract infections and ear, nose, and throat infections. The most commonly reported adverse effects are mild gastrointestinal and central nervous system symptoms. Concomitant enoxacin and theophylline therapy has been associated with toxic serum concentrations of theophylline. Interactions have also been reported with caffeine, antacids, cimetidine, warfarin, and fenbufen. Enoxacin (Comprecin, Parke-Davis/Warner-Lambert) will be available in 200-, 300-, and 400-mg tablets for oral administration. Enoxacin is usually taken twice daily. A single 400-mg dose is effective therapy for uncomplicated gonorrhea. Since enoxacin, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin have many similar properties, formulary decisions involving these agents should be based on the individual institution's need to treat certain types of infections and pathogenic organisms. Enoxacin has been shown to be an effective agent for the treatment of urinary-tract, genital-tract, and skin and soft-tissue infections, including those that currently require injectable antimicrobial agents or that are resistant to conventional therapy.",

      "title": "An Analytical study of the Ocular Effects in Patients on Long Term Corticosteroids",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nCorticosteroids (CS) are the most important class of anti-inflammatory drugs, used frequently. The therapeutic outcome of corticosteroids have been known and are employed for more than 65 years. Though the major advancement in discovering the hidden molecular mechanisms has been made in the last 20-25 years. The use of corticosteroids for their highly potent action was at its peak during the 1960s and 1970s and ineluctably they were used inappropriately and uncritically, when the untoward effects became apparent and a stage to think about their lavish use in all forms arrived. \r\nAdverse effects ranging from acne to intestinal perforation and adrenal crisis has been documented. Both short term or long-term corticosteroids use has their own side-effects involving major systems of the body. Potency, dose, duration, frequency and form of the drug used in various routes also contributes to the manifestation of adverse effects. Corticosteroids treatment brought adverse events of such a proportion that the upcoming major group of anti-inflammatory drugs, were named as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Corticosteroids were voted by the American Contact Dermatitis Society as “Allergen of the year” in 2005.\r\nEven today, they are the established therapy for reducing inflammation and immune activation in numerous disease conditions like asthma, rheumatoid, vascular, allergic, collagen, inflammatory bowel, dermatological, ocular and other systemic diseases and also in allotransplantation. Their utilization has leaping up continuously in recent years as their therapeutic effects are indispensable and had made marvels in managing certain disease conditions in spite of their adverse effects. For appropriate use of corticosteroids, a basic knowledge of pharmacology, clinical usage guidelines and adverse effects are essential. In this study, the prevalence of various ocular manifestation in patients on long term corticosteroids in multiple routes of administration had been analysed.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY: \r\nTo analyse the ocular effects of long term use of corticosteroids by various routes of administration for several disorders treated in a tertiary care hospital. \r\nOBJECTIVES: \r\n1. To study the prevalence of the ocular effects of long term use of corticosteroids in various diseases.\r\n2. To emphasis the importance of regular ocular examination for the patients on long term steroid therapy. \r\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: \r\nA cross-sectional study involving 230 patients on long-term use of corticosteroids for various disorders attending eye op within our inclusion criteria were evaluated for any ocular manifestations in the department of Ophthalmology in a tertiary medical college hospital for a period of one year from Jan-2017 to Dec-2017. \r\nOBSERVATION AND RESULTS: \r\nOverall 50.4% (n=116) of the study group found with lens opacities, 39.1% (n=90) had elevated IOP, 6.5% (n=15) had elevated IOP with disc and visual field defects and 1.7% (n=4) had CSCR. The prevalence of lens opacities showed significant association with all routes of steroid intake, duration of the therapy and dose of the drug. The prevalence of elevated IOP showed significant association with the dosage of topical, topical with sub-tenon and inhalational steroids and no significance with oral and external steroids dose. But duration of therapy was significantly associated with elevated IOP prevalence. \r\nCONCLUSION: \r\nProlong use of corticosteroids in any form with increase in dose raised the prevalence of ocular adverse effects. Pre-treatment documentation of baseline values and intermittent re-evaluation for side effects has to be intensified since the prevalence of adverse effects are found to be in significant numbers.",

      "title": "Foreseeable Advantages and Limits of Buprenorphine-Naloxone Association",
      "abstract": "Drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing disease that results from the prolonged effects of drugs on the brain. Opioid dependence is a worldwide problem. In opioid-dependent humans, buprenorphine is an effective treatment alternative to methadone (1,2) and levomethadyl acetate hydrochloride (3).The pharmacological profile of buprenorphine results in greater safety, less physical dependence, and greater flexibility in dose scheduling. However, abuse of buprenorphine has been reported in many countries where it is available as an analgesic (4) and in France (5), where it is available as an opiate-analgesic for drug substitution and maintenance. Despite the partial agonist activity of buprenorphine at µ opioid receptors and its “ceiling effect”, some cases of respiratory depression and fatalities have been reported, especially in cases of high doses of intravenously injected buprenorphine. The buprenorphine/naloxone (BupNx) combination tablet capitalizes on the differential absorption of naloxone by the sublingual (sl) vs parenteral routes: naloxone has a poor sl absorption. BupNx combination has been investigated with the goal of decreasing abuse, misuse, and diversion of buprenorphine. The BupNx combination product may be interesting for use in primary care office-based settings as a safe and an effective treatment that is likely to increase the availability of agonist treatment for opioid dependence. Availability of buprenorphine and BupNx tablets in United States has been slowed by the desire to provide them outside the traditional, highly regulated methadone clinic system. The Controlled Substances Act was amended in October 2000 and allows office-based prescribing of schedule III, IV, and V medications (and combination of medications) approved for opioid dependence and detoxification.",

The effectiveness of various analgesics and antiarthritic protaglandin inhibiting drugs in treating dysmenorrhea is reviewed. Several clinical trials indicate that ibuprofen and mefenamic acid are more effective in reducing mild and moderate dysmenorrhea than aspirin. Side effects associated with ibuprofen use included gastrointestional and visual disturbances, and those associated with mefenamic acid were gastrointestional and hematological toxicity. Some anti-inflammatory drugs used to treat arthritis also inhibit prostaglandin production and have been evaluated in terms of their effectiveness in treating dysmenorrhea. Clinical trials of indomethacin and naproxen indicate these drugs to provide relief from dysmenorrhea. A number of negative side effects are associated with prolonged use of indomethacin. Naproxen is not currently available in the United States. Some physicians have found that administering prostaglandin drugs prior to the onset of menstruation enhances their effectiveness. Other physicians advise against this practice and administer the drugs only after menstruation begins in order to rule out the possibility of pregnancy. The effect of these drugs on the fetus is unknown. Larger clinical trials and studies of the long term effects of using these drugs are needed.",

      "abstract": "Dear Editor,\r\n\r\nThe article by Mogadam et al. (1) regarding the comparison of analgesic effect of gabapentin and diclofenac on pain after tonsillectomy was interesting, as it explained the comparison of analgesic efficacy results of preoperative gabapentin and diclofenac administration on postoperative pain in tonsillectomy. However, it is noted that one of the main factors which influences the rate of drug absorption is the route of administration. Absorption of the same molecule, taken at the same dose, by the same patient, but under a different administration route or a different dosage form (e.g. capsule or suppository) will not have the same kinetics of absorption, nor the same bioavailability. Therapeutic efficacy can only be achieved after the absorption of the active drug. In rectal administration, in general, it usually takes 5-30 minutes for the drug to be absorbed from rectum, whereas capsules must be first dissolved so as to release the drug powder. The effect of orally administered drugs is largely dependent on the rate of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and absorption of drug takes place the whole length of the gastrointestinal tract (2). The authors mentioned the results of Biyik et al.’s paper and reported that both gabapentin and diclofenac had an effect on postoperative pain and in which gabapentin’s analgesic effect is found longer (3). I want to remind Mogadam et al. that in this study both gabapentin and diclofenac were administered in the same route; orally, so their effect was comparable. In my opinion, examination of two variables (different administration routes and two different active ingredients) at the same time makes the experimental design of the study difficult to compare. It may be of more interest examining the analgesic effect of gabapentin and diclofenac’s rectal administration on post-operative pain in patients undergoing tonsillectomy.",

      "abstract": "Epinephrine (adrenaline) is universally recommended as the initial drug of choice for the treatment of anaphylaxis. No other medication has similar life-saving pharmacologic effects in multiple organ systems, including prevention and relief of both upper and lower airway obstruction, and of shock. Failure to inject epinephrine promptly contributes to anaphylaxis fatalities. It is most effective when given immediately after the onset of anaphylaxis symptoms. The initial recommended adult dose is 0.3-0.5 mg, injected intramuscularly in the anterolateral aspect of the mid-thigh. Injected by other routes, epinephrine appears to have a less satisfactory therapeutic window; for example, onset of action is potentially delayed when it is injected subcutaneously, and risk of adverse effects potentially increases when it is injected intravenously. The possibility of randomized, controlled trials of epinephrine in anaphylaxis should be considered. For ethical reasons, these trials will not be placebo-controlled. They might involve comparison of one epinephrine dose versus another, or one route of epinephrine administration versus another. For first-aid treatment of people with anaphylaxis in the community, novel epinephrine formulations are being developed. These include epinephrine autoinjectors that are safer and easier to use, and epinephrine formulations that can be administered through non-invasive routes.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Studies of the therapeutic efficacy and indications for the use of histamine (H2)‐receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in children are reviewed. In adequate dosages, both ranitidine and cimetidine reduce acid output and increase intragastric pH, and H2RAs have been shown to be effective in the treatment of acid‐peptic disease. Ranitidine is a more potent drug with a longer duration of action than cimetidine and thus requires less frequent administration. Dosage requirements vary according to age and clinical condition, and children require a relatively higher drug dosage (mg/kg) than adults. There is insufficient information on the long‐term paediatric use of famotidine to validate its use in children, and the endocrinological side effects associated with cimetidine therapy in adults essentially preclude its long‐term use in children. It is suggested that ranitidine administration is safe and effective in children with acid‐peptic disease and should be considered as first‐line treatment for children with severe oesophagitis or peptic ulceration and for the prophylaxis of stress ulceration and aspiration pneumonitis.",

      "abstract": "Most of the drugs in the treatment of functional disorders of the urinary bladder has a peripheral effect. Their work consists mainly in reducing detrusor contractility of the bladder, or effects on the afferent innervation. Anticholinergics are the first drugs of choice. An alternative pharmacological treatment is to eliminate the overactivity by acting on the bladder afferent innervation, while not inhibiting its contractility. One option is to modulate the pharmacological activity of sensory mechanisms governing the functioning of the bladder via the vanilloid receptor (TRPV1) and ancyrin (TRPA1). Intravesical treatment with capsaicin or lidocaine only partially reduces bladder sensation. Furthermore, clinical use of lidocaine in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) is reduced to intravesical supply before capsaicin instillation to reduce the symptoms associated with initial phase of C-fibres sensitization. This paper presents the current state of knowledge regarding the use of capsaicin and lidocaine in functional disorders of the urinary bladder, as well as discusses the impact of these substances on afferent C-fibres and the activity of the urinary bladder. Based on previous studies intravesical capsaicin and lidocaine therapy is one of the alternative treatment options in selected patients with functional disorders of the urinary bladder (in particular OAB) in addition to standard anticholinergics therapy or the newer generation of therapies using botulinum toxin.",

      "abstract": "The rising incidence of methicillin-resistant staphylococci and resistant enterococci in recent years has led to increased use of vancomycin as an active combatant in the treatment of gram-positive infections. Teicoplanin is an investigational glycopeptide that shares a similar spectrum of activity with vancomycin and appears to have similar efficacy. Teicoplanin offers several theoretical advantages compared with vancomycin including once-daily dosing, fewer side effects, and the option for intramuscular administration. While these may be perceived as substantial advances in the glycopeptide class of antibiotics, teicoplanin will probably not replace the now generically available vancomycin on hospital formularies. If competitively priced as a once-daily dosing regimen, teicoplanin will likely gain initial acceptance as an alternative in patients with an intolerance to vancomycin infusion-related side effects or in patients placed on combination aminoglycoside therapy for extended periods of treatment, as an intramuscular antibiotic in patients with poor venous access, and for routine antibiotic prophylaxis where protection from resistant gram-positive pathogens is important. The use of teicoplanin in the hospital may become more widespread as its side effect profile and economic advantages of less frequent dosing compared with vancomycin become better understood.",

Duloxetine is a selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin and norepinephrine uptake which increases urethral striated muscle activity and bladder capacity. Duloxetine is readily absorbed and extensively metabolized; cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) inhibiting drugs can markedly increase duloxetine exposure. The clinical efficacy of duloxetine has consistently been demonstrated in several randomized, double-blind studies in women with moderate-to-severe stress urinary incontinence, but the additional benefit relative to placebo was moderate. Duloxetine treatment is frequently associated with adverse events such as nausea, dry mouth, fatigue, insomnia and constipation, but serious adverse events are rare. Therefore, duloxetine appears suitable for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence.",

      "abstract": "While it is unreasonable to expect emergency physicians to have detailed knowledge of the constituents of all commercial products, there are some products they should know. Creolin is one of these. Creolin is a commercially available disinfectant that contains phenol in a concentration of 26%. Also known as carbolic acid, phenol is a corrosive material that can cause skin burns in concentrations as low as 1% to 2 %. Exposure to Creolin is of concern based on the percentage of phenol contained in the product. Once a common ingestant in suicide attempts, phenol ingestions are not common today. The most serious potential side effects are central nervous system and respiratory depression, often with a rapid onset (within 20 minutes). Coma may occur within 20 minutes of ingestion. When Creolin ingestion is probable, the patient often will require hospital admission for observation. Successful treatment generally involves supportive care. Skin exposure, especially in this toddler, is concerning. The literature suggests that using water to decontaminate may actually increase the systemic absorption of phenol through the skin. While this is controversial, many recommend the use of polyethylene glycol to decontaminate the skin.FigureWhile most phenol ingestions and exposures prove benign, when Creolin is involved, the clinician should be aware that a substantial percentage of phenol is involved. In these cases, caution is required, especially in pediatric patients. Patients need to be disrobed and decontaminated thoroughly. Hospital admission should be considered if ingestion is probable.",

      "abstract": "Dry eye is a multifactorial disease of the tears and the ocular surface that manifests with a wide variety of signs and symptoms. It is prevalent in about 33% of the population worldwide. Due to the importance of the pathology, new tests, drugs and technologies have been developed to assist the diagnosis, management and follow-up of the disease. Current available therapies try to alleviate symptoms and to reduce signs in order to restore the ocular surface. Depending on the etiology of the pathology it is possible to use lubricants, secretagogues, biological tear substitutes or antiinflammatory drugs, either independently or combined. Nowadays, the therapies under clinical trial are devoted to stimulating tear components (e.g., diquafosol, a P2Y receptor agonist), or mucin secretion (e.g., rebamipide, an amino acid analogue of quinolinone). Others include gefarnate, a water-insoluble terpene fatty acid that contributes to restoring mucins on the ocular surface, or cevimeline, an oral cholinergic agonist that reduces the symptoms associated with dry eye. Other potential compounds described in patents are in a lower phase of drug development. These compounds come from different families of therapies, and among others, can be found in the form of steroidal and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, vitamins A and D, neurotransmitters and neuropeptides.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDA pure s-enantiomer of bupivacaine known as levobupivacaine, is now considered a safer alternative for regional anaesthesia than a racemic solution, bupivacaine since it is as efficacious as bupivacaine, but with better pharmacokinetics.Levobupivacaine is clinically tolerated well in cases requiring regional anaesthesia with both bolus administration and post-operative infusion.There are very few incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) if administration is monitored appropriately as most ADRs are due to mistakes causing systemic exposure of drug.Hypersensitivity reaction to drug or pharmacological effects of anaesthesia though rare can also cause ADRs. 1 Lidocaine (Xylocaine), is available commonly in a 0.5 % or 1 % solution, though several more concentrations are available.It is the most commonly used infiltrative amide anaesthetic.Higher concentrations show no difference in pharmacodynamics but may increase the risk of toxicity. 2The duration of action may be increased by addition of epinephrine.It can be added in concentrations of 1:100,000 or 1:200,000.This is seen to increase the maximum dose of drug and also reduces blood loss. 3ecent studies have found this combination to be safe to use in nose, ears, fingers and toes. METHODSA randomized comparative study was carried out in a tertiary care teaching hospital, Karad.A total of 112 cases was enrolled in the study who were having chronic suppurative otitis media and who require surgical management by tympanoplasty.Cases with a previous history of ear surgery were excluded.The enrolled cases were classified into group I and group II alternatively and the group I cases were given levobupivacaine 0.5 % and group II were given lidocaine 2 %.Infiltration with local anaesthetic was given in post auricular region.Perioperative analgesics were not given.Post-operative pain was measured by using VAS score and comparison of both groups was done by the Mann Whitney U test. RESULTSLevobupivacaine (8.6 mL) and lidocaine (9.2 mL) used during tympanoplasty in cases were stable throughout the procedure and no post-operative complications were noticed.The mean time of analgesic requirement was 186.43 ± 91.04 minutes and 329.54 ± 135.82 minutes respectively in levobupivacaine group and lidocaine group.The mean quantity of analgesics used was 1.95 ± 1.01 tablets and 3.34 ± 1.10 tablets in the levobupivacaine and lidocaine groups respectively. CONCLUSIONSLevobupivacaine when used with a local anaesthetic in cases of tympanoplasty is a more effective analgesic post operatively when compared to lidocaine, thus increasing post-operative comfort.",

      "title": "Utilization of Intravenous Lidocaine Infusion for the Treatment of Refractory Chronic Pain",
      "abstract": "Context: Chronic pain accounts for one of the most common reasons patients seek medical care. The financial burden of chronic pain on health care is seen by direct financial cost and resource utilization. Many risk factors may contribute to chronic pain, but there is no definite risk. Managing chronic pain is a balance between maximally alleviating symptoms by utilizing a therapeutic regimen that is safe for long-term use. Currently, non-opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, and opioids are some of the medical treatment options, but these have numerous adverse effects and may not be the best option for long-term use. However, Lidocaine can achieve both central and peripheral analgesic effects with relatively few side effects, which may be an ideal compound for managing chronic pain. Evidence Acquisition: This is a Narrative Review. Results: Infusion of lidocaine (2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)acetamide), an amino-amide compound, is emerging as a promising option to fill the therapeutic void for treatment of chronic pain. Numerous studies have outlined dosing protocols for lidocaine infusion for the management of perioperative pain, outlined below. While there are slight variations in these different protocols, they all center around a similar dosing regimen to administer a bolus to reach a rapid steady state, followed by infusion for up to 72 hours to maintain the therapeutic analgesic effects. Conclusions: Lidocaine may be a promising pharmacologic solution with a low side effect profile that provides central and peripheral analgesia. Even though the multifaceted mechanism is not entirely understood yet, lidocaine may be a promising novel remedy in treating chronic pain in various conditions.",

Compared to aminoglycosides, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, rifampicin and other antibacterial chemotherapeutics, the overall toxicity of quinolones is relatively low. The questions of adverse effects upon the intestinal microflora and of tolerance of novel quinolones are also addressed. With regard to the above mentioned aspects, ofloxanice, ciprofloxacine, enoxacine, pefloxacine, norfloxacine, and fleroxacine have been most thoroughly studied.

      "abstract": "Summary: Studies of the therapeutic efficacy and indications for the use of histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) in children are reviewed. In adequate dosages, both ranitidine and cimetidine reduce acid output and increase intragastric pH, and H2RAs have been shown to be effective in the treatment of acid-peptic disease. Ranitidine is a more potent drug with a longer duration of action than cimetidine and thus requires less frequent administration. Dosage requirements vary according to age and clinical condition, and children require a relatively higher drug dosage (mg/kg) than adults. There is insufficient information on the long-term paediatric use of famotidine to validate its use in children, and the endocrinological side effects associated with cimetidine therapy in adults essentially preclude its long-term use in children. It is suggested that ranitidine administration is safe and effective in children with acid-peptic disease and should be considered as first-line treatment for children with severe oesophagitis or peptic ulceration and for the prophylaxis of stress ulceration and aspiration pneumonitis.",

Prescription of clomipramine during pregnancy should be restricted to specific cases and the doses should be kept as low as possible.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Ketamine was used for the first time in 1962 in Veterinary Medicine as an anesthetic and analgesic drug. For decades it was used as a narcotic substance, more widely known as “Special K”, i.e. a recreational drug. In recent years, the scientific community has focused on its remarkable and immediate therapeutic effect on depressed patients, who showed a remission of symptoms in a short period of time compared to antidepressant drugs. Purpose: The effectiveness of ketamine in psychiatric pharmaceutical therapy is investigated, even with the co-administration with other antidepressants. Methodology: The work is a literature review. The international literature was searched using the following keywords: psychiatric therapeutics, resistant depression, ketamine, esketamine. Results: In the treatment of major depression, the forms of ketamine administered are intravenous and inhaled. Intravenous is done with repeated injections at intervals to maintain the therapeutic effect and esketamine, the nasal spray, in the same way and for the same reason. Both forms have contraindications and side effects during their administration. The therapeutic benefit to the patient is weighed. Its effectiveness in psychiatric treatment has now been proven worldwide, mainly in mood disorders and in various pain conditions. Conclusions: Ketamine was used as an anesthetic in wars and surgeries. Its analgesic properties led to its use as a recreational drug. Today, it is a promising treatment for major depressive disorder, a disease that is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Its rapid action can also contribute to the prevention of suicide.",

Nine drugs (D-600, diltiazem, flunarizine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, nitrendipine, verapamil, tiapamil) were tested in experimental screening models of brain hypoxia, ischemia, cellular intoxication and against bicuculline-induced seizures. Three types of activity were found. Verapamil, D-600, tiapamil and diltiazem were almost inactive, possibly due to their poor brain penetration. The dihydropyridines had a broad spectrum of activity, but considerable differences between these compounds exist. They all were active against hypoxia and less active against ischemia. Out of this subgroup, only nicardipine protected against metabolic intoxication and nifedipine and nicardipine could block seizure components at very high doses. Flunarizine was the only compound with a dose-related effect in all the tests. These results suggested that this combination of screening tests could be used to find compounds with an interesting activity in the field of cerebral protection.",

The onset and symptoms of diseases such as asthma attacks, coronary infarction, angina pectoris, stroke and ventricular tachycardia are circadian phase dependent. In humans, variations during the 24 h day in pharmacokinetics (chronopharmacokinetics) have been shown for cardiovascularly active drugs (propranolol, nifedipine, verapamil, enalapril, isosorbide 5-mononitrate and digoxin), anti-asthmatics (theophylline and terbutaline), anticancer drugs, psychotropics, analgesics, local anaesthetics and antibiotics, to mention but a few. Even more drugs have been shown to display significant variations in their effects throughout the day (chronopharmacodynamics and chronotoxicology) even after chronic application or constant infusion. Moreover, there is clear evidence that even dose/concentration–response relationships can be significantly modified by the time of day. Thus, circadian time has to be taken into account as an important variable influencing a drug's pharmacokinetics and its effects or side-effects.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pirlindole, a tetracyclic drug, is known to have a reversible and short‐lived monoamineoxidase inhibitory activity. When administered after a supramaximal inhibitory dose of a classic monoamineoxidase inhibitor, pirlindole continues to antagonize reserpine‐induced ptosis and oxotremorine‐induced akinesia in mice. These results indicate that some central effects of pirlindole are partially independent of its monoamineoxidase inhibitor activity.",

      "abstract": "Green tobacco sickness occurs from transdermal absorption of chemicals from freshly harvested, green tobacco leaves. Signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, headache, and abdominal cramps. Prevalence has shifted from the United States and Europe to China, India, and Brazil. Worldwide 8 million individuals are afflicted, including women and children. Areas covered: Mecamylamine (Inversine®, Vecamyl®), a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist, should be tested as a remedy for green tobacco sickness. Mecamylamine is approved as an oral tablet for the treatment of hypertension, is safe, and is off-patent. Mecamylamine attenuates many of the effects of nicotine and tobacco including seizures, thereby supporting its use as an effective pharmacotherapy for tobacco dependence. Varenicline (Chantix®) and cytisine (Tabex®) are low efficacy (i.e. intrinsic activity) nAChR agonists, are used as smoking cessation aids, and are viable options to test as remedies against green tobacco sickness. Nicotine immunization strategies may provide further options for future testing. Expert commentary: Efforts to demonstrate reversal and/or prevention of green tobacco sickness by mecamylamine will underscore the importance of nicotine in this illness and highlight a new medication for effective treatment of tobacco poisoning.",

Several pharmacologic antagonists serve as essential drugs in the contemporary practices of sedation providers and anesthesiologists. Reversal or “antidote” drugs, such as flumazenil and naloxone, are often used in unintentional overdose situations involving significant benzodiazepine- and/or opioid-induced respiratory depression. Within the context of skeletal muscle relaxation, neostigmine and sugammadex are routinely used to reverse the effects of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. In addition, the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine is used in dentistry as a local anesthetic reversal agent, decreasing its duration of action by inducing vasodilation. This review article discusses the pharmacology, uses, practical implications, adverse effects, and precautions needed for flumazenil, naloxone, neostigmine, sugammadex, and phentolamine within the context of sedation and anesthesia practice for dentistry.",

Uniformly, such a client has been using heroin in addition to prescribed methadone. After heroin use stops (though methadone use continues), the disorder recedes.

We earlier proved clearly that the small doses of capsaicin (given orally in doses of nanogram to microgram / kg in animal experiments and 200 to 800 µg in human observations) prevents the aspirin, indomethacin (a mixed COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor)-induced gastrointestinal mucosal damage.Aims: 1.The development and pharmaceutically production of the planned production of new gastrointestinal mucosal protective drug (capsaicin alone and/or capsaicin in combination with different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for the use in human healthy beings and in patients.2. For the development and production of a new drug, we had to respect the following aspects: a. the knowledge of the chemical composition of natural origin capsaicin(oids); b. problems of the analytical measurements of capsaicin(oids) in the biological samples (in animals and humans); c. correct and complete preclinical dossier; d. correct dossier of acute and chronic toxicological studies with capsaicin (including the different tests) in two speciments of animal experiments; e. existence of a complete drug master file (DMF); f. the exclusion of pesticides, fusariums, aflatoxin and other toxicological agents (which are used during the plant cultivation in the different countries) from the capsaicin(oids) preparations used for drug production; g. to collect the necessary permissions from the different international and national authrorities before starting of pharmaceutical production of drug alone or in combinations; h.different pharmaceutical controlling measurements and other pharmaceutical aspects of planned drug or drug combinations (such as stability, drug preparation, different pharmaceutical technologies, etc.); i. preparation of different protocols for human human phase examinations (especially for human phase I.); j. to receive the permissions from the the different national authorities to carried out the prepared protocols before starting of the classical pharmacological studies; k. to gather the necessary numbers of experts from the very different scientific fields, who are able to solve all of above mentioned scientific, pharmaceutical, research problems (in animal experiments and in human observations); l. to find accredited institutes to perform human clinical pharmacological (phase) examinations.2.

      "abstract": "Significance: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one of the most widely prescribed drugs to treat inflammation and related ailments. In recent years, loading these drugs onto nanodevices like nanoparticles, nanofibers, etc. as a drug delivery system has gained momentum due to its desirable properties and advantages. The purpose of this review is to examine the existing research on the potential and novel use of nanofiber-assisted delivery of NSAIDs. Recent Advances: Electrospun nanofibers have recently garnered considerable attention from researchers in a variety of sectors. They have proved to be promising vehicles for drug delivery systems because of their exceptional and favorable features like prolonged drug release, controllable porosity, and high surface area. In this article, various polymers and even combinations of polymers loaded with single or multiple drugs were analyzed to achieve the desired drug release rates (burst, sustained, and biphasic) from the electrospun nanofibers. Critical Issues: The administration of these medications can induce major adverse effects, causing patients discomfort. Thus, encapsulating these drugs within electrospun nanofibers helps to reduce the severity of side effects while also providing additional benefits such as targeted and controlled drug release, reduced toxicity, and long-lasting effects of the drug with lower amounts of administration. Future Directions: This review covers previous research on the delivery of NSAIDs using electrospun nanofibers as the matrix. Also, this study intends to aid in the development of enhanced drug delivery systems for the treatment of inflammation and related issues.",

      "title": "Risperidone Augmentation of Clozapine",
      "abstract": "While effective as a single agent in a significant proportion of treatment refractory patients, clozapine is often used in combination with other medications, including classical neuroleptics (1), mood stabilizers and antidepressants (2), benzodiazepines (3) and lithium (4). In Denmark, where clozapine has been in near continuous use since 1975, up to 60 % of clozapine patients receive additional medication (4). Classical neuroleptics, often at antipsychotic levels, are the medications most frequently added, and are used in 30 - 35 % of patients receiving clozapine (4, 5). Clozapine, due to its low D2-blocking effect, may be therapeutically insufficient to contain symptoms and additional agents may be required (4). In controlled clinical trials risperidone has been shown to be superior to haloperidol (6), but has not yet been rigorously compared to clozapine. In light of its established efficacy and pharmacological profile (7) risperidone may be reasonably construed to be a medication with efficacy somewhere between clozapine and classical neuroleptics. As such, it may be especially well suited for use with clozapine as a part of an augmentation strategy. There are no reports in the literature describing the concurrent use of risperidone and clozapine. We present two cases demonstrating augmentation of clozapine's effects through combined use with clozapine.",

      "title": "The Control of Deviant Sexual Behaviour by Drugs",
      "abstract": "Drugs have been used to control deviant sexual behaviour in recidivist sexual offenders for over 20 years. Oestrogens have been most widely used (Golla and Hodge, 1949; Whittaker, 1959; Scott, 1964) and generally have been considered to be effective though limited by their side effects, in particular nausea, vomiting and feminization. A further uncommon but grave complication has been carcinoma of the breast (Symmers, 1968). Recently, oestradiol implants have been used (Field and Williams, 1970). A similar libido-reducing effect has been claimed with some tranquillizers, notably thioridazine (Litkey and Feniczy, 1967; Bartholomew, 1964), fluphenazine enanthate (Bartholomew, 1964) and a new butyrophenone, benperidol (Sterkmans and Geerts, 1966; Field, 1973). Progestogens have been recognized for some time as having libido reducing qualities in both males and females (Heller et al. , 1958; Kupperman, 1963; Money, 1970). The use of medroxyprogesterone in treating sexual deviants has recently been reported (Money, 1970); it was found not only to be effective in controlling behaviour but also to produce marked reduction in circulating androgen. Currently, much interest is being shown in the use of an anti-androgen, cyproterone acetate, for this purpose (Laschet and Laschet, 1969; Briggs and Briggs, 1971; Cooper et al. , 1972).",

The natural history of the disease is for stabilization or improvement in a third of patients for 6 months or more. Thus some agents that did not produce dramatic benefit may have been prematurely abandoned.

Headache induction was performed with sublingual Nitroglycerin (1.0 mg) and cocaine was employed for abortive purposes. Subjects were then instructed in a mode of self‐application of cocaine solution to their Sphenopalatine Foramen regions for abortion. Most patients can learn to abort most of their cluster headaches by application of cocaine solution to their Sphenopalatine Foramen region in from 15 seconds to three minutes. The risk of addiction is slight when employing 5 to 10% solution for the period of time that the typical cluster persists (4–12 weeks), and the benefits are great in cessation of the agonizing pain that accompanies this headache. Cocaine may be a valuable adjunctive abortive therapeutic measure in cluster headache when combined with a patient educational program. The rapidity of its effectiveness in some circumstances might suggest that the origin of much of the pain of cluster headache may be found in the Pterygomaxillary Fossa region.",

Se usa principalmente como anestésico local en forma de spray, siendo también utilizado como droga de abuso debido a sus efectos depresores sobre SNC. Presentación del caso: Varón de 18 años, ingresado en UCI tras precipitación a las vías del metro en contexto de intoxicación por cloretilo. Inicio del consumo de tóxicos durante la adolescencia: THC en un primer momento, posteriormente cocaína y en la actualidad cloruro de etilo y drogas de diseño. Dos intentos autolíticos previos, con un ingreso en centro para tratamiento de adicciones y posterior incorporación a Hospital de Día. A su ingreso en UCI inicialmente sedado, con fracturas faciales, vertebral y contusiones pulmonares. Familiares refieren recaída reciente en consumo de tóxicos (consumo diario de cloretilo), obteniendo la sustancia en máquinas expendedoras de productos sanitarios. Su estancia en UCI queda marcada por fluctuaciones del nivel de orientación, desinhibición conductual, conductas regresivas y episodios de agitación, que requieren tratamiento con neurolépticos. Tras lograr estabilización, es trasladado al hospital de referencia. Conclusiones: La literatura acerca de la neurotoxicidad del cloretilo es limitada, principalmente extraída de presentaciones de casos. La normalidad en las pruebas de imagen y laboratorio exige una elevada sospecha clínica. Se han descrito complicaciones derivadas de su uso como confusión, ataxia, alucinaciones, encefalopatía e incluso fallecimiento. Ante intoxicaciones graves, el tratamiento se centra en medidas de soporte, sin antídoto. Los posibles riesgos derivados del consumo y su fácil acceso hacen necesario un mayor estudio y concienciación. Bibliografía: 1. Pothiawala S, Yong CK, Charles R.

Diazepam accumulation was extensive, washout was slow and active compounds were present two weeks after the last dose. Oxazepam accumulation was significantly less and elimination significantly faster than diazepam. There was no difference between oxazepam and diazepam in sedation or fatigue during the drug treatment, but sedative effects persisted for two weeks after diazepam therapy was discontinued. Sedation rapidly returned to baseline in the oxazepam group. Thus, the differing pharmacokinetic profiles of diazepam and oxazepam have clinical consequences during multiple dosage in the elderly.",

Subcutaneous apomorphine is currently used in Parkinson's disease as an add-on to levodopa therapy or monotherapy for management of sudden, unexpected and refractory to levodopa-induced off state and fluctuation in advanced stage of illness. Many clinical trials have shown markedly (about 50-72%) reduced time of off phases. Other indications include the challenge test for determining the dopaminergic responsiveness. Apomorphine is used subcutaneously either as intermittent rescue injections or continuous infusions. Several other routes - transdermal, sublingual, intranasal, rectal and intravenous infusion - have been tried. Oral administration is not recommended. Apomorphine has rapid onset of antiparkinsonian action, qualitatively comparable to that of levodopa, short duration of action and stable efficacy with usually mild adverse events similar to other dopamine agonists. Domperidone or trimethobenzamide should be introduced before starting apomorphine treatment to reduce occurrence of peripheral adverse events (nausea, vomiting, orthostatic hypotension). Dyskinesias, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, delusion, oedema and yawning can occur, but some side effects are connected only with a specific route (for example skin nodules appearing during subcutaneous administration). Despite its long history, apomorphine is registered and used in only a few countries. Apomorphine warrants wider application in treatment of advanced Parkinson disease but the high cost of the drug, the necessity of concomitant treatment for prevention of side effects and subcutaneous administration restrict its use.",

Case reports describe abuse of clonidine alone or in combination with benzodiazepines, methadone, codeine, or heroin. Clonidine reportedly boosts and extends the opioid-related euphoria and reduces the amount of psychoactive drug needed. In this case report, we describe clonidine abuse and withdrawal management in an elderly patient with concurrent opioid use disorder. The usage of clonidine in the treatment of opioid detoxification remains controversial. Clonidine abuse is underestimated and requires more attention among health-care providers who concurrently prescribe clonidine and opioids. With the opioid epidemic becoming increasingly prevalent, physicians and other health-care providers must be vigilant in their opioid prescribing as well as concurrent prescribing of other psychoactive pharmacologic agents.",

      "title": "Fentanyl Overdoses in North America",
      "abstract": "A deadly street drug epidemic that has beleaguered North America for years is on the uptick this spring, albeit under a new guise.\r\nSince March, a growing number of regions in the United States and Canada have encountered an alarming increase in opioid drug overdoses. In most instances, the drugs causing the overdoses have been presented as either powerful painkiller pills or heroin, but mounting evidence suggests that the drugs were masked and of an extremely potent—and fatal—nature.\r\nAccording to reports, many victims of this epidemic—those who illicitly bought the drugs, overdosed, and several of whom subsequently died—had believed that they were purchasing either (i) Norco, a prescription painkiller similar to Vicodin and Percocet, or (ii) a form of common heroin. In both contexts, authorities suspect that the drugs were doses of illegally manufactured fentanyl that resembled either Norco tablets or heroin.[1]\r\nFentanyl is a powerful synthetic opiate analgesic, primarily for treating patients with severe pain (e.g., those with terminal cancer) or for managing pain after surgery, though it can also treat individuals with chronic pain who are physically tolerant to opiates. In its prescription form, fentanyl is known as Actiq, Duragesic, and Sublimaze; its many street names include Apache, China girl, dance fever, goodfella, jackpot, murder 8, Tango and Cash, and TNT.[2] As the most powerful painkiller available for medical treatment, fentanyl is considered the king of all opiates: indeed, it is about fifty times stronger than heroin and a hundred times stronger than morphine. Since fentanyl is cheap to produce illicitly and efficient to transport, it can be used to contaminate other, less potent street drugs. Once contamination occurs, users are unaware that they are inhaling or rejecting a perilous substance.[3]\r\nMedical and law enforcement officials suspect that the drugs in question are smuggled into Canada and the United States from China and through Mexican drug cartels, according to collective reports. However, it is unknown as to how, exactly, the drugs are being disguised as painkiller pills or heroin. Investigations into the matter are occurring on both local and federal levels.[4]\r\nWhile historically, fentanyl sales and overdoses have been concentrated in the Eastern United States (in places such as Ohio and Southern Florida), the primarily affected regions of the emerging epidemic range from the greater Chicago area to British Columbia in Western Canada and California’s Central Valley. In response to the rising overdoses, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have cautioned that a nationwide opiate epidemic is underway.\r\nIn the Central Valley alone, more than fifty opioid-related overdoses have been reported since late March. Sacramentan Jerome Butler, who ingested one such pill that he thought was a Norco painkiller, was one of the latest fatal victims. After taking the pill, he lapsed into a coma with liver and kidney failure and was taken off life support just days later.[5] Strikingly, he obtained the pill from a trusted contact, whose supplier is unknown. His mother, Natasha, said, “Someone here in Sacramento has the deadly pills. They are selling the deadly pills to our people.”[6] And the fatal overdoses remain on the rise: drugs spiked with a powerful painkiller have been responsible for at least twelve reported deaths in the region between March 24 and April 22.[7]\r\nAs in Sacramento, the recent sales and overdoses in British Columbia have tended to resemble painkiller pills. This spring’s significant increase in fentanyl-related overdoses and deaths prompted the BC government to declare a public health emergency.[8]\r\nIn the Chicago area, on the other hand, it seems that fentanyl is disguised as, and even combined with, heroin, in a liquid form. Reports indicate that at least eighteen recent heroin-opioid overdoses have occurred this spring, with two of them being fatal fentanyl ingestions. Investigators surmise that the buyers are in search of heroin, but that the street drugs are being combined with a more powerful-than-ever synthetic fentanyl.[9]\r\nWith these realities in mind, several suggestions should be considered as a means of confronting this epidemic. First, it is necessary to improve current systems for monitoring prescriptions. All too often, public health experts and bioethicists concentrate their attention on the interactions of doctors with current patients. While it is understandable that pain management doctors may not follow their patients after discharge, isn’t it possible, and perhaps even probable, that the individuals seeking the street drugs have developed an addiction that stemmed from legally provided prescriptions, but that has lacked thorough monitoring post-discharge? Epidemiological reviews of the explosive 2014 fentanyl epidemic in Ohio indicated that many of those seeking the opioids were suffering from bipolar disorder, depression, or other mental illnesses, and that the monitoring programs currently in existence suffer from notable shortcomings.[10] This belief is supported in the literature. According to hospitalist Marianne Maumus, addiction psychiatry services “are excellent and can direct the withdrawal process, [but] they frequently do not have the daily encounters required to witness, manage, or document the aberrant behaviors or to understand the nature of the alleged painful medical condition [at hand].” Such patients need increased monitoring in the outpatient setting to reduce diversion and supervise compliance.[11]\r\nSecondly, improvements to overdose treatment access should be sought. In Canada, for instance, kits containing an overdose treatment called naloxone have been made available to paramedics, firefighters, and police, according to Health Minister Terry Lake. However, more action is needed, he said: “We have to do what’s needed to prevent overdoses and deaths, and what’s needed is real-time information … Medical officers need immediate access to what’s happening and where so they can deploy the necessary strategies to prevent these tragedies.”[12]\r\nThirdly, public health agencies and medical professionals should aim to reduce the demand for fentanyl and other opioids through addiction prevention efforts, including safer practices in prescribing painkillers, improved approaches to prescription monitoring, and by reinforcing evidence-based approaches to treating pain in a way that spares the use of opioids. In light of the emerging epidemic, top officials at the FDA published a special report last week in the New England Journal of Medicine with the intent of guiding a national response to the opioid crisis—galvanizing the medical community to commit to actively propose solutions and ultimately to upend the status quo, which “is clearly not acceptable.”[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n[1] Soumya Karlamangla and Joseph Serna, “Painkiller Fentanyl Linked to Six Deaths and Numerous Overdoses in Sacramento Area,” Los Angeles Times, April 15, 2016,http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-fentanyl-contaminated-street-drugs-20160330-story.html.\r\n[2] National Institutes of Health: National Institute on Drug Abuse. “The Science of Drug Abuse and Addiction: Fentanyl.” December 2012.https://www.drugabuse.gov/drugs-abuse/fentanyl.\r\n[3] Christine Vestal, “Cheaper and Stronger than Heroin, Fentanyl Deaths Spike.” Tribune News Service’s Health and Human Services column, April 5, 2016,http://www.governing.com/topics/health-human-services/sl-fentanyl-deaths-drugs.html.\r\n[4] ABC 10 News Staff, “Man Found Dead in Manteca from Suspected Overdose,” April 4, 2016,http://www.abc10.com/news/local/manteca/man-found-dead-in-manteca-from-suspected-drug-overdose/119966165.\r\n[5] CNN Wire and Tribune Media Wire, “7th Person Dies as Wave of Fentanyl Overdoses Strikes California; CDC Warns of Epidemic,” WGN News, March 30, 2016,http://wgntv.com/2016/03/30/7th-person-dies-as-wave-of-fentanyl-overdoses-strikes-sacramento-county/.\r\n[6] ABC 10 News Staff, with Dale Schornack, “Another Possible Death by Fake Norco Pills in Sacramento Co.,” ABC 10 News, April 4, 2016,http://www.abc10.com/news/local/sacramento/another-possible-death-by-fake-norco-pills-in-sacramento-co/119481013.\r\n[7] Sarah Heise, “12th Fentanyl Death Reported in Sacramento County,” KCRA News, April 22, 2016,http://www.kcra.com/news/local-news/news-sacramento/12th-fentanyl-death-reported-in-sacramento-county/39168802.\r\n[8] CBC News Staff, “Increase in Overdose Deaths Prompts B.C. to Declare Public Health Emergency,” CBC News, April 14, 2016,http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-public-health-emergency-overdose-drugs-1.3535910.\r\n[9] Warner Todd Huston, “Fentanyl, A Drug 200 Times Worse Than Heroin, is Sweeping the Chicago Area,”BreitBart, April 14, 2016, http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/04/14/fentanyl-drug-200-times-worse-heroin-swamping-chicago-area/.\r\n[10] Christine Vestal, “As Fentanyl Deaths Spike, States and CDC Respond,” The PEW Charitable Trusts, STATELINE, April 1, 2016,http://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2016/04/01/as-fentanyl-deaths-spike-states-and-cdc-respond.\r\n[11] Marianne Maumus, “Bioethics in Practice—the Ethics of Opiate Use and Misuse from a Hospitalist’s Perspective,” The Ochsner Journal 2015; 15(2): 124–126.\r\n[12] Tom Fletcher, “B.C.

      "title": "Comparative efficacy, safety, and tolerability of diclofenac and aceclofenac in musculoskeletal pain management: A systematic review",
      "abstract": "Diclofenac and aceclofenac are nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Diclofenac is advocated for the treatment of painful and inflammatory rheumatic and certain nonrheumatic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, tendinitis, and bursitis, and in other inflammatory or painful conditions such as strains and sprains, dysmenorrhea, back pain, sciatica, and postoperative pain. Aceclofenac provides symptomatic relief in a variety of painful conditions such as joint inflammation, and reduces pain intensity and the duration of morning stiffness in the patients with rheumatoid arthritis, improves spinal mobility in the patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Gastrointestinal (GI) problems are the most frequent effects, which are caused by diclofenac and include dyspepsia and abdominal pain. Aceclofenac also has similar adverse effect but they are mild compared to diclofenac. We have reviewed 9 prospective studies that compared efficacy and safety of diclofenac with those of aceclofenac, 5 studies on osteoarthritis patients, 1 study on rheumatoid arthritis patients, 1 study on overall musculoskeletal disorders, 1 study on lower back pain, and 1 study on postextraction dental pain. Western Ontario and McMaster (WOMAC) universities scores, visual analogue scale (VAS), the Ritchie index, Lequesne OA severity index (OSI) were used in assessing the pain intensity and measuring the efficacy of the drug that proved beneficial in assessing the pain intensity and measuring the efficacy of both the drugs. All the studies came to the conclusion that aceclofenac is a better choice of drug in managing pain in case of all the above conditions with better efficacy and tolerability, patients experienced more number of adverse events (AEs) with diclofenac when compared with aceclofenac.",

      "abstract": "The safety and efficacy of intranasal corticosteroids (INCs) are well established for the management of allergic rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, and nasal polyps. As seen in numerous studies, INCs demonstrate markedly reduced systemic bioavailability compared with oral and even inhaled corticosteroids and have shown an excellent safety profile over 3 decades of use. Nonetheless, concerns remain among some prescribers and patients that these agents may reach the systemic circulation in sufficient concentration to produce adverse effects (AEs). Available evidence does not support these concerns. A review of the published literature indicates that the side effect profiles of INCs consist primarily of a low incidence of mostly mild and often transient local AEs, such as nasal irritation and epistaxis.The second-generation INC agents currently in use (mometasone furoate nasal spray, fluticasone propionate, ciclesonide, and fluticasone furoate) have favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics that further minimize systemic bioavailability (< 1%) compared with older INCs and compared with oral agents, thereby limiting the risk for systemic adverse events.",

Off-label therapy with prazosin and oxybutynin was proposed in two neonates with PBNO. <h3>Purpose</h3> To compound oxybutynin and prazosin correctly for dosing and administration in these patients and monitoring them. <h3>Material and methods</h3> A bibliographic search of indication, dosage and formulation was made in Pubmed, Micromedex and other compounding pharmaceutical sources. Keywords: prazosin, oxybutynin, neonate, PBNO. Clinical monitoring and interviews were carried out with the parents of two neonates (5 and 12 months' old) in treatment from the first month of life to the present. <h3>Results</h3> We did not find any bibliographic reference describing its use in neonates. Initially, we formulated sachets with their specific dose. Later, we formulated in suspension, 100 mcg/ml prazosin and 1 mg/ml (minurin) and oxybutynin (raw material), using simple syrup without preservatives as a vehicle. The initial doses collected were the minimum referenced in children: 10 mcg/kg/12 hour for prazosin and 0.1 mg/kg/12 hour for oxybutynin. The dose of prazosin was increased weekly, in both neonates, because of the improvement in uro-dynamics tests and no significant adverse effects detected. It was increased until 25 mcg/kg/8 hour (maximum collected in paediatrics 25 mcg/Kg/6 hour). The dose of oxybutynin was maintained in one patient with the initial dose and, in another, rose to 0.1 mg/kg/8 hour (the maximum 0.2 mg/kg/8 hour). Pharmaceutical care was performed by the explanation of the doses in milliliters adjusted to the weight and monitoring of possible adverse effects. Strawberry essence was incorporated into the suspension to improve flavour. Since birth, the number of catheters has decreased, with an improvement in the patient's symptoms. Regarding safety, no adverse reactions attributable to the drugs have been observed. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Both oral suspensions were appropriated for the pathology of our patients, which continue in treatment. They are well tolerated, for an age range not included in the bibliography, with good response. Pharmaceutical care was given from the beginning to the family and the paediatric service. <h3>References and/or acknowledgements</h3> To Rosa Millán García for the review of the work and her contribution to it.

Phase I trials conducted in the late 1980s were almost halted because of the high frequency of hypersensitivity-like reactions. Respiratory distress (dyspnea and/or bronchospasm), hypotension, and angioedema were the major manifestations, but flushing, urticaria, chest, abdomen, and extremity pains were described also. Reactions occurred on first exposure in the majority of cases raising etiologic questions. The vehicle for paclitaxel Cremophor EL (polyoxyethylated castor oil in 50% ethanol) was strongly suspect as a direct (non-immunoglobulin E dependent) histamine releaser. Premedication regimens and longer infusion times lowered the incidence of reactivity allowing phase II and III trials to progress through the early 1990s. The mechanism(s) underlying paclitaxel hypersensitivity-like reactions is still unknown, and clinical data on probable complement and mast cell activation are lacking. The original clinical trial protocols for paclitaxel required discontinuation of therapy for patients who experienced hypersensitivity-like reactions. Here, we review the current etiologic knowledge of these reactions and describe our clinical approach to allow completion of chemotherapy with this powerful plant-derived agent.",

Whereas kava extracts are well tolerated by most patients and rare side effects are rapidly reversible upon drug discontinuation, there are suspected hepatotoxic reactions reported during the last years in temporal and not necessarily causal association with a therapy with kava extracts. Almost 80 % of the patients took kavapyrones in overdose (maximally 480 mg/d) and/or for a prolonged time of more than 3 months up to 2 years. Additional risks factors include co-medication with up to 5 other chemically defined or herbal drugs with in part potentially hepatotoxic properties as well as a genetic deficiency of the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 2D6. Severe clinical courses with liver transplantation and possible fatal outcome occurred in 7 patients with overdose and/or long duration of the therapy with kavapyrones. Preventive measures should therefore include a dose of 120, maximally 210 mg kavapyrones per day for 1 month, maximally 2 months, as well as a prescription by a physician. Laboratory test (ALT and gamma-GT) should be done before and during the therapy, and co-medication and alcohol consumption should be avoided.

For practical purposes, in this clinical setting, true resedation does not occur, and if the appropriate type and dose of agonist have been used, residual sedation is not a clinical problem. Concerns over acute anxiety reactions and precipitation of acute withdrawal syndrome in chronic benzodiazepine users remain theoretical and unsubstantiated by human data. Further clinical studies are required to determine whether the clinical practice of using flumazenil could include this group of patients. Depression of ventilatory responsiveness induced by benzodiazepines can be reversed effectively and promptly by flumazenil. Flumazenil must be immediately available as an emergency drug in any area where benzodiazepines are used.

      "title": "Nebulised/aerosolised drugs in anaesthesiology, critical care and pain practice–benefit with a professional hazard!",
      "abstract": "The use of nebulised/aerosolised/inhaled drug administration in medical practice is well known for its beneficial effects. Respiratory disease management remains one of the most common uses of this modality. Various drug delivery systems, techniques and drug formulations are available. This modality is increasingly being used in anaesthesiology, critical care and pain practice to deliver drugs like antibiotics, dexmedetomidine, lidocaine, morphine and fentanyl.[1-12] This journal has published many manuscripts about using these drugs in the perioperative period for quoted beneficial effects.[2-11] The advancements in dedicated drug delivery systems and drug molecules intended for delivery via nebulisation have been reported for respiratory diseases, but have yet to be documented in anaesthesia and perioperative practice.[13] The drugs used are primarily intended for intravenous use, and the same are being utilised for nebulisation. The concern that must be addressed is the occupational hazard of this usage. Nebulisation is performed in hospital wards, preoperative holding areas, operating rooms and critical care units. The aerosolised molecules are released into the atmosphere, exposing other patients and healthcare workers. Since many of these drugs are quite potent, long-term exposure of healthcare workers to them poses health-related hazards, and therefore, it needs to be studied further. Similarly, the aerosolised route has been used for a long time for administering antibiotics.[14,15] More and more antibiotics have been added to this armamentarium in recent years because of their beneficial effects. This risks exposing other patients and healthcare workers to aerosolised antibiotic molecules. This may have serious consequences on healthcare workers due to the development of antibiotic resistance in them, as they may repeatedly receive subtherapeutic/minuscule doses. A systematic review reported a striking need for standardised procedures to prepare non-commercial solutions for inhaled antibiotics.[16] The authors concluded that there needs to be more information on the tolerability and biochemical safety of non-commercial dilutions of inhaled antibiotics used to treat bronchiectasis. They emphasised that when the antibiotics meant for the intravenous route were used via the inhalation route, the dilutions employed were outside the range of tolerability. In recent years, many advancements have been made in formulation design, inhalation devices, aerosol delivery devices and particle sizes of the drugs for better delivery and optimal action.[17] However, more is needed to prevent environmental exposure to the drug molecules. Certain areas have already been recognised for their concern about aerosol exposure to healthcare workers. Administering chemotherapeutic drugs using the technique of pressurised intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) is being practised for cancer patients.[18] The exposure of healthcare workers to chemotherapeutic drugs is well identified, and techniques like PIPAC follow protocols for preventing exposure of healthcare workers to the drugs. Concerns have been raised in the clinical practice of dentistry with regard to aerosol transmission of infectious agents. Interventions reducing exposure to aerosolised microbes in dentistry have been emphasised.[19,20] Aerosol exposure was again noted in the recent coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. There is a need for future research and technological advancements for producing better drug molecules intended for nebulisation in anaesthesia practice and to find their impact on healthcare workers and as environmental hazards. Hence, more research is required for the effective usage of local anaesthetics, opioids, dexmedetomidine molecules etc., for aerosolisation. There is a need to consider preventing the environmental pollution by exhaled drug particulates. There is an utter need for protocols as well whenever the drug is being used via the inhalation route, especially for drugs having the potential to cause an adverse impact on healthcare workers.",

      "abstract": "THE CONTINUING INCREASE in strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae which are relatively resistant to penicillin and the problem of allergy to penicillin create a need for evaluating alternate modes of therapy in gonorrheal urethritis. Drugs which are absorbed by the blood in quantities adequate to produce cure when the patient is given a single oral dose usually are ideal for treating uncomplicated gonorrheal urethritis. Oral medications preclude painful injections and lessen the risk of anaphylaxis. A single dose is desirable because patients frequently fail to complete longer treatment regimens. WVhen administered in a single oral dose, tetracycline and certain of its derivatives have been proved adequate in the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrheal urethritis (1). There are, however, instances of gastrointestinal upset following doses as large as those required for a single oral dose regimen. Although the percentage of patients in whom such upsets develop is small, any treatment schedule which reduces these reactions would be desirable. Doxycycline monohydrate, a tetracycline derivative, produces blood levels of antibiotic equal to or higher than the other tetracyclines given in smaller doses (2). We felt, therefore, that for treating uncomplicated gonorrheal urethritis a single oral dose of doxycycline monohydrate might provide adequate therapy with a minimum of gastrointestinal intolerance.",

Ofloxacin was strongly suspected as the causal drug for the hypersensitivity reaction as the subject had a history of allergic reaction to the same in the past.

PG increases the insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissues. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common and fastest developing diseases. The antihyperglycemic effect of pioglitazone (PG) is not its only one. This drug has a number of other metabolically beneficial effects. Many outcome trials indicate a positive impact of PG on the functioning of other systems.&#x0D; Aim of the study: The aim of this study is to summarize the current knowledge on the effectiveness and safety of pioglitazone based on the available scientific literature.&#x0D; Materials and methods: Literature review based on PubMed, Google Scholar database using the following phrases: pioglitazone, type 2 diabetes, pioglitazone in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) therapy, pioglitazone and cardiovascular risk, pioglitazone nephroprotective effect, pioglitazone safety profile.&#x0D; State of knowledge: Pioglitazone is an oral antidiabetic drug used in the therapy of T2DM. PG belongs to the ‘insulin- sensitizers’. It is included in the treatment in the case of intolerance, contraindications to metformin or as part of combination therapy.&#x0D; Conclusions: Recently, interest in pioglitazone has waned due to the perception of significant side effects. The analysis of the papers showed a positive effect of PG on the cardiovascular system, central nervous system, NAFLD and nephroprotection. The acceptable safety profile of pioglitazone with the appropriate selection of patients as well as its multidirectional action and effectiveness mean that clinicians should reconsider the use of this drug guided by the balance of profits and losses.",

Data sources and methods: We reviewed the published literature on calcium channel blockers and their pharmacology and therapeutic applications in obstetrics and gynecology. We paid particular attention to methods of animal research and recent clinical evaluations. Conclusions: The dihydropyridine group of calcium channel blockers (type II calcium blockers) and, specifically, nifedipine are safe for use in pregnancy. They have little teratogenic or fetotoxic potential. Nifedipine's mechanism of action is through smooth-muscle relaxation secondary to blockage of the slow calcium channels into the cells. In vivo, there is minimal effect on the cardiac conducting system. Multiple studies in women have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of nifedipine as an antihypertensive. Therapeutic doses range from 10-30 mg orally every 6-8 hours. For acute control of hypertension, 10 mg of sublingual nifedipine may be used. Nifedipine is as effective as betamimetics in decreasing uterine activity. As a tocolytic agent, it is more effective as there are fewer patients who have to discontinue nifedipine because of side effects. The side effects of nifedipine include flushing, headache, or, rarely, hypotension in the hypovolemic patient. Nifedipine has potential and theoretical indications for dysmenorrhea and bladder irritability.(Obstet Gynecol 1994;83:616-24)",

These drugs have recently been evaluated for the treatment of female sexual arousal disorder, although results to date have been inconclusive. Pharmacologic therapies have also been proposed for the treatment of premature ejaculation and hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Strong evidence exists for the value of serotonergic drugs (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) in the treatment of premature ejaculation.

Of the local anesthetic agents, tetracaine afforded the least protection from death, whereas lidocaine seemed to be most effective.",

The nitrogen in the thiodiphenylamine molecule is the pharmacologically active position. There are three groups of phenothiazine derivatives determined by the substituted side chain. Group I is the dimethyl-aminopropyl of which chlorpromazine (Thorazine) is an example. Group II is the piperazinyl propyl derivative; eg, prochlorperazine (Compazine). Group III is the piperidyl ethyl derivative; eg, thioridazine hydrochloride (Mellaril). The most serious ocular side effect occurring with a phenothiazine derivative administration is a pigmentary retinopathy with visual loss. This complication apparently is limited to piperidyl derivatives such as NP-207 with a narrow therapeutic-toxic range and thioridazine hydrochloride which is claimed to be safe if administered in amounts of less than 800 mg daily. A less serious ocular side effect has been reported recently associated with long-term therapy with chlorpromazine. This complication is a deposit on the anterior lens capsule and the",

LDN has been used clinically to treat various conditions, including pain, as an off label use of naltrexone for years. In 2009, Younger and Mackey published a single-blinded crossover trial in which LDN was used for the treatment of painful fibromyalgia [1]. They concluded that LDN may be effective for the relief of fibromyalgia symptoms. LDN, an opioid antagonist, blocks endogenous opioid receptors for 4–6 hours. This temporary receptor blockade is followed by a rebound increase in endogenous opioid receptors and ligands, which is one of the proposed mechanisms for pain relief. LDN has also been described as an atypical anti-inflammatory agent...",

In addition, it offers a significantly greater duration and safety margin without a vasopressor. On the other hand, prilocaine has a latency that is somewhat longer than lidocaine, and may produce methemoglobinemia. The small difference in latency betwen these agents is of little importance to most clinicians. With respect to methemoglobin formation, dosages of prilocaine equal to the maximally recommended dose of lidocaine do not produce statistically significant amounts of methemoglobin, and at dose levels which are twice in excess of that recommended for lidocaine, prilocaine does not produce clinically significant levels of methemoglobin. Moreover, methemoglobin is rapidly and effectively reverted by methylene blue. Therefore, the production of methemoglobin does not limit the clinical indication for this drug in the dosages recommended. On the basis of our clinical experiences, prilocaine would appear to be the local anesdietic drug of choice for regional anesthesia.",

In the early sixties, it was withdrawn from the market after its infamous association with congenital abnormalities that left about 10,000 children affected world-wide. With strict regulations and precautions, thalidomide is now approved by the FDA for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum. Its role in cancer therapy is promising, with clinical trials in the past 5 years showing significant activity in multiple myeloma. Several trials are ongoing in other malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndrome, agnogenic myeloid metaplasia, renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer. The major toxicities of thalidomide are birth defects, sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, somnolence, rash, fatigue, and constipation. Less common side effects include deep venous thrombosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, elevated liver enzymes, malaise, and peripheral edema. The incidence and severity of adverse events are related to dose and duration of therapy. Doses of the drug of 200 mg/day or less are usually well tolerated. In this review, we will discuss the incidence and management of the side effects of thalidomide and the precautions and interventions needed to minimize the toxicities of this drug.",

Its properties make it a safe and effective drug, but one which also produces undesirable effects such as dreams, delusions and hallucinations. For some, these medical drawbacks were an incentive for its non-clinical use, quickly demonstrating its enormous psychedelic potential. By the seventies, a psychonautical use was already established in limited circles of consumers experienced in the use of various drugs. Since the end of the 80s, and coinciding with the expansion of techno culture, raves and synthetic drugs, ketamine has been introduced as a recreational drug into adolescent parties where it has been consumed in low to medium doses, generally by sniffing, and frequently mixed with other substances such as ecstasy or cocaine. The principal risks associated with its consumption are the high potential for psychological addiction, the high rate of tolerance it produces and the possibility of resulting injuries and accidents if consumed in an unsuitable environment. Today, even though it is still a substance in minority use, it is slowly but surely gaining ground. For this reason, it would be advisable to undertake specific preventive and interventive steps to tackle the problem",

      "abstract": "The use of a drug to modify a person's behavior for criminal gain is not a recent phenomenon. However, the recent increase in reports of drug-facilitated crimes (sexual assault, robbery) has caused alarm in the general public. Drugs involved can be pharmaceuticals such as benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam, lorazepam, etc), hypnotics (zopiclone, zolpidem), sedatives (neuroleptics, some histamine H, antagonists), or anesthetics (gamma-hydroxybutyrate, ketamine), drugs of abuse such as cannabis, ecstasy, or lysergide, or more often ethanol. Drugs used to facilitate sexual assaults can be difficult to detect (active products at low dosages, chemical instability), possess amnesic properties, and can be rapidly cleared from the body (short half-life). In these situations, blood or even urine can be of little interest. This is the reason why this laboratory developed an original approach based on hair testing. Hair was suggested as a valuable specimen in situations where, as a result of a delay in reporting the crime, natural processes have eliminated the drug from typical biologic specimens. Although there are many papers focused on the identification of drugs in hair following chronic drug use, those dealing with a single dose are very scarce. The experience of the authors is documented in cases involving zolpidem, GHB, lorazepam, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and flunitrazepam. The expected concentrations in hair are in the low picogram per milligram range for the hypnotics. Drug exposure is demonstrated by hair segmentation. Hair analysis may be a useful adjunct to conventional drug testing in sexual assault. It should not be considered as an alternative to blood and urine analyses but as a complement. MS/MS technologies appear to be a prerequisite.",

      "abstract": "Amiodarone is a unique class III antiarrhythmic drug with several unusual pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and toxicological actions which are quite distinct from those of the standard antiarrhythmic drugs. Extensive animal and clinical studies have demonstrated that amiodarone and its major metabolite, desethylamiodarone, both produce a marked increase in the duration of transmembrane action potential which may be related to their antiarrhythmic as well as clinical electrophysiological activity. Unlike most other cardiovascular drugs, it has been recognized for more than 20 years that optimal antiarrhythmic effects may take several days to weeks after onset of oral therapy. Amiodarone is highly lipid soluble and exhibits at least three separate compartments of drug distribution, with a long elimination half‐life of 14–120 days after chronic therapy. The pharmacokinetic profile of desethylamiodarone is qualitatively similar to that of amiodarone, but its elimination half‐life is even longer and its tissue distribution may be slightly different. Although there may not be any correlation between serum drug levels and clinical toxicity of amiodarone during long‐term therapy, recent animal as well as clinical data suggest that multilamellar intracellular inclusions can be dissociated from cell death or clinical toxicity. Thus, it is possible that amiodarone toxicity can be minimized with low doses or low serum drug concentrations. The metabolite(s) of amiodarone may play a major role in its pharmacological and toxicological actions.",

Excited delirium is a state in which the cocaine user develops severe hyperthermia, engages in bizarre or violent behavior, and demonstrates extreme strength and insensitivity to pain. In medical practice, cocaine is applied topically to the interior surfaces of the nose, mouth, and throat to provide anesthesia during procedures. Cocaine is typically self-administered by nasal insufflation, smoking or intravenous injection. Screening tests for cocaine are performed with immunoassays that detect the principal metabolite benzoylecgonine.

      "title": "Evaluation of Standard Market Preparation Tablet (Tentex Forte) and Vrishya Gutika in the Management of Klaibya (Erectile Dysfunction): Research Protocol for a Randomised Controlled Tria",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Klaibya is a sexual dysfunction characterised by various symptoms, including Ling Shaithilya (penis shrinkage) and Mlan Shishna (penis weakening). It refers to a man’s inability to engage in sexual acts satisfactorily, leaving the female partner either partially or completely unsatisfied. The Charak Samhita mentions Vajikaran (aphrodisiac) Yoga as a remedy for Klaibya. Need of the Study: Common modern medications used to treat Klaibya include Cialis, Viagra, Levitra and Stendra. However, these drugs can lead to several side-effects, such as headaches, body aches, gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness, vision changes, flushing, nasal congestion and in some cases, priapism (an erection lasting longer than four hours) and sudden changes in hearing. On the other hand, Vrishya Gutika, an herbal formulation mentioned in the Charak Samhita, includes ingredients like Vidarikand Swaras, Tugaksheeri Churna, Sharkara Churna, Ikshurak Churna (Kokilaksha), Pippali Churna, and Kappikacchu Beej Churna, along with cow ghee, cow milk, and honey-all known for their aphrodisiac properties. Aim: To conduct a comparative evaluation of the efficacy of Vrishya Gutika and Tablet Tentex Forte in the management of Klaibya (Erectile Dysfunction). Materials and Methods: A single-blinded, randomised controlled trial will be conducted at the Kayachikitsa outpatient and inpatient departments of Mahatma Gandhi Ayurved College, Hospital, and Research Centre in Salod (H), Wardha, Maharashtra, India from March 2023 to February 2025. Two groups will be formed, each consisting of 30 subjects. Group A will serve as the control group and will receive a standard market preparation (Tentex Forte)-two tablets twice daily. Group B, the trial group, will receive Vrishya Gutika-four tablets twice daily, both for 30 days. The effectiveness of the interventions will be evaluated using a validated questionnaire. The paired t-test will be employed to assess subjective parameters within the same group, while the unpaired t-test will be used for intergroup comparisons, establishing a significance level of &lt;0.05.",

      "abstract": "One of the most actual problems of pharmacy is the development of medication forms for external application with complex effects on (gel, emplastro, aerosol, etc.) skin wounds, burns and inflammatory factors. The centuries-old practice of using phyto-preparations (herbal remedies) proved that they have fewer side effects in comparison with synthetic drugs. Despite the wide application of herbal preparations, in the literature there is a little information about their application in development of wound and burn healing modern dosage forms. Among the medicinal plants with the mentioned pharmacological actions, comfrey (Symphytum L.) should be distinguished. Phenolic polymer poly[3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)glyceric acid] (PDGA) or poly[oxy-1-carboxy-2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)ethylene], amounting approximately 25% of polysaccharides and 1.5-2.5% of dry plant material, were isolated from the roots and stems of Caucasian comfrey species (S. asperum, S. caucasicum). Contrary to polysaccharides this phenolic polymer of Comfrey appeared to have a high immunomodulatory (anticomplement), antioxidative, antilipoperoxidantive, anti-inflammatory and wound-healing efficacy/activities. The aim of the study was development of the composition and technology of PDGA-containing gel. According to the results of complex biopharmaceutical studies PDGA gel optimal composition has been proved. The technological scheme for preparation of PDGA gel has been developed. PDGA gel stability under normal conditions of storage at +40С was studied. The gel has a shelf life (determined expiration date) of 2 year.",

Based on a product available in Europe, over 4 million smokers in Central and Eastern Europe have used this medication and over 10,000 subjects have participated in clinical trials worldwide. Cytisinicline acts as a partial agonist and partial antagonist for the alpha-4 beta-2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain, which are the same receptors that are activated by nicotine. Cytisinicline helps to reduce cravings, withdrawal symptoms and the reward and satisfaction associated with smoking by preventing nicotine from binding to these receptors and releasing dopamine. The On-going Research of Cytisinicline for Addiction-1 clinical trial has shown that participants receiving 3.0 mg cytisinicline three times daily had the highest biochemically verified point-prevalence abstinence rate (50%) compared with placebo (10%) at the end of treatment, with no significant safety concerns. These quit results were statistically significant (p&lt;0.001). Cytisinicline demonstrates weak binding to the 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor that causes nausea, consistent with few observed nausea events in participants receiving cytisinicline. No new medications for tobacco dependence have received United States Food and Drug Administration approval since 2006. Cytisinicline represents a promising treatment for those globally who continue to smoke tobacco.",

      "abstract": "Methoxyflurane is a volatile, halogenated analgesic, self-administered in a controlled low dose from the Penthrox(®) inhaler for short-term pain relief. It was formerly used in significantly higher doses to produce anaesthesia, when it caused a specific type of dose-related renal tubular damage. The pathogenesis of the renal damage and clinical use of methoxyflurane are discussed here with evidence that a low but effective analgesic dose is not associated with the risk of renal adverse effects. The maximum dose employed to produce analgesia is limited to methoxyflurane 6 mL/day and 15 mL/week, producing a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 0.59 MAC-hours. Renal damage is due to the metabolism of methoxyflurane and release of fluoride ions. Exposure of humans to methoxyflurane ≤2.0 MAC-hours, resulting in serum fluoride ≤40 µmol/L, has not been associated with renal tubular toxicity. The safety margin of analgesic use of methoxyflurane in the Penthrox ((®)) inhaler is at least 2.7- to 8-fold, based on methoxyflurane MAC-hours or serum fluoride level, with clinical experience suggesting it is higher. It is concluded from clinical experience in emergency medicine, surgical procedures and various experimental and laboratory investigations that the analgesic use of methoxyflurane in subanaesthetic doses in the Penthrox inhaler does not carry a risk of nephrotoxicity.",

      "abstract": "One of the main symptoms of acid-dependent conditions, gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic duodenal ulcer and functional dyspepsia is heartburn. This condition is characterized by an unpleasant, sometimes painful sensation of burning in the epigastric region and behind the sternum accompanied with a sour taste in the mouth. Heartburn affects the emotional state of a patient and leads to reduction of the quality of his/her life. The symptom of heartburn can bother not only adults but also children; moreover, the physiological inconsistency of the cardiac sphincter, etc., can be added to its provoking factors, in addition to errors in nutrition and the presence of the gastrointestinal tract diseases. The main drugs for stopping heartburn are antacids, as well as medicines containing alginic acid. Aim. To develop recommendations for introducing changes or additions to the peculiarities of using antacids in children (under 15 years of age) in the “Protocol of the pharmacist. Symptomatic treatment of heartburn”.Materials and methods. To achieve the goal the clinical and pharmaceutical analysis of antacid medicines registered and marketed in Ukraine was performed.Results. As a result of the study it has been found that there are 30 antacids and 6 medicines based on alginic acid registered at the Ukrainian market. All medicines belong to the category of over-the-counter drugs and can be used by patients or the patient’s representatives independently. The analysis of the composition of antacid medicines has been performed, and it has been determined that agents based on aluminum compounds prevail, combinations of calcium and magnesium carbonates are 19.4 %.When studying the indications for medical use it has been found that in the case of heartburn in children only 14 of 36 trade names can be used. In addition, depending on the age, their ranking can be presented by the following sequence: aluminum phosphate, hydrotalcite, combination of aluminum and magnesium hydroxides, alginates (a standard dose).Conclusions. It has been recommended to make clarifications in the “Protocol of the pharmacist (pharmaceutist). Symptomatic treatment of heartburn” regarding the possibility of using anti-acid drugs in children of different age.",

      "abstract": "Plant extracts have been used for their therapeutic properties for thousands of years. Many of the well known drugs still in widespread use today, such as morphine, digoxin or salicylic acid, were originally isolated from plants such as the poppy, the foxglove and the willow [1–3]. Yet plant extracts, as such, still have a place in therapy alongside synthetic chemical products. With increasing concern among both practising physicians and the lay public about the possible risks associated with drug treatment, there is an understandable desire to treat with traditionally well-tolerated drugs. Over-the-counter medicines are being used increasingly in the developed countries, particularly for children, and concern has been expressed as to whether parents are sufficiently well-informed about the benefits and risks of the products they keep at hand in the kitchen cupboard [4]. Many plant-derived products are regarded as well-tolerated by their proponents and ridiculed as inefficacious by their critics. In this controversial atmosphere, it is important to assess objectively the facts about individual therapeutic products.",

      "title": "Dissociative AnestheticsAngel: Dust to Special K to Ketamine Clinics",
      "abstract": "Abstract We will consider just two drugs in this chapter. They are phencyclidine and ketamine. Both are widely used as anesthetic agents, ketamine in humans and phencyclidine in animals. The acronym for phencyclidine that we will use, PCP, comes from its chemical name 1-(1-PhenylCyclohexyl)-Piperidine. In addition to their medical use, both ketamine and PCP have gained roles as recreational drugs or, as others would put it, drugs of abuse. While sharing some of the properties of the depressant drugs we met in the preceding chapter, PCP and ketamine are pharmacologically and therapeutically unique. On March 26, 1956, V. Harold Maddox, a chemist working at the research laboratories of Parke, Davis &amp; Company in Detroit, synthesized a novel compound later to be called phencyclidine. PCP was submitted in the autumn of that year for testing in animals. Pigeons, mice, rats, Guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, cats, and monkeys all had their turn. Depending on the dose employed and the species in which it was tested, the effects ranged from excitement and stimulation to taming and quieting. Analgesia, that is, absence of pain without loss of consciousness, and anesthesia were common but, unlike the depressant drugs we met in the previous chapter, the anesthesia was not accompanied by depression of breathing. Studies in human subjects began in May 1957 at the Department of Anesthesiology of the Detroit Receiving Hospital. By this time, PCP had been given the trade name Sernyl. The drug initially was administered to seven volunteers. As had previously been noted in animals, there was no suppression of breathing or disturbance of cardiac rhythm, highly desirable qualities in an anesthetic agent. The investigators then moved on to 64 patients ranging in age from 18 to 78, 47 of whom were women, who were to undergo various surgical procedures, including breast biopsy, dilation and curettage, skin grafts, hysterectomy, and hernia repair. Immediately after the intravenous administration of PCP, there was what the anesthesiologists called “a profound state of analgesia” permitting surgical incision and, in many cases, completion of the operation without the use of other drugs.",

Most concerning is the increased risk of cutaneous malignancies, primarily squamous cell carcinoma (SCC); this risk is duration dependent and the associated malignancies tend to be more aggressive and multifocal. Voriconazole is also associated with phototoxicity (which may be a precursor to malignancy), periostitis, hallucinations and encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, nail changes, hyponatremia, and other adverse effects. Some toxicities (neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal including hepatic) are seen in clear association with supratherapeutic serum voriconazole levels; thus, careful monitoring of voriconazole levels is a critical component of safe drug use. Guidelines for screening for adverse effects after long-term voriconazole use may be beneficial and need to be established.",

A considerable degree of potentiation of the analgesic properties of morphine and codeine is obtained by using aminopyrine, cyclopal (a barbiturate) either alone or, better, together, in combination with the opiate.

      "abstract": "Introduction: As a consequence of greater prescription opioid utilization, there has been the parallel increase in misuse, abuse, and overdose, which are serious risks. Associated new formulations may be safer.Areas covered: The introduction of abuse-deterrent opioid formulations and continuous programs to improve opioid prescribing practices may limit the opioid abuse and its consequences. Oxycodone extended release capsules are an extended-release (ER), microsphere-in-capsule abuse-deterrent-formulation designed to retain its extended-release properties following tampering or misuse (e.g., chewing, crushing). Studies have reported that this preparation is efficacious in patients with low back pain, less attractive for illicit use, and an option for patients who have difficulty swallowing and erroneously crush their medication.Expert commentary: Preliminary data regarding oxycodone extended release capsules are encouraging. However, more data in different populations are necessary to confirm initial observations, and comparison should be performed with active substances.",

Accordingly, an initial set of recommendations are provided herein. Major advantages of pegASNase are its 2–3-week duration of action, in contrast to less than 3 days with native ASNase, and the flexibility of intravenous or intramuscular administration of pegASNase and associated patient and physician convenience. The most frequent toxicities of both types of ASNase are hepatic and pancreatic, with pancreatitis being the most serious. Other toxicities are hypersensitivity reactions, thrombosis, nausea/vomiting, and fatigue. Whether or not the replacement of one dose of pegASNase for 6–9 doses of native ASNase can be achieved in adults with similar efficacy and acceptable toxicities to those achieved in children remains to be established.",

En este esudio se ha comparado el efecto de dos analgesicos diferentes (diclofenaco vs rofecoxib, un AINE clasico frente a un inhibidor de la COX-2) sobre la inhibicion del movimiento dental inducido por un mecanismo ortodoncico. Se estudian 42 ratas divididas en 6 grupos. A tres de ellas se les aplica una traccion ortodoncica con fuerza de 50 g, la diferencia es el farmaco que se les administra (grupo R-50: refocoxib; grupo D-50: diclofenaco; grupo C-100 y del mismo modo cada uno con una farmaco diferente (R-100: rofecoxib; grupo D-100: diclofenaco; grupo C-100: suero salino).

Fixed drug eruption (FDE) is a distinctive type of adverse drug reaction in which every exposure to the offending medication leads to the appearance of lesions at the same ‘fixed’ sites. A sharply defined erythematous patch or plaque with a violaceous hue is typically seen. A clinical variant featuring classic FDE lesions along with blistering in at least three out of six anatomical sites or involving at least 10% of body surface area is known as generalized bullous fixed drug eruption (GBFDE). Tadalafil-induced FDE is in itself an uncommon phenomenon, with only a handful of documented cases, none of which seem to have reported GBFDE-type presentation post-tadalafil intake. Here, we present a case of GBFDE following tadalafil administration.",

When chronically administered in low dosages, these compounds decrease Stage 4 of the sleep process and produce insomnia, while in high dosages they produce deeper sleep stages. Based on these observations and the fact that extrapyramidal symptoms usually do not occur during deep sleep, we hypothesized that high oral doses of trifluoperazine given at night would produce fewer sleep disturbances and extrapyramidal symptoms than the same dosages of this compound administered during the morning.",

Need for an effective drug to combat this annoying infection is obvious. Innumerable topical therapeutic agents tried in the past for treatment of trichomonal vaginitis afforded an occasional cure but only temporary symptomatic relief in the majority of cases. Failure with these agents is due to the fact that some trichomonads are located in areas other than the surface of the vagina or cervix.

During the same The demand for orally disintegrating tablets has enormously increased during the last decade. Particularly for geriatric and pediatric patients who have difficulty in swallowing conventional tablets and capsules. Oral administration of the drugs is difficult in patients having concomitant vomiting or diarrhea. Fast dissolving or fast disintegrating dosage form is advantageous for such patients. Fast dissolvable or fast disintegrating dosage forms are meant to disintegrate immediately upon contact with the saliva leading to faster release of drug in the oral cavity. Because administrating the fast disintegrating dosage forms, absorption of the drugs occurs through buccal mucosa and it may reduce the first pass metabolism leading to better efficacy of the drug. Prednisolone is a naturally occurring glucocorticoids (hydrocortisone), it targets to corticosteroid binding globulin (it regulates Enzyme regulatory activity, Enzyme inhibitory activity and protease inhibitory activity.

      "abstract": "The treatment of acne with combination therapy is commonplace with treatment aimed at sustained efficacy with minimal side effects, maximum adherence, and the avoidance of bacterial resistance. Combinations containing clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide have been shown to be effective, but the irritation caused by the concentration of benzoyl peroxide 5% in the more commonly used, fixed combinations can be limiting. In addition, surfactants, preservatives, and high levels of organic solvents, including alcohols, often used in combination with benzoyl peroxide, are potential irritants. An optimized formulation of clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide using a lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide (clindamycin-benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel) has been developed without the use of surfactants or alcohol. It was recently introduced for the once-daily treatment of inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions in moderate-to-severe acne. Following a clinical program that studied more than 2,800 patients, clindamycin-benzoyl peroxide 2.5% was found to be highly effective and well tolerated.

Publications indexed in PubMed/Medline® between January 1999 and October 2023, were reviewed. For each clinical question, a level of evidence was attributed to the conclusions. These conclusions and the working group arguments were used to develop and grade (A-C) the recommendations. ED management must be personalized. Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5I) are recommended as first-line treatment (A). In patients with severe ED, a combination of PDE5I may be proposed as first- or second-line treatment (Expert Agreement, EA). Extra-cavernous or intra-urethral injections of alprostadil may be offered as first-line alternative to PDE5I or as second-line treatment (B). In case of unsatisfactory response to PDE5I or alprostadil alone, the combination of a PDE5I with intra-cavernosal or intra-urethral alprostadil may be proposed (EA). Vacuum therapy can be offered to all patients (B). Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy may be proposed to patients with mild or moderate ED, alone or in combination with PDE5I (B). Penile implants are indicated for patients with ED who are refractory or intolerant to pharmacological or mechanical treatments, or if they wish a permanent solution (B). Revascularization surgery may be offered to patients without comorbidities following pelvic trauma and ED with isolated arterial insufficiency (B). In addition to pharmaceutical, mechanical and/or surgical treatments, it is suggested to always consider educational interventions and counseling, lifestyle modifications and management of co-morbidities and curable causes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Vecuronium is a curaric agent, largely used in anesthesia. Indications as to its employ in uremic patients appear to be debated because of partial renal elimination of the drug. A 52‐year‐old hemodialyzed woman required transplantectomy for rejection. At awakeness after general anesthesia (induced with fentanyl, propofol, and 6 mg of vecuronium, repeated with a single 2 mg dose 30 min later), she presented diafragmatic and muscular limb weakeness that lasted 180 min in spite of prostigmine administration. A 2 h 30 min predilutional hemofiltration was then performed, which induced rapid disappearance of neuromuscular blockade. Even if vecuronium can be used in dialysis patients, one should remember its possible side effects, especially with repeated doses, in determining prolonged neuromuscular blockade. Cautious use of this drug in renal failure is mandatory. Low dosage must be employed and repeated administration avoided. Neuromuscular blockade seems to be rapidly reversible with dialytic treatment.",

      "title": "Cocaine: An Updated Overview on Chemistry, Detection, Biokinetics, and Pharmacotoxicological Aspects including Abuse Pattern",
      "abstract": "Cocaine is one of the most consumed stimulants throughout the world, as official sources report. It is a naturally occurring sympathomimetic tropane alkaloid derived from the leaves of Erythroxylon coca, which has been used by South American locals for millennia. Cocaine can usually be found in two forms, cocaine hydrochloride, a white powder, or ‘crack’ cocaine, the free base. While the first is commonly administered by insufflation (‘snorting’) or intravenously, the second is adapted for inhalation (smoking). Cocaine can exert local anaesthetic action by inhibiting voltage-gated sodium channels, thus halting electrical impulse propagation; cocaine also impacts neurotransmission by hindering monoamine reuptake, particularly dopamine, from the synaptic cleft. The excess of available dopamine for postsynaptic activation mediates the pleasurable effects reported by users and contributes to the addictive potential and toxic effects of the drug. Cocaine is metabolised (mostly hepatically) into two main metabolites, ecgonine methyl ester and benzoylecgonine. Other metabolites include, for example, norcocaine and cocaethylene, both displaying pharmacological action, and the last one constituting a biomarker for co-consumption of cocaine with alcohol. This review provides a brief overview of cocaine’s prevalence and patterns of use, its physical-chemical properties and methods for analysis, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and multi-level toxicity.",

Oxicodone has been a semisynthetic opioide derived from thebaine with multiple actions similar to morphine, used actually clinical for more than 80 years. Its main therapeutic action is the analgesia; and to a lesser extent sedative action. To dose lower than the necessary one to produce analgesia, can act on the center of the cough. The objective of this article is to make a review of the characteristics of oxicodone: its pharmacological properties, tolerability and mainly its clinical effectiveness in the different types of pain and with the different presentations that exist at the moment in the market. The reviewed articles come from the data base of Medline and Cochrane. Clinical effectiveness. Numerous studies guarantee the effectiveness of oxicodone in the treatment of the different types of pain. Nevertheless these studies have their limitations. The studies that are based on the use of oxicodone in nononcological chronic pain are positive comparative studies to placebo. As far as the oncological pain, the comparative clinical tests from morphine and hidromorphone, oxicodone has presented advantages in effectiveness, and safety. Also revisions have been carried out on the matter in which it scores at oxicodone like a good alternative to morphine. Discussion. Oxicodone is a good alternative for the treatment of the moderate-severe pain, for a program of opioids rotation of since it has an excellent balance between analgesia and toxicity. Oxicodone prolonged release 5 mg, is very useful like initial dose to titrate opioids, being climbed dose at 48 hours, with which the incidence of indirect effect is diminished and diminishes the risk of therapeutic abandonment that these entail. With this approach one would be able to eliminate the main obstacle to put in practice the Analgesic Elevator theory.",

      "title": "In the context of a case: Aripiprazole to resume habits",
      "abstract": "Introduction A 43-year-old male with a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder associated with substance use is admitted to the mental health unit due to a psychotic decompensation. The patient has had an unfavorable progression requiring multiple admissions to mental health services. He suffers from dyslipidemia, hypertension, and poorly controlled diabetes. He has had some occasional work but is currently unemployed. He does not engage in leisure or sports activities, which he attributes to being highly sedated by the medication. He is currently being treated with clozapine, valproic acid, quetiapine, and various benzodiazepines. Objectives Achieve stabilization of the psychopathological condition without producing additional side effects such as sedation. Methods During the hospital stay, Quetiapina is slowly reduced over one week, and Aripiprazole is introduced at a moderate oral dose (Aripiprazole 10 mg). It is then gradually increased to 30 mg/day. After 3 weeks, it is switched to Aripiprazole 400 mg /28 days intramuscularly. At the start of Aripiprazole introduction, there is a good response and a tolerance. With the combination of Clozapine and Aripirazole 400 mg/28 days intramuscularly, there is a noticeable reduction in psychotic symptoms, allowing for the discontinuation of both Quetiapine and benzodiazepines from the patient’s treatment. Results At present, reviewing the outpatient follow-ups the patient has had after hospital discharge, he continues with Aripiprazole 400 mg /28 days intramuscularly, showing overall improvement in functioning. Due to the reduction in sedation, the patient has begun participating in sports and educational activities, which provide him significant personal satisfaction. Conclusions Introducing Aripiprazole in combination with Clozapine significantly reduces psychotic symptoms by controlling positive symptoms, which means the patient does not need to rely on benzodiazepines, allowing for their discontinuation. The reduced level of sedation has enabled the patient to engage in sports and other activities that he previously felt hindered from due to medication. It is indeed very important for any patient to resume leisure and sports activities, but in this specific case, the patient had grade III obesity with associated dyslipidemia.

      "title": "Running in Place: The Challenge of Prescribing Medications Today",
      "abstract": "As the Red Queen said to Alice in Alice in Wonderland, “Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.”1 One could say the same for trying to stay current with pharmacology in clinical practice. Consider this: not long ago, Vicodin was the most commonly prescribed pain medication used to treat moderate to severe pain. Today, Norco is the new recommendation in many institutions, and the standard dose of Vicodin made of 500 mg acetaminophen and 5 mg of hydrocodone bitartrate is essentially disappearing. The provider is faced with a myriad of questions: Why? Are they the same in terms of effectiveness, risks, and cost? Where is the information about this new agent? Here is the story: The dose of Vicodin most often used for postoperative pain contains 500 mg of acetaminophen (Tylenol) and 5 mg of hydrocodone bitartrate. Norco has 325 mg of acetaminophen and either 7.5 mg or 10 mg of hydrocodone bitartrate. High doses of acetaminophen are the leading cause of liver failure in the United States today, and individuals taking combination products for moderate to severe pain easily consume these doses.2 Acetaminophen-related liver failure occurs because a small proportion of acetaminophen is metabolized into a metabolite that is toxic to the liver. In January 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asked drug manufacturers to limit the amount of acetaminophen in combination products to 325 mg.3 Vicodin has been reformulated to contain 325 mg of acetaminophen, but this dose may not be as effective, which is why many prescribers are changing to Norco. Although the rationale for the acetaminophen dose change is clear, the greater challenge is keeping ahead of the curve. This issue of the Journal of Midwifery & Women's Health is the second in our current 2-part series on pharmacology topics, although certainly not the last of pharmacology content in this Journal. This issue contains articles on important clinical and policy topics germane to clinicians who have prescribing privileges in an attempt to help them keep “running.” The articles in this issue address clinical topics of interest but also content that provides health care providers with tools to help them stay up to date as prescribers. As most clinicians already recognize, prescribing drugs is more than memorizing drug cards. Most of us carry a pocket book such as the annual Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia or the smart phone application such as Epocrates or Micromedex. Each of these contain updated specific drug doses, contraindications, and interactions. While these resources are helpful, they are not always as current as might be needed nor in the easiest format for a busy clinician who requires information about conditions and treatments in addition to drug specifics. Several of the articles in this issue contain Web sites and other resources that provide cutting-edge information for the reader. Although clinical information generally changes faster than policy and regulatory restrictions, ultimately, the latter affects prescribing practice in important ways. The article in this issue by Osborne4, 5 is an excellent overview of prescriptive authority for certified nurse-midwives and certified midwives in all 50 states. This article lists the Web sites for each state that summarize regulations pertinent to prescriptive authority for midwives. Check the Web site for your state annually when you renew your state or hospital credentials so you never inadvertently jeopardize your legal practice. Government Web resources tend to be current and often provide needed information. The article by Jacobson and Murphy5, 6 Regarding the Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use focuses on the latest document that modifies the World Health Organization evidence-based material to reflect use in the United States. Downloading this document to a computer or tablet can enable the busy clinician to rapidly identify the contraceptive methods that are indicated or contraindicated for a woman with special conditions such as migraines or seizure disorders. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also maintains an active Web site regarding sexually transmitted infections that complements the article by FitzMaurice et al6, 7 on management strategies for the partners of women who present with gonorrhea and/or chlamydial infections. The CDC Web site also has information pertinent to the article by Laura Manns-James,7 which provides an overall update on current treatment (or nontreatment) of the enigmatic bacterial vaginosis. The primary body responsible for updating and disseminating information about the effects of drugs is the FDA, whose FDA Drug Daily Bulletin is available free of charge (http://www.fdanews.com). Even agents that are carefully studied through rigorous clinical trials may prove to be problematic after they are released in the public marketplace and used by large populations. The FDA MedWatch site summarizes findings from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting Program. Sometimes the drug effects that are noted postmarketing are important enough to necessitate a recall. Critical safety alerts about drugs that you may be prescribing regularly can be delivered to your e-mail if you sign up for the FDA MedWatch e-list (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Medwatch). This issue also contains a variety of topics that not only reflect the scope of midwifery today but also are often difficult to find in current literature in spite of recent changes. For example, the reemergence of nitrous oxide for the laboring woman is summarized in a professional article that can be used as part of documentation for policy changes.8 Older drugs, such as magnesium sulfate, still may surprise clinicians with the emergence of new information.9 Midwives, who may or may not provide direct neonatal care, often talk to pregnant women and new mothers about steroid therapies and their impact on neonatal respiratory function as addressed in the article by Riley et al.10 Treatment of chronic conditions and recognition of advantageous side effects of medications make up 2 articles, 1 on osteoporosis and 1 on noncontraceptive benefits of hormonal methods.11, 12 Pharmaceutical agents also include nutraceuticals or nutritional supplements and botanicals used for therapeutic effects, and an article on omega 3s and ginger completes this issue.13 Appropriate use of drugs in the clinical arena remains a 21st Century challenge. Direct-to-consumer advertising has women asking for specific brand name drugs that may or may not be appropriate. Counterfeit drugs are slowly infiltrating even the largest pharmacies.14 Agents previously considered relatively innocuous (eg, pseudoephedrine) are manipulated in home laboratories to become agents of abuse, necessitating a new behind-the-counter category for a previously over-the-counter drug. The number of drugs recalled primarily for safety or efficacy has slowly been increasing and, in any 1 year, may exceed the number of drugs approved annually. However, indications and packaging of established drugs change, and communication to providers lags. There is no field that illustrates the need to be a lifelong learner more than clinical pharmacology. To paraphrase Alice, all these issues and challenges are simply “Curiouser, and curiouser!”",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most widespread form of diabetes, characterized by chronic hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, and inefficient insulin secretion and action. Primary care in T2DM is pharmacological, using drugs of several groups that include insulin sensitisers (e.g., biguanides, thiazolidinediones), insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulphonylureas, meglinides), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and the newest incretin-based therapies and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors. However, their long-term application can cause many harmful side effects, emphasising the importance of the using natural therapeutic products. Natural health substances including non-flavonoid polyphenols (e.g., resveratrol, curcumin, tannins, and lignans), flavonoids (e.g., anthocyanins, epigallocatechin gallate, quercetin, naringin, rutin, and kaempferol), plant fruits, vegetables and other products (e.g., garlic, green tea, blackcurrant, rowanberry, bilberry, strawberry, cornelian cherry, olive oil, sesame oil, and carrot) may be a safer alternative to primary pharmacological therapy. They are recommended as food supplements to prevent and/or ameliorate T2DM-related complications. In the advanced stage of T2DM, the combination therapy of synthetic agents and natural compounds with synergistic interactions makes the treatment more efficient. In this review, both pharmaceutical drugs and selected natural products, as well as combination therapies, are characterized. Mechanisms of their action and possible negative side effects are also provided.",

      "title": "Role of Nutraceuticals in Treating Erectile Dysfunction <i>via</i> Inhibition of Phosphodiesterase-5 Enzyme: A Mini Review",
      "abstract": "Erectile Dysfunction (ED) is a prevalent sexual health condition affecting a significant portion of the male population worldwide. The conventional therapeutic approaches for ED often involve the use of pharmaceutical agents targeting the phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) enzyme. Currently, treatment with PDE-5 inhibitors is the standard approach for ED, and four PDE-5 inhibitors, namely sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, and avanafil, are in use. However, these pharmaceutical interventions may be associated with adverse effects and limitations. As a result, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternative and complementary treatment options for ED, such as nutraceuticals, which are bioactive compounds derived from natural sources. Nutraceuticals, which include vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary supplements, have gained popularity for their potential health benefits. Certain nutraceuticals have demonstrated the ability to modulate various physiological pathways, including those involved in erectile function. A notable mechanism of action is the inhibition of the PDE5 enzyme, which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cGMP levels. By inhibiting PDE5, nutraceuticals can promote the accumulation of cGMP, leading to enhanced penile blood flow and improved erectile function. A comprehensive analysis of the literature showcases various nutraceutical agents, including plant-derived compounds like flavonoids, polyphenols, and amino acids which have exhibited PDE5 inhibitory effects. Mechanistic insights into their action involve modulation of NO release, cGMP elevation, and relaxation of penile smooth muscles, all critical factors for achieving and sustaining erections. This review focuses on elucidating the role of nutraceuticals in treating erectile dysfunction through the inhibition of the PDE5 enzyme.",

      "abstract": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, adverse effects, and dosage of clomipramine hydrochloride are described, and clinical studies of the use of clomipramine in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), other psychiatric conditions, and chronic pain are reviewed. Clomipramine hydrochloride, a tricyclic antidepressant, is a potent inhibitor of serotonin reuptake and may affect dopaminergic neurotransmission, suppress rapid eye movement sleep, produce changes in electrocardiograms, and elevate plasma prolactin. The drug is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. Peak plasma concentrations occur three to four hours after a 150-mg oral dose. The mean elimination half-life is 39 hours. Some 66% of a dose is excreted in the urine, the remainder being eliminated in the feces. In clinical trials, clomipramine was significantly more effective than placebo, clorgiline, amitriptyline, imipramine, and doxepin in ameliorating the symptoms of OCD. Initial effects are seen at four weeks; improvement may continue for up to 18 weeks. Clomipramine may also be effective in treating panic attacks, phobias, depression, and chronic pain. The most common adverse effects of clomipramine are anticholinergic; others include nausea, seizures, and sexual difficulties. Interactions between clomipramine and barbiturates, haloperidol, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and cigarette smoking have been documented. The usual initial adult dosage is 25-50 mg/day, titrated gradually to 250 mg/day if necessary. Clomipramine hydrochloride is a welcome new agent for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Although its adverse-effect profile is like that of other tricyclic antidepressants, sexual dysfunction and seizures may be more frequent with this agent and limit its use.",

      "abstract": "The desire of improved palatability in orally administered products has prompted the development of numerous formulations with improved performance and acceptability. Orally disintegrating tablets are an emerging trend in novel drug delivery system and have received ever-increasing demand during the last few decades. Superdisintegrants are used to improve the efficacy of solid dosage forms. This is achieved by decreasing the disintegration time which in turn enhances drug dissolution rate. Disintegrants are substances or mixture of substances added the drug formulation that facilitates the breakup or disintegration of tablet or capsule content into smaller particles that dissolve more rapidly than in the absence of disintegrants. In recent years, several newer agents have been developed known as Superdisintegrants. Diverse categories of Superdisintegrants such as synthetic, semi-synthetic, natural and coprocessed blends etc. have been employed to develop effectual mouth dissolving tablets and to overcome the limitations of conventional tablet dosage form. Superdisintegrants are generally used at a low level in the solid dosage form, typically 1- 10 % by weight relative to the total weight of the dosage unit. The present study comprises the various kinds of Superdisintegrants which are being used in the formulation to provide the safer, effective drug delivery with patient's compliance.",

      "abstract": "Overactive bladder is a common disorder that affects over 100 million adults worldwide though its prevalence has been grossly underestimated. The magnitude of this problem is increasing steadily with the growing elderly population, increased incidence of obesity, polypharmacy and increased awareness, making its treatment a challenging task for the physician. The treatment strategies may be nonpharmacologic or pharmacologic or both. Physical therapy techniques, such as bladder training, pelvic-floor exercises and electrical stimulation of the pelvic floor - are the nonpharmacological therapies that mitigate the sufferings of such patients. Anticholinergic agents remain the mainstay of the pharmacological therapy and act by decreasing or inhibiting the intensity of involuntary detrusor contractions. Immediate-release oxybutynin was the first dedicated antimuscarinic agent used for the treatment of overactive bladder symptoms. With geographic differences, other currently approved antimuscarinics are propiverine, tolterodine (immediate and extended release), trospium chloride (immediate and extended release), solifenacin (extended release), darifenacin (extended release) and fesoterodine(extended release). Still in the research phase and for use in refractory OAB are gabapentine and intradetrusor injection of botulinum toxin A. Symptom relief has been observed by more direct neuromodulatory techniques, such as acupuncture, posterior tibial nerve stimulation and sacral nerve stimulation, that address the underlying neurologic condition, although urodynamic data have not corroborated the same. Surgical intervention such as bladder augmentation, may rarely be resorted to in those with refractory urge incontinence and failure of conservative treatments. Eventually, the aim of all the treatment modalities is to improve the patients’ quality of life.

      "title": "Evaluation of Antidepressant Like Activity of Extract of Boerhavia diffusa in Swiss Albino Mice",
      "abstract": "Depression often known as depressive disorder is described by a persistent lack of enjoyment, enthusiasm in pursuits, or melancholy feelings. Depression is not the same as normal mood swings and feelings about day-to-day living. It could affect every aspect of life, including relationships with friends, family, and the community. It could be brought on by or exacerbated by problems at work or in the classroom. This study aims to evaluate antidepressant like activity of ethanolic extract of roots of Boerhavia diffusa (Nyctaginaceae). control and cure of this diseases, a vast variety of medications are used daily. The herbal drugs are biodegradable and are natural medications hence are becoming more and more popular. Using a Soxhlet equipment and a normal extraction procedure, the ethanolic extract was produced. The mice were administered several dosages of the extract (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) in addition to the vehicle (normal saline) for the control group &amp; ARS (Acute Restraint Stress) Group and fluoxetine as the conventional medication. The mice were subjected to ARS and were treated with ethanolic extract of Boerhavia diffusa at a dose of 100mg/kg, 200mg/kg and 400mg/kg respectively. After that they were subjected to animal models, the tail suspension test (TST), force suspension test (FST) to assess the antidepressant potential and open field test (OFT), to assess locomotor &amp; antidepressant potential of administered drug The TST revealed prolonged immobility in the BDEE (Boerhavia diffusa ethanolic extract) treated animals. The crossing over of squares activity in the OFT rose, indicating a decline in depression levels. The mice's FST revealed a decrease in their ability to reach the plateau stage following immobility. According to the study, BDEE demonstrates strong antidepressant effect and offer a natural alternative to pharmaceutical treatment for depression disorders. In futuristic study, further investigation is required to identify certain active molecules and have a deeper comprehension of the underlying processes of action.

      "abstract": "Since the discovery of chlordiazepoxide in the 1950s, benzodiazepines have revolutionized the treatment of anxiety and insomnia, largely because of their improved safety profile compared with barbiturates, formerly the preferred sedative-hypnotic. (1) In addition to their anxiolytic and sedative-hypnotic effects, benzodiazepines exhibit anterograde amnesia, anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. (1) Psychiatrists use benzodiazepines to treat anxiety and sleep disorders, acute agitation, alcohol withdrawal, catatonia, and psychotropic side effects such as akathisia. This article highlights the evidence for using benzodiazepines in anxiety and other disorders and why they generally should not be used for obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (Box 1, page 59). Pharrnacolunetic properties Most benzodiazepines are considered to have similar efficacy; therefore, selection is based on pharmacokinetic considerations.

Dexmedetomidina es un compuesto derivado imidazolico, con una alta afinidad por el receptor α2 adrenergico, siendo un potente agonista sobre el. Se han desarrollado un buen numero de estudios de laboratorio, experimentos con animales y ensayos clinicos controlados sobre voluntarios y sobre pacientes con el objeto de dilucidar las principales caracteristicas farmacologicas de la dexmedetomidina. Como fruto de todos estos trabajos de investigacion se pudo constatar que dexmedetomidina posee propiedades sedantes, hipnoticas, analgesicas, de disminucion de los requerimientos de otros anestesicos, simpaticoliticas y de disminucion de la liberacion de catecolaminas, habiendose desarrollado ensayos clinicos controlados en los que se ha estudiado la aplicacion de estas propiedades farmacologicas antes referidas, para su posible administracion en pacientes ingresados en Unidades de Reanimacion que necesiten de la aplicacion de tecnicas de sedacion y analgesia.

      "title": "Reconsidering the usefulness of long-term high-dose buprenorphine",
      "abstract": "Buprenorphine has been successfully used for decades in the treatment of opioid use disorder, yet there are complexities to its use that warrant attention to maximize its utility. While the package insert of the combination product buprenorphine\\naloxone continues to recommend a maximum dose of 16 mg daily for maintenance, the emergence of fentanyl and synthetic analogs in the current drug supply may be limiting the effectiveness of this standard dose. Many practitioners have embraced and appropriately implemented novel practices to mitigate the sequelae of our current crisis. It has become common clinical practice to stabilize patients with 24 - 32 mg of buprenorphine daily at treatment initiation. Many of these patients, however, are maintained on these high doses (>16 mg/d) indefinitely, even after prolonged stability. Although this may be a necessary strategy in the short term, there is little evidence to support its safety and efficacy, and these high doses may be exposing patients to more complications and side effects than standard doses. Commonly known side effects of buprenorphine that are likely dose-related include hyperhidrosis, sedation, decreased libido, constipation, and hypogonadism. There are also complications related to the active metabolite of buprenorphine (norbuprenorphine) which is a full agonist at the mu opioid receptor and does not have a ceiling on respiratory suppression. Such side effects can lead to medical morbidity as well as decreased medication adherence, and we, therefore, recommend that after a period of stabilization, practitioners consider a trial of decreasing the dose of buprenorphine toward standard dose recommendations. Some patients' path of recovery may never reach this stabilization phase (i.e., several months of adherence to medications, opioid abstinence, and other clinical indicators of stability). Side effects of buprenorphine may not have much salience when patients are struggling for survival and safety, but for those who are fortunate enough to advance in their recovery, the side effects become more problematic and can limit quality of life and adherence.",

The authors report a case of atypical intoxication in a 16-year-old female who consumed cannabis in conjunction with an unusual powdered mixture containing psychotropic substances. The intoxication led to confusion, hallucinations, sinus tachycardia and hospitalization. A comprehensive high-resolution mass spectrometry and liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of her plasma, her urine and a powder found in her possession revealed the presence of the same 5 medicines: citalopram/escitalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine and trihexyphenidyl. This case underscores the intricate interactions between psychoactive substances that are never prescribed together in clinical settings, along with the issue of diverted prescription drugs like trihexyphenidyl. It also emphasizes the potential circulation and use of crushed mixtures of medication for recreational purpose. Fortunately, powder analysis provided crucial insight to understand the intoxication.",

      "abstract": "Lesions of the gastric, duodenal and intestinal mucosae are found in large numbers of patients using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); however, no markers have yet been isolated to identify patients at risk for developing gastrointestinal problems or to predict which patients with lesions are at risk for developing catastrophic complications. There appears to be a poor correlation between the presence of ulcer disease and the appearance of symptoms while patients are using NSAIDs. The ideal treatment--namely, withdrawal from NSAIDs--may not always be practicable in patients who require the analgesic benefit of these otherwise generally innocuous agents. It is incumbent on the clinician to identify the agent most appropriate for the needs of the individual, and to supplement NSAID therapy, where appropriate, with a means of preventing or minimizing adverse effects. Four classes of drugs are used to prevent NSAID-related gastric mucosal damage: histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists (ranitidine, cimetidine, nizatidine, famotidine); gastric acid-pump inhibitor (omeprazole); barrier agent (sucralfate); and prostaglandin analogue (misoprostol). The current therapies (H2 antagonists and barriers) have not lived up to their promise for preventing gastroduodenal erosion. Moreover, such protection as they provide is limited to the duodenal mucosa; they afford no protection to the gastric mucosa. Preliminary data indicate that an acid pump inhibitor may be useful, but large-scale studies have yet to be reported. Acute and long-term studies of the prostaglandin analogue misoprostol have shown that this agent has an important role as an adjunctive therapy to prevent both gastric and duodenal ulceration due to NSAIDs.",

      "abstract": "This article answers some questions about use of emergency contraceptive pills (ECP) in the US. It is acceptable to prescribe ECPs over the telephone. ECPs should not be given to women with severe migraine headaches with neurologic impairment. ECPs are acceptable for women who are smokers and over 35 years old, diabetics with vascular disease, women with a history of severe migraine, and women with a benign or malignant liver tumor. Women who seek ECPs over 72 hours after unprotected sexual intercourse could have ECPs, insertion of a Copper T380 IUD, or Ru-486, when available in the US. Lo-Ovral4+4 is the preferred ECP. Ovral2+2 is less often available and tends to cost more. An ECP prescription might indicate Phenergan (25 mg), 4 tablets, taken between 6 and 7 PM, and repeated in 12 hours. Another ECP prescription might indicate Lo-Ovral (21-pill pack), 4 tablets taken one half hour after anti-nausea medication, and repeated in 12 hours. If nausea is severe from the first or second dose of Lo-Ovral, an extra tablet of Phenergan may be taken. For continued contraception, the patient should be prescribed a low-dose pill and not a 50 mcg pill. The most common transition from ECP combined pills to regular oral contraception is to prescribe 4 tablets followed by 4 tablets 12 hours later, and to start a new package of pills the Sunday after menstruation begins. Nonlapsed pill taking involves taking the 4 tablets, followed by 4 tablets in 12 hours, and 1 tablet taken daily for the next 13 days (with backup contraception the first 7 days), and a lapse for 7 days. Nothing needs to be done for vomiting. Women are not likely to abuse this option. It should be widely known and appreciated that mistakes do happen, emergency contraception does work, and women should be aware of ECPs. 98% of women bleed by 21 days after ECP use. There appears to be no increased risk of birth defects among pill users who become pregnant.",

      "title": "Alternative drugs to phenobarbital in canine epileptic patients",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological diseases in companion animals. The first choice for anti-epileptic drugs has consistently been phenobarbital. However, the presence of side effects or contraindications for its use, or poor control of seizures in some canine patients, may require the replacement of phenobarbital, or the addition of more anti-epileptic drugs to the treatment protocol. This article describes the indications, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, recommended doses and adverse effects of anti-epileptic drugs whic can be used in place of phenobarbital. A review of the current literature and the administration of each anti-epileptic drug in veterinary practice is also presented. Bromide and imepitoin are overall good options for adjunctive or alternative anti-epileptic medications. However, the pros and cons of each drug need to be considered, in order to choose the most suitable therapeutic protocol for each case. Pharmaco-resistant epilepsy occurs when seizure activity fails to be controlled with two or more anti-epileptic drugs. In the latter situation, some more recently studied alternative anti-epileptic drugs can be considered, such as levetiracetam, gabapentin, pregabalin, zonisamide, felbamate and topiramate. Non-medical options include a medium chain triglyceride oil enriched diet, and cannabidiol.",

Moreover, natural and synthetic estrogens, the use of certain drugs and the use of cosmetics with certain components have been implicated as etiologic factors. For the treatment of melasma, the elimination of the factors that are associated with the abnormality of pigmentation, is essential (discontinuation of birth control pills, avoidance of sun exposure). From the many medications that have been used in the treatment of melasma, Hydroquinone alone at a concentration of 2‐5%, or in combination with tretinoin or tretinoin and corticosteroids, is now the most widely used preparations. New phenolic compounds and Azelaic acid are also used. Medium depth chemical peeling alone or in combination with other bleaching agents has also been tried with success in some cases. Finally, the use of lasers is discussed.",

      "title": "Efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal compound in the treatment of functional constipation",
      "abstract": "Functional constipation refers to constipation without organic lesions caused by dietary factors, mood depression, changes in life rules, and poor bowel habits. Clinically, constipation is mainly manifested by changes of stool texture, difficulty or lack of bowel movement, and dry stool. Sometimes, it can be accompanied by abdominal distension and abdominal discomfort. Chinese herbal compound is a prescription which is composed of 2 or more medicinal flavors and is designed for relatively certain diseases and syndromes. Clinical studies have shown that TCM compounds have a good therapeutic effect on functional constipation, but there is no evidence of evidence-based medicine. The purpose of this study is to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCM compounds in the treatment of functional constipation, and to provide evidence-based basis for the clinical application of TCM compounds in the treatment of constipation.A systematic search was performed on English database (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library) and Chinese database (CNKI, Wanfang, Weipu (VIP), CBM), in addition to the manual retrieval of Baidu and Google academic for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the treatment of functional constipation with Chinese herbal compound. The retrieval time limit was from the establishment of the database to August 2020. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data and evaluated the quality of the included studies. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software.In this study, the efficacy and safety of TCM herbal compounds in the treatment of functional constipation were evaluated by the overall effective rate, recovery rate, colonic transmission function, and other indicators.This study will provide reliable evidence-based evidence for the clinical application of Chinese herbal compound in the treatment of functional constipation.DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/D5ECF.",

      "abstract": "Following the demonstration by C. Heymans and others that α-dinitrophenol (1-2-4) produces fever in experimental animals, we have attempted to determine the cause of the rise of temperature, the effects on various functions, and its possible therapeutic applications.Dinitrophenol produces fever in pigeons, rats, rabbits, cats, dogs, and man, in doses of 5 to 40 mg. per kilo, the exact dose depending on the species and route of administration. After subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, the temperature begins to rise in about 10 minutes and steadily increases until the maximum of up to 4°C. increase is reached, in from one-half to 4 hours. Then there may be a subsidence of the fever with complete recovery, or, if a fatal dose has been given, a sudden stoppage of respiration and circulation, and death. Rigor sets in at once.Preceding the onset of the fever, and throughout the entire febrile period, there is a marked respiratory stimulation, including both the rate and depth, so the total ventilation increases up to 10 times the resting values. The respiratory stimulation may be prevented or diminished by large doses of morphine. Conversely, dinitrophenol increases the ventilation to better than the normal values after it has been decreased by toxic or fatal doses of morphine, chloral, alcohol or barbital. The stimulation compares favorably with that caused by caffeine. The improvement in respiration does not prevent death, if otherwise fatal doses of these hypnotics have been given; thus indicating that the respiratory depression per se is possibly not the primary cause of death from the hypnotics. During the period of maximum respiratory stimulation, there is little or no change in blood pressure and pulse rate, and the sugar, pH and CO2-combining power of plasma are unaltered.",

Ketoconazole can be taken with or without food; however, in studies, Ketoconazole was administered with meals. It requires a low pH for absorption. If concomitant antacids, anticholinergics, and H2-blockers are needed, they should be given at least two hours after administration of Ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system. It is available in 200 mg tablets. Ketoconazole should be started at 200 mg daily; in very serious infections or if clinical responsiveness is insufficient within the expected time, the dose may be increased to 400 mg once daily.",

More than 600 references are cited. Endrin is used chiefly as an insecticide, particularly for the control of lepidopterous larvae that infest cotton crops. In 1971, total US consumption of endrin exceeded 600,000 kg. Endrin is highly toxic to mammals, birds, fish, and insects, but is generally nontoxic to plants. Acute exposure of mammals to endrin typically results in central nervous disorders, with convulsions leading to death through respiratory failure within two days. Symptoms of acute endrin exposure in humans include convulsions, vomiting, abdominal pain, nausea, dizziness, and headaches. Chronic exposure of mammals to endrin may result in damage to the liver, kidney, heart, brain, lung, adrenal gland, and spleen. Behavioral abnormalities, reproductive disorders, changes in carbohydrate metabolism, changes in blood composition, and other effects secondary to central nervous system disorders have also been observed following chronic exposure of mammals to sublethal doses of endrin. No malignancies attributable to endrin have been reported, but chromosomal abnormalities and teratogenesis have been induced in several mammalian species by endrin. Endrin is dissipated from the environment by photochemical and thermal decomposition and by microbial degradation. Relatively few bacteriamore » can degrade endrin, but many species of algae and fungi exhibit this ability. Environmental contamination by endrin appears to be restricted to areas where the compound is used intensively; background concentrations in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere at locations distant from areas of heavy use are generally below the levels of detection.« less",

      "abstract": "This chapter provides examples of improving antimicrobial dosing by employing pharmacodynamic principles and demonstrates methods to develop clinical programs based on these concepts. The application of antimicrobial pharmacodynamics to daily clinical practice is derived from early implementation of clinical pharmacy services, specifically pharmacokinetic consulting. Antimicrobials exhibit two primary patterns of bacterial killing: concentration-dependent and concentration-independent, or time-dependent, killing. Aminoglycoside-associated nephrotoxicity is caused by accumulation of the drug molecule in the proximal renal tubular epithelial cells, inducing cellular toxicity and necrosis. Like the aminoglycosides, metronidazole displays concentration-dependant bactericidal activity. Accordingly, at Hartford Hospital, twice-daily dosing of metronidazole combined with a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftizoxime or ceftriaxone has replaced the use of the cephamycins in intra-abdominal procedures. Piperacillin/tazobactam has become a popular antimicrobial in the treatment of nosocomial infectious processes and is used frequently in the institutional setting. As a result, this agent is often responsible for a large percentage of antimicrobial expenditures.",

      "abstract": "Objectives MDAI (5,6‐methylenedioxy‐2‐aminoindane; 6,7‐dihydro‐5H‐cyclopenta[f][1,3]benzodioxol‐6‐amine; ‘sparkle’; ‘mindy’) is a psychoactive substance, sold primarily over the Internet and in ‘head’ shops as a ‘legal high’. Synthesised and used as a research chemical in the 1990s, MDAI has structural similarities to MDMA (3,4‐methylenedioxy‐ N ‐methylamphetamine) and shares its behavioural properties. Recreational use of MDAI appears to have started in Europe around 2007, with a noticeable increase after 2009 in the UK and other countries. Calls to National Poisons Information Services started in 2010, although there were few presentations to emergency departments by patients complaining of undesirable physical and psychiatric effects after taking MDAI. Recreational use of this drug has been reported only occasionally by online user fora. There is little scientifically based literature on the pharmacological, physiological, psychopharmacological, toxicological and epidemiological characteristics of this drug. Methods Recent literature (including ‘grey’) was searched to update what is known about MDAI, especially on its toxicity. Results The resultant information is presented, including on the first three UK deaths involving MDAI use in 2011 and 2012. ‘Serotonin syndrome’ appears to be a possible factor in these fatalities. Conclusion It is vital that any other cases, including non‐fatal overdoses, are documented so that a scientific evidence base can be established for them.

      "title": "Real-World Treatment Strategies to Improve Outcomes in Patients With Chronic Idiopathic Constipation and Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Constipation",
      "abstract": "Chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation are complex, overlapping conditions. Although multiple guidelines have informed healthcare providers on appropriate treatment options for patients with chronic idiopathic constipation and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, little direction is offered on treatment selection. First-line treatment options usually include fiber and over-the-counter osmotic laxatives; however, these are insufficient for many individuals. When these options fail, prescription secretagogues (plecanatide, linaclotide, lubiprostone, and tenapanor [pending commercial availability]), or serotonergic agents (prucalopride and tegaserod) are generally preferred. Individuals experiencing concurrent abdominal pain and/or bloating may experience greater overall improvements from prescription therapies because these agents have been proven to reduce concurrent abdominal and bowel symptoms. Should initial prescription treatments fail, retrying past treatment options (if not adequately trialed initially), combining agents from alternative classes, or use of adjunctive therapies may be considered. Given the broad spectrum of available agents, therapy should be tailored by mutual decision-making between the patient and practitioner. Overall, patients need to be actively monitored and managed to maximize clinical outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Most anesthetics in general use ten years ago had important undesirable properties which limited the seope of their usefulness or were inherently dangerous in the seriously ill patient. New inhalation, intravenous, and loeal anestheties have been synthesized sinee then which more closely fill the needs of the clinical anesthesiologist and the patient. Halothane and methoxyflurane have obvious advantages over cyclopropane and diethyl ether because they are nonexplosive and cause less metabolic disturbance. We would welcome a new gaseous anesthetic more potent than nitrous oxide, less potent than cyclopropane, and completely free from adverse effects on the myocardium and the liver. Of the intravenous anesthetics, only methohexital appears to have even slight advantages over thiopental. We still need an intravenous anesthetic that is more rapidly detoxified or exereted, is a potent hypnotic and analgesic, and is free from adverse effects on the medulla and neuromuscular apparatus. The quest for less toxic and more potent or longer‐acting local anesthetic agents has resulted in the development of prilocaine and mepivacaine. Laboratory and clinical studies of both of these agents have failed to demonstrate any clear advantages over older ones.",

      "abstract": "Figure: Characteristic skin popping scars in a long-term heroin user who ran out of veins and used subcutaneous injections.FigureGiven the omnipresent yet ever-increasing incidence of opioid overdose, it seems like the right time to review what 10 years ago seemed like a relatively straightforward and simple approach to opioid overdose. Back then, opioid overdose for the emergency clinician mostly meant heroin and the occasional misuse of oxycodone or hydrocodone. Today, however, numerous opioids, many of them undetected by routine drug screening and many with incredibly powerful effects, have emerged as relatively new and much more potent clinical felons. Fortunately, naloxone, a very safe and effective antagonist, is available if opioid overdose is suspected. Previously, administering a large dose of naloxone used to be a standard part of the coma cocktail, given even before the diagnosis was certain. Opioids were not the problem if the patient did not respond. This rather simple concept has changed significantly over the past decade. Many of those given naloxone today are addicted, and will experience withdrawal if naloxone is used. Death from opioid overdose, from prescription opioids or heroin, is a somewhat different animal today. Management of Opioid Analgesic Overdose Boyer EW New Engl J Med 2012;367[2]:146 This is a nice review for clinicians involved in managing opioid overdose. The author states that opioid overdose results from excessive prescribing practices, inadequate understanding of potential risks on the patient's part, errors in drug administration, and most commonly, outright drug abuse. Opioid toxicity involves a number of organ systems. A wide variety of available opioids results in significant variations in duration of action and alterations of normal pharmacological properties. Physician prescriptions for opioid analgesics increased by an amazing 700 percent from 1997 to 2007. The number of grams of methadone prescribed over the same period increased by more than 1200 percent.Figure: Naloxone is the perfect antidote for an obtunded patient with a suspected opioid overdose except that opioid withdrawal may be precipitated with complete reversal. The goal is to support respirations and avoid withdrawal, not an easy goal to obtain in the ED. A small initial dose (0.04 mg) has been recommended for that reason. If the first dose is ineffective, use increasing amounts every two minutes until a 10-15mg dose is administered. Using a small naloxone dose requires close monitoring in case toxicity recurs. Some clinicians will start with 0.4-1 mg as the initial dose and deal with withdrawal if it occurs. Naloxone is available in 0.4 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml concentrations.Figure: Needle tracks on the neck from using the external jugular vein.Mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors are widely distributed throughout the body, particularly in the central nervous system. The mu receptor is responsible for the majority of clinical effects caused by opioids. Opioid tolerance involves the progressive inability of the mu receptor to propagate its normal signal after opioid binding, resulting in receptor desensitization. The prolonged use of opioids results in tolerance of the analgesic and respiratory depressive effects of all opioids. Once absorbed, opioids undergo first order elimination pharmacokinetics, defined as a constant fraction of the drug being converted over a given period of time. This results in a half-life elimination profile. The system can be saturated with an overdose, however, producing zero kinetics where only a small given proportion of the drug is eliminated per time. Clinical manifestations of opioid overdose produce a so-called opioid toxidrome. This includes respiratory depression leading to apnea, decreased mental status resulting in stupor or coma, and miosis (pinpoint pupils). The pupillary response may vary because of the presence of other substances, and not all opioids produce pinpoint pupils, but meperidine, propoxyphene, and tramadol, for example, produce dilated pupils. The diagnosis is relatively straightforward, and a variety of other specifics must be considered. Opioids can produce pulmonary edema, clandestine-retained fentanyl patches can result in continued opioid release, acetaminophen can cause concomitant liver damage, and some opioids can cause seizures (propoxyphene and meperidine most commonly). Prolonged immobilization can result in a rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuric renal failure, or compartment syndrome. A persistent nonresponsive state in a cold environment may produce hypothermia. The use of many opioids results in a positive urine drug screen, but commonly used hospital tests do not routinely identify methadone, fentanyl, and even oxycodone. A routine urine drug screen should not be used to determine treatment or to confirm or rule out opioid toxicity. The standard opioid antidote, naloxone, is a competitive mu opioid receptor antagonist. It reverses all signs of opioid intoxication and can be administered IM, IV, intranasally, or via the lung. It has minimal bioavailability after oral administration, which prompted its addition to pills to deter grinding and subsequent intravenous injection. The author states that the initial dose of naloxone is 0.04 mg, with increasing doses every two minutes for a last dose of 15 mg before concluding that naloxone will not be effective. It is not explained in the paper, but that dose is for a patient still breathing, not apneic. The duration of the effect of naloxone is transient, and recurrent respiratory depression or the return of other signs of toxicity indicates the need for repeat doses or a continuous naloxone infusion. Naloxone will produce withdrawal in patients who are opioid-dependent. Opioid withdrawal is very unpleasant, consisting of yawning, lacrimation, diaphoresis, myalgia, vomiting, and diarrhea, but these symptoms are not life-threatening. Seizures do not occur from opioid withdrawal. The use of low-dose naloxone can lessen opioid toxicity without provoking withdrawal. The author said patients should be observed for four to six hours following improvement with naloxone before considering discharge. Opioid overdose in children may be characterized by the delayed onset of toxicity and prolonged toxic effects. This author suggests that any young child who is exposed to opioids other than an immediate-release formulation should be routinely admitted to the hospital for 24 hours of observation even if the specific ingestion cannot be confirmed. This includes exposure to buprenorphine-naloxone products (Suboxone). Comment: The term opiate refers to drugs that are derived from opium, such as morphine. Drugs that are semisynthetic or synthetic (methadone, oxycodone, fentanyl) but not directly derived from opium are called opioids. Most clinicians use the term opioids to refer to any drug that acts on opioid receptors and produces morphine-like effects. Diagnosing Opioid Toxicity: Opioid toxicity is obvious in patients who have ingested or otherwise used heroin or oral opioids in the absence of other substances. The toxidrome consists of decreased mental status leading to coma, decreased respirations leading to apnea, and pinpoint pupils. But life is not that simple in the ED these days. It's actually unusual to obtain pure heroin on the street. The majority of street heroin is either fentanyl, contains fentanyl derivatives, or is heroin mixed with fentanyl or a number of other substances added for more pronounced effects for the user. A user who injects heroin will experience well-known effects if they are, in fact, receiving the same drug and the same dose that he has been sold in the past, but death from respiratory depression can rapidly ensue if the concentration of heroin is higher, it has been increasing over the years, or if it is mixed with a heroin substitute for an added kick. An opioid overdose patient dying in the hospital is quite unusual, and most deaths occur before medical assistance arrives. This has been why police, EMS, and even patients and their relatives are being increasingly offered nasally administered naloxone to carry with them. Death is usually averted if the patient can be kept alive until he reaches the hospital.Figure: If a peripheral vein is not available, consider injecting naloxone via the external jugular vein.Simply intubating patients with opioid overdose will usually be all that is needed because opioids cause death by respiratory depression, followed by cardiac arrest. Occasionally hypotension and pulmonary edema will require additional interventions. The patient may have opioid toxicity, but the concomitant use of ethanol or sedative-hypnotics, particularly benzodiazepines, will cause additional CNS depression and often negate the expected response to naloxone. Opioid use can predispose patients to head trauma, which can simulate an opioid-like state, so concomitant head trauma in someone with an actual opioid overdose is always a consideration. The serum glucose should also be routinely checked early in the course. Opioids usually spare direct cardiac effects, but recent overdose of massive amounts of loperamide (Imodium) used as an opioid substitute has been reported to cause wide complex tachycardia. Loperamide abuse is likely underappreciated. (Read “Opioid Abusers Using Loperamide to Get High or Alleviate Withdrawal, with Fatal Consequences” by EMN columnist Leon Gussow, MD, at http://bit.ly/EMN-ToxJuly16.) Ordering a routine urine drug screen is second nature to the emergency clinician, but acute opioid poisoning is a clinical diagnosis whose management will not change based on its result. A positive test can indicate use but not intoxication, and many of the synthetic opioids will produce a negative screen. Many clinicians do not know exactly what is detected by their hospital's urine drug screen, and laboratories vary widely. Simply stated, the urine drug screen is of minimal value in the acute clinical management of most overdose patients, but it is a universal test. I recommend using it liberally, not to dictate initial management but to garner other useful information. No absolute indications for a urine drug screen exist in the ED, but it will generally detect even small amounts of morphine (the metabolite of heroin) and codeine, and perhaps or perhaps not, hydrocodone and hydromorphone. Oxycodone require a supplemental test. None will detect methadone, fentanyl, fentanyl derivatives, tramadol, propoxyphene, or meperidine, but these can be ordered as separate tests not available in the ED. The Use of Naloxone: Naloxone will reverse all opioids, but the effective dose is wide ranging in today's opioid epidemic. This author's recommendation of 0.04 mg as an initial dose is quite small and unlikely to reverse a significant opioid overdose totally. This minimal dose is suggested for those who still have respirations (are not apneic) to ameliorate toxicity but to avoid opioid withdrawal. It now appears to be medically incorrect to induce withdrawal in an unconscious opioid addict; go figure. The author's goal is to produce adequate ventilations but not necessarily a normal mental status. Nice effect if you can get it. I am uncomfortable with that goal in the ED. I would rather have an awake patient than one still obtunded. It's appropriate to increase the dose if the prior dose is ineffective, but I see no reason not to begin with a larger dose in someone who is significantly intoxicated. The old standard doses of naloxone just don't cut it with the current use of fentanyl and acetyl fentanyl. The recently available naloxone nasal spray delivers 4 mg per dose. The self-administered naloxone injection (Evzio) delivers 0.4 mg per dose. Injectable naloxone is available in a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml. I may be old-school, but I still believe that one should administer at least 0.4 mg of naloxone IV in the ED as your initial dose. If this is not effective, I would then go directly to a 2 mg, then a 5 mg, then a 10 mg dose before giving up. A patient who stays awake or stable after your initial reversal with naloxone does not need continued doses of this antidote. Naloxone in doses of up to 2 mg will lose its effect in about two hours, so prolonged observation after initial reversal is required. I would go right to a small-dose, continuous naloxone intravenous infusion if a patient responds to naloxone initially and then sedates again and requires more naloxone. The easiest way to provide this is to mix 10 mg of naloxone in a liter of saline and administer 40-50 ml an hour (0.04-0.5 mg), adjusting dosages upward or downward. This will usually keep the patient stable without producing severe withdrawal. It is true that complete naloxone reversal will produce withdrawal in many patients, but not all are addicted. Attempting to treat serious intoxication and prevent withdrawal is a tightrope that is not easily walked in a busy ED. This requires continuous monitoring, a luxury not always available. I would much rather have an awake person in mild withdrawal than one who must be monitored closely because I was afraid to reverse the opioid overdose fully for fear of producing withdrawal. Opioid toxicity recurs unpredictably. One can treat withdrawal with 0.2 to 0.3 mg of clonidine, a small amount of benzodiazepines, or both, but producing withdrawal will often prompt many patients to attempt to sign out against medical advice. Some will just up and leave. I would not allow someone to leave the ED in less than two hours if he were significantly intoxicated by opioids and responded to naloxone. That often causes significant strife and arguments. One can clearly finesse the approach or otherwise negotiate with such patients, but attempting to predict the subsequent course of someone whose naloxone has only been partially metabolized is impossible. The patient put into withdrawal by your efforts will often leave the ED and reuse the opioid, occasionally with a fatal outcome. Most heroin overdoses will not require more than one dose of naloxone because of the short half-life of heroin. All bets are off with prescription opioid overdoses or today's street heroin, scenarios that often put the emergency clinician in a no-win situation. Read InFocus and Earn CME!

Prescription Opioid Overdose Data Overdose deaths involving prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999, and so have sales of these prescription drugs. More than 165,000 people died in the United States from overdoses related to prescription opioids from 1999 to 2014. Opioid prescribing continues to fuel the epidemic. Today, at least half of all U.S. opioid overdose deaths involve a prescription opioid. More than 14,000 people died from overdoses involving prescription opioids in 2014. Most Commonly Overdosed Opioids The most common drugs involved in prescription opioid overdose deaths are: Methadone Oxycodone (such as Oxycontin) Hydrocodone (such as Vicodin) Overdose Deaths Among those who died from prescription opioid overdose between 1999 and 2014: Overdose rates were highest among people ages 25 to 54. Overdose rates were higher among non-Latino whites and American Indian or Alaskan Natives compared with non-Latino blacks and Latinos. Men were more likely to die from overdose, but the mortality gap between men and women is closing.

Even though the evidence for the role of calcium remains weak, drugs affecting calcium might be useful in the treatment of anxiety disorders. One of these compounds, verapamil, has been used to treat mood disorders. Calcium channel blockers have also been tried in other indications such as premenstrual syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, schizophrenia, tardive dyskinesia, and Tourette's syndrome. However, the number of articles on the use of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of anxiety disorders is low. Three reports (two open, one double-blind) described some success in the treatment of panic disorder with verapamil, diltiazem, or nimodipine and one open-label study described unsuccessful treatment of anxiety and phobia with nifedipine in patients with various anxiety disorders. Further double-blind placebo-controlled studies of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of anxiety disorders are warranted to determine a possible role of these compounds in the armamentarium of antianxiety drugs.",

Opioid antagonists, in particular naltrexone, are the unique medication for the specific pharmacotherapy of opioid dependence currently approved in the Russian Federation. The main problem that considerably reduces the efficacy and restricts the use of naltrexone in the treatment of opioid dependence is the problem of compliance. Nevertheless, in the double blind randomized placebo-controlled trials, we have demonstrated the higher efficacy of peroral naltrexone for the remission stabilization compared to analogous foreign publications. It might be explained by the cultural specifics of the family in the Russia Federation, in particular, by the possibility to control the treatment by relatives of the patient. However the possibilities of this control are significantly reduced as the patient gets older. Long-acting depot formulations of naltrexone (implantable and injectable) are more effective than peroral ones that allows to solve the problem of compliance and opens new perspectives in the treatment of opiate dependence.",

      "title": "Dexmedetomidine as premedication in children: Status at the beginning of 2017",
      "abstract": "An ideal premedication for children should have anxiolytic, sedative, analgesic and antisialagogue action when administered non-parenterally, with rapid onset, short duration of action, and devoid of adverse haemodynamic and respiratory effects. Premedication should allow easy parental separation, good mask acceptance, excellent cooperation during intravenous (IV) cannulation, reduce anaesthetic requirement and decrease the incidence of post-operative emergence delirium. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), an alpha 2 agonist, has many good pharmacological properties. However, the onset time is 30–45 min. It has cardiovascular effects such as bradycardia and hypotension. In 2011, Mason and Lerman[1] wrote 'As a premedication, DEX does not hold great promise. Its slow and unpredictable onset and maintenance of anxiolysis, regardless of route of administration, together with its prolonged offset make it an unsuitable substitute for oral midazolam'. In next 5 years, multiple studies were done. Peng et al.[2] performed a meta-analysis of 13 randomised controlled trials up to April 2014 involving 1190 patients. When compared with midazolam, premedication with DEX resulted in an increase in satisfactory separation from parents (risk difference [RD] =0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.06–0.30, P = 0.003) and a decrease in the use of post-operative rescue analgesia (RD = −0.19, 95% CI: −0.29–−0.09, P = 0.0003). Children treated with DEX had a lower heart rate before induction. The incidence of satisfactory mask induction, emergence agitation (EA) and post-operative nausea and vomiting did not differ between the groups. DEX was superior in providing satisfactory IV cannulation as compared to placebo. In this issue of IJA, Kumar et al.[3] have shown that intranasal DEX at a dose of 1 μg/kg produced superior sedation scores at separation and induction but normal behavioural scores in comparison to oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg in paediatric patients. It is not clear from the figures presenting haemodynamic data about onset and duration of changes, sample variability and significance levels at all time points. In a Cochrane database of systematic reviews, Costi et al.[4] investigated effect of DEX on incidence of sevoflurane-induced EA. Twelve studies investigating this intervention found a large overall reduction in risk of EA, with I2 = 0 (relative risk = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.29–0.47). An additional four studies reported lower EA scores for this intervention. However, only in one study, DEX was administered orally. In ten studies, IV DEX was used. There is a very limited literature available for the use of DEX as oral premedication.[5678] In this issue of IJA, Kavya Prabhu and Mehandale[9] have compared oral DEX 4 μg/kg versus oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg for the incidence of EA, following sevoflurane anaesthesia. The study has limitations including small sample size (45 patients in each group), wide variety of surgeries, and use of two different types of airway devices, i.e., endotracheal tube or supraglottic device. Two different scales were used for the measurement of EA. This makes definitive interpretation of the results difficult. In all, so far, there is good evidence that intranasal DEX 1 μg/kg as premedication provides good to excellent separation from parents. However, there is not sufficient evidence showing benefits of oral premedication with DEX on the incidence and severity of EA with modern inhalational agents. An ideal premedication needs to be simple, safe and effective. Future research needs to be directed on following aspects: Effect of intranasal DEX on quality of mask acceptance and IV cannulation. Ultimately, these are the two most important aspects for smooth conduct of anaesthesia Determine the effective dose (ED) 50 and ED 95 of intranasal DEX for various age groups. Zhang et al.[10] determined the ED 50 for rescue sedation using intranasal DEX after failed chloral hydrate sedation for magnetic resonance imaging in children. ED 50 was 0.4 μg/kg (95% CI = 0.34–0.50) in children aged 1–6 months, 0.5 μg/kg (95% CI = 0.48–0.56) in children aged 7–12 months, 0.9 μg/kg (95% CI = 0.83–0.89) in children aged 13–24 months and 1.0 μg/kg (95% CI = 0.94–1.07) in children aged 25–36 months A study with large homogenous sample for assessing effect of oral DEX is required. A dose finding study is also essential. The current dose selection is empirical. This is necessary as bioavailability of DEX following orogastric route is 16%, as compared to intranasal 65%, buccal 82% and intramuscular 104%[1112] Effect on haemodynamics for a longer length of time. This can be best carried out during procedural sedation where other confounding factors are eliminated. This is essential to prepare discharge criteria when patient has received DEX as premedication. Few cautions need to be exercised: Simplicity of non-IV administration may lead to widespread use by non-anaesthesiologists and nursing staff. Accuracy of dose calculation, administration and vigilant monitoring of haemodynamics is warranted DEX interferes with thermoregulation by diminishing shivering, vasoconstriction and non-shivering thermogenesis. Activation of hypothalamic adrenergic receptors decreases centrally mediated metabolic heat production.[13] There is danger for developing hypothermia. Incidence of bradycardia following hypothermia has been reported. Use of external warming devices is recommended particularly for infants.[14] If these precautions are exercised, intranasal DEX has very good potential as a premedication in the paediatric age group.",

      "title": "Effects of Chronic Treatment with Bupropion on Nicotine, Cocaine, and Nicotine + Cocaine Polydrug Self‐Administration",
      "abstract": "Clinical reports suggest that cocaine and nicotine are often used concurrently; however, medications to manage this form of polydrug addiction are lacking. Bupropion (Zyban), a dual monoamine (dopamine/norepinephrine) transport inhibitor, is a non‐nicotine‐based pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation that has been approved by the FDA and is currently used medicinally. The present study was conducted to investigate the potential utility of bupropion in managing nicotine + cocaine polydrug addiction by comparing its effectiveness in decreasing intravenous (IV) nicotine, cocaine, and nicotine + cocaine polydrug self‐administration. Adult rhesus monkeys responded under a second order (FR2 (VR16:S)) schedule of reinforcement for food or IV nicotine (0.001–0.0032 mg/kg), cocaine (0.0032–0.01 mg/kg), or nicotine (0.001–0.0032 mg/kg) + cocaine (0.0032–0.01 mg/kg) mixtures during four 1‐hr daily sessions. The effects of chronic treatment (5–10 days) with bupropion (1.0 – 1.8 mg/kg/hr, IV) on food‐ and drug‐maintained responding were then assessed. Consistent with our previous findings, combinations of nicotine (0.001 or 0.0032 mg/kg/inj) + a low dose of cocaine (0.0032 mg/kg/inj) were self‐administered to a greater extent than either drug alone. Results further indicate that consistent or significant alterations in responding for nicotine alone or cocaine alone were not observed during chronic treatment with bupropion; however, averaged data revealed dose‐dependent reductions in responding maintained by each combination of nicotine + cocaine studied. No consistent effects on food‐maintained responding were observed during bupropion treatment regimens. These results suggest that bupropion deserves further consideration for its potential use in the management of nicotine + cocaine polydrug addiction.

The drug was given at two dose levels, 24 mg. daily for four weeks followed by 48 mg. for two weeks. The effect on a number of other blood constituents commonly estimated in clinical chemistry was also assessed and these results are discussed.The drug had no effect on excretion of the connective tissue products, calcium, total hydroxyproline and glycosaminoglycans which suggests that its effects are primarily on mucus secretions and unlikely to affect connective tissue and ground substance throughout the body.

The US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval of Concerta in 2000 followed by approval of additional long-acting methylphenidate (Ritalin LA; Metadate CD) and amphetamine formulations (Adderall XR) expanded the repertoire. By providing sustained efficacy for most of the school day, mid-day administration is avoided, privacy is preserved, and adherence to treatment improves. In 2001, an isomer preparation of methylphenidate, Focalin, was approved, and in 2002, Strattera, a selective noradrenergic agent expanded treatment options to non-controlled agents. At this time, stimulant preparations continue to remain the first-line agents due to their unparalleled efficacy and safety record.

We suspected adverse drug reaction as per the temporal relationship. After reviewing previous literatures and database (e.g. Micromedex, UpToDate.) we found that oral ulcers are not proved as an adverse reaction due to Cefpodoxime Proxetil. These rare cases mainly occur due to lack of rapid diagnostic tools, which can concomitantly cause antibiotic resistance in patients and can be a public threat in near future. After prescribing such drugs monitoring of patient is required to prevent any harmful effects. Clinical Pharmacist can play vital role in this field of healthcare.

      "title": "Adult procedural sedation",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review The increasing request for procedural sedation will create in the upcoming future the need for a specific training in delivering care to patients in a continuum of sedation, whose effects and adverse events are unpredictable. The main debate in the past years has been focused on using drugs that could have few adverse effects and could be considered well tolerated when administered by a nonanaesthesiologist. Propofol remains the most used drug for procedural sedation, but given its side-effects, its administration is limited and suggested only when an anaesthesiologist is available. The main studies recently appearing in the literature are focusing on the use of alternative drugs such as dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, fospropofol, ketofol and remimazolam. The current study is an overview of the different fields of procedural sedation, describing the evidence from the published studies and some upcoming studies. Recent findings Propofol is still considered as the drug of choice, and a recent study on its administration in the emergency department by nonanaesthesiologists has revealed a reduced number of adverse events. Dexmedetomidine is considered, at present, the most commonly used alternative to propofol, given its greater safety in terms of haemodynamic stability and lack of respiratory depression. Remifentanil has been suggested as the 'solo' drug during procedural sedation by target-controlled infusion, but it needs a controlled environment and skilled practitioners. Fosprofol and ketofol are new alternatives, but convincing studies that could support their wider use are absent. Remimazolam is another alternative whose efficacy is still to be determined. Most of the studies in the literature are debating on the training that the 'proceduralist' should undergo to deliver sedation safely and to manage any kind of adverse effect caused by it. Summary Recent studies on procedural sedation are still debating on the use of propofol by nonanaesthesiologists and are exploring the use of other sedatives and analgesics. The main goal in the future should be to have a clear curriculum on the role of the 'sedationalist' outside the operating room.",

The lower dose gave a lower failure rate, 3-2 compared with 5-1 per cent., but this difference was not statistically significant. The overall known failure rate of 4-2 per cent. compares most favourably with our previous findings in this area using other drugs of the tetracycline group. The incidence of post-gonococcal urethritis (5-1 per cent.) was also the lowest we have found. The few side-effects reported were comparatively trivial. Because of its high degree of therapeutic efficacy, the relatively lack of side-effects, and the reduced incidence of post-gonococcal urethritis, minocycline hydrochloride should be considered the drug of choice whenever single-dose oral treatment is given in uncomplicated gonorrhoea in men.",

      "abstract": "Over recent years I have been studying whether dopamine agonist treatment alone, or in early combination with levodopa, might institute a better long-term treatment in Parkinson's disease than levodopa alone. Indeed, early combination of levodopa with bromocriptine, pergolide or lisuride has indicated that this kind of treatment results in better management of Parkinson's disease with fewer fluctuations in disability, especially end-of-dose disturbances and dyskinesias, than treatment with levodopa alone. Furthermore, similar results were obtained by using lisuride in combination with selegiline and levodopa. Thus, it appears advisable to initiate the dopaminergic treatment in early Parkinson's disease by using a combination of selegiline, levodopa and a dopamine agonist. There are many ways of building up this kind of treatment. Instead of levodopa, it is possible to use initially a dopamine agonist and to add selegiline and levodopa when the therapeutic response becomes insufficient. Another alternative would be to start with selegiline alone, then to add a dopamine agonist and, finally, levodopa when clinically indicated.",

Even when applicable, these methods, requiring special skill and always attended with considerable discomfort to the patient, would obviously be minimized were any substance known which, administered internally, would impart to the urine either bactericidal or bacteriostatic properties of sufficient strength and continuity to effect equally good or better clinical results. Hexamethylenamin and the many closely allied compounds which have been exploited to the medical profession under various names were thought for a time to be promising, not only as urinary antiseptics but as general internal antiseptics as well.

However, this approach has faced physiological difficulties, such as the inability to contain and position the controlled drug delivery system within the desired region of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) due to variable gastric emptying and motility. Venlafaxine is an antidepressant and a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Its active metabolite, desvenlafaxine, works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, which are key neurotransmitters in mood regulation. Gastroretentive dosage forms can stay in the gastric region for several hours and significantly prolong the gastric residence time of drugs. Natural materials have been extensively used in drug delivery because they are readily available, cost-effective, eco-friendly, capable of many chemical modifications, potentially degradable, and compatible due to their natural origin.

Once familiarity is achieved with the various factors that can alter clearance, such as age, smoking habits, physiological abnormalities, and concurrent drug therapy, an initial dosage can be appropriately individualized. Careful product selection, the slow progressive titration of dose over nine days, and the accurate measurement and interpretation of serum theophylline concentration can prevent adverse effects and interactions. However, long-term therapy with theophylline should probably be avoided when other drugs are available for patients with cor pulmonale, liver dysfunction, congestive heart failure, migraine headaches, and seizure disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Anterior cervical spine surgeries are often complicated by difficulty swallowing due to local postoperative swelling, pain, scarring, and tissue dysfunction. These postoperative events lead to systemic steroid and narcotic use. Local, sustained drug delivery may address these problems, but current materials are unsafe for tight surgical spaces due to high biomaterial swelling, especially upon degradation. To address these shortcomings, a low‐swelling, amphiphilic hydrogel system termed DexaPatch is developed containing dexamethasone‐poly(lactic‐co‐glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles for sustained release upon local implantation in the surgical site. The bulk amphiphilic hydrogel, comprised of 4‐arm poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)‐maleimide macromer cross‐linked with triblock dithiolated PEG‐poly(propylene glycol)‐PEG (poloxamer a.k.a. Pluronic), achieves consistent and tunable mechanical and low‐swelling properties. Dexamethasone is released in a burst, followed by a sustained release over 40 days, similar to the release from microparticles alone. The DexaPatch system is lyophilized for shelf stability and surgical handling properties, sterilized, and briefly rehydrated in the operating room prior to surgical implantation in a rabbit model of anterior spinal surgery. DexaPatch results in significantly reduced prevertebral edema radiographically and decreased fibrosis in prevertebral muscles compared to sham surgery. This implantable biomaterial platform reduces local postoperative inflammation with potential surgical applications throughout the body.",

At the other end of the spectrum are those patients who relapse repeatedly at any attempt to lower the steriod dosage and who continue to be treatment-dependent for many years. Corticosteroids, although dramatically improving the prognosis in terms of both morbidity and mortality in BP, have also been responsible for problems of their own as a result of their well recognized side-effects, including susceptibility to infections, weight gain, hypertension, glucose intolerance, osteoporosis, peptic ulceration, proximal muscle wasting, cataracts and skin atrophy. These side-effects can produce considerable morbidity, particularly in patients with high maintenance steroid requirements, and in such patients immunosuppressive agents, in addition to prednisone, are of benefit.",

Paroxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxamine all have large volumes of distribution and are highly bound to plasma proteins. In contrast to fluoxetine, these three drugs possess shorter elimination half-lives of approximately one day and are metabolized to clinically inactive compounds. Nausea was the most commonly reported adverse effect for all three agents. Other reported adverse effects are headache, sedation, dry mouth, insomnia, sexual dysfunction, and constipation. Because of their favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, paroxetine, sertraline, and fluvoxaetine are less likely than fluoxamine to interact with other drugs. Paroxetine has been found to be superior to placebo and equivalent to amitriptyline, imipramine, clomipramine, and doxepin in treatment of depression. Sertraline has been found to be superior to placebo and equivalent to amitriptyline in treatment of depression. Fluvoxamine has been found to be superior to placebo and equivalent to imipramine, clomipramine, desipramine, mianserin, and maprotiline in the treatment of depression. Fluvoxamine and sertraline have been shown to be superior to placebo in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Clinical experience has demonstrated all three drugs to be effective in treatment of depression. They may be especially useful in elderly patients, in those who cannot tolerate alternative treatments, and in those who do not respond to adequate trials of other antidepressant therapies.",

      "abstract": "Chronic urticaria is a relatively common disorder in which its management often presents a difficult clinical challenge. Histamine antagonists are the mainstays of therapy, and the second-generation antihistamines offer an attractive combination of efficacy, convenience, and lack of side effects. For patients whose symptoms are not controlled by once daily second-generation antihistamines, adjunct therapy with first generation H1-antihistamines, H2-antihistamines, doxepin, or leukotriene modifiers may be effective. Short-term systemic corticosteroids are useful for acute symptom flares but should not be used chronically. For chronically unremitting disease, immunomodulatory agents such as low-dose oral cyclosporine often are useful.",

      "title": "Corticosteroids for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy",
      "abstract": "Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) is a progressive or relapsing and remitting paralysing illness probably due to an autoimmune response which should benefit from corticosteroids. Non-randomised studies suggest that corticosteroids are beneficial. Two commonly used corticosteroids are prednisone and prednisolone. Both are usually given as oral tablets. Prednisone is converted into prednisolone in the liver so that the effect of the two drugs is usually the same. Another corticosteroid, called dexamethasone, is more potent and is used in smaller doses.To evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment compared to placebo or no treatment for CIDP and to compare the efficacy of different corticosteroid regimes.We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (20 February 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1966 to February 2012), and EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2012) for randomised trials of corticosteroids for CIDP.We included randomised or quasi-randomised trials of treatment with any form of corticosteroids or adrenocorticotrophic hormone for CIDP, diagnosed by an internationally accepted definition.Two authors extracted the data and assessed risk of bias independently. The primary outcome was intended to be change in disability, with secondary outcomes of change in impairment, maximum motor nerve conduction velocity, or compound muscle action potential amplitude after 12 weeks, and adverse events.In one non-blinded randomised controlled trial (RCT) with 35 eligible participants, the primary outcome for this review was not available. Twelve of 19 participants treated with prednisone, compared with five of 16 participants randomised to no treatment, had improved neuropathy impairment scores after 12 weeks; the risk ratio (RR) for improvement was 2.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.90 to 4.52). Adverse events were not reported in detail, but one prednisone-treated participant died.In a double-blind RCT comparing daily standard-dose oral prednisolone with monthly high-dose oral dexamethasone in 40 participants, none of the outcomes for this review were available. There were no significant differences in remission (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.50 to 2.45 in favour of monthly dexamethasone) or change in disability or impairment after one year. Eight of 16 in the prednisolone, and seven of 24 in the dexamethasone group deteriorated. Adverse events were similar with each regimen, except that sleeplessness and moon facies (moon-shaped appearance of the face) were significantly less common with monthly dexamethasone.Experience from large non-randomised studies suggests that corticosteroids are beneficial, but long-term use causes serious side effects.Very low quality evidence from one small, randomised trial did not show a statistically significant benefit from oral prednisone compared with no treatment. Nevertheless, corticosteroids are commonly used in practice. According to moderate quality evidence from one RCT, the efficacy of high-dose monthly oral dexamethasone was not statistically different from that of daily standard-dose oral prednisolone. Most adverse events occurred with similar frequencies in both groups, but sleeplessness and moon facies were significantly less common with monthly dexamethasone. Further research is needed to identify factors which predict response.",

A clinical diagnosis is difficult to establish correctly, and it should be verified by a laboratory test. The objectives of treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis are to alleviate the symptoms and signs of acute pharyngitis, to prevent spread of infection to others, to eradicate the bacteria from the throat, and to prevent sup-purative and nonsuppurative sequelae. Recent studies compared the clinical and bacteriologic cure rates of cefdinir, a new oral cephalosporin antibiotic, given once or twice per day for either 5 or 10 days, with standard doses of oral penicillin given 4 times daily for 10 days. Cefdinir's cure rates equaled and sometimes surpassed those of penicillin. Cefdinir's fewer daily doses and the possibility of a shorter treat ment course may improve patient compliance. Cefdinir is a new, safe, and highly effective agent for the treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Lurasidone is a benzisothiazol derivative second-generation antipsychotic. It has been approved in the United States and Europe for treatment of acute schizophrenia and bipolar depression. In type I bipolar subjects, treatment with lurasidone monotherapy of adjunctive therapy to lithium or valproic acid with doses of 20 to 120 mg once daily with food, results in statistically and clinically significant reduction of depressive symptoms. Patients experience relatively few side effects, which include somnolence, akathisia, nausea, and other gastrointestinal upset. Dopamine related side effects, such as Parkinsonism and elevated prolactin, are rare and mild. Longer term safety data obtained in 6 months long, open continuation observation periods, suggest that metabolic related elevations in weight, glucose, and lipids are absent or minimal. The mechanism of action of lurasidone is not known, but the data are compatible with antagonism of the serotonin 7 receptor. Lurasidone is a new option for the treatment of bipolar depression with relatively few side effects. Keywords: lurasidone, bipolar disorder, bipolar depression, adjunctive therapy",

      "title": "Oxycodone: A Current Perspective on Its Pharmacology, Abuse, and Pharmacotherapeutic Developments",
      "abstract": "Oxycodone, a semisynthetic derivative of naturally occurring thebaine, an opioid alkaloid, has been available for more than 100 years. Although thebaine cannot be used therapeutically due to the occurrence of convulsions at higher doses, it has been converted to a number of other widely used compounds that include naloxone, naltrexone, buprenorphine, and oxycodone. Despite the early identification of oxycodone, it was not until the 1990s that clinical studies began to explore its analgesic efficacy. These studies were followed by the pursuit of several preclinical studies to examine the analgesic effects and abuse liability of oxycodone in laboratory animals and the subjective effects in human volunteers. For a number of years oxycodone was at the forefront of the opioid crisis, playing a significant role in contributing to opioid misuse and abuse, with suggestions that it led to transitioning to other opioids. Several concerns were expressed as early as the 1940s that oxycodone had significant abuse potential similar to heroin and morphine. Both animal and human abuse liability studies have confirmed, and in some cases amplified, these early warnings. Despite sharing a similar structure with morphine and pharmacological actions also mediated by the μ-opioid receptor, there are several differences in the pharmacology and neurobiology of oxycodone. The data that have emerged from the many efforts to analyze the pharmacological and molecular mechanism of oxycodone have generated considerable insight into its many actions, reviewed here, which, in turn, have provided new information on opioid receptor pharmacology. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Oxycodone, a μ-opioid receptor agonist, was synthesized in 1916 and introduced into clinical use in Germany in 1917. It has been studied extensively as a therapeutic analgesic for acute and chronic neuropathic pain as an alternative to morphine. Oxycodone emerged as a drug with widespread abuse. This article brings together an integrated, detailed review of the pharmacology of oxycodone, preclinical and clinical studies of pain and abuse, and recent advances to identify potential opioid analgesics without abuse liability.",

      "title": "Controlled-Release Therapeutic Systems: Technology Applicable To the Treatment of Oral Disease",
      "abstract": "Controlled-release therapeutic systems are designed to deliver a pre-determined amount of drug to a specific anatomical site for an extended period of time. A single controlled-release delivery system no larger than an ordinary tablet or capsule and placed at the desired site of drug action can produce long-term therapeutic effects that previously could only be achieved through multiple administration of conventional dosage forms. Transient spikes in drug concentration seen with multiple dose regimens are eliminated, decreasing the chance of adverse reactions. Because they are effective for an extended period of time, controlled-release therapeutic systems minimize the involvement of the patient in drug administration , a factor which can increase both patient compliance with a prescribed regimen and patient satisfaction with the treatment schedule compared with conventional therapy. Controlled-release technology can be utilized to deliver therapeutic agents ranging in size from small ions to macromolecules. Clinically-proven controlled-release drug delivery systems are currently available with durations of action ranging from several days (e.g., for the prevention and treatment of angina pectoris and motion-induced nausea and the treatment of glaucoma) to one year (e.g. for contraception). A therapeutic system for contraception with a five-year effective lifetime is in clinical trial. Intra-oral controlled-release therapeutic systems are being investigated for the delivery of fluoride and antibiotics. A system for fluoride has reduced experimental dental caries in rats by over 50% and has significantly elevated salivary fluoride concentrations during a six-month trial in adolescents. Tetracycline-containing polymeric fibers can provide site-specific delivery of the antibiotic to periodontal pockets for 10 days or more. An intra-oral controlled-release pellet for tetracycline with a duration of action of one to two weeks is being developed, and additional possibilities exist for the intra-oral use of this versatile technology.",
