      "title": "PENGARUH SINDROMA DEPRESI TERHADAP DISFUNGSI EREKSI",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Normal sexual function is a bio-psycho-social process which is significantly related to the quality of life (QOL). Any disturbance in one of the components can be a disaster in sexual life. Erectile dysfunction is a disability to get an erection or to maintain the erection well enough for a sexual intercourse, which persists or recurs at least three months conse-cutively due to either psychogenic or organic disturbances, or both. Some psychogenic dis-turbances especially depression, anxiety, and relational distress, play some important roles in ED. Besides that, aging, low testoteron level, physical diseases, and some certain medicines have to be included. Key words: erection, erectile dysfunction, sexual stimulus, depression. Abstract: Fungsi seksual yang normal merupakan suatu proses biopsikososial yang berkaitan langsung dengan kualitas hidup. Adanya gangguan pada salah satu komponen dapat menjadi malapetaka bagi kehidupan seksual. Disfungsi ereksi dapat dedefinisikan sebagai suatu keti-dakmampuan untuk ereksi atau mempertahankan ereksi yang cukup untuk melakukan hu-bungan seksual yang memuaskan, yang menetap atau berulang paling tidak selama tiga bulan berturut-turut. Gangguan psikogenik khususnya sindroma depresi, ankietas, dan distres relasional berperan penting dalam hal terjadinya disfungsi ereksi. Disamping itu usia lanjut, rendahnya kadar testoteron, penyakit fisik, dan beberapa jenis obat perlu diperhitungkan. Kata kunci: fisiologi ereksi, disfungsi ereksi, stimulus seksual, depresi.",

      "title": "Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder in the ICD‚Äê11",
      "abstract": "During the last decade, there has been heated debate regarding whether compulsive sexual behaviour should be classified as a mental/behavioural disorder. Compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been proposed for inclusion as an impulse control disorder in the ICD-111. It is characterized by a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges, resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour over an extended period (e.g., six months or more) that causes marked distress or impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning. The pattern is manifested in one or more of the following: a) engaging in repetitive sexual activities has become a central focus of the person's life to the point of neglecting health and personal care or other interests, activities and responsibilities; b) the person has made numerous unsuccessful efforts to control or significantly reduce repetitive sexual behaviour; c) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour despite adverse consequences (e.g., repeated relationship disruption, occupational consequences, negative impact on health); or d) the person continues to engage in repetitive sexual behaviour even when he/she derives little or no satisfaction from it. Concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours are explicitly addressed in the diagnostic guidelines proposed for the disorder. Individuals with high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., due to a high sex drive) who do not exhibit impaired control over their sexual behaviour and significant distress or impairment in functioning should not be diagnosed with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. The diagnosis should also not be assigned to describe high levels of sexual interest and behaviour (e.g., masturbation) that are common among adolescents, even when this is associated with distress. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also emphasize that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be diagnosed based on psychological distress related to moral judgments or disapproval about sexual impulses, urges or behaviours that would otherwise not be considered indicative of psychopathology. Sexual behaviours that are egodystonic can cause psychological distress; however, psychological distress due to sexual behaviour by itself does not warrant a diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. Careful attention must be paid to the evaluation of individuals who self-identify as having the disorder (e.g., calling themselves \"sex addicts\" or \"porn addicts\"). Upon examination, such individuals may not actually exhibit the clinical characteristics of the disorder, although they might still be treated for other mental health problems (e.g., anxiety, depression). Additionally, individuals often experience feelings such as shame and guilt in relationship to their sexual behaviour2, but these experiences are not reliably indicative of an underlying disorder. The proposed diagnostic guidelines also assist the clinician in differentiating compulsive sexual behaviour disorder from other mental disorders and other health conditions. For example, although bipolar disorder has been found at elevated rates among individuals with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder3, sexual behaviours must be persistent and occur independently of hypomanic or manic episodes to provide a basis for a possible diagnosis of the disorder. A diagnosis of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder should not be made when the behaviour can be explained by other medical conditions (e.g., dementia) or by the effects of certain medications prescribed to treat specific medical conditions (e.g., Parkinson's disease)4 or is entirely attributable to the direct effects of illicit substances on the central nervous system (e.g., cocaine, crystal methamphetamine). Currently, there is an active scientific discussion about whether compulsive sexual behaviour disorder can constitute the manifestation of a behavioural addiction5. For ICD-11, a relatively conservative position has been recommended, recognizing that we do not yet have definitive information on whether the processes involved in the development and maintenance of the disorder are equivalent to those observed in substance use disorders, gambling and gaming6. For this reason, compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is not included in the ICD-11 grouping of disorders due to substance use and addictive behaviours, but rather in that of impulse control disorders. The understanding of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder will evolve as research elucidates the phenomenology and neurobiological underpinnings of the condition7. In the absence of consistent definitions and community-based epidemiological data, determining accurate prevalence rates of compulsive sexual behaviour disorder has been difficult. Epidemiological estimates have ranged up to 3-6% in adults8, though recent studies have produced somewhat lower estimates of 1 to 3%9. The more restrictive diagnostic requirements proposed for ICD-11 would be expected to produce lower prevalence rates. In general, men exhibit the disorder more frequently than women, although robust data examining gender differences are lacking. Additionally, higher rates of the disorder have been noted among individuals with substance use disorders. Among treatment seekers, the disorder negatively impacts occupational, relationship, physical health and mental health functioning. However, systematic data are lacking regarding the prevalence of the disorder across different populations and associated socio-cultural and socio-demographic factors, including among non-treatment seekers. Growing evidence suggests that compulsive sexual behaviour disorder is an important clinical problem with potentially serious consequences if left untreated. We believe that including the disorder in the ICD-11 will improve the consistency with which health professionals approach the diagnosis and treatment of persons with this condition, including consistency regarding when a disorder should not be diagnosed. Legitimate concerns about overpathologizing sexual behaviours have been carefully addressed in the proposed diagnostic guidelines. We posit that inclusion of this category in the ICD-11 will provide a better tool for addressing the unmet clinical needs of treatment seeking patients as well as possibly reduce shame and guilt associated with help seeking among distressed individuals. The proposed diagnostic guidelines will be tested in international multilingual Internet-based field studies using standardized case material, which will help to assess the generalizability of the construct across different regions and cultures, and clinicians' ability to distinguish it from normal variations in sexual behaviour and from other disorders. Additional field studies in clinical settings will provide further information about the clinical utility of the proposed diagnostic guidelines for the disorder among clinical populations. Shane W.

      "title": "Consequences of impaired female sexual functioning: Individual differences and associations with sexual distress",
      "abstract": "Abstract A number of risk factors for sexual distress have been identified, including impairments in sexual function. However, for women, sexual function is only weakly associated with distress levels in many cases. One reason for this disconnect may be that impaired sexual function can have a variety of consequences for the individual's sexual experience and that some consequences may be more or less distressing to different people. Research suggests that some consequences of impaired sexual function may be more distressing to older women and/or for women in longer or less satisfying relationships. To examine the association between consequences of impaired female sexual function and distress, 75 women reporting one or more recurrent difficulties with sexual function in the past month were assessed. Frequency of sexual consequences including decreased physical pleasure, decreased sexual frequency, and negative partner emotional responses, were associated with sexual distress after controlling for the effects of sexual function. Additionally, a number of sexual consequences were rated as more distressing by older women and women in unsatisfying relationships. The idiosyncratic ways in which impairments in sexual function play out in the context of sexual activity may be an important target of future research and clinical interventions for sexual dysfunction. Keywords: sexual distresssexual functioningfemale sexual dysfunction Notes 1. This criterion may have biased the sample by excluding women who were unable to engage in sexual activity; however, the requirement was necessary given our aim of assessing the consequences of impaired sexual functioning that occurred during or immediately following sexual activity.",

It is also pointed that hypoactive sexual desire can be caused by: long-term sexual abstinence; response to a sexual disorder of one‚Äôs male/female spouse (male/female partner); psychological response to another sexual dysfunction in the other person. Besides, weak sexual desire can be revealed in homosexual men and women, who have not accepted their sexual orientation to the end. The article gives data about influence of cultural/religious factors on the frequency of sexual desire. For example, noticeable differences exist in the levels of incidence of low desire in different cultures: from 12.5% in men from Northern Europe to 28% in men from South-East Asia at the age of 40-80. The association between the East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire in men can be mediated by feeling of guilt. Lower values of sexual desire were detected in women from East Asia versus women of the Canadian origin.",

      "abstract": "Almost 4% of the UK population have some form of physical, sensory, or intellectual impairment‚Äîalmost 2.5 million people. Many of these disabling conditions can produce sexual problems of desire, arousal, orgasm, or sexual pain in men and women. Sexual difficulties may arise from direct trauma to the genital area (due to either accident or disease), damage to the nervous system (such as spinal cord injury), or as an indirect consequence of a non-sexual illness (cancer of any organ may not directly affect sexual abilities but can cause fatigue and reduce the desire or ability to engage in sexual activity). The two main points for consideration are how disabling conditions affect sexual function and behaviour and which sexual difficulties most commonly arise. Women who undergo radical mastectomy or a disfiguring trauma often report concerns about their femininity and self image such as feelings of lowered self worth or the fear that men will find them less attractive. Similarly, young men with erectile dysfunction often avoid meeting potential partners because of their embarrassment over their inability to perform. \"Sexuality\" describes how people express their view of what is sexual. That awareness is the result of all the physical, emotional, intellectual, and social factors that have influenced their development up to that point in their life. Defining sexuality as wider than just physical functionis particularly important for people with disabilities. A person who is not able to use part of his or her body still has an equal right to full sexual expression. ### Key questions in cases of disability Present condition Effect of condition on sexuality",

Child sexual abuse can vary along a number of dimensions, including pattern, frequency, duration, age at onset, and relationship of victim to perpetrator. Experience with and exposure to sexual abuse in childhood are particularly associated with long‚Äêterm psychological effects and profoundly shape victims' lives well into adulthood by increasing the probability of negative psychological outcomes such as poor self‚Äêesteem, lack of a sense of control or agency, and associated mental disorders. The level of harm may be affected by multiple factors such as duration and frequency of abuse, use of force, and penetration, and the social stigma of child sexual abuse often compounds the psychological harm to children.",

      "title": "Preliminary Results in a Romanian Population Screening of Erectile Dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Abstract The lack of data and protocols in identifying, diagnosing and treating sexual disorders in general and erectile dysfunction in particular tend to favor the maintenance of myths and ignorance, with serious impact on the quality of life of all individuals and couples affected. The objective of this study was to identify the main characteristics and correlates of erectile dysfunction which are key elements in improving the diagnosis procedure, comorbidities prevention and the implementation of efficient treatment protocols, the aims of our main research project. Preliminary data of an erectile dysfunction screening in a Romanian population are discussed. Keywords: sexual disorders, erectile dysfunction, screening INTRODUCTION Sexual activity is very important for most individuals, regardless of age, sex or sexual orientation. However, throughout our lifespan, different changes at the physical or psychological level may influence, among others, our sex life. Moreover, most women and men occasionally experience sexual difficulties. If these sexual difficulties prevent the individual or couple from enjoying sexual activity during any phase of the sexual response cycle (desire, arousal, orgasm and resolution) and if they cause distress and interpersonal problems, sexual disorders are very likely to be present. Since people tend to avoid talking about their sexual problems, many people develop various myths about what is and what is not normal when it comes to sex life. Society, media or religion tend to shape unrealistic or dysfunctional images of sexual behavior. The lack of acknowledgement of certain disorders and over diagnosing others are, to a certain extent, common phenomena. Sexual disorders can also be often mistaken for various symptoms of several other mental disorders (such as affective and anxiety disorders) as they appear together quite frequently. The lack of data and protocols in identifying, diagnosing and treating these disorders tends to favor the maintenance of myths and ignorance, with serious impact on the quality of life. Erectile dysfunction (ED), also known as (male) impotence, is one of the most frequent sexual disorders; ED is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain an erection of the penis sufficient to permit a satisfactory sexual intercourse (Coman, 2004). Although ED is referred to as a benign pathology, it has a significant negative effect on the patients, their couple lives and their socioprofessional performances. The incidence and prevalence of ED have grown remarkably lately, not only because of the population aging effect and of the increasingly higher action of risk factors on the general population, but also because of the beginning of use, at the end of the last millennium, of oral medication against this pathology, medication that had the role to raise awareness of the masculine population regarding this pathology. The socio-cultural prejudice and the perception that ED is part of the aging process have led to a poor addressing of elderly men to doctors [contrary to the general perception, Helgason (1996) indicates that 13% of the patients aged 50 to 80 consider sexual activity to be very important, 29% see it as important, 41% consider occasional sexual acts to be pleasant and only 17% consider sex not to be important]. Most patients turn to medical assistance only in severe cases of the pathology, when the diagnosis and the treatment are more complex and costly. On a global level, the prevalence of ED is over 500 million men; estimative data (Ayac et al., 1999) predict a doubling of the prevalence of ED in 2025, this problem becoming thereby a serious public health issue. Among the Eastern European countries, Romania has the highest prevalence of ED, 25% in the general population, which means that one out of four men experience such difficulties. According to the CLOSER study (Porav-Hodade, et al., 2007) ED is even more frequent in older men; more than half of men over 50 years of age have different levels of ED. ‚Ä¶",

      "title": "Biopsychosocial models of women's sexual response: applications to management of ‚Äòdesire disorders‚Äô",
      "abstract": "Abstract The complexities of women's sexual response preclude useful management strategies which are modelled only on the traditional human sex response cycle beginning with sexual desire rather than other motivations. Both biological and psychological parameters affecting women's sexual motivation and arousability can be depicted in alternative models. These reflect that motivations to begin a sexual experience, although varied, are most often intimacy-based in women. The key role of subjective sexual arousal, which often precedes and then accompanies sexual desire, is clarified. A positive outcome emotionally and physically is necessary to achieve the original goal of enhancing emotional closeness, sense of being attracted and attractive, committed, loved‚Äîtogether with the goal (accessed en route) of sexual satisfaction. Innate, spontaneous desire may only occasionally augment the intimacy-based motivation. Thus therapy for 'desire disorders' may more profitably focus on the woman's problematic motivation, inadequate sexual stimuli and context, diminished arousability and/or unsatisfactory outcome to an experience. A model of subjective sexual arousal reflects the ongoing affective and cognitive modulation and variable input from physical genital congestion. Awareness of the poor correlation between genital vasocongestion and the subjective experience allows subtyping of arousal problems in order to facilitate their management.",

      "title": "Affirmative sexual consent? Direct and unambiguous consent is rarely included in discussions of recent sexual interactions",
      "abstract": "Sexual activity typically follows an implicit sexual script or a normative sequence of behaviours that are involved in a sexual interaction. It is unclear whether or how affirmative sexual consent is incorporated in individual sexual scripts and interactions. The current research explores how sexual consent may be expressed and verified as part of individuals‚Äô sexual interactions. Undergraduate participants from an Ontario university ( N = 92; 58 males, 34 females) completed a series of open-ended questions that asked them to describe their sexual experiences with a new and long-term partner from beginning to end. Analysis of presence of consent-related behaviours in participants‚Äô accounts were assessed on the basis of a priori themes and extensions of these themes. Thematic analyses identified the following themes: 1) Sex proceeding with escalating intensity of nonverbal sexual behaviour, 2) Passive behaviours that do not indicate unwillingness to have sex, 3) Indirect verbal communication of interest in sex, 4) Indications that sex ‚Äújust happened,‚Äù 5) Descriptions of the context in which sex occurred, and 6) Direct discussions relevant to sexual consent. Results indicated that direct discussion of sexual consent was exceedingly rare and that most sexual interactions included indirect, veiled, and coded behaviours that require inference of sexual consent or non-consent. Consent-related themes varied as a function of both participant gender (male versus female) and nature of relationship (new versus long-term). The findings of this study have implications for sexual health education, sexual assault prevention interventions, and public policy development.",

Unlike alcohol or drug abuse, suppression of sexual behavior is not an option, only compulsive character must be suppressed in order to allow a full and satisfying sexuality. The purpose of this observation is to explore the psychological and physical consequences of sexual addiction. We report the case of a patient with sexual addiction, in order to describe the impact of this addiction on his psychological and physical health. Mr. JG is 28 a years old man, he has no particular habits and no significant pathological history. He was addressed by his general practitioner for \"excessive masturbation\". His sexual history is characterized by: - An excessive interest in pornographic films since the age of 13, - An extremely rich fantasy life, - Frequent compulsive masturbation, going up to ten times a day. Through the years, this hyper sexuality has become more important, and masturbation more frequent, which resulted in: - Permanent feeling of embarrassment and shame, - Ideas permanently focused on sexual thoughts, - Fatigue and chronical physical exhaustion, - Constant muscle pain and headache, diminished visual acuity. - Relationship difficulties, and social maladjustment, - Depression and suicidal thoughts. The evaluation by the Carnes scale found a score of 16/25, which corresponds to a severe sexual addiction. The boundary between normal and pathological depends on the models and taboos of society, but for physicians, the major criteria for sexual addiction are mental suffering, social maladjustment, and demand of care.",

Responses to infertilityIn response to being unable to conceive, many people feel emotions such as anger, panic, despair, and grief, and these may affect sexual activity.The stress of infertility and its treatment may also cause sexual difficulties for both men and women.Intercourse may be avoided, with patterns of behaviour established so that one or other partner is not reminded of the fertility problem.Post-coital tests or repeated need to provide semen samples may result in a man feeling under pressure to perform, which can adversely affect his erectile or ejaculatory ability.For some men, one or two failures during intercourse begin a vicious circle of fear of failure, with anxiety leading to further failures.Partners may also develop arousal difficulties because of anxiety or distress.Some people feel that their partner wants them only when there is a chance of conception, and sexual activity can then become a battleground for issues of power and control.Such stresses conspire to alienate couples from the recreational aspects of sexual expression and focus them, often obsessively, on the procreative aspect of sexual intercourse.",

Diff√©rents facteurs d√©clenchent le comportement addictif sexuel (√©motions positives, n√©gatives, circonstances environnementales). La consommation sexuelle est excessive et concerne diff√©rents supports sexuels. Il y a au moins un orgasme quotidien pendant au moins 6 mois mais celui-ci s‚Äôaccompagne toujours d‚Äôune perte contr√¥le, d‚Äôune perte de temps √† pr√©parer le comportement, le r√©aliser ou √† r√©cup√©rer de ses effets.

Women more frequently have problems in experiencing sexual arousal and pleasure, whereas men more often suffer from erectile dysfunction or dysfunctional ejaculation. From an evolutionary point of view, many sexual dysfunctions are caused by conflict relating to intra- and intersexual competition or cultural practices of controlling sexual activity of the opposite sex. Suppression of sexual interest in women may, for example, occur in patrilocal societies, where curbing one‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs sexual activity before her arranged marriage may eventually increase the parents‚Äô reproductive success. Evolutionary hypotheses of female orgasm suggest that the function of orgasm in women could signal satisfaction and fidelity to their male partners. Premature ejaculation in men may relate to performance anxiety. Finally, hormonal contraceptives impact on the experience of sexual pleasure and mate choice in relevant ways.",

In many cases sexual communication is improved because of contraception; in many cases it has a negative influence, caused mainly by the mental immaturity of the partners, by their emotional instability, or by their sociocultural background. Negative sexual side effects of contraception are usually caused, in the woman, by a conflict with the traditional image of the woman as mother, and by an unconscious desire of fertility; in the man they are usually caused by the long-accepted identification of sexual potency with reproductive ability, and by fears for the newly acquired freedom of the female partner. Positive or negative psychological effects of contraception vary, but not greatly, according to the method used. A sympathetic and experienced doctor can furnish good advice on the matter.",

      "abstract": "I N THE POPULAR MIND, marital difficulties and psychoanalysis are almost synonymous. There is a widespread belief that the majority of individuals who consult a psychoanalyst come because of with marriage. If for conscious dissatisfaction is substituted unconscious with the marital state, the popular belief is correct, for no matter how diverse the symptoms which the psychoneurotic patient presents to the psychoanalyst, closer scrutiny always reveals some psychosexual dissatisfaction. A marital relation in which the ideals of the man's or the woman's personality are realized while at the same time their diverse instinctual needs also find adequate expression is the goal for which men and women are striving in marriage. Yet it is increasingly evident that a large percentage of men and women either cannot marry or, if marriage occurs, can find little happiness in it. Their discontent may find expression in illness, unfaithfulness, psychosexual difficulties such as frigidity and impotence, psychoneurotic or even psychotic manifestations such as depression, delusional jealousy, or alcoholism. Anyone who goes through the case records of any psychiatrist or psychiatric clinic will immediately be struck by the frequent coincidence between an engagement or marriage and the onset of the psychosomatic, psychoneurotic, or psychotic disorder for which the patient is consulting a physician. The patient may be completely unconscious, or more or less of a causal connection between the marriage and the illness. One striking example of the desperate measures which an individual unconsciously took in order to preserve the illusion of a perfect marriage comes to my mind. A married woman of forty was sent by an internist who had been treating her for spastic colitis. In the course of the treatment, he had been struck by something queer in her personality. The woman came to the psychiatric consultation with a very sweet, fixed smile on her face. She protested immediately, before any question could be asked, that she had no need of psychiatric help since her marriage was an absolutely ideal one. When the psychiatrist made only a nonargumentative neutral reply to this statement, she continued her story. She had been married some fifteen to twenty years. She had wanted a child very much, but her husband did not. Of course she did not mind at all, she was sure she did not care whether she had a child. Throughout the last ten years of her marriage, she had had various illnesses which were always diagnosed as nothing wrong-or functional -in character. Five years ago, her husband became impotent-which she",

Romantic love can also occur in same-sex partnerships, yet not much is known, either psychologically or behaviorally, about the similarities or differences in how romantic love manifests in homosexual or bisexual couples compared with heterosexual couples. This study investigated romantic love in a cross-cultural sample of heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual young adults (N = 783) experiencing romantic love. We analyzed differences between sexual orientation groups on six variables pertaining to different aspects of romantic love. These variables included number of times ever in love; the timing of falling in love relative to starting a romantic relationship; intensity of romantic love; obsessive thinking about a loved one; commitment; and frequency of sex per week. Homosexual females reported a significantly lower frequency of sex per week than heterosexual and bisexual females. Bisexual males reported a greater number of times ever in love than heterosexual males. Other variables revealed small or very small differences between sexual orientation groups.

The most frequent sexual disorder reported by spouses of patients with dementia is sexual indifference related to apathy and blunted affect.

Permanence of sexual activity is most often a factor of adjustment for married dementia sufferers and their caregivers. However, some sexual behaviors are stressing for the spouses, mainly women spouses. In nursing homes or long term care facilities, expressing sexuality by demented subjects and dealing with inappropriate sexual expression are source of concerns for the nursing staff, other residents, and families.

Los pacientes ostomizados presentan una prevalencia elevada de s√≠ntomas ansiosos y depresivos, especialmente cuando el estoma se percibe como permanente o si fue resultado de una cirug√≠a de urgencia. El trastorno de adaptaci√≥n es tambi√©n com√∫n, caracterizado por dificultades emocionales persistentes para asumir los cambios en el estilo de vida, alimentaci√≥n, sexualidad e higiene. Las preocupaciones sobre el atractivo f√≠sico, el miedo a fugas o el rechazo por parte de la pareja pueden conducir a una disminuci√≥n del deseo sexual o incluso a evitar las relaciones √≠ntimas. As√≠ mismo, muchos pacientes reducen sus actividades sociales por miedo al estigma o a situaciones embarazosas en p√∫blico. El estoma intestinal exige una respuesta cl√≠nica que trascienda lo t√©cnico y abrace la dimensi√≥n humana del proceso, es fundamental trabajar en la reconstrucci√≥n de la identidad psicol√≥gica y corporal del paciente. Solo mediante un enfoque biopsicosocial, centrado en la persona, ser√° posible favorecer una adaptaci√≥n saludable, restaurar el bienestar subjetivo y promover una vida digna y plena m√°s all√° de la ostom√≠a.

      "title": "Child sexual abuse : Disclosure, social support and subjective health in adulthood",
      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a known risk factor for ill-health. It is assumed that the health consequences are worse if the abuse has been considered severe or if the child has been exposed to cumulative trauma, e.g. physical abuse or other stressful life events. However, symptom development seems to vary widely between individuals. According to developmental theories the dynamic interplay between environmental and individual conditions creates a course toward either healthy or maladaptive outcomes. Social support has been shown to have a strong influence, direct or indirect, on abuse sequelae ‚Äì a higher amount of support is related to better psychological functioning. However, adult victims may have difficulties forming close relationships with others due to lack of trust and other abuse aftermath. Further, despite a high risk for ill-health victims often fail to disclose the abuse. If they do tell they are not rarely met by negative reactions, which has been related to worse outcome. Delayed disclosure is related to intrafamilial abuse, closeness to the perpetrator, multiple perpetrators, age at onset and severe abuse. The victim may experience a psychological disclosure dilemma: the need to tell in order to get support is weighed against the risk to receive negative reactions. Thus, the overall aim of the thesis was to contribute knowledge concerning the relationship between child sexual abuse, disclosure, social support, and subjective health in adult women reporting experiences of sexual child maltreatment. Methods. The thesis was based on a study with a cross-sectional design using retrospective data about abuse and disclosure experiences as well as current data about health and social support. Participants (n = 152, aged 20-60 years) were recruited by advertisements in a membership magazine published by a national organisation for sexually abused women providing activities for support and healing, as well as in staff magazines for municipal employees in the Stockholm area. Data was retrieved by both a semi-structured interview and questionnaires. Analyses included quantitative methods (variable-approach and person-approach) as well as qualitative methods. Results. The results showed that disclosure characteristics were more prominently related to health than sexual abuse characteristics. Moreover, in spite of experiences of severe abuse and negative reactions after disclosure it was possible to get access to health enhancing social support in adulthood. The relation between disclosure-related events and health was dependent on source and type of reaction, in favour of partner and friends. A positive reaction from a partner was strongly related to subjective health. It may be crucial for victims of CSA who have problems with trust and intimacy to get emotional support, acceptance and respect from a partner in overcoming these feelings. Further, two groups of women reporting good health in spite of severe abuse were found by cluster analysis. The groups were among other things characterised by a high proportion of women who had formerly been active members in the support organisation. A qualitative analysis of the member‚Äôs experiences from the organisation showed that a victim process altering the victim identity over time seemed to constitute an important part of the individual development. However, few members who had gone through crucial steps of the victim process seemed to remain in the organisation passing the knowledge on to new members, thus creating a chronic structural problem for the organisation to deal with. Conclusions. Social support is a crucial protective factor for victims of child sexual abuse, a group highly at risk for and ill-health and adverse outcome. Victims of child sexual abuse seek and receive social support in various ways depending on severity of abuse, timing of disclosure and choice of disclosure receiver. Thus, the whole disclosure process during life is important to consider when studying disclosure-related events in relation to social support and health. Further, different methods of analyses may contribute to the understanding of how risk and protective factors interact. Both variableand person-based methods pointed at the importance of resources like self-esteem and social support above the amount of risk factors for health outcome. Finding ways to combine self-help with professional help might be fruitful and constitutes a further challenge for psychiatry when it comes to the task of developing new and effective care for this group.",

      "abstract": "In article author discussed results of research on the basis of the data obtained during social and psychological research of an index of vital style of the child in a family. During adaptation, both at stable, and at unstable families the mismatch of requirements for certain spheres of family life takes place: at stable couples it insignificant, at unstable considerable. This insignificant divergence at stable couples gives them opportunity of gradual development and improvement of the relations. Young families are very unstable educations, feelings to the spouse bear both powerful positive, and a negative charge (ambivalence of feelings is great). For many families extremes in behaviour and in feelings are also characteristic. Constant life near other person inevitably leads to accumulation of disagreements, tantrums and the conflicts. All couples face troubles in the course of marriage: all happens sometimes painfully, sometimes people are disappointed and don't understand each other. The love cools down, dies away or disappears; about it forget, in its revival any more don't believe. Without love the happiness of family life, satisfaction with marriage disappears. In case of a conscious dissatisfaction there is usually open recognition by the spouse of that the family relations don't satisfy it. The instruction on global character of a dissatisfaction that family life doesn't conform even to the most minimum requirements thus is indicative. The conscious dissatisfaction is quite often accompanied by the conflict between spouses. Otherwise ¬´the smoldering dissatisfaction¬ª acts. The spouse expresses relative satisfaction with family life. The true dissatisfaction comes to light an indirect way. First, through expression of feelings and states: monotony, boredom, dullness of life. Secondly, the dissatisfaction appears in numerous complaints to various private parties of family life. The dissatisfaction, quarrels, the conflicts inevitably lead changes in behaviour, character and attitude of spouses. Thus, the considered features of a modern matrimony and family relationship show a wide palette of the determinant, defining matrimonial satisfaction with marriage both providing formation and development of intra family relationship and influence on vital style of the child in a family. The psychologist participates in inspection addressed in the health Center within complex screening inspection, applying a hardware-software complex for screening assessment of level of psycho physiological and somatic health, functional and adaptive reserves of an organism with a set of the equipment for measurement of parameters of physical development which includes: personal computer; complex software. Within complex inspection research of married couples on a technique ¬´LSI questionnaire (an index of vital style)¬ª is conducted. The obtained data allowed to draw a conclusion on inability of a modern family to provide realization of satisfaction of vital style in a modern family.",

      "title": "The Sexually Exploited Child",
      "abstract": "Sexual exploitation of children (under 14 years of age) is a common occurrence, although actual numbers are unknown. There are three major forms of sexual abuse: (1) incest, ie, sexual activity between consanguineous family members; (2) sexual assault, such as rape or molestation by adults not related to the child; and (3) habitual sexual exploitation for purposes of financial reward or perverse sexual satisfaction. Brother-sister incest has the highest incidence in the middle and upper socioeconomic levels and is probably the least damaging, psychologically, to sexual adjustment later in life. Father-daughter incest is more common in the lower socioeconomic levels and is thought to produce major disorders in the psychosexual area. Sexual assault of children, if handled supportively and with understanding by the surrounding adults, including parents, physicians, teachers, law enforcement officers, and others, can result in minimal sequelae; however, often the situation is handled with emotional reactions ranging from disgust to hysteria which result in the child's being victimized and traumatized unnecessarily. These latter situations lead to sexual acting-out in adolescence, promiscuity, perversions, or frigidity in adult sexual life. Teachers, physicians, and child welfare workers need to be attuned to the possibility to sexual abuse in the children they serve.",

      "abstract": "Although rates of sexual aggression are high among college men who engage in heavy drinking, little is known regarding how often heavy drinking college men initiate unwanted sexual advances towards women that could lead to a potential sexual assault or the reasons why these advances stop or proceed. The present study describes heavy drinking college men‚Äôs ( N = 210) initiation of unwanted sexual and social advances towards women, as well as outcomes of these interactions, including how often these behaviors continue, and men‚Äôs perception of what stopped the behavior over a 3-month period. Men indicated whether they were in a situation where a sexual partner noted that she does not want sexual activity to proceed further, initiated unwanted sexual contact, initiated unwanted sexual intercourse, attempted to give a woman alcohol when she did not appear to want to drink, or attempted to take a woman to an isolated location when she did not appear to want to go. These unwanted sexual and social advances most often stopped because of women‚Äôs verbal resistance (i.e., saying ‚Äústop‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù), or because men engaged in a discussion regarding the women‚Äôs limits or choices. Given that none of the unwanted sexual or social advances stopped because of bystander intervention, the present study highlights the importance of raising awareness of the effectiveness of women‚Äôs resistance tactics and continuing to train bystanders to notice and take action to address risky situations.",

      "abstract": "The persistent or recurrent difficulties of the woman to allow vaginal entry of a penis, a finger, and/or any object, despite the woman's expressed wish to do so\" is vaginismus. Early traumatic sexual experiences (e.g. sexual abuse), religious orthodoxy, low self-esteem and body image, negative attitudes about sexuality, lack of knowledge about sex and fear responses are some of the traditional etiological correlates of vaginismus. Vaginismus is largely a diagnosis of exclusion. An interview is crucial in differentiating the causes of this disease and it should involve the following key questions: -whether the contraction of the vaginal muscles was recorded from the first sexual contact and still remains a need for sexual satisfaction is achieved without relations vaginal or -symptom occurs for some time and what circumstances it bound or -contraction of the muscles is independent of the will, reflex and is at the very idea of sexual intercourse, and -that the contraction of the vaginal muscles occurs when you try to enter the member into the vagina which is very painful. The physical, gynecological and sexuological examinations exclude local causes of the disease. The mainstay of treatment in the majority of cases is psychosexual support. The cause of organic vaginismus is congenital malformation of the genital tract. It results from abnormal development of genital paramesonephric (M√ºllerian) ducts and the urogenital sinus, which are structures involved in the process of oviduct, uterus, and vagina organogenesis. This has strong implications in the practices of gynecology and sexuology in general, not only in adolescent gynecology and sexuology. Vaginismus with congenital malformation is an important problem in these fields.",

Particularly in the realm of sexual functioning, interacting psychological and physiological factors are always operating. Sexual disorders are divided into those that have been lifelong (called ‚Äúprimary‚Äù) and those that developed during adulthood (‚Äúsecondary‚Äù). In addition, there are three general categories of difficulties: disorders of desire, disorders of arousal, and difficulty attaining orgasm. Many medications, including psychoactive medications, can affect sexual appetite and/or sexual performance significantly. Healthcare professionals should look up the possible sexual side effects of each medication that a patient is taking. The evaluation of an individual with sexual problems requires a sophisticated integration of knowledge from many areas, as biological, psychological, and social forces all strongly influence sexual functioning. Establishing a safe, non-judgmental interview setting will facilitate frank discussion of sensitive, private sexual matters.",

      "title": "Sexual Stimuli Cause Behavioral Disinhibition in Both Men and Women, but Even More So in Men",
      "abstract": "Abstract In our society men are considered more impulsive than women, especially in the violent and sexual domain. This correlation of sex and impulsivity might trace back to enhanced male impulsivity in general or a domain specific effect of emotions on impulsivity. The evidence for sex differences in the interaction of emotional or sexual stimuli and impulsivity has been relatively inconclusive so far. In this study, we investigated the effects of various emotional stimuli on responsivity in a Go/No-Go task. Participants had to respond quickly to a visual cue and withhold their response to another visual cue, while different emotional pictures were presented in the background, including sexual stimuli, non-sexual positive stimuli and negative stimuli. Both men ( N = 37) and women ( N = 38) made most commission errors in the sexual condition, indicating a disinhibiting effect in both genders. On top of this, men made even more commission errors than women, specifically in the sexual condition and not in other conditions. Men rated sexual stimuli as more positive, but did not differ from women in arousal ratings and pupil dilation. These findings may partly indicate increased impulsive behavior under sexual arousal in men, most likely driven by enhanced approach motivation due to more positive value but not higher arousal of sexual stimuli. The results are consistent with the theory of evolutionarily based concealment of sexual interest in women.",

      "abstract": "As many as one third of all women have experienced sexual victimization as juveniles, and a range of emotional, inter-personal, and sexual problems appear to be frequent among these victims. On the current evidence, it is not possible to determine the extent to which these problems are a direct result of the exploitive sexual encounter or of other circumstances in the victims' lives. Nor can the incidence rates for various problems among victimized and non-victimized women be stated with any certainty, the samples on which estimates are made being biased and limited in many ways. Emotionally, the problems of guilt, low self-esteem, and depression, are extremely common among victims, especially those who seek treatment. The interpersonal relationships of many victims are characterized by feelings of isolation, alienation, and difference from other people, together with much mistrust and insecurity. There is some conflict of evidence over the prevalence of hostile or fearful attitudes towards men. Some victims do appear to avoid a lasting relationship with a man and many engage in a series of more transient and casual relationships. Prostitution also seems to be associated with sexual victimization in childhood. Among victims there appear to be tendencies to oversexualize all relationships with men, to engage repeatedly in ill-matched and punitive partnerships, and to exhibit a fear of intimacy. The evidence is contradictory on the incidence of homosexuality among women victims. Sexual problems, and more particularly sexual dysfunctions, appear to be more frequent among victimized compared to non-victimized women, The dysfunctions exhibited include lack of motivation, sexual phobias, vaginismus, impaired arousal, difficulty in reaching climax, dyspareunia, and sexual dissatisfaction. There is wide variation in adjustment between women victims, and among the factors that may contribute to these individual differences are the age of the child victim, the duration of the victimization, the nature of the sexual activity involve, and the perception of the woman concerning her feelings at the time of the victimization and its effects on her.",

      "abstract": "Marked differences have been found in men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs sexual response patterns, contingent upon their sexual orientation; androphilic (attracted to men) and gynephilic (attracted to women) men demonstrate greatest genital and self-reported arousal to their preferred stimulus type (a ‚Äúgender-specific‚Äù response), whereas androphilic women do not, and findings for gynephilic women have been mixed. While there have been many investigations into gynephilic men‚Äôs and androphilic women‚Äôs (i.e., heterosexual men/women) sexual response, there has been less investigation into the specificity of sexual response of androphilic men and gynephilic women. Given the complex nature of sexual stimuli that are used in sexual response research, it is often unclear to what extent contextual cues (e.g., cues other than the sexual actor‚Äôs primary and secondary sex characteristics, such as physical attractiveness, sexual activity, etc.) influence participants‚Äô sexual response patterns. As such, the current study examined genital, discrete self-reported, and continuous self-reported responses of androphilic men ( n = 22) and gynephilic women ( n = 10) to prepotent sexual features (stimuli thought to elicit automatic sexual arousal: erect penises and exposed vulvas), non-prepotent sexual features (flaccid penises and pubic triangles) and neutral stimuli (clothed men and women). Both samples exhibited a gender-specific pattern of genital, self-reported, and continuous self-reported sexual arousal. Similarly, all measures of sexual arousal were generally found to be greatest to ‚Äúprepotent‚Äù sexual cues. Implications for understanding gender specificity of sexual response are discussed.",

Women presenting with gynecological problems often appear tense and anxious just because of the nature of the intimate questions and examination which they anticipate with some apprehension. Some come distressed and tearful. They may feel shame and disgust about their symptoms or because of the reaction of others. Many find the whole consultation an ordeal.

      "abstract": "The data on the effect of the absence or presence of orgasm on the representation in the domain of self-awareness of women of sexual and emotional experience at different age stages is given. 429 women with an average age of sexual debut 18,22ÔÇ±0,12 years were surveyed anonymously. Between the ages of 18 and 24, 179 women had regularly experienced orgasm, but 37 had not. At the age of 25-60, 186 women had experienced orgasm, and 27 had not. We used the method of sampling experiences. The women noted the signs consistent with their usual experiences during ‚Äúnormal‚Äù intercourse. It has been established that the appearance of an orgasm before 25 years of age strengthens and reinforces psychological satisfaction, inner comfort, meeting expectations, sexual interest, intensity of reaction and acceptance of what is happening, weakens dysphoria and shame. At the age of over 25 years, appearance of an orgasm maximally stimulates sexual interest, intensity of response, acceptance of what is happening, sharpness of perception, reduces shame and weakens physical discomfort more strongly. The absence of an orgasm before the age of 25 does not have a bright negative effect. After 25 years, this, first of all, leads to a decrease in sexual interest and mood, increased shame, guilt, hopelessness, and disruption of interpersonal interaction.",

Extreme favoritism appears to require one or more of these four factors for its development: (a) at least one parent experienced emotional trauma in his/her childhood, (b) the child's conception or birth was unusual or stressful, (c) a child's appearance or actions are invested with ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù meanings, and (d) there is severe marital conflict, accompanied by the inability of the family to provide corrections to the ‚Äúgood/bad‚Äù identities assigned to children. Favorites are exposed not only to the love of a favoring parent but also to that parent's weaknesses and to the other family members' dislike. The favorite is usually guaranteed the lasting dislike of his brothers and sisters. To be a favorite is indeed a mixed blessing.",

      "abstract": "Sexual consent refers to people's internal willingness to engage in sexual activity with another person-as well as their external communication of that willingness. Internal and external sexual consent can vary by type of sexual behavior; however, previous research on sexual consent has primarily only assessed \"typical\" sexual behaviors such as genital touching, oral sex, and vaginal-penile sex without providing further context or acknowledging people's sexual diversity. Therefore, we provided an initial account of people's sexual consent-and lack thereof-for a broader array of sexual behaviors and contexts in which they occur. Using an online cross-sectional survey of participants in the United Kingdom and the United States (N = 658, 50.5% women), we examined event-level internal and external sexual consent for 20 sexual behaviors or contexts. Women reported significantly lower levels of sexual consent feelings than men for 12 of the 20 sexual behaviors and lower levels of active consent communication for 7 of them. Almost a third of participants (31.0%) had experienced at least one of the listed sexual behaviors against their will. Of those, participants on average reported nonconsensual experiences with 3.1 of the 20 types of sexual behavior listed, ranging from 1 to 11. More women reported at least one nonconsensual experience with one of the sexual behaviors assessed compared with men (47.9% versus 22.3%, respectively). We discussed several behavior-specific findings regarding sexual consent and the lack thereof. We also made recommendations for initiatives aimed at promoting healthy sexual consent practices: embrace sexual diversity, emphasize sexual agency, and encourage active consent communication.",

      "abstract": "Despite general perceptions of committed romantic relationships as the most satisfying context with which to engage in sexual activity, acceptance of casual sexual contexts has increased in recent years. Yet little research has examined sexual and emotional satisfaction outside of the committed relationship context. Further, most satisfaction research has focused exclusively on heterosexual samples. The present study aimed to investigate sexual and emotional satisfaction derived from seven sexual relationship contexts and note similarities or differences based on gender and sexual orientation. Data were drawn from an online survey of 6,955 sexually diverse participants. Sexual satisfaction was stronger than emotional satisfaction within casual sex contexts (one night stand, first date, sex with a friend, and hookups) than within more committed contexts (married, living together, committed unmarried relationship). Men found all contexts except for sex in a committed unmarried relationship significantly more sexually and emotionally satisfying than women. Emotional and sexual satisfaction were significantly different across sexual orientation groups in casual sexual relationship contexts but not in more committed relationship contexts. Gay men reported gaining the most sexual and emotional satisfaction out of casual sex contexts, with lesbian women reporting the least out of casual sexual contexts. Overall, this research found that a wide variety of relationship contexts, including casual sexual contexts, can be a source of both sexual and emotional satisfaction.",

Sexual problems may be caused or exacerbated by the diagnosis, investigation, and management of infertility (or subfertility), or they may be a contributory factor in childlessness. Any examination of a couple's difficulty in conceiving must include overt and clear questioning about their sexual activity. ### Responses to infertility In response to being unable to conceive, many people feel emotions such as anger, panic, despair, and grief, and these may have several effects on sexual activity. The stress of infertility and its treatment may be a cause of sexual difficulties for both the prospective father and mother. Intercourse may be avoided, with patterns of behaviour established, so that one or other partner is not reminded of the fertility problem. Postcoital tests or having to provide semen samples may result in a man feeling under pressure to perform, adversely affecting his erectile or ejaculatory ability. For some men, one or two failures during intercourse begins a vicious circle of fear of failure, with anxiety leading to further failures. Partners may also develop arousal difficulties because of anxiety or distress. Some individuals feel that their partner seems to want them only when there is a chance of conception, and sexual activity can then become a battleground for issues of power and control. #### Useful questions to elicit information",

      "abstract": "Research on casual sexual relationships and experiences (CSREs) has increased in the last decade; however, there is no consensus about the scope and definition of CSREs. To describe the main forms of CSREs, a latent profile analysis was performed on single and sexually active men and women aged from 18 to 30 years old who described their last casual sexual experience. Five profiles were identified: 1) the one-time sexual encounter; 2) the ex-romantic partnership, in which one still has sexual contact after ending their romantic relationship; 3) the mostly about sex partnership, in which contacts are primarily sexual, whether or not a friendship exists; 4) the intimate and sexual partnership, a hybrid of friend and romantic partner with whom one has frequent sexual and social interactions without commitment or intent to form a couple; 5) the friendship first partnership, a friendship to which sex is added, where social activities and friendly interactions dominate. Participants across profiles differed according to the number of sexual partners in the past year, their intention of having other sexual contacts with the partner, being under the influence of alcohol or drugs during the most recent sexual encounter with their partner and their type of sexual exclusivity agreement. This research contributes to a better description and understanding of CSREs among young adults and to further specifying its area of investigation.",

      "abstract": "Men's sexual overperception bias-where men tend to perceive greater sexual interest in women's behavior than actually exists-is a well-documented finding in previous research. All of the existing research, however, has tested this effect in the context of initial encounters or for fictitious or unknown targets. No research currently exists on how people perceive their romantic partner's sexual desire in the context of ongoing, intimate relationships. In 3 dyadic studies, we provide evidence that men in established romantic relationships err in the direction of the opposite bias and underperceive their romantic partner's sexual desire. We also demonstrate that this underperception bias is functional (particularly for men) in that it is associated with their partner feeling more satisfied and committed to the relationship. In addition, people are particularly likely to underperceive their partner's desire on days when they are motivated to avoid sexual rejection, and men's underperception bias is, in part, accounted for by men's higher general levels of sexual desire than women. The current studies extend previous findings on sexual perceptual biases and demonstrate the important role of context in men's judgments of a partner's sexual interest. (PsycINFO Database Record",

Interpersonal factors are also associated with sexual desire; both passionate love and overall relationship health (e.g., satisfaction, commitment, adjustment) are strongly linked with the amount of sexual desire that individuals feel for their partners. Reductions in sexual desire are common in most romantic relationships; however, sudden or sharp decreases may signal the development of an underlying interpersonal issue. Although less examined than other variables, sociocultural factors, including norms, stereotypes, laws, and religious doctrine, may also inhibit or facilitate the experience and expression of sexual desire.",

Specifically, LGBTQ+ refers to individuals who may identify as lesbian (L), gay (G), bisexual (B), transgender (T), queer (Q), or other sexual and/or gender identities (+). Given that many individuals live in heteronormative and cisnormative societies, the LGBTQ+ community experiences unique stressors specific to their traditionally marginalized identity/identities; such experiences are defined as experiences of <italic>minority stress</italic>. Aspects of minority stress, including stigma, prejudice, and discrimination, generate stressful social environments for LGBTQ+ individuals and these experiences are often negatively associated with individual and relationship well-being. For example, if an individual experiences harassment for their sexual and/or gender identity, they may experience feelings of distress and be more reserved with public displays of affection with their partner. As such, one romantic partner‚Äôs experience of minority stress can impact both they and their partner‚Äôs experiences. Relationship maintenance behaviors, such as communicating and coping with the stress together with one‚Äôs partner (dyadic coping), have been identified that may help mitigate minority stress‚Äô deleterious effects. Dyadic coping is a process that conceptualizes how partners cope with stress in the context of their relationship, identifying how partners communicate their stress and the respective coping behaviors. Finally, there has been an insurgence of relationship education programs designed to help LGBTQ+ couples identify and cope with experiences of minority stress. For example, the Couples Coping Enhancement Training‚ÄìSexual Minority Stress incorporates the unique experiences of sexual minority couples to help couples improve (minority) stress management; enhance their ability to cope as a couple; sensitize both partners to ideas of mutual fairness, equity, and respect; improve communication; and improve (emotional) problem-solving skills.",

      "abstract": "Most first-time mothers experience a decline in both their sexual and relationship satisfaction from prepregnancy, which has negative consequences for the couple and their family. Prior studies have begun to identify risk and protective factors (e.g., empathy) for postpartum sexual and relationship satisfaction. Causal attributions for postpartum sexual concerns may be important because a specific cause can be difficult to pinpoint given the wide range of postpartum sexual problems among first-time parents. In the current study, 120 first-time mothers (3‚Äì12 months postpartum) completed validated measures assessing attributions for postpartum sexual concerns, sexual satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction. Attributions were measured on four dimensions: internal/external (i.e., is the sexual concern due to the self or the situation), stable/unstable (i.e., will the cause of the concern occur again in the future), global/specific (i.e., will the cause of the concern affect other situations), and partner responsibility (i.e., is the partner the cause). When new mothers reported more stable and partner attributions for postpartum sexual concerns, they were less sexually satisfied, and when they attributed greater responsibility for sexual concerns to their partners, they were less satisfied with their overall relationship. These associations remained significant after controlling for potential challenges that may also impact sexual and relationship satisfaction during this period (i.e., breastfeeding, sexual frequency, depressive symptoms, fatigue, sexual functioning). As postpartum sexual concerns are common, attributions for these changes may be a valuable target for interventions aimed at strengthening the intimate relationships of women making the transition to parenthood.",

      "title": "Emphatic inaccuracy in husband to wife aggression: The overattribution bias",
      "abstract": "Is husbands‚Äô wife‚Äêdirected aggression related to unusual accuracy (hypersensitivity) or to bias (being likely to inappropriately infer criticism or rejection) when they infer women‚Äôs critical/rejecting thoughts and feelings? Results of a study using the empathic accuracy paradigm and signal detection analyses revealed that the greater the husbands‚Äô bias to overattribute criticism and rejection to the thoughts and feelings of women they had never met, the more the husbands reported behaving in a verbally aggressive way toward their own wives. This finding discourages the conclusion that maritally aggressive men are uniquely provoked by their own female partners, and instead suggests that they are biased to overattribute criticism and rejection to women in general. The strength of this overattribution bias correlated negatively with the men‚Äôs accuracy in inferring the actual content of the women‚Äôs thoughts and feelings. On the other hand, the husbands‚Äô thematic accuracy (their ability to accurately specify which of the stimulus women‚Äôs thoughts and feelings really were critical or rejecting) was associated with their self‚Äêreported marital satisfaction.",

      "title": "ATTITUDINAL DISTINCTIONS OF SOLO SEX ENGAGERS AMONG OLDER ADULTS",
      "abstract": "Abstract Solo sex gets little attention in the research on sexual activity of older adults as most studies frame definitions around partnered sexual behaviors. This does not reflect the reality of many older adults who lack active sexual partners due to death, dysfunction, or serious illness. When solo sex is included in studies, they rarely go beyond frequency. The aim of this study was to determine how sexually active older adults view solo sex, its importance, and attitude distinctions between solo sex engagers and non-engagers through survey research with a sample over age 60 (N=556). The majority (58%) of older adults engage in solo sex with men more likely (67%) than women (53%). As expected, solo sex engagers are twice as likely to use sexual toys and to be interested in using them if they currently do not. More solo sex engagers (70%) view orgasms as being extremely/very important for a good sexual experience than non-engagers (55%). Positive sexual outlooks correlate with solo sex as 80% of engagers anticipate an unlimited number of future orgasms compared to 65% of non-engagers. The most striking attitude distinction is 72% of engagers believe solo sex can be ‚Äúgreat sex‚Äù compared to only 39% of non-engagers. Solo sex has psychological and physiological benefits for older adults and this study demonstrates solo sex correlates with positive sexual attitudes. The findings of this study highlight the need for further attention to the importance of solo sex for older adults and how it relates to positive sexual health.",

      "title": "Sexual Manifestations of Emotionally Disturbed Behavior",
      "abstract": "It is difficult to define sexual disturbance today because concepts about emotional disturbance in general and sexual disorder in particular have recently undergone signifi cant changes. Sexual disorders may be seen in terms of (a) specific aberrant acts or (b) the psychological and philo sophic causes that underlie such acts. It would appear to be more meaningful to define them largely in relation to the self- defeating ways in which and reasons for which an individual behaves sexually rather than in terms of the concrete behav iors he performs. When so viewed, the basic causes of sexual disorders seem to be quite the same as those of most general emotional difficulties. Societal reaction to disturbed indi viduals with sexual problems has improved in recent years but is still much too condemnatory and punitive. At the same time, some social thinkers, in a misguided effort to pre vent the persecution of sexually troubled and deviant indi viduals unrealistically refuse to face the facts of their intrinsic neurosis or psychosis and trace all their upsets to social persecution. Sexually disturbed persons are not easy to treat successfully for a variety of reasons, especially by conven tional psychoanalytic methods. But if a hard-headed thera pist actively-directively intervenes in their lives and induces them to challenge and work against their irrational value systems, he may achieve effective results in a relatively brief period of time.",

      "abstract": "‚ÄúSexual and reproductive health and wellbeing are essential if people are to have responsible, safe and satisfying sexual lives. Sexual health requires a positive approach to human sexuality and an understanding of the complex factors that shape human sexual behaviour. These factors affect whether the expression of sexuality leads to sexual health and wellbeing or to sexual behaviour that put people at risk or make them vulnerable to sexual and reproductive illhealth. Health program managers, policy ‚Äì makers and care providers need to understand and promote the potentially positive role sexuality can play in peoples‚Äô lives and to build health services that can promote sexually health societies.‚Äù ‚Äì (WHO 2006) There is increasing number of cancer survivors worldwide. A lot of them experience sexual dysfunction for a long time which can last beyond ten years post treatment. Sexual dysfunction can occur as a result of any aspect of cancer and cancer treatment. Sexual functioning and/or satisfaction have been found to be of concern to many cancer survivors. Sexual function can be affected by physical or emotional trauma especially if the genitals are affected and can adversely affect the quality of life of the patients. Sexual dysfunction includes erectile dysfunction in males and disruption in the sexual response cycle (sexual desire, excitement, arousal, orgasm and resolution) and dyspareunia in women. There are differences in the pattern of sexual dysfunction between males and females as females may be able to cope better than males emotionally. Bonini-Colmano et al. (2007) noted that malignant diseases have a strong influence in quality of life, sexuality being one of the most affected variables. In their study to determine the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in a cohort of patients with cancer and its relationship with the following: pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, mechanisms of adaptation to stress, anxiety and depression, questionnaires were used which included treatment, adverse events, Zimong and Snaith depression and anxiety scale, sexual dysfunction questionnaire, coping strategies of Tobin David, Hopwood body image scale and the analogical visual test for pain evaluation. Sixty four patients were evaluated. Seventy two percent were women and median age was 50 years. Libido was absent in 50%; this was associated with gender (better in men; p=0,05) and the presence of pain (p=0,05) and fatigue (p=0,05) but not with age. All patients who had intact libido also had arousal and orgasms; this was more prevalent in men than in women and in subjects younger than 60 years. Arousal was absent in 47% of cases. Forty four percent of men had erectile dysfunction; this was present in all patients older than 60 years. Frequency of",

      "abstract": "Sexual self-schema (SSS) ‚Äì the cognitive frameworks that organize information about one‚Äôs own sexuality ‚Äì are known to guide sexual attitudes and behaviors, and are thus likely to interact with the kinds of people to whom one is attracted (i.e., heterosexual, same-sex/gender, monosexual or bisexual patterns of attraction). Extending prior work highlighting differences in SSS between discrete sexual orientation identity groups, we investigated associations between multiple aspects of SSS and attraction patterns among 602 young adults with a range of sexual orientations. Generally, there were more similarities than differences in SSS across individuals with monosexual vs. bisexual patterns of attraction. However, a few significant effects emerged, with significant differences across sex/gender. For women, the greatest differences were seen between romantic self-schema in women with asexual vs. non-asexual patterns of attractions, while women with bisexual attractions were relatively similar to those with monosexual attractions (either exclusively heterosexual or same-sex/gender attracted). For men, however, the greatest differences were seen between open/liberal self-schema in exclusively same-sex/gender attracted men vs. either bisexual or heterosexually attracted men. Broadly, these findings point to subtle sex/gender differences in how bisexual attractions interact with one‚Äôs conceptualization of one‚Äôs sexual self. Also, a non-trivial portion (22%) of participants reported attractions to gender non-binary people, and these attractions significantly predicted different SSS, suggesting the need to measure attractions outside of the gender binary.",

However, psychologists have less knowledge about such people's everyday pursuits. In the present study, the authors examined authoritarian interest in film, live events, music, and reading. A predictable pattern of correlates emerged. For example, authoritarians enjoyed activities in which physical conflict was prominent, whereas authoritarians tended not to like entertainment that offered introspection. In general, the present results were consistent across 2 samples (N = 120, N = 90). Although men and women had significantly different preferences on over 0.5 of the leisure pursuits (e.g., men enjoyed action films more than did women), there were no significant gender differences in the magnitudes of correlates with authoritarianism. In general, leisure interests appeared to be partly manifestations or expressions of authoritarian tendencies.",

Problems of sexual arousal in women are now recognized to mirror erectile dysfunction in men in many ways and assessment of cardiovascular disease should form part of the routine assessment of women presenting with sexual problems of lack of vaginal arousal (including lubrication) or clitoral arousal. However, psychosocial issues can predominate and perpetuate sexual problems for women and often require concurrent assessment. The sexual difficulties may be concurrent to erectile dysfunction or another sexual problem in the man. An offer of multiple interventions should be recommended where indicated.",

Se admite hoy en d√≠a que m√°s de un tercio de las mujeres ha padecido violencia (psicol√≥gica, f√≠sica o sexual) en alg√∫n momento de sus vidas. La violencia sexual es la versi√≥n m√°s extrema de violencia contra la mujer y concurre usualmente con los otros dos tipos de violencia.

Las personas m√°s cercanas a las v√≠ctimas (pareja actual o anterior, sus familiares o personas conocidas), generalmente con poder sobre ellas, son los perpetradores m√°s comunes.

Las consecuencias pueden ser inmediatas o de corto, mediano y largo plazos y se dan sobre la salud f√≠sica (suicidio, homicidio, muertes derivadas de sida o por complicaciones del embarazo; lesiones leves y graves, infecciones p√©lvicas y de transmisi√≥n sexual, embarazos ect√≥picos, embarazos no deseados, abortos espont√°neos o inducidos, peso bajo al nacer) y mental (depresi√≥n, ansiedad, s√≠ndrome postraum√°tico, s√≠ndrome posviolaci√≥n, trastornos del sue√±o, obesidad, consumo de alcohol, drogas y tabaco y conductas sexuales de riesgo, entre otras) y tiene tambi√©n impacto social (costos derivados de la atenci√≥n de la salud y de la atenci√≥n legal, implicancias sobre la productividad y el empleo).

Some bisexual individuals internalize society's negative attitudes, resulting in an experience of self-stigma. Consequently, many bisexual individuals report a reduced sense of belonging. The current study explored whether self-stigma mediates the association between experiences of anti-bisexual prejudice and a sense of belonging within a bisexual sample (n = 529) while also identifying how experiences of anti-bisexual prejudice vary as a function of participant gender (man, woman, non-binary) and the source of prejudice (gay/lesbian or heterosexual). Self-stigma fully mediated the association between anti-bisexual experiences and a sense of belonging. Women and non-binary individuals reported more frequent anti-bisexual experiences than men, and all participants reported more frequent anti-bisexual experiences from heterosexual versus gay/lesbian sources. Efforts to improve a sense of belonging among bisexual individuals should focus on reducing anti-bisexual prejudice and anti-bisexual self-stigma.",

On the other side, sexuality can be maintained up to high age. In any case is the demand for affection, tenderness, love and sexual relations nearly always present, and its realization should not be inhibited. The sexual reactions are decreased and retarded. Therefore often a change of the role and behaviour pattern of the partners is necessary in the sexual contact. The partners should know their mutual problems and desires, show understanding and should adjust to each other.

The possibility of false allegation needs to be considered, particularly if allegations are coming from the parent rather than a child, if parents are engaged in dispute over custody or visitation, and/or if the child is a preschooler. False allegations may arise in other situations as well, such as the misinterpretation of a child's statement or behavior by relative or caretakers. And children may make false statement in psychiatric evaluations. A case of false allegation of sexual abuse made by mentally retarded 10 year-old girl who has been located in an institute is presented. During her evaluation process, it was clinician's diagnostic impression that she had no been sexually abused but sexually stimulated in some way, and most of what she said was a fantasy lie. Its pathological mechanism is discussed in terms of pseudologia fantastica along with the review of literatures.",

Los hallazgos apuntan que las alteraciones causadas en la funcion sexual dependen del nivel y del grado de la lesion medular. Fueron observadas alteraciones en la sensibilidad, reduccion en la misma; en la ereccion, dificultad en hacerla o mantenerla; en la evaluacion, que puede estar impedida o hacerse retrograda; en la fertilizacion, reduccion del numero de espermas; en la lubricacion, que puede estar disminuida; entre otros. La movilidad alterada es uno de los factores que mas perjudica el portador de lesion medular en el desempeno del acto sexual. Se concluye que la satisfaccion de los antojos sexuales es un factor que proporciona estado de bienestar, con eso es importante que la pareja recoja descubrir diferentes formas de satisfacer esos antojos. La implicacion y la comprension del companero son extremadamente importantes en todo el transcurrir de la conquista de la satisfaccion sexual.",

      "title": "Male sexuality and mental void",
      "abstract": "In male patients having severe problems in the nucleus of their narcissistic structure, disturbed sexuality is an attempt at compensating for mental void and not a mere manifestation of \"perversion\". The complexity of the sexual life of some patients is not primarily caused by the \"acting-out\" generated by their instinctive, pregenital fixations or polymorphous and/or perverse fixations, but by an attempt of compensation of the underlying mental void. Patients with mental void have a tendency to pass from the signal of anxiety to dread. This is an indication of their ego fragility, particularly the narcissistic fragility of the organizing identifications of their psychic apparatus. Very often, sexual experiences carried out in order to shape an exaggerated masculine identity, followed by polymorphous sexual behaviour of different kinds, are attempts at evolution, an evolution that has probably been somehow interrupted during their lives.",

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "Although the criteria for the sexual disorders are relatively straightforward, they hint at the challenge of categorizing sexual problems. For example, a diagnostic system that intends to meaningfully describe sexual dysfunction must take into consideration the broad range of normal sexual response. The system must take into account the fact that dysfunction and distress depend heavily on the individual's expectations, wishes, and opportunities regarding sexual activity (as well as those of his or her partner). It should consider the effects of aging. It should consider the effects of proscriptive societal and religious norms on sexual behavior as well as take into account what it means to sexually function as a man or woman (or elsewhere on the modern gender continuum). The system should also take into account medications and illnesses that predictably reduce sexual desire and/or function, as well as those that predictably intensify desire and/or function, in addition to the reality that most assessments of sexual function and dysfunction are incomplete without an understanding that although sexual response has a biological underpinning, it is experienced from intrapersonal, interpersonal, and cultural perspectives. In that biopsychosocial context, making a diagnosis of, for example, male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is potentially more complicated than briefly exploring whether the patient is interested in having sex. DSM-5 identifies eight sexual dysfunctions, four specific to men, three specific to women, and one that can apply to either gender (substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction). DSM-5 terminology and criteria vary somewhat between the genders. For example, men may have erectile disorder and/or male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, but for women, the somewhat comparable condition is merged into female sexual interest/arousal disorder. DSM-5-TR addresses the fact that both men and women can have difficulties with orgasm. Whereas women may meet criteria for female orgasmic disorder, men may be diagnosed with either delayed ejaculation or premature (early) ejaculation. Women can also have genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, a diagnosis that is new to DSM-5 and that was developed in response to the increasing recognition that the prior diagnoses of vaginismus and dyspareunia were highly comorbid and difficult to distinguish. In addition, as is generally the case in DSM-5, there are categories for clinical presentations that either do not quite meet criteria or are incomplete (i.e., other specified or unspecified sexual dysfunction). Except for substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction, all of the sexual dysfunctions require a minimum duration of 6 months. In addition, each disorder can be noted to be lifelong versus acquired and generalized versus situational. If a medical condition is deemed pertinent, it can be listed as a specifier, but DSM-5 has specifically excluded the previous diagnosis of sexual dysfunction due to a medical condition because of the view that most of the sexual dysfunctions can be attributable to both psychological and biological factors. The sexual dysfunction diagnoses are applicable to gender-diverse individuals. In particular, DSM-5-TR encourages clinician judgment when assessing sexual dysfunctions among transgender, nonbinary, agender, and other individuals who may not appear to fit this chapter's categories. When the diagnosis is based on anatomy (e.g., erectile dysfunction), DSM-5-TR guides the clinician to base the diagnosis on the person's current anatomy rather than on the sex assigned at birth.",

Theories of sexual addiction suggest that these individuals regulate their emotions poorly, as evidenced by coactivation of positive and negative emotions during sexual stimulation. Men and women who either reported problems down-regulating their use of VSS (VSS-P, N = 71) or no problem regulating use of VSS (VSS-C, N = 49) watched a neutral film and a sexual film. They reported their positive and negative feelings after each film. Unexpectedly, the VSS-P group exhibited significantly less coactivation of positive and negative affect to the sexual film than VSS-C. This is inconsistent with emotion dysregulation, supposedly a key feature of ‚Äúhypersexual disorder.‚Äù Affect regulation could be failing at a different stage of sexual stimulus processing not studied.

In Bachmann and coll. study, sexually active women ranging from 60 to 70, without HRT had higher mean levels of E2 and T than sexually inactive women. Of course the numerous complaints of that period (hot flushes, asthenia, tachycardia...) are creating physical and psychological conditions rather damaging for sexuality. They may also induce a state of true suffering with a loss of self esteem resulting in a more introverted way of life. In other cases, it is the psychological context in it self (depression, anxiety, relational difficulty with the partner or even male sexual problems) which is interfering. An actual amelioration of sexual life can be obtained with HRT plus or a minima percutaneous androgenotherapy in some cases. The treatment is indeed an asset for the therapeutic support, even from the psychotherapeutic point of view.",

This diagnosis is intended to include only individuals who experience dissatisfaction with their low levels of sexual desire. Women with this condition will often report that they \"want to want\" more sex, while women with low levels of sexual desire that do not meet HSDD criteria will indicate no bother or concerns with the frequency of their sexual desire. The subjective experience of distress caused by low desire is a critical component of the diagnosis of HSDD because many individuals are not alarmed by low levels of sexual desire. Indeed, an epidemiological study conducted in Australia demonstrated that 32% of women who are 20‚Äì70 years old report low sexual desire, but only 16% report distress caused by the low sexual desire [2].",

      "abstract": "Sexuality with a disabling disease, or serious disabling or disability: a sensitive subject probably due to the association of the two words: sexuality and disability. The question of the emotional life, the life of a couple, the sexuality of a person living with a disability remains a real social and cultural problem. This necessarily impacts on the people concerned because they are victims of their states of disability. This is a subject that is difficult to address both by the couple, by society and by health professionals. In addition, it should be noted that regardless of their physical or psychological state, their visible or invisible disability, their chronic, serious, rare, disabling or disabling illness, or simply their difference, everyone has their own sexual identity. The feeling of love, the affective life, the sexual life of a person with a disability, their life as a couple, pleasure, do not disappear with the onset of illness or disability, it is accessible to all, disabled, sick, in a couple or single, married or not, all have the right to sexuality, to an emotional life regardless of their physical appearance, their mental handicap or other differences... However, for many people in a situation of disability, living one's sexuality remains a difficult aspect in their life as a couple, or not, or in their daily lives. Disability, whatever its origin, can contribute to the alteration or changes in the sexual life of a lambda individual, thus affecting his sexuality, his sexual pleasure... Health professionals are often confronted with suffering, physical and/or psychological pain. However, even today the question of the fulfillment and sexual serenity of people with disabilities remains a silent subject, an unresolved issue, not popularized, not a priority if I can put it that way, but the question of pleasure sex is often overlooked. It would seem that social representations approach the subject of the affective relationship and the love life of sick or disabled people, their life as a couple, their intimacy as a couple, their affective and love life, as being abnormality in the face of what they consider \"normal\".",

Using a multivariate approach, this study investigated the relationships among sexual narcissism, sexual function/dysfunction, and sexual and overall relationship satisfaction in 1297 men completing an online survey about sexual history, sexual health, sexual function/dysfunction, and narcissism. Results indicated widespread differences on various sexual parameters between narcissistic and non-narcissistic men, with narcissistic men showing higher sexualization overall as well as higher auto-erotic orientation. Higher sexual narcissism was also significantly associated with various symptoms of sexual impairment, including a propensity toward both premature ejaculatory response and delayed ejaculatory response. Despite this association, both sexual narcissism and sexual function/dysfunction scores also independently predicted sexual and overall relationship satisfaction. Discussion focuses in part on explaining how two diametrically opposed sexual problems‚Äîrapid ejaculation and delayed/inhibited ejaculation‚Äîmight play out sequentially in the sexual relationships of narcissistic men.",

      "title": "The Psychology of Sexual Deviance",
      "abstract": "There is one topic that is guaranteed to polarise any group that discusses it, and that is sex. The perception of what is sexually perverted shifts dependent on who is talking about it. A person‚Äôs profession, gender, age, race, proclivities, education and even which century they live in, have all effected the viewpoint on sex and sexual perversions. For example, homosexuality has long been stigmatised as sexually perverted, (and remains so among some portions of society), but psychological and medical professionals no longer consider it pathological. Even the term perversion is controversial. Psychologists generally refer to non-traditional sexual behaviour as sexual deviation or, in cases where the specific object of arousal is unusual, as paraphilia. There are a number of clinically recognised disorders of sexual or paraphiliac function, including fetishism (the object of sexual desire is either an inanimate object or a non-genital part of the human anatomy), voyeurism (the covert viewing of other individuals who are naked, undressing, or engaged in sexual activity) and chronophilia (the primary sexual attraction is to a particular age group). Many of these behaviours are punishable by law. Although rape is not classified as a paraphilia, it is a serious sexual deviance, and perhaps the most highly reviled form of sexual gratification. \r\nThis lecture will explore forms of sexual deviance and sexual violence that come to the attention of forensic psychology, and outline the psychological theories that attempt to explain why some people find sexual gratification in unusual and illegal ways. You may be surprised at the ways in which the law impinges upon sex.",

      "title": "437 - The elderly and their sexuality: specific challenges and the roleof the psychiatrist",
      "abstract": "Abstract The model of sexuality currently in force is a young, genitalized model, that does not tolerate failures and often forgets about affective communication, sharing and body contact. This model is also not compatible with the natural aging process, generating manymyths about sexuality in later life. Although a taboo subject, the majority (up to 70%) of healthy 70-year-olds revealedthemselves to be sexually active even with some sexual dysfunction reports. Low sexual desire (up to 43%) was the most prevalent reported sexual difficulty in women, and erectiledifficulties (up to 37%) were most prevalent among men. Aging impacts sexuality in various ways: age-related organic/metabolic changes in men and women; age-related affective and cognitive changes also in both genders; age-and duration-related changes in a couple‚Äôs dynamic interaction, which can lead to discrepancy between the partners and their sexual narratives. In the sexual response cycle, aging affects the stages of desire, arousal/excitement,plateau, orgasm, and resolution/refractory period both men and women. Depressed mood as well as the use of antidepressant drugs, deterioration of cognitive function and difficulties to communicate can cause loss of intimacy and emotional closeness which then may result in sexual withdrawal and difficulties. Repetitive experiences of failure increase even more the couple distress. There are also to consider medical conditions, medication side effects, loss of physical capacity, subjective loss of attractiveness, lack of a partner, institutionalization or living withtheir children, which can be obstacles to sexual activity in the elderly. Diagnostic workup has to integrate not only general medical, gynecological, urological andpsychiatric factors, but also take a systemic perspective which deals with the interaction pattern of the partners. Treatment of sexual dysfunctions in later life combines biomedical interventions with psychotherapeutic and psychosocial strategies. An essential therapeutic contribution for allcouples is, however, basic counseling and psychoeducation. Explaining how aging has an impact and how other individuals and couples experience these changes is an important step in empowering the couple, clarifying and correcting the sociocultural myths andencouraging the couple to build their very own sexuality.",

Relative to partners in heterosexual couples, those in gay or lesbian couples did not differ in reasons for the separation or in level of separation distress. Aspects of relationship quality assessed shortly before the separation occurred did not predict later separation distress. However, individuals who indicated that problems with intimacy were the cause of the separation were unlikely to be distressed by the separation, whereas individuals who indicated that problems with communication were the cause of the separation were likely to be distressed by the separation. Separation distress was positively related to the severity of neurotic symptoms reported when the relationship was intact and was negatively related to the extent to which the separation was expected. It is concluded that separation distress is more strongly related to personal strategies for coping with stress than to relationship‚Äêrelated events leading to separation.",

These women's imagination and experience of good sex is composed of a multitude of components. Women may feel good because they can achieve other psychological and social aims that are important in their lives (which could be related to the maintenance of marriage or the peace of the family). Women may feel good because of the erotic satisfaction that they derive from different pursuits including interests, leisure or other intimate relationships, rather than sexual fulfilment in terms of orgasm or physical pleasure. Women may reformulate their pleasures variously at different stages of their lives. Social respectability, orgasm, emotional intimacy, or any other specific elements, may all enter or leave the formula for good sex.",

Most preferred women for romantic partnerships, but were wary of casual hookups with women. The trait they felt made women better romantic partners‚Äîemotional compatibility‚Äîalso made many uncomfortable with women as hookup partners, as they felt that women would become too attached.

We know by now that castration anxiety, penis envy, and the traumas and frustrations of oedipal conflict are easy to demonstrate; but if the first stage in female development is different from Freud's description-if a fundamental, fixed sense of being rightfully a female is established in earliest childhood-then our psychology of women needs repair. The factors that make up this stage, with examples, are reviewed: (1) a biological \"force\": the effect of circulating fetal sex hormones on the brain of the fetus; (2) sex assignment: the announcement at the time of birth to the parents that they have had a boy or a girl (or a hermaphrodite); (3) parental attitudes: the effects of the sex assignment on parents, then reflected back onto the infant; (4) \"biopsychic\" phenomena: early postnatal effects caused by certain habitual patterns of handling the infant-conditioning, imprinting(?), or other forms of nonconflictual learning; (5) developing body ego: sensations, especially from the genitals, that define the child's dimensions. I suggest that one can divide the development of femininity in females into two phases, both of which lead to adult femininity, but each of which contributes in a different manner. The first, nonconflictual in origin, contributes a sense of femaleness and some of what allows for one's looking feminine; the second, the result of conflict, especially oedipal, produces a richer and more complicated femininity, not merely one of appearances, but one enriched by desires to perform with the substance, rather than just the fa√ßade, of femininity.",

      "title": "Sexuality and chronic pain.",
      "abstract": "F or the chronic pain sufferer, sexual expression may become distorted, inhibited, sublimated, alienated, demanding or fearful-patterns frequently seen in people who view sexual activity as a duty or a means of procreation. The idea that sexual activity will cause, precipitate, or aggravate the pain may yield reluctance to participate, thus further anxiety and depression, which can diminish sexual function. Yet the human need and desire for sexual warmth is not negated by pain. Sexuality does not stop when pain strikes, it merely changes. Some form of sexual expression is possible for, and the right of any, regardless of disability, according to Weinberg(1). Although illnesses and surgical procedures may produce sexual difficulties, none have more devastating effects than diseases of the neuromuscular system(2). Any impairment of parasympathetic nerve activity, or loss of muscular and/or skeletal movement-such as with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, or arthritis-can involve sexual dysfunction. The most difficult position for people with restrictive movement is the one most frequently used for intercourse. Although the male-on-top position allows good vocal and visual communication, a female with arthritis may be unable to abduct and rotate her hips for the supine position(3). Alternative sidelying and rear-entry positions may be less strenuous and may ease the partner's fear of causing pain. Major tranquilizers, skeletal muscle relaxants, and narcotics are a major part of some pain treatments but a diminished libido and potency are common side effects. Patients need to be informed about these effects and should be helped in timing their doses. Peter Koestenbaum writes, many people conceptualize their dissatisfaction with life in terms of sexual problems, but their real difficulty lies in",

      "title": "ERECTION DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "The first physiological response to effective sexual stimulation, produced by a source of physical or mental stimulation, is the erection of the penis. Erection usually occurs within 3-8 seconds of the onset of arousal. When sexual tension and erection reach a certain level in the presence of the partner, the need for interference appears. The intensity of the erection may increase or decrease until it disappears, whether the arousal is prolonged or not. The complicated anatomical apparatus is regulated by a nervous mechanism, just as complex, being dependent to a remarkable extent on psychic influences. By the strong interweaving of these two components - psychological and functional - the sexual function is subject to changes. Erectile dysfunction, when it occurs, is obvious because, although there may be libido, the lack of an erection makes it impossible to perform sexual intercourse. Erectile dysfunction should not be confused with isolated or occasional failures to obtain or maintain a penile erection. They do not constitute a condition or disease that justifies medical attention and should be perceived as absolutely normal. The vast majority of men face such an episode at some point in their lives. One can speak of erectile dysfunction in the case of a recurrent or persistent inability to obtain an erection or to maintain it long enough to complete sexual intercourse, which lasts at least three months. It is especially important because in a normal activity, without erection, intercourse, ejaculation and orgasm cannot take place. (Pathologically, premature ejaculation can occur, without an erection, in the form of pollution!)",

Those guilty of sexual offenses fall into a special category that is called ‚Äúsex offenders‚Äù within which there is a diversification of ways concerning the manner, degree and motivations.

Ha due componenti cardinali: il bisogno sessuale, inteso come sensazione/pulsione fisica che spinge a cercarsi sessualmente, con prevalente componente biologica, e il desiderio, emozione erotica\r\nche si nutre di distanza, di ricordi, di anticipazioni, di motivazioni affettive o strumentali, e che ha maggiori componenti di tipo psicosessuale e relazionale.

      "abstract": "Given that the prevailing literature largely neglects the unwanted sexual activity experiences of men, this study examined both prevalence and predictors of men's compliance with unwanted, but consensual, sexual activity. Specifically, we examined whether traditional gender-role endorsement, belief in male sexuality stereotypes, and age predict sexual compliance among heterosexual men. Participants (N = 426 men) completed a brief demographic questionnaire, measures of gender-role beliefs and male sexuality stereotypes, as well as a modified measure investigating motives for consenting to unwanted kissing, sexual touching, oral sex, and/or penetrative sex. The reported incidence rate of mild sexual compliance (i.e. consenting to unwanted kissing at least once) in heterosexual men was 61.3% over the past 12 months. Results suggest that sexual compliance in heterosexual men may be predicted by their endorsement of traditional gender-role beliefs and male sexuality stereotypes. Moreover, men may be motivated to be sexually compliant due to motives of altruism, intoxication, sexual inexperience, peer pressure, popularity, and sex-role concerns.",

      "title": "Why is absent/low sexual desire a mental disorder (except when patients identify as asexual)?",
      "abstract": "This analytic essay challenges the psychiatric practice of treating absent/low sexual interest/desire/arousal as a mental disorder. It does so by calling attention to the fact that asexuality is treated differently than other non-heterosexual orientations. The current DSM contains no psychiatric diagnosis which has, as its primary symptom, same-sex sexual desire. Yet, the same DSM offers diagnoses such as male hypoactive sexual desire disorder and female sexual interest/arousal disorder which have, as their primary symptom, absent/low sexual interest/desire/arousal. One of the unfortunate consequences of treating absent/low sexual desire as a mental disorder is that it perpetuates the false belief that those who experience their sexuality differently than the heterosexual ‚Äòsexusociety‚Äô norm are less healthy and more dysfunctional. It is also troubling because of the implied gender bias: women are more likely to experience absent/low sexual interest/desire/arousal than men and more likely to be diagnosed with a sexual interest/desire/arousal disorder. Women‚Äôs sexual desires, or the absence thereof, are, thus, more likely to be seen as abnormal. Since that judgment has long been used to pressure women to engage in sex they do not want, the unavoidable inference is that the psychiatric tradition of diagnosing absent/low sexual desire as pathological has placed, and continues to place, women at greater risk of sexual exploitation and abuse. The remedy: stop treating absent/low sexual desire as pathological. Recognize that people are sexually different and are entitled to desire sex a lot, a little, or not at all‚Äîwhatever feels right for them.",

      "abstract": "Responses to conflict were studied in samples of college students from a highly collectivistic society (China, n = 207) and a highly individualistic society (United States n = 209). As predicted, the collectivistic society reported more conflict-reducing behaviors and less verbal or physical aggression. However, the effect of individualism/collectivism was moderated by both the ingroup/outgroup status of the target and gender of the participant. Chinese and US women did not differ on any measure. However, of the four groups, Chinese men reported the most conflict-reducing behaviors and the least physical aggression, whereas US men reported the fewest conflict-reducing behaviors and the greatest physical aggression. As predicted, conflict-reducing behaviors were more common in the ingroup condition and both verbal and physical aggression was more common in the outgroup condition. However, the latter were moderated by gender of the participant. US men reported greater physical aggression than any other group. Neither gender nor society had any effect on the level of indirect aggression. There were no gender or individualism/collectivism effects on indirect aggression. Observed gender effects were attributed to differences in how collectivistic and individualistic societies conceptualize masculinity. The effect sizes associated with the ingroup/outgroup condition were consistently and substantially larger than effect sizes associated with individualism/collectivism or gender. Aggr.

      "abstract": "An examination of cognitive sexual orientation, sexual partner activity, and sexual identity was conducted among 76 lesbian/bisexual female youths and 80 gay/bisexual male youths (age range of 14‚Äì21 years) recruited from community‚Äêbased or college organizations for lesbian / gay youths in New York City. Self‚Äêidentification as lesbian / gay or bisexual changed over time; more than half the youths who identified as lesbian / gay at the interview had considered themselves bisexual in the past, and vice versa. A modal developmental sequence of cognitions and behaviors was found: Most youths first became aware of a cognitive sexual orientation (e.g., attractions and fantasies) toward the same or other sex, then considered a lesbian / gay or bisexual identity, and finally felt certain of a lesbian / gay or bisexual identity. Age at initiation of sexual activity with females or males was inconsistently related to this pattern. Significant gender differences indicated that females were older than males when they first considered (M years of 13.9 and 12.5, respectively) or were certain of (M years of 15.9 and 14.6 years, respectively) being lesbian/gay. The majority of youths had a history of sexual activity with the same sex (88% of females and 95% of males) and the other sex (80% of females and 56% of males). The youths became sexually active during the early adolescent years, both with the same sex and the other sex. Their sexual practices, with the same and other sex, followed an initiation sequence beginning with manual (i.e., hand‚Äêgenital) sex during the early teens and ending with anal practices during the middle and late teens. No significant gender differences were found in lifetime prevalence rates or ages at initiating sexual practices with the same sex. Gender differences were found for other‚Äêsex partners: Females became sexually active at an older age than did males, and more females than males engaged in heterosexual activity. No significant differences in the psychosexual variables were found among Black, Hispanic, White, and youths of other ethnic backgrounds.",

The deficit or distortion of these developmental conditions blocks the satisfaction of the needs of the adolescent's personality, which are the source of sociogenesis. The most vulnerable in the development process are adolescents with developmental disabilities, which is associated with the specifics of the socio-biological conditions in which they grow up. Disorders sensory (visual or hearing), motor or mental spheres in adolescents with disabilities, as well as the specifics of the social situation of their development lead to difficulties in communication, expression of emotions, lower levels of self-control, possession of verbal and nonverbal communication in adolescents of this group. Deprivation or delay in the development of social needs in adolescence can lead to frustration, impoverish the conditions for the development of the individual as a whole. Solving the experimental task of identifying the main social needs of adolescents with developmental disabilities in three different groups (mentally retarded, visually impaired, and hard of hearing) in comparison with normatively developing adolescents, we assume that they will differ in their specificity and severity.",

      "title": "Determinants of Juvenile Deviant Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract. Deviant behavior of minors manifests in various forms and with different degrees of intensity, influenced by external social environments and the individual characteristics of the minor's personality, which shape their reactions to various life challenges. Behavior that deviates from generally accepted expectations can be either constructive or destructive, and deviant behavior, accordingly, can be positive or negative. The evaluation of such behavior is based on the social consequences of the deviation. The article establishes that within the framework of criminological research, the focus is on negative deviant behavior of minors, which may result in criminal responsibility (in accordance with the Criminal Code of Ukraine) or may not lead to such responsibility (e.g., withdrawal from social contact, self-isolation, or avoidance of societal norms and interaction with others; behavior contrary to common communication norms, such as rudeness; alcohol consumption by minors, which may not yet lead to offenses but is socially unacceptable; behavior that violates aesthetic or moral standards but is not illegal, such as extreme forms of tattooing or piercing; protest behavior, for instance, ignoring traditions or deliberately breaking etiquette; or actions by minors that have the objective signs of criminal offenses, but the perpetrators have not yet reached the age of criminal liability). The article states that there is no single theory of deviant behavior, including among minors. However, all researchers agree on the following point: eliminating certain factors can significantly reduce the likelihood of deviant behavior, but only a systematic approach to addressing all determinants of deviance provides grounds to talk about a high probability of significantly reducing or partially eradicating such actions. Deviant behavior is a complex form of social behavior influenced by a range of interconnected factors. Thus, in each case of deviant behavior, it is insufficient to investigate only biological, psychological, or social factors. A comprehensive approach that considers all these factors together is necessary, as such behavior results from the unsuccessful socialization of youth: due to disruptions in the processes of identification and individualization, such individuals are prone to \"social disorganization,\" where cultural norms, values, and social ties are either absent, weakened, or in conflict with each other. It is important to create conditions for preventing negative deviant behavior, particularly through the promotion of a healthy lifestyle, fostering a favorable socio-psychological climate in the child's environment, and providing opportunities for personal self-realization in society.

      "title": "[Impact of aging on sexuality].",
      "abstract": "Numerous authors on sexual behaviors have studied the link between the persistence of a sexually active life and progressive aging. The knowledge of sexual health in the elderly has shown that biological sexual aging is extremely diverse and heterogeneous in men as well as in women, and contradicts the stereotype of age that would inevitably alter the sexual biological response in each human. Sexual diseases (lubrication, dyspareunia, erectile dysfunction, inability to achieve orgasm) and diseases of aging that impact sexual function have a growing incidence but don't never touch 100% of individuals. There is a decline in sexual interest correlated with the life-span, but the negative effects of age on desire are related to health problems. Moreover, sexual desire is more correlated with personal attitudes toward sexuality than with biological factors and diseases. Several predictors account for the pursuit of an active sexuality (including the presence of a partner, good health, having good sexual self-esteem, enjoyable past experience, an attitude that values the importance of sex in couple relationship), but the most decisive factor to successfully face the specific markers of aging is the ability to adapt to a more sensory sexuality, less focused on performance and coitus.",

      "abstract": "The sex drive refers to the strength of sexual motivation. Across many different studies and measures, men have been shown to have more frequent and more intense sexual desires than women, as reflected in spontaneous thoughts about sex, frequency and variety of sexual fantasies, desired frequency of intercourse, desired number of partners, masturbation, liking for various sexual practices, willingness to forego sex, initiating versus refusing sex, making sacrifices for sex, and other measures. No contrary findings (indicating stronger sexual motivation among women) were found. Hence we conclude that the male sex drive is stronger than the female sex drive. The gender difference in sex drive should not be generalized to other constructs such as sexual or orgasmic capacity, enjoyment of sex, or extrinsically motivated sex.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The sexual interactions of young adults are characterized by a surprising amount of coercion and aggression. Assumptions about the causal antecedents of sexual desire may contribute to sexual miscommunication and the failed negotiations that result in sexual harassment and date rape. I examined the impact of one presumed cause of female desire (i.e., romantic love or romantic events) on perceptions of a heterosexual, sexual interaction. Results indicated that the perceived level of sexual desire felt by a female target and the extent to which she is believed to want sex mediated the relation between a male target's sexual request style (romantic vs. sexual) and the extent to which their sexual interaction was viewed as consensual. Neither gender nor previous experience with harassment or assault moderated this result; however, main effects for gender were found such that men attributed greater sexual desire to the female target than did women, and women perceived the female target as less responsible for the occurrence of intercourse than did men.",

      "abstract": "While most studies on sexuality in later life report that sexual desire declines with age, little is known about the exact nature of age effects on sexual desire. Using self-reported dyadic sexual desire relating to a partner, dyadic sexual desire relating to an attractive person, and solitary sexual desire from a large (N &amp;gt; 8000) and age-diverse (14.6 - 80.2 years) online sample, the current study had three goals: First, we investigated relationships between men and women‚Äôs sexual desire and age. Second, we examined whether individual differences such as gender/sex, sexual orientation, self-rated masculinity, relationship status, self-rated attractiveness, and self-rated health predict sexual desire. Third, we examined how these associations differed across sexual desire facets. On average, the associations between age and both men and women‚Äôs sexual desire followed non-linear trends and differed between genders/sexes and types of sexual desire. Average levels of all types of sexual desire were generally higher in men. Dyadic sexual desire related positively to self-rated masculinity and having a romantic partner and solitary desire was higher in people with same-sex attraction. We discuss the results in the context of the evolutionary hypothesis that predict an increase of sexual desire and female reproductive effort prior to declining fertility. Our findings both support and challenge beliefs about gender/sex specificity of age effects on sexual desire and highlight the importance of differentiating between desire types.",

This abuse produces many behavioral, emotional, and physical problems in adult life. One such consequence is adult sexual promiscuity. Anxiety which arises over childhood abuse may be dealt with by compulsive or addictive behaviors. Repressed or forgotten abuse may manifest itself in adult life symptomatically by out-of-control behaviors which are abusive of self and/or others. Such compulsive behaviors reflect an attempt to gain mastery over the original abuse and the abuser. Keeping promiscuous behavior secret reinforces lhe original abuse pattern and leads to guilt, shame, and isolation. Countertransference issues facing the therapist are discussed. Four case histories show examples of male and female promiscuity following childhood abuse.",

What happens?Sexual abuse entails all types of sexual activity often with escalating intrusiveness.Children may be exposed to indecent acts, pornographic photography, or external genital contact in the form of being fondled, masturbating an adult, or being used for intercrural intercourse.Finally, they may be penetrated orally, vaginally, or anally.How often does sexual abuse occur?Nobody knows how often sexual abuse occurs.It is certain that a lot of abuse is undiagnosed and equally certain that false diagnoses may be catastrophic.Five main risk factors predispose to child sexual abuse.* Previous incest or sexual deviance in the family * New male member of the household with a record of sexual offences * Loss of inhibition due to alcohol * Loss of maternal libido or sexual rejection of father * A paedophilic sexual orientation, especially in relation to sex rings and pornography.

The case of si-nais (housewives) in Hong Kong shows that we can never assume that married women (or any social category) are privileged by virtue of their status on the sexual hierarchy. The blessings of social respectability apparently enjoyed by these women may work to enable or hinder women's expression of their erotic desires and sexual fulfillment, depending on their special social circumstances. These women's imagination and experience of good sex is composed of a multitude of components. Women may feel good because they can achieve other psychological and social aims that are important in their lives (which could be related to the maintenance of marriage or the peace of the family). Women may feel good because of the erotic satisfaction that they derive from different pursuits including interests, leisure or other intimate relationships, rather than sexual fulfillment in terms of orgasm or physical pleasure. Women may reformulate their pleasures variously at different stages of their lives. Social respectability, orgasm, emotional intimacy, or any other specific element, may all enter or leave the formula for good sex.",

      "title": "SEXTING, NON-CONSENSUAL IMAGE SHARING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH",
      "abstract": "Background and Aims: Sexting refers to the exchange (sending and/or receiving) of self-taken sexual photographs, usually depicting the sender nude or semi-nude, via mobile phone. Academic and media narratives tend to portray sexting as a deviant behaviour due to the perceived risks of non-consensual image distribution (where individuals‚Äô sexual images are shared without permission): Qualitative research suggests the psychological harms of revenge pornography (one type of non-consensual image distribution) are comparable to the effects of sexual assault and are gendered in nature; considered part of a continuum of sexual violence against women. There is a lack of quantitative research regarding adult sexting and non-consensual image sharing. Studies to date have conflated consensual and non-consensual sexting behaviours and have poor methodological design in terms of the operational definitions used. Researchers investigating sexters‚Äô psychological health have thus far neglected to consider individual factors (e.g. coping, resilience and sexting attitudes), interpersonal aspects (e.g. relationship context and privacy expectations) and image characteristics. Existing research is biased by the measures used (i.e. primary focus on psychological distress) and there has been limited opportunity to demonstrate positive sexting associations (e.g. relational wellbeing). We therefore sought to develop a more nuanced understanding of sexters‚Äô psychological health and wellbeing by addressing the following questions:\r\nHow common are non-consensual image sharing experiences amongst a UK community (non-clinical) sample of adult sexters?\r\nAre there any differences in the psychological health and wellbeing of non-sexters and sexters (including those who have experienced non-consensual image sharing)?\r\nAre any sexting specific factors, such as privacy expectations, image characteristics and relationship with recipients, associated with psychological health?\r\nAre there any differences in psychological health and wellbeing between consensual sexters‚Äô, those who have experienced non-consensual sexting, and non-sexters‚Äô when coping, resilience and sexting specific factors are accounted for?\r\nMethod: We utilised a quantitative, cross-sectional online survey design. Participants from a non-clinical adult population (N = 270) were recruited via social media. The\r\nsurvey consisted of a sexting questionnaire identifying type of sexting behaviours, relationship context, privacy beliefs and sexting attitudes; as well as non-consensual image sharing behaviours and experiences. Psychological measures used included: the Depression, Anxiety and Stress scales (DASS-21), the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing scale (WEMWBS), the Impact of Event Scale (IES-6), the Brief COPE and the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS).\r\nResults: 87% of the sample had engaged in sexting as an adult, primarily within committed relationships in order to maintain sexual intimacy. 14% of sexters had experienced the non-consensual distribution of their images and 16% had distributed others‚Äô images without permission. Males and females did not differ significantly in who experienced non-consensual image distribution. Images were most often shared by someone the person was dating, typically with friends and family, although images were shared online in 43% of cases. Privacy expectations and sexting attitudes were not related to psychological health or wellbeing. When coping and resilience were accounted for, experiencing non-consensual image distribution was not related to psychological distress but individuals who were uncertain if their images had been shared had lower wellbeing, and consensual sexters who sent sexts to multiple partners had higher anxiety.\r\nConclusion: Our research suggests that the problematic coping strategies individuals employ, and their level of resilience have a stronger relationship with psychological health than do their sexting behaviours; although further quantitative research with clear consistent definitions of sexting and non-consensual image sharing is needed to identify if these findings are replicable. Clinical interventions for those who are distressed by non-consensual image distribution should focus on identifying and reducing the use of problematic coping strategies such as avoidance, denial and self-blame. Sexting may be considered a normative part of intimate relationships: Educational strategies should fully explore issues of consent and perceived gender stereotypes; as opposed to encouraging individuals to abstain from sexting as a deviant or risky behaviour (which could contribute to self-blame and victim blaming). Future research should focus on understanding specific motivations for and types of non-consensual image distribution (e.g. revenge pornography) and whether it is associated with more harmful aspects of relationships such as interpersonal violence.",

Fewer than 19% of participants mentioned any kind of trauma in their responses. We discuss implications for scientific understandings of kinky sexual desire within the umbrella of sexual diversity.",

      "abstract": "Couples experience greater satisfaction and desire when they are motivated to meet each other's sexual needs (sexual communal strength); however, doing so at the expense of one's own sexual needs (unmitigated sexual communion) can detract from satisfaction and desire. Self-determination theory suggests engaging in sex for pleasure and value (autonomous reasons) versus out of pressure and obligation (controlled reasons) may account for these differences. Across two dyadic studies, one cross-sectional (N = 103 couples) and one longitudinal (N = 147 couples), people higher in sexual communal strength had sex for more autonomous and less controlled reasons, and in turn, reported greater satisfaction and desire, overall, in daily life, and over time. In contrast, people higher in unmitigated sexual communion endorsed more controlled reasons for engaging in sex, and in turn reported lower satisfaction. Partners of people higher in sexual communal strength reported less controlled reasons for engaging in sex, and in turn, both partners felt more satisfied, whereas partners of people high in unmitigated sexual communion endorsed more controlled reasons and reported lower satisfaction. This research furthers our understanding of when and why being motivated to be responsive to a partner's sexual needs enhances or detracts from sexual and relationship quality.",

      "title": "Sexual Desire",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual desire is typically viewed as an interest in sexual objects or activities. Although sexual desire is often confused with sex drive, these are fundamentally different constructs. Whereas sex drive represents a basic, biologically mediated motivation to seek out sexual activity and/or sexual gratification (and hence is traitlike in nature), sexual desire is a specific state of sexual interest that typically has a specific target and/or trigger. Sexual desire can be elicited by a large variety of cues and situations, private thoughts, feelings, and fantasies, erotic materials (such as books, movies, photographs), and a variety of erotic environments, situations, or social interactions. Researchers have increasingly come to acknowledge that there are different forms of sexual desire. One useful distinction, first advanced in the context of research on nonhuman primates, is that between proceptivity and receptivity. Proceptivity refers to a basic urge to seek out and initiate sexual activity and is regulated by gonadal hormones (e.g., testosterone in men and estrogen in women). Receptivity, sometimes called arousability, represents the capacity to become sexually interested or aroused upon exposure to certain environmental or situational stimuli.

      "abstract": "This paper is a systematic review and meta-analysis on sexual orientation identity development milestones among people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or another sexual minority identity (LGB+). Common milestones measured in the 30 studies reviewed were becoming aware of queer attractions, questioning one‚Äôs sexual orientation, self-identifying as LGB+, coming out to others, engaging in sexual activity, and initiating a romantic relationship. Milestones occurred in different sequences, although attraction was almost always first, often followed by self-identification and/or sexual activity; coming out and initiating a romantic relationship often followed these milestones. Meta-analysis results showed that the mean effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals varied by milestone: attraction [ M age =12.7 (10.1, 15.3)], questioning one‚Äôs orientation [ M age =13.2 [12.8, 13.6]), self-identifying [ M age =17.8 (11.6, 24.0)], sexual activity [ M age =18.1 (17.6, 18.6)], coming out [ M age =19.6 (17.2, 22.0)], and romantic relationship [ M age =20.9 (13.2, 28.6)]. Nonetheless, results also showed substantial heterogeneity in the mean effect sizes. Additional meta-analyses showed that milestone timing varied by sex, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, and birth cohort. Although patterns were found in LGB+ identity development, there was considerable diversity in milestone trajectories.",

      "title": "A Case Report of Zoophilia in Aceh Where Lack of Education and Family Supervision can be a Trigger",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Paraphilia or deviance is sexual stimulation or action that deviates from normal sexual behavior, but is necessary for some people to experience arousal and orgasm. People with paraphilia have unusual sexual interests, including inanimate objects, places, or individuals (children and corpses), and animals. Another paraphilic disorder involving a disapproving individual is characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, compulsions, or behavior in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the other person being unwilling or unable to consent. However, it is not specifically described in any of the other so-called Paraphilic Disorder categories (e.g., arousal patterns involving corpses or animals). CASE REPORT: Here, we report a case of a male patient aged 37 years, unmarried status, his last education graduated from elementary school, the patient complained that he had frequent contact with cows, he had been experiencing it for 2 years, he felt lonely and had no close friends. As a child, he was often scolded and beaten by his father. He is also often teased by his friends. CONCLUSION: Zoophilia is another paraphilic disorder involving disapproving individuals characterized by a persistent and intense pattern of atypical sexual arousal manifested by sexual thoughts, fantasies, drives, or behaviors in which the focus of the arousal pattern involves the animal. This case is rarely reported because sufferers think their actions are not harmful, lack of parental attention and supervision may be one of the causes of this disorder.",

      "abstract": "Jealousy is a commonly experienced emotion which has been observed in infants as young as 5-6 months of age and across the lifespan of an individual. In its extreme form jealousy can be pathological, when the belief which may be a delusion, obsession or an overvalued idea, is held on inadequate grounds and is unaffected by rational discussion. Morbid jealousy differs from normal jealousy in its intensity or rationality. It can be thought of as hypersensitive jealousy since jealous reactions are experienced at a much lower threshold than in average individuals. Morbid jealousy is a disorder in which an individual believes that their partner is, or will be, sexually unfaithful. Morbid jealousy can occur when a partner is in fact being unfaithful, provided that the evidence for the infidelity is incorrect and there is an excessive or irrational response to such evidence. The preoccupation with the partner's infidelity is often triggered by vivid mental images of their partner's past or present relationships.",

      "title": "Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire",
      "abstract": "Although sexual desire and romantic love are often experienced in concert, they are fundamentally distinct subjective experiences with distinct neurobiological substrates. The basis for these distinctions is the evolutionary origin of each type of experience. The processes underlying sexual desire evolved in the context of sexual mating, whereas the processes underlying romantic love‚Äîor pair bonding‚Äîoriginally evolved in the context of infant-caregiver attachment. Consequently, not only can humans experience these feelings separately, but an individual's sexual predisposition for the same sex, the other sex, or both sexes may not circumscribe his or her capacity to fall in love with partners of either gender. Also, the role of oxytocin in both love and desire may contribute to the widely observed phenomenon that women report experiencing greater interconnections between love and desire than do men. Because most research on the neurobiological substrates of sexual desire and affectional bonding has been conducted with animals, a key priority for future research is systematic investigation of the coordinated biological, behavioral, cognitive, and emotional processes that shape experiences of love and desire in humans.",

      "abstract": "We replicated and extended (N = 495) what is known about the relationships between the Dark Triad traits (i.e., narcissism, Machiavellianism, psychopathy) and a wider range (than previously reported) of sociosexuality including risky sexual behaviors (e.g., lack of condom use) and sexuality in relation to dating applications like Tinder, in general, in men and women, and above agreeableness. Machiavellianism and psychopathy were linked to most sociosexual behaviors and attitudes. In men, Machiavellianism was linked to various sociosexual outcomes, in women those outcomes were associated with psychopathy instead. Agreeableness was hardly correlated with sociosexual outcomes. The Dark Triad traits were more strongly correlated with the studied outcomes even after controlling for agreeableness or for the dark core. Unexpectedly, men who were Machiavellian and agreeable reported the most sex partners in different contexts, but not psychopaths. In contrast, women who were psychopathic not only had more sex partners in general, but they also engaged in more unprotected sex, and one-night stands than men did. These findings build on prior research on the Dark Triad traits and their associations with sociosexuality and help to draw a more nuanced and modern picture of those relationships.",

      "abstract": "Among factors identified as being statistically associated with child abuse, we can broadly distinguish those related to characteristics of the child itself and those related to family characteristics, bearing in mind that parents are the perpetrators of child abuse in the vast majority of cases. Observed among children are: young age (abuse begins very early in life); male sex, as concerns shaken baby syndrome and lethal violence; the presence of mental disability and/or behavioural disorders; and particularly frequently, prematurity, especially if it requires neonatal hospitalisation. In fact, any circumstance that makes early attachment between the newborn and its parents difficult or impossible, such as prematurity or postpartum depression, constitutes a situation of risk for subsequent child abuse. Among parents, psycho-affective factors take precedence over socio-economic factors, which play no role. Child abuse is found in all social classes, as is the transgenerational transmission of violence, with those parents having suffered from abuse as children being more at risk than others of becoming abusive themselves.",

It is a progressive disease associated with many vascular and cardiac risk factors. The subject of sexual dysfunction is more widely discussed in the media as a result of newer therapies that have become available in the past decade. Therefore, men and women of all ages are seeking assistance to improve their sexual relationships. Male sexual dysfunction refers to a problem with one or more of the four components of male sexual function, i.e. libido, erection, ejaculation or orgasm, that interferes with the ability or interest to engage in sexual intercourse. Psychological and physical factors as well as drugs may affect male sexual dysfunction. Female sexual dysfunction has both psychogenic and organic causes, related to desire, arousal, orgasm and sexual pain disorders. This article focuses mainly on erectile dysfunction (ED) in males. However, it is important to remember that the sexual partner plays an integral role in the successful and effective management of the ED patient.",

      "abstract": "Mediante este trabajo se reflexiona de forma general sobre la sexualidad en el adulto mayor y algunos de los factores que mas pueden influir en ella de forma desfavorable. El objetivo es describir los enfoques actuales de la sexualidad en los adultos mayores de 65 anos de edad. Se han desarrollado gran variedad de mitos y/o tabues, el primero se refiere a que los adultos mayores no tienen capacidad fisiologica que les permita tener conductas sexuales activas, no les interesa el sexo, las adultas mayores que se interesan por el sexo son perversas y ridiculas (Viuda alegre), el adulto mayor con deseo sexual es un degenerado o viejo verde, las personas mayores no son sexualmente deseables, la disfuncion erectil es normal en los adultos mayores, entre muchos mas. Se concluye que la sexualidad en los adultos mayores es la expresion psicologica de emociones y compromisos que requiere la mayor cantidad y calidad de comunicacion entre ellos, en una relacion de confianza, amor, compartir y placer, con o sin coito. Los principales cambios anatomofisiologicos que se producen en los organos sexuales de los adultos mayores tienen que ver de una forma directa con el desarrollo de su sexualidad. La existencia de estresores como puedan ser la perdida de la pareja, el deterioro de la red social y del nivel socioeconomico o la presencia de problemas de salud en la familia, contribuyen tambien a la aparicion de diversas dificultades en la actividad e interes sexual en el anciano. La renuncia a la actividad sexual debe ser el ultimo recurso y debe quedar como opcion del individuo, nunca como consecuencia fatalista de un evento en particular.",

      "title": "Event Characteristics of Sexual Violence Perpetration Against Romantic Partners Versus Non-Romantic Partners",
      "abstract": "Tactics used to perpetrate sexual violence may be crucial to understanding when and why sexual violence occurs. Moreover, most sexual violence occurs between people who know each other‚Äîincluding in the context of dating or sexual relationships. Little is known about the context of sexual violence that occurs with non-romantic partners. To address these research gaps, we examined online survey data from 786 young adults (weighted n = 763) aged 19 to 27 years, living across the United States. Findings suggest that 60% of sexual assault, 40% of attempted rape, 42% of rape, and 67% of coercive sex were perpetrated against a romantic partner, defined as a current or ex-boyfriend, girlfriend, spouse, or domestic partner. Contextual differences were noted by relationship type: Those who perpetrated against romantic partners were more likely than those who targeted non-romantic partners to report that it occurred because they were feeling sad or angry. They were also more likely to say that the other person was completely responsible for what happened. Conversely, those who aggressed against non-romantic partners were more likely to say that someone else found out about what happened. Making the other person feel guilty was the most common tactic for both groups. The most frequently endorsed reason for perpetrating sexual violence was ‚Äúfeeling really horny,‚Äù although feeling ‚Äúgood‚Äù or being drunk/high were also common reasons noted by aggressors. Afterward, many said they felt guilty or ashamed and were worried about the other person‚Äôs feelings. Fear of getting caught was universally absent. Findings support the importance of building emotion regulation and emotional awareness skills in sexual violence prevention programming. Prevention programs should also discuss coercion as a violence tactic, since perpetrators may not always recognize this to be sexual violence. More generally, violence prevention programs should also address healthy relationships, consent, and taking responsibility.",

Much of the broader association between psychopathy and offending of all types including sexual deviance relates to psychopathy's general Antagonism. Disproportionately attributing sexual offending to psychopathy belies the many pathways into sexual offending, which is itself a very broad criminological classification, ranging from hands-off, remote offenses to hands-on/contact offenses (rape and sexual assault). Moreover, some aspects of psychopathy are more associated with sexual offending than others; the core traits (affective and interpersonal) are less strongly associated than behavioral and criminal lifestyle facets. Also, concurrent sexual deviation is a key risk-increasing factor, as are emotional‚Äìneurotic elements emerging from with secondary psychopathy such as obsessionality and compulsivity.",

Following results were obtained: ‚Ä¢ dreams of sexual contents are rare both with addicts and other population, but significantly larger percent of alcoholics has ‚Äúwet or orgasmic‚Äù dreams, ‚Ä¢ day-dreaming is less noticed with alcoholics, meaning that the need for raising sexual vigilance is reduced, ‚Ä¢ alcoholics masturbate more, they start to masturbate in later stage, ‚Ä¢ addicts rarely have foreplay and its duration is shorter, as a consequence of disturbed intimacy and impossibility of total harmony and exchange with a partner, ‚Ä¢ alcoholics have less sexual intercourses and feel different during them ‚Ä¢ there are no great differences in opinions about sex, ‚Ä¢ structural personal characteristics also have effect on sexual behaviour and alcoholism. Alcoholics have certain personal characteristics that clearly define them and which, because of their nature, influence addiction development and sexual behaviour. We can conclude from the research that a tendency in behaviour is evidenced, and for which can be said that it is \"pattern of sexual functioning of alcoholics\".

On average, participants reported feigning orgasm in approximately one-fourth of sexual encounters in their current sexual relationship, most commonly during vaginal sex. Feigning orgasm for reasons related to a poor sexual experience or to poor partner choice was the strongest predictor; associated with lower levels of desire and sexual and relationship satisfaction. Feigning orgasm to support a partner's emotional well-being was associated with higher levels of desire. Feigning orgasm because one was intoxicated, having undesired sex, or out of a desire to improve the quality of the sexual encounter was associated with higher levels of sexual satisfaction (though these variables accounted for little variance). This research indicates men do feign orgasm, and motivations for doing so are associated with sexual and relational outcomes.",

This current study searches for the FAB, and for potential moderators of the FAB, in the context of romantic relationship memories. Both nonsexual types of memories and sexual types of memories showed the FAB. Moreover, the FAB emerged for memories of current relationships, but not for memories of past failed relationships. The FAB also emerged for securely attached individuals, but not for individuals exhibiting other attachment styles. In addition, the FAB was moderated by relationship quality, (for failed relationships) need to belong, sexual esteem, and sexual depression. Implications of these findings both for memory and for relationships are discussed.",

Women experience sexual pleasure on many levels: physical, emotional, spiritual and intellectual. Sexual functioning of women and men is determined by many factors. A strong correlation between the state of subjective arousal and genital response (erection) is typical for men. In the case of women important role played: emotions, cognitive interpretation of the situation, age, self-esteem and previous sexual experiences. Among women experience orgasm during intercourse or masturbation is not a goal in itself. Modern approach to the phenomenon of orgasm and sexual education of women, make absence of orgasm as a failure.

      "title": "Psychological Aspects of Child Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT.According to statistics, about 90% of people were emotionally abused in childhood, but many do not realize, deny or, worse, their own children or others, considering that their treatment of childhood was natural and normal. Emotional is form of aggression, but law can not penalize it. Most parents believe that child means physical or violence and / or child neglect. But they do not know that they can hurt child simply by their excessive attitude. The emotional is any behavior that is intended to control, subjugate, submit other beings through fear, intimidation, humiliation, blaming, and growing guilt, coercion, manipulation, invalidation etc. The consequences of emotional are multiple, varied, extremely serious; they leave marks for life, affecting child development at various levels - emotionally, intellectually and even physically. Moreover, it will affect future adult's social and professional life, relationships and physical and mental health, to greater or lesser extent, depending on type of emotional abuse, and on its frequency and intensity.Keywords: behavior, emotional abuse, violence, control, abuse1. IntroductionAbuse means use of force in order to try to dominate child, to compel him/her to do dangerous things that he/she does not want to do, expose him/her to hazardous situations or to situations perceived by him/her as dangerous. Any action that causes injury or psycho-emotional disorders is an abuse.The can be of several types:Physical - involves use of physical force against children and subjecting them to hard work that exceed their capabilities, actions that result in damage of their body integrity.Emotional - is inappropriate behavior of adults towards children, behavior that adversely affects child's personality in development. Child rejection, forced isolation, terrorization, ignoration, humiliation and corruption are manifestations of child abuse.Sexual - consists in exposing child to watching pornography, seduction (advances, caresses and promises) or involvement in acts of any kind.Economic - implies attracting, persuading or forcing child to do income generating activities, adults close to child at least partially or indirectly benefiting from this revenue. The economic leads to removing child from school, thus depriving him of to access superior social and cultural levels.Neglection - is adult's inability or refusal to appropriately communicate with child, and limited access to education.The term sexual abuse refers to exploitation of child whose age does not allow him/her to understand nature of contact and to adequately resist it. This exploitation may be done by child's friend whom he/she is psychologically dependent on.The can have different aspects:- evocation (phones, exhibitionism, pornography, content of adult's language etc.)- stimulation (erotic contact, masturbation, incomplete genital contact, forced participation in sexuality of couple etc.)- making sex (rape or attempted rape).1.2 Issues of Abusea) Children may be abused since very young.Children may be abused from very early age. They are often seduced by games in sexual- abusive situation. The abuser often establishes positive relationships with both parents and child.The child is encouraged or forced to engage in abusive relationship. This is achieved through rewards and / or threats. The activity is presented as something special, and child should be considered lucky because he/she has a chance to participate in it. The child is unable to understand what is happening. Just when he/she is told that the game is secret he/she begins to understand that something is wrong. ‚Ä¶",

      "title": "Masturbation and Relationship Satisfaction",
      "abstract": "Relationship satisfaction often declines after marriage or cohabitation and between 40-50% of marriages end in divorce. Furthermore, many couples who stay together report feeling unsatisfied in their relationships. Thus, it is important to examine factors that contribute to enduring and satisfying relationships. One factor that has been closely linked to relationship satisfaction is the sexual relationship of the couple. One aspect of the sexual relationship that has received little attention is masturbation. Although most psychologists hold positive views about masturbation, and recommend masturbation in many instances, the empirical data examining the association between masturbation and relationship satisfaction has mixed findings, with the majority of studies reporting a small negative relationship between these variables. The purpose of the present study was to further explore the association between masturbation and relationship satisfaction, focusing on possible moderators and mediators of this relationship including: masturbation guilt, openness with an individual's partner about masturbation, gender, object of arousal during masturbation, and reason for masturbating. Overall, masturbation frequency did not have a significant association with relationship satisfaction. However, the object of arousal during masturbation and openness about masturbation moderated the association between masturbation frequency and relationship satisfaction. Specifically, individuals who (a) used objects of arousal other than the partner when masturbating and (b) were less open about the masturbation reported a more negative association between masturbation frequency and relationship satisfaction.",

      "abstract": "Few investigations of sexual attitudes have restricted their focus to individuals' preferences for specific behaviors within a heterosexual relationship. None have examined gender differences in a broad and multidimensional array of such behavioral particulars. As part of an effort to develop a measure of preferred scripts in heterosexual couples, 258 men and women reported how much they agreed or disagreed with 74 statements of preference. A reduced and factor analyzed questionnaire included 38 items and was administered to a second sample (N = 228). Results offer qualified support that, compared to women, men are more erotophilic and show a stronger preference for incorporating erotic materials as well as drugs and alcohol into sexual relations with their partner. These results were more robust in the second sample, in which almost half of the subjects were tested in same-sex groups. Across both samples, women showed stronger preferences for activities reflecting romanticism. No gender differences were evident in sexual conventionality or in preference regarding the general use of contraceptives. However, results suggest that both sexes respond more favorably to a partner-focused or unspecified contraceptive method than to a self-focused method.",

On learning of their infertility patients usually go through an initial emotional crisis. The male response thereafter varies depending on the aetiology of the infertility. Male factor infertility threatens the traditional male/father role and results in a feeling of personal and sexual inadequacy. This may resolve itself in extramarital affairs or by the sufferer throwing himself into his work. Unfortunately treatment for infertility often has transient negative effects on male sexuality, and is frequently believed by the recipient to be more successful than in fact it is.",

Precipitating factors include traumatic sexual experiences, negative self-image, sexual guilt or shame, deviant or variant sexual behavior, relationship difficulties, and a chronic sexual dysfunction. Regardless of whether the male or female experiences ISD, the effect on the couple is that the cycle of positive anticipation, pleasure-oriented intercourse, and a regular rhythm of sexual contact is replaced by anticipatory anxiety, unsuccessful intercourse, self-consciousness, and avoidance.

However, little empirical research has directly tested the role of sexual avoidance in samples of men with sexual problems. The goals of the current study were to A) assess the association between sexual avoidance, sexual function, and subjective sexual well-being, and B) explore possible predictors of sexual avoidance, including insecure attachment, activation of negative sexual schemas, and trait experiential avoidance. One hundred and fifty eight men with self-identified impairments in sexual function (low desire, erectile function, and/or premature/delayed ejaculation) completed validated self-report measures in a secure online survey. Sexual avoidance was uniquely predicted by most aspects of sexual function, and was correlated with poorer subjective sexual well-being. Higher levels of attachment avoidance and activation of negative schemas uniquely predicted more frequent sexual avoidance. Alternatively, interaction models suggested that impaired erectile function was less likely to be associated with sexual avoidance for those with high levels of attachment anxiety and for those with high levels of trait experiential avoidance. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundModulation of sexual desires is, in some cases, necessary to avoid inappropriate or illegal sexual behavior (downregulation of sexual desire) or to engage with a romantic partner (upregulation of sexual desire). Some have suggested that those who have difficulty downregulating their sexual desires be diagnosed as having a sexual 'addiction'. This diagnosis is thought to be associated with sexual urges that feel out of control, high-frequency sexual behavior, consequences due to those behaviors, and poor ability to reduce those behaviors. However, such symptoms also may be better understood as a non-pathological variation of high sexual desire. Hypersexuals are thought to be relatively sexual reward sensitized, but also to have high exposure to visual sexual stimuli. Thus, the direction of neural responsivity to sexual stimuli expected was unclear. If these individuals exhibit habituation, their P300 amplitude to sexual stimuli should be diminished; if they merely have high sexual desire, their P300 amplitude to sexual stimuli should be increased. Neural responsivity to sexual stimuli in a sample of hypersexuals could differentiate these two competing explanations of symptoms.MethodsFifty-two (13 female) individuals who self-identified as having problems regulating their viewing of visual sexual stimuli viewed emotional (pleasant sexual, pleasant-non-sexual, neutral, and unpleasant) photographs while electroencephalography was collected.ResultsLarger P300 amplitude differences to pleasant sexual stimuli, relative to neutral stimuli, was negatively related to measures of sexual desire, but not related to measures of hypersexuality.ConclusionImplications for understanding hypersexuality as high desire, rather than disordered, are discussed.",

Por otro lado, cuando la salud fisica de una persona se ve comprometida por una enfermedad terminal, esta influye de manera trascendental en la vida la persona; la sexualidad puede verse afectada por importantes factores organicos, psicologicos y socioculturales, que inciden en el pleno disfrute de la actividad sexual en el sujeto. Las disfunciones sexuales son alteraciones en la sexualidad, que generalmente estan presentes en paciente terminales y usualmente afectan la respuesta sexual en la fase del deseo y la excitacion. El tratamiento farmacologico administrado a los pacientes con enfermedades terminales, es importante para su recuperacion, sin embargo, puede llegar a producir ciertas disfunciones que se ven exacerbadas por sintomas psicologicos como el proceso de adaptacion a la enfermedad, creencias que existen en torno a la sexualidad y las condiciones particulares de cada enfermedad terminal, esto determina cierta dificultad de mantener relaciones sexuales satisfactorias. Pese a que no existe un modelo determinado para intervenir en estas manifestaciones negativas que presenta la funcion sexual, se menciona un modelo que emplea tecnicas con el objetivo de fomentar bienestar en el sujeto.",

A review of recent studies on the topic showed, that apart from a critical threshold, hormones exert no influence on sexual behaviour that would go beyond the alleviation of vasomotoric or genital menopausal symptoms or their consequences. However, psychosocial and relational factors play a major role in sexual dysfunctions generally and at this age of the \"empty nest\" and a doctor-patient relationship based on trust may well help in coping with them. Finally, a (new?) understanding of genital sexuality as a concise body-language or literally an incarnation of the relationship is advocated and may add a new dimension and quality to a couple's sex life.",

      "abstract": "One of the most common reported postpartum concerns, linked with relationship dissatisfaction, is how body image will affect sexuality. Outside of the postpartum period, feeling more satisfied with one's body is linked with feeling more sexually and relationally satisfied, with some cross-sectional evidence that sexual satisfaction mediates these associations. This dyadic daily experience study examined how new parents' daily satisfaction with their own and their partner's bodies relates to their own sexual satisfaction, and in turn, their own and their partner's relationship satisfaction during a vulnerable time in their sexual and romantic relationship-3- to 4-months postpartum. First-time parent couples (N = 240) completed 21 daily surveys. On days when birthing parents reported greater satisfaction than usual with their own or their partner's body, they reported higher sexual satisfaction and in turn, higher relationship satisfaction. On days when non-birthing parents reported greater satisfaction with their own or their partner's body, they reported higher sexual satisfaction and in turn, both parents reported higher relationship satisfaction. Evidence of bidirectionality was also observed such that relationship satisfaction mediated links between body satisfaction and sexual satisfaction. Findings support that daily body satisfaction is important for both sexual and relationship satisfaction among postpartum couples.",

      "abstract": "Considerable research has established that particular partner characteristics have a negative impact upon marital quality and that marital distress often results from the failure of partners to resolve personality differences. This study assessed personality and interpersonal differences related to marital distress within 92 clinical couples. Husbands in marriages of 6 years or less reflected distant, apathetic, hostile, and domineering features, while their wives reflected a greater need for attention and stimulation. Husbands in marriages of 7 years or more reflected greater distant and apathetic, self-focused, hostile, and domineering characteristics, while their wives reported greater passive dependency. The shorter married wives‚Äô and husbands‚Äô marital distress was most strongly associated with their own avoidant and self-defeating characteristics. The longer married wives‚Äô marital distress was associated with their husbands‚Äô dominant and self-involved characteristics. The longer married husbands‚Äô marital distress was most strongly associated with their own dominant and self-centered characteristics, but with none of their wives‚Äô characteristics. Partner ratings supported interpersonal theory expectations that distressed couples would reflect noncomplementary interaction patterns. Marital therapists may increase the likelihood of remediating/preventing marital distress by helping couples to recognize that their own and their partner‚Äôs personality traits, and interpersonal styles can be linked to marital distress, that these links seemingly differ for males and females, and that these links are likely to change over the marital life cycle.",

      "title": "Psychodynamic Perspective of Sexual Obsessions in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a disorder that is characterized by the presence of obsessions and compulsions. OCD can occur in a wide range of subtypes, which may include sexual OCD, i.e., the occurrence of intrusive sexual thoughts. People with sexual OCD may experience unwanted obsessive sexual thoughts about a family member, dead or inanimate objects, animals, God, or children, which can range from mild to severe levels of occurrence. The psychodynamic perspective on OCD suggests that the content of obsessive thinking is commonly drawn from primitivized sexuality and aggression. It further suggests that in the absence of key relationships that include emotional proximity, mirroring and containment, and attunement, a child experiences a void-like state. Consequently, the anxiety that arises in the child leads to a form of liveliness in a ‚Äúdead‚Äù inner world. However, it occurs out of a sense of abandonment and loss of good objects, and ultimately out of fear of annihilation. As a result, the child resorts to maladaptive defense mechanisms. The study attempts to explore the adverse early childhood experiences such as parental neglect, mother‚Äìfather conflict, and lack of parental love and care leading to fixation in psychosexual stages of development, which further leads to the adoption of maladaptive defense mechanisms that in turn further contribute to the development of obsessional personality traits. This study aims to explain the psychodynamic perspective on the emergence of sexual obsessions by proceeding with a case study approach by taking a diagnosed case of OCD. A comprehensive psychodiagnostic assessment was conducted with the help of Draw-a-Person Test, Thematic Apperception Test, Rotter‚Äôs Incomplete Sentence Blank, and Million‚Äôs Comprehensive Multiaxial Inventory. The analysis of the assessment protocol revealed a strong relationship between the defense mechanism, personality traits, and the development of obsessive symptoms.",

      "title": "[Psychological aspects of voluntary induced abortion among fathers drafted into military service].",
      "abstract": "This work examines the symptomatology of 4 young men recently drafted into military service in France who had negative reactions to their partner's abortions. The men ranged in age from 19-21 years. In all cases there was frank depression, accompanied or not by activity illegal in the eyes of the military (unauthorized leave) or of the common law (theft, use of drugs). The abortion was either a pretext for a rapid decompensation of a pathological personality, or it occasioned a crisis in personalities previously relatively well adapted despite immaturity, psychopathology, or weakness. The organization of the couples tended to be recent, unstable, precarious, and without a promising future either affectively or socioeconomically. Either the woman decided to seek an abortion herself and presented the father with an accomplished fact, or the couple tacitly made a joint decision to seek an abortion, in which case the subsequent illegal activity of the father tended to be more serious. Each of the men had conflictive family relationships with their fathers especially perceived as hostile and rejecting. All of the men had attempted suicide or had considered it. Induction into the army has traditionally been seen as a rite of passage to adult life, but in some cases the emotional distances it causes and the socioeconomic difficulties it aggravates prevent the man from undertaking the responsibilities of fatherhood. In these cases it is as if social maturity can be acquired only at the expense of fatherhood; the 2 states cannot coexist. Frustration and sacrifice of fatherhood nevertheless may occasion loss of the social maturity stemming from military service. The abortion is followed by guilt, psychic suffering, and behavioral problems leading to expulsion from the military. On the symbolic level the man does not become either man or father. Another point is that depression, anxiety, and guilt are an affective expression of the idea of death; the embryo is thought of as an infant when in fact it is only potentially an infant. On the unconscious level the father may identify with the aborted fetus in the belief that his own parents may have wanted to destroy him. The abortion may also contain a suicidal element to the extent that the fetus represents a prolongation of the parent. The anxiety and guilt of the father find expression also in auto- and heteroaggressive acts. Through a mechanism of projection, responsibility of the army is substituted for that of the individual.",

      "abstract": "In the early stages of romantic relationships, sexual desire is often intense, but over time, as partners get to know each other, desire tends to decline. Low sexual desire has negative implications for relationship satisfaction and maintenance. Self-expansion theory suggests that engaging in novel activities with a long-term romantic partner can reignite feelings of passion from the early stages of a relationship. Across 3 studies using dyadic, daily experience, longitudinal, and experimental methods, we find evidence for our central prediction that engaging in self-expanding activities with a partner is associated with higher sexual desire. In turn, we found that higher desire fueled by self-expansion is associated with greater relationship satisfaction. Self-expansion, through sexual desire, is also associated with an increased likelihood that couples will engage in sex, and when they do engage in sex, they feel more satisfied with their sexual experiences. We also demonstrate that the benefits of self-expansion for relationship satisfaction are sustained over time, and that the effects cannot be attributed solely to increases in positive affect, time spent interacting with the partner or closeness during the activity. Implications for self-expansion theory and sexual desire maintenance in relationships are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "title": "Psychosexual factors in infertility.",
      "abstract": "This discussion of psychosexual factors in infertility focuses on the following: sexual dysfunctions in infertility (impotence ejaculatory impotence premature ejaculation vaginismus orgasmic dysfunction); coital factors in infertility (coital frequency coital error effluvium seminis coital technique); effect of infertility on psychosexual function; clinical aspect of psychosexual problems and infertility; and management. The importance of sexual problems as a cause of male infertility has been emphasized by Dubin and Amelar (1972). The etiology of sexual dysfunction is primarily psychogenic but functional and organic pathology may also be involved. If primary sexual failure occurs in 1 partner it can produce dysfunction in the other. Sexual dysfunctions usually are psychosomatic disorders. Both the vasocongestive and the orgasmic components of the sexual response may be inhibited together or separately. Macleods study indicates that at almost any age the chance of conception being achieved in less than 6 months rises with the frequency of intercourse yet Dubin and Amelar reported 6 cases of male infertility due to too frequent ejaculations. Daily ejaculation may have no clinically significant effect on the sperm count of a man who normally has a high sperm concentration. Effluvium seminis is a common phenomenon and is not a cause of infertility but a woman cleaning or douching herself immediately after intercourse is not encouraged for subfertile women. The best coital position for achieving conception is that of the male above with the female lying supine underneath. Infertile couples undergo much stress when they are unable to conceive. Many couples may find that their sexual pleasure and functioning become impaired. Infertile couples may have abnormalities in sexual functioning which can present in several ways: as psychosexual problems causing infertility; as infertility resulting in psychosexual dysfunction; or as incidental findings of psychosexual disturbances in cases of infertility. In the management of infertility associated with psychosexual problems the doctor must have an empathic understanding and nonjudgemental attitude and should be ready to encourage the couple to speak openly about their anxiety in a relaxed confidential and private setting. The couples attitudes concerning sexual behavior must be identified and help must be provided to modify them when appropriate.",

      "abstract": "Sexual addiction has become the catch-all for infidelity, cheating, promiscuity, and rape. Recently it has become the newest claim for rapists and child molesters. Sexual addiction was defined similarly to how the DSM-5 has defined substance use disorders. Following the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria, as well as how Carnes et al. defined sexual addiction, it sometimes appears as though sexual offenders are sex addicts and are therefore not responsible for their sexually abusive behaviour. Sex offenders may have a sexual addiction in addition to being a sexual offender; however the sexual addiction has nothing to do with sexual offending. No different than a sex offender having a substance use disorder- the drugs or alcohol used never cause the offender to rape, rape is a choice the offender makes whether sober or intoxicated. Sexual addiction involves having intense thoughts involving sexual activities and may include engaging in numerous promiscuous sexual encounters and frequent masturbation. However, those sexual encounters are not about forced sex, just about sex. Sexual offenders rape and molest because of thoughts involving the use of physical or psychological use of force to obtain sex and/or because of sexual thoughts involving children or adolescents.",

Meanwhile, the term ‚Äúsexuality‚Äù has come to connote a wide variety of human sociobiological responses that range from varying levels of social attraction or physiological arousal to intimate body contact that may or may not include physical penetration. The failure of research scientists to define what they mean by ‚Äúsexuality,‚Äù ‚Äúsexual behavior,‚Äù or ‚Äúlate life‚Äù when designing studies or publishing their results complicates attempts to compare research findings within older age groups and across societies and sociocultural environments.

The presence or absence of clear dominance in the relationship, dominance status, or relationship worries did not affect cortisol levels.

      "title": "Mental Health Problems in Urban Setting",
      "abstract": "M ental health is defined as a state of wellbeing in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community. Mental health problems may increase in specific environments where social isolation and poor quality of life are prominent. In urban settings in developing countries, the risk of mental health problems or mental disorders may be higher than in rural areas. Health inequalities between rural and urban areas are considered by many investigators because urban areas have better health statistics and consume the majority of the health budget. It is important to understand the characteristics of urban environment and provide mental health services to obtain mental well-being of the people and prevent mental problems. The causes of mental problems may include genetic abnormalities, physical disorders, problems in childhood and growing up and stressful events of life. Mental illness occurs from the interaction of multiple genes and other environmental factors such as poor family conditions, abuse, psychiatric disorders in family members, traumatic events, unsafe neighborhood, and pollution, uncomfortable living conditions (crime areas or war-torn regions). Social stressors such as poverty, financial pressures, racial and sexual discrimination or harassment, unemployment, isolation, and a lack of social support can also cause stress and lead to poor quality of life and mental problems or disorders. The urban setting is a specific area where risk factors of mental problems exist. The competitive life which is not usual in rural area pushes the people across their life span. Significant problematic behaviors are frequent in urban setting as the result of mental health problems for example: divorce, abuse, selfdestruction, suicide, drug abuse, crime, sexual problems and abortion,",

      "abstract": "Since the 1960s the increase in erotic entertainment has conveyed a clear message: the more sex the better.This has resulted in myths about sexual norms, which if believed may lead to behaviour result- ing in the acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases or in sexual dysfunction, or both.The psychosexual problems seen in departments of genitourinary medicine are either secondary to sexually acquired infection or primarily psychological. General reactionsWhen genital lesions are seen, felt, or suspected most patients lose interest in sexual intercourse, or at least restrain themselves for fear of infecting their partners.Those disinhibited by drugs or alcohol or of a psychopathic nature may, however, continue to have inter- course, and particular care must be taken to explain the dangers to others of such behaviour.Marital discord-The innocently infected partner ofa patient who has had intercourse outside a stable relationship may realise the implications of a sexually transmitted disease but may not want the diagnosis spelt out.The doctor therefore should not force the diagnosis on the patient but give him or her room to manoeuvre by saying, for instance, \"Is there anything more you would like to know?\".Often the answer is \"No.\"Anger, anxiety, guilt, and depression-Under the stress of having a sexually transmitted disease the extravert may become angry and the introvert anxious or depressed.Anger may be directed at the clinic staff as well as the person who transmitted the infection.Recognition of this anger may allow the doctor to intervene and discuss the facts and feelings surrounding a patient's illness.This may prevent later violence towards the patient's sexual partner.Unfortunately, in the case of the psychopath such intervention may not alter the patient's strong feelings or the outcome.The neurotic introvert is more likely to become anxious or depressed under stress, particularly when he or she has had intercourse outside a stable relationship.When severe these symptoms must be taken seriously.Clinical anxiety may be dealt with by letting the patient voice his feelings, and later by reassurance.In some patients the anxiety is so severe that a short course ofbenzodiazepines (such as diazepam 2 mg three times a day) may need to be given.Guilt and depression often go together, though most cases of depression seen in clinics are not severe; if necessary antidepressants such as mianserin 30-60 mg at night may be given; the dose should be built up slowly to prevent undue sleepiness in a working person.When the depression is deeper, psychiatric help should be enlisted, but the patient may refuse unless the psychiatrists are on the spot at the clinic.A clinically trivial condition such as recurring non-gonococcal urethritis, as well as the more serious problems of genital herpes, pelvic inflammatory disease, acute epididymitis, and hepatitis B, may all cause anger, anxiety, guilt, and depression.Allowing such patients to air their feelings is vital.",

It may contribute to marital difficulties or cause sexual problems, including promiscuity, and the repeated conception of out-of-wedlock children. For a small number of women (and perhaps men), the need or wish to be held is a major determinant of a particular characterological pattern or way of life. It is surprising, therefore, that the seeking of body contact has received so little attention in the psychiatric literature. Comprehensive investigations have been conducted only on subhuman species. Some observations on human infants and adults have been reported but mostly as incidental findings, and they are not derived from systematic studies. While the dearth of investigations of the need or wish to be held or cuddled can be attributed to various influences,",

      "abstract": "Sixty‚Äêseven female and 54 male college students participated in a study of sexual disagreements in which the man desired to engage in a higher level of sexual activity than did the woman. Participants kept an ongoing record of dates and disagreements and provided descriptive information about some of these. We had three goals: (a) to determine how frequently this type of disagreement occurs in dating relationships; (b) to determine the types and frequencies of the various strategies that men use when their partner indicates that she is unwilling to engage in a particular sexual activity; and (c) to describe the characteristics of disagreement situations and relate these to male compliance with the woman's refusal. One or more disagreements were reported by 47% of participants, but disagreements occurred on only 7% of reported dates. In 61% of the disagreement situations, the man complied with the woman's refusal without question. Verbal and/or physical coercion was reported in 25% of the disagreement situations. These results suggest that although sexual coercion is a part of some dating relationships, it does not characterize our dating system to the degree suggested by Clark and Lewis (1977). Characteristics of the disagreement situation and their relationship to male compliance are reported and discussed.",

      "title": "Intoxicated Perpetrators of Sexual Assault & Rape Know What They are Doing Despite Intoxication: What the Literature Has to Say",
      "abstract": "Far too many people claim that they did not know what they were doing when confronted about antisocial or illegal behavior they engaged in when intoxicated.Yet somehow they seem to recall most if not all pleasant or fun behavior when intoxicated.People tell their stories of how much fun they had when intoxicated, recalling most of the details of their drunken escapades.The literature suggests that people may not recall events that commonly occur and therefore some of their drunken escapades may not be recalled in full because they are routine occurrences.I postulate that events that are pleasant for an individual are likely stored in memory stronger than other events and therefore more likely to be recalled.Remember that sex related offenses and behavior an individual engages in are good or positive events for that person-they like what they are doing.Sex related offenses involve specific behavior that requires thinking (e.g., to counter victim resistance, to engage in specific sexual or other behavior on the victim, and to remove any evidence, and to escape the situation).Even with an unconscious victim, the perpetrator has to make contact without others seeing, remove any clothing, deal with any victim resistance should the victim awake, and escape without detection.I believe that sex offenders who engage in sex offenses while intoxicated have a memory of their offense and know what they are doing at the time they are doing it, despite claiming that they either i. did not know what they were doing at the time because they were intoxicated or ii.Have no recollection of the event because of a \"black-out\".Literature suggests that even when intoxicated, individuals are aware of what they are doing and recall events via free recall and cues interviewing.In addition, though alcohol may cause cognitive and physical impairment, focusing on the desired reward of coerced or forced sex may help the perpetrator counter some of the negative impact of alcohol.Intoxicated non-rapists pay attention to peripheral cues (e.g., social sanctions against rape, peer accountability) and choose to stop sexually assaultive and rape behavior.The factors involved in the decision to sexually assault and rape are many; alcohol intoxication appears to play only a peripheral role.This is also supported by the alcohol-myopia theory.Marijuana intoxication is also briefly addressed.",

      "abstract": "Regular positive sexual interactions are one reason why relationships have health and well-being benefits, yet low sexual desire is among the most common sexual problems reported by women. One interpersonal factor that has been associated with greater sexual desire and satisfaction in community couples is self-expansion (i.e., expanding one‚Äôs sense of self through novel, exciting, and broadening activities with a partner). In the current study, we recruited 97 couples in which the woman was diagnosed with clinically low sexual desire to test how self-expansion was associated with both partners‚Äô sexual and relationship well-being. When women with low desire reported higher self-expansion, they reported greater relationship and sexual satisfaction, higher desire, and couples were more affectionate. When their partners reported higher self-expansion, they felt more satisfied with their sex life and relationship (and so did the women), lower sexual distress and less relationship conflict, and couples were more affectionate. Our findings suggest that self-expansion is associated with greater relationship and sexual well-being for couples with low desire, as well as less sexual distress and relationship conflict. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.",

If do not receive timely and proper professional social and psychological assistance, in victims, increases the level of trauma that could greatly complicate further their physical, psychological and social recovery.

Emotional psychotrauma can occur not only because of the impact of such critical cases as war or natural and social cataclysms, serious illnesses, but also due to the breakdown of relations, deep frustration in people or life, loss of an ideal, social or individual deprivation of personality. In general, the results indicate the main reasons and consequences of obtaining a psychotrauma by the subjects; determine the ways of self-correction that respondents use, as well as the lack of their focus on seeking help from professional psychologists.

      "abstract": "Sexuality is influenced by the interaction of biological, psychological, social, economic, political, cultural, ethical, legal, historical and religious and spiritual factors. The multidimensional concept of sexuality is constructed socially and shaped by sexual and gender norms and inequalities. Sexuality is one of the key components of the physical, intellectual and psychosocial well-being of an individual. Patient-centered approaches are used to define 'normal' or 'healthy' sexuality. Disruption in any phase of the sexual response cycle is considered sexual dysfunction. The prevalence of sexual dysfunction in mental illness is very high. The disease process by itself as well as the medication used in treatment both contribute to the increased prevalence of sexual dysfunction. The estimated prevalence of sexual dysfunction in people suffering from depression is around 70-80% in various studies. Patients suffering from Alzheimer's and related dementia have a multitude of sexual problems, which include sexual apathy, sexually inappropriate behavior, decreased sexual desire and inappropriate sexual behavior, causing disrupted marital relationships.",

Dennoch finden sich auch einige Besonderheiten in sexuellem Erleben und Verhalten bei Menschen mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-St√∂rung, die gr√∂√ütenteils auf die st√∂rungsspezifischen Symptome zur√ºckzuf√ºhren sind. Hierzu z√§hlen eine h√∂here Diversit√§t bez√ºglich der eigenen sexuellen Orientierung sowie des eigenen Geschlechtsrollenverst√§ndnisses, aber auch Probleme im Hinblick auf das Eingehen von festen Partnerschaften oder im Hinblick auf die eigene sexuelle Funktionsf√§higkeit. Dar√ºber hinaus finden sich bei manchen Personen mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-St√∂rung (insbesondere bei M√§nnern) Hinweise auf das Vorliegen hypersexueller Verhaltensweisen sowie paraphiler sexueller Fantasien und Verhaltensweisen. Bisher existieren keine empirischen Befunde, die nahelegen, dass eine Autismus-Spektrum-St√∂rung einen Risikofaktor f√ºr allgemeine oder sexuelle Straff√§lligkeit darstellt. Basierend auf Fallstudien wurden jedoch einige Erkl√§rungsans√§tze publiziert, die beschreiben, wie in einigen wenigen F√§llen die autismusspezifische Symptomatik mit zu der Begehung einer Straftat beigetragen haben k√∂nnte, was auch bei der Schuldf√§higkeitsbegutachtung Ber√ºcksichtigung finden k√∂nnte. Hierzu z√§hlen eine fehlende Opferempathie, das Vorliegen kognitiver Verzerrungen oder defizit√§re Kommunikations- und Interaktionsfertigkeiten. Straft√§ter mit einer Autismus-Spektrum-St√∂rung sollten individuell auf sie zugeschnittenen psycho- und pharmakotherapeutischen Interventionen zugef√ºhrt werden, um eine erneute Straff√§lligkeit im besten Falle zu verhindern.",

      "abstract": "Engaging in sex is a common practice, however, some adults may choose to not have sexual experiences for normative reasons. Asexual adults, in particular, may hold negative attitudes about sex and are less likely than allosexual adults to engage in sex. Less is known about whether adults' motives to not have any sexual experiences differ based on sexual orientation. We use qualitative to explore asexual and allosexual adults' intrinsic and extrinsic motives for not having sexual experiences. From a larger study, 129 adults with no sexual experiences (52.7% allosexual, Mage = 22.0, 47.3% asexual, Mage = 25.4; 61.2% women, 28.7% men, 10.1% transgender/gender non-conforming) responded to an open-ended question about sexual motives. Using thematic analysis, we developed five themes: (1) Lack of interest, (2) Morals or personal values, (3) Disgust or aversion, (4) Not feeling ready, and (5) No opportunity. Our findings suggest that asexual adults are more likely to report motives related to intrinsic experiences, such as negative feelings, whereas allosexual adults are more likely to report motives related to intrinsic personal beliefs. Overall, these findings expand our understanding of asexual and allosexual adults' motives for not having sexual experiences, and provide insight into diverse experiences of sexuality.",

These actions occur on a very frequent basis (statistical definition: at least once a week) and over a long period of time (statistical definition: at least six months¬¥ duration).

      "title": "The Instability of Sexual Preference",
      "abstract": "Abstract Whether an explanation for sexual preference is biological, psychological, or sociological, the basic presumption usually is that sexual preference is set early and changes little through life. In this view, any changes in sexual feelings, sexual behaviors, or romantic feelings are especially unlikely after adulthood. Further, it would be sexual feelings that would be least likely to change because they are assumed to be the most basic element of sexual preference. Despite these presumptions, evidence of substantial change in an individual‚Äôs sexual preference does exist. For example, one recent study noted the effect of the feminist movement on women‚Äôs sexuality, teaching some women that relating both emotionally and sexually to other women is an option.1 Another study focused on a group of women who were all heterosexual in behavior and identity before participating in swinging.2 As a response to their husbands‚Äô wishes and their observations of other women, they became involved in sex with other women, and all of them eventually identified themselves as bisexual. Their bisexuality, moreover, was an addition to their previous heterosexual interest, and they still preferred heterosexual sex.",

While previous research has extensively investigated desired sexual behavior and rape, less is known about consensual, yet unwanted sexual activity. This study devised a scale to measure consensual unwanted sex and explored its relationship with several characteristics (i.e., sexual self-efficacy, sexual assertiveness, sex refusal skill, sex motives, and conflict style) that may contribute to consenting to sex contrary to one's desire. Participants recalled sexual compliance in adolescent dating relationships. Results revealed that decreased consent to unwanted sex was related to increased sexual self-efficacy, sex refusal, partner approval, and an obliging conflict style in females. For males, consensual unwanted sex in adolescence was associated with younger age at sex initiation and having sex for physical gratification.",

      "abstract": "The importance of primal-scene experience is suggested by the wide range of attention it has received, with a multitude of derivative phenomena being attributed to its influence. Emphasis has been on possible psychiatric problems, and almost all available reports are clinical and anecdotal. The classical psychoanalytic view has been that such stimulation, be it through actual witnessing or fantasy, results (especially in children) in experience of anxiety, intense eroticization, and sadomasochistic confusions about sexuality. It is suggested here that issues of affectional love and fears of aloneness and feelings of vulnerability may often be the focus of primal-scene reactions. A wide range of evidence has been presented here to support the view that primal-scene experience per se is not necessarily deleterious, and that traumatic or pathogenic effects usually occur only within a context of general brutality or disturbed family relationships. In contradistinction, some emphasis here has been placed on possible positive effects of primal-scene experience. There is a clear need for further study, especially among nonpsychiatrically selected persons, for understanding to be advanced regarding the vicissitudes of both normal and pathological primal-scene experience.",

      "abstract": "Recently, scholars have become interested in the impact of culture on people's attitudes, emotions, and behavior. In this study, it was predicted that culture and gender would have an impact on people's sexual self-schemas ‚Äì especially, women's self-schemas. It was also predicted that couples that verified one another's sexual self-schemas would be more satisfied than those couples that did not. Contrary to the predictions, race did not prove to be a good predictor of either women's or men's sexual self-schemas. However, self-construal was a significant predictor of women's sexual self-schemas. Again, contrary to prediction, whether or not couples verified one another's sexual self-schemas did not appear to be an important predictor of either sexual or general relationship satisfaction. Some unexpected findings were found, however. Women who perceived their partners to be passionate and men who perceived their partners to be romantic were more sexually and generally satisfied in their relationships than were their peers. Men were also less satisfied if they viewed their partners as more shy/embarrassed sexually. These data demonstrate that culture (as indicated by self-construal) may influence how women see themselves sexually and that perception (for both men and women) of their partner's sense of sexual self are important predictors of sexual and relationship satisfaction.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological adaptation underlies all human behavior. Thus, sexual coercion by men could either arise from a rape-specific psychological adaptation or it could be a side-effect of a more general psychological adaptation not directly related to rape. Determining the specific environmental cues that men's brains have been designed by selection to process may help us decide which these rival explanations is correct. We examine six testable predictions against existing data: (1) Both coercive and noncoercive will be associated with high levels of sexual arousal and performance in men. (2) Achieving physical control of a sexually unwilling woman will be sexually arousing to men. (3) Young men will be more sexually coercive than older men. (4) Men of low socioeconomic status will likewise be more sexually coercive. (5) A man's motivation to use sexual coercion will be influenced by its effects on social image. (6) Even in long-term relationships men will be motivated to use coercion when their mates show a lack of interest in resistance to sex because these are interpreted as signs of sexual infidelity. Current data support all six predictions and are hence consistent with the rape-specific hypothesis, but this does not eliminate the side-effect hypothesis, which is likewise compatible with the findings, as well as with the further evidence that forced matings increased the fitness of ancestral males during human evolution. We suggest some research that may help decide between the two hypotheses.",

When sex feels further away, do people feel less satisfied? Do they desire sex more? In a cross-sectional study (Study 1), when one's last sexual experience felt further away, people reported lower sexual satisfaction and desire. In an experimental study (Study 2), women (but not men) who were made to feel that the last sex was further (vs. closer) reported lower desire, but overall, there was limited evidence of causal effects. However, in a 21-day daily experience study (Study 3), within-person lagged models revealed that sex feeling further away was associated with lower sexual satisfaction, but higher desire, tomorrow, and higher desire and satisfaction were associated with sex feeling further away tomorrow. Subjective time since sex has nuanced associations in relationships, especially with desire and satisfaction in daily life.",

An intensive and detailed personal interview was conducted with 260 women in the immediate post-partum period concerning their sexual behavior during pregnancy. It was found that for most women coital activity declines in a linear fashion once pregnancy is discovered. Orgasmic activity, sexual interest and noncoital behavior are similarly affected. The decrease in noncoital behavior, such as mutual oral-genital stimulation suggests that more than attitudes and comfort with sexuality are involved. Despite the significant and steady reduction in sexual behavior for most women, some increased their activity, reflecting the highly individualistic nature of human sexuality and response to pregnancy. The decrease or increase in sexual activity is not predictable by socioeconomic or other demographic factors. There was no relation between sexual activity and prematurity.

Nowadays Klaibya is considered as one of the most common problems affecting the males having variable severity.

It has a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patients along with their partners. It is projected as a medico-social problem. Vajikarana, a specialized branch of Ayurveda deals in treating these problems. It refers to a problem during any phase of the sexual cycle that restricts the man from experiencing satisfaction from the activity. Nowadays the incidence of sexual dysfunction is increasing due to age, sedentary life style, unhealthy foods etc. About 5% of 35 years old men and between 15% and 25% of 50 years old men experience sexual dysfunctions.

Having many short-term relationships and many lifetime sex partners are ways to maximize current reproduction, but they come at a cost (e.g., decreased resources for future reproduction, decreased desirability as a future mate, etc.). This study, therefore, examined whether sexually active individuals with high levels of early psychosocial stress report more terminated short-term relationships, a shorter relationship length with their current partner, and more lifetime sex partners than those with less early psychosocial stress. Early psychosocial stress in men was associated with more terminated short-term relationships and a greater number of lifetime sex partners, but not with current relationship length; in women, high early psychosocial stress was associated with shorter current relationship length but not with the number of terminated short-term relationships or number of lifetime sex partners. Results are discussed from the perspective of life history theory and gender differences in preferences for short- and long-term relationships.",

Still, it is unclear whether this inhibitive role also includes common, normative sexual behavior, particularly in secularized contexts. Moreover, the possible mediating effects emotions, affects, and thoughts have on the association between religiosity and restricted sexuality have never been integrated into a single model. Finally, cross-religious differences in common sexual behavior have still yet to be documented. We addressed these three issues in two studies, with samples of Catholic and Muslim tradition (total N = 446). Consistently across samples, religiosity predicted, either directly or indirectly, less frequent common heterosexual behaviors and masturbation, partly through sexual guilt and inhibition, and/or decreased sexual fantasy and the search for sexual pleasure. However, married Muslims‚Äô religiosity, unlike Catholics‚Äô, did not directly undermine fertility-oriented sexuality and the search for pleasure.

      "abstract": "Abstract Whilst loneliness and social isolation amongst older care-givers are becoming increasingly recognised, little is known about how these concepts impact on specific sub-groups of care-givers, such as older males. In the current study, we aimed to gain a better understanding of the experiences of loneliness and social isolation amongst older spousal male care-givers. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 24 participants, caring for a spouse/partner with a long-term chronic condition. After thematic analysis of the data, three themes were identified: dwindling social interactions, loneliness in the spousal relationship, and living with loneliness and social isolation. Study findings suggest that opportunities for social interactions gradually ‚Äòdwindled‚Äô due to a reluctance by older male care-givers to leave their spouse/partner at home alone, to accept offers of help or respite, or to attend social events without their spouse/partner. Consequently, social isolation increased. Feelings of physical and emotional loneliness were evident, and the loss of spousal companionship (such as loss of conversation and shared interests) increased loneliness. Individualised coping strategies were adopted including focusing on moments of positivity, talking to others and using prescribed medication. Findings provide insight into the experience of loneliness and social isolation for many older male spousal care-givers. This may facilitate a better understanding of older male care-givers‚Äô support needs in addressing loneliness and social isolation, and should help to inform the development of targeted support services for this population.",

Welfare also affects the relationship of horses with humans both at work and outside work; it enhances security for people and thus it constitutes a social issue too. Studies combining behavioural, postural, physiological and sanitary data suggest that it is possible to identify and validate indicators of altered welfare but also of well-being, that is, of a positive affective state. Although it has been proposed that positive affective states could arise from the sum of positive emotions experienced daily, the link between these short term experiences and the chronic state that characterizes the welfare state is not clear yet. Indeed, emotions are short-lived affective reactions but do not necessary depict the chronic state of the animal. Moreover, identifying expressions of positive emotions remains more difficult than identifying those of negative emotions. Also discriminate valence (positive/negative) from intensity (high/low) when measuring emotions is both necessary and delicate. For example, adult play or anticipatory behaviours may not have the same valence if one considers the short term or the chronic affective state but are both of high intensity. On the other hand, other low intensity indicators of positive emotions emerge that might be better candidates for revealing a ‚Äúwell-being‚Äù state. The aim of this review is to propose a critical view of measuring short experienced positive emotions, evaluating their interest for welfare assessment and present novel perspectives of investigation through behavioural and electrophysiological recordings.",

      "title": "Cambio terap√©utico y eficacia del tratamiento psicol√≥gico de los agresores sexuales = Therapeutic change and effectiveness of psychological treatment of sex offenders",
      "abstract": "[spa] En la actualidad los delitos de abuso y agresion sexual generan un gran rechazo y alarma social a la vez que son conductas prohibidas y castigadas penalmente en la inmensa mayoria de los paises. Pese a que los delitos sexuales tienen una prevalencia baja en relacion al resto de delitos conocidos, su gravedad y los severos danos que causan a las victimas (generalmente mujeres y ninos) los convierten en conductas criminales de alto riesgo. De ahi que la investigacion especializada haya dirigido una gran atencion a ampliar el conocimiento sobre la genesis de la agresion sexual y sobre su posible prevencion y tratamiento. Hasta el momento se han descrito numerosos deficits y carencias personales y sociales vinculados al inicio y desarrollo de la agresion sexual, tales como baja autoestima, dificultades de control emocional, deficits de comunicacion y de relacion interpersonal, aislamiento social, experiencias de victimizacion, etc. necesidades Algunos de estos elementos, a los que se ha denominado criminogenas (o factores de riesgo dinamicos), son susceptibles de mejora a traves de una intervencion psicologica adecuada. Por este motivo, las necesidades criminogenas suelen constituir los objetivos principales de los programas de tratamiento con agresores sexuales. En coherencia con ello, actualmente existen numerosos programas de tratamiento para agresores sexuales dirigidos a promover en los individuos cambios y mejoras en factores de riesgo dinamicos, de cariz cognitivo, actitudinal, emocional y conductual. Por lo que se refiere al tratamiento de los agresores sexuales en los centros penitenciarios espanoles, desde 1996 se aplica el Programa de Control de la Agresion Sexual (PCAS), que incluye ingredientes terapeuticos de necesidad criminogena como los siguientes: entrenamiento en relajacion mecanismos de defensa; desarrollo de la empatia con la victima; etc. muscular; restructuracion cognitiva; conciencia emocional. Segun se ha concluido en la investigacion sobre reincidencia delictiva tanto nacional como internacional, los programas de tratamiento de agresores sexuales tienen una eficacia significativa aunque de tamano moderado. No obstante, pese a que la participacion de los delincuentes sexuales en los tratamientos parece reducir su reincidencia delictiva, todavia se desconoce en gran medida el proceso individual de cambio y mejora terapeutica de los agresores sexuales que podria vincularse finalmente a una menor reincidencia. Por todo lo anterior, el objetivo principal de esta Tesis Doctoral es la evaluacion de la eficacia terapeutica del Programa de Control de la Agresion Sexual aplicado en los centros penitenciarios espanoles. En esta direccion, los objetivos especificos planteados en este estudio son los siguientes: (a) revisar la investigacion cientifica sobre las principales necesidades criminogenas de los agresores sexuales, con la finalidad de evaluar en que medida los programas de tratamiento contribuyen a la solucion de dichas necesidades y a la mejora terapeutica de los agresores; (b) explorar la existencia de diversas tipologias de agresores sexuales en funcion de sus necesidades criminogenas o de tratamiento; y, por ultimo, (c) evaluar el cambio y la mejora terapeutica en una muestra de agresores sexuales tras su participacion en el programa de tratamiento. En consonancia con los objetivos planteados en esta Tesis Doctoral, presentada como compendio de publicaciones, se integran aqui cinco estudios sobre la evaluacion y el tratamiento de los agresores sexuales encarcelados en Espana. Las principales conclusiones que se derivan de los estudios realizados son las que siguen. En primer lugar, tras la revision de la bibliografia cientifica efectuada sobre necesidades criminogenas y tratamiento, se ha podido constatar que el Programa de Control de la Agresion Sexual aplicado en Espana es susceptible de promover cambios y mejoras en las necesidades terapeuticas de los agresores sexuales que podrian disminuir su riesgo delictivo. Paralelamente, se ha comprobado que pueden establecerse categorias y tipologias de agresores sexuales en funcion de la intensidad de sus necesidades criminogenas, orientadas a facilitar la aplicacion del tratamiento. Por otro lado, se ha observado una tendencia hacia el incremento de la motivacion para el cambio de los agresores sexuales a lo largo del proceso de desarrollo del tratamiento, desde estadios de cambio menos avanzados a estadios mas avanzados. Y finalmente, ha podido concluirse que la participacion de los agresores sexuales en un programa de tratamiento promueve la disminucion de sus necesidades criminogenas y su mejora terapeutica global. Sin embargo, como en toda investigacion sobre eficacia terapeutica, deben tenerse en cuenta diversas limitaciones que se han destacado a lo largo de los diferentes estudios compendiados y de esta Tesis Doctoral en su conjunto. En sintesis, aunque los resultados de estas investigaciones deben interpretarse con cautela, la conclusion general que puede extraerse es que el programa de tratamiento de agresores sexuales aplicado en las prisiones espanolas favorece en los individuos mejoras terapeuticas vinculadas a la reduccion de su futura conducta delictiva. [eng] Nowadays, sexual abuse or sexual assault crimes generate a great rejection and social alarm, since they constitute as prohibited and criminally punishable acts in the vast majority of countries. Although sexual offenses have a low prevalence in comparison with other known offenses, they need to be considered high-risk criminal behaviours due to their severity and the serious harm they cause the victims (usually women and children). So far, numerous personal and social deficits and deficiencies related to the onset and development of sexual aggression have been described, such as low self-esteem, emotional difficulties, communication and interpersonal deficits, social isolation, victimization experiences, etc. In relation to this, there are currently numerous treatment programs for sex offenders aimed at promoting changes and improvement in individuals‚Äô cognitive, emotional, behavioural and attitude-related dynamic risk factors. Since 1996, the Sexual Offending Control Program (SOCP) is applied in Spanish penitentiary centres. For all of the above, the main purpose of this Doctoral Thesis is the assessment of the therapeutic effectiveness of the Sexual Offending Control Program applied in Spanish prisons. Accordingly, the specific objectives of this study are: (a) to review the scientific research on the main criminogenic needs of sex offenders in order to evaluate the extent to which treatment programs contribute to offenders‚Äô therapeutic improvement and related needs; (b) to explore the existence of different typologies of sexual aggressors according to their criminogenic or treatment needs; and, finally, (c) to evaluate change and therapeutic improvement in a sample of sex offenders after their treatment participation. In line with the objectives outlined in this Doctoral Thesis, presented as a compendium of publications, five studies on the assessment and treatment of sex offenders imprisoned in Spain are included. In summary, although the results of these studies need to be interpreted with prudence, the general conclusion that can be drawn is that the Sexual Offending Control Program implemented in Spain is likely to promote changes and improvement in the sex offenders‚Äô therapeutic needs, which could reduce their criminal risk.",

      "title": "Sexual and intimacy dysfunction among homosexual men and women.",
      "abstract": "Homosexually active men and women are no more immune than anyone else from various types of sexual dysfunction and underlying psychopathology. Intimacy fears and conflicts, ignorance, alcohol and drug dependence and relationship issues exemplify the type of issues influencing dysfunction regardless of sexual orientation, although membership of a stigmatized minority sexuality may exacerbate causes of sexual dysfunction. The effects of discordant lifestyle and identity, homosexual identity formation, dysphoria and internalized homophobia on sexual functioning are three examples of these factors of specific relevance to being homosexual in this culture. The effects of AIDS, difficulties arising from the mechanics of safer sex and the psychosexual effects of oppression on healthy sexual functioning all indicate how factors important to (but not caused by) minority sexuality status may influence sexuality functioning. The importance of neither perceiving homosexuality solely in terms of pathology on the one hand, nor refusing to recognize unhealthy sexual functioning on the other, is emphasized throughout. Models of sexuality must be inclusive, positive and communicated to the client if future sexual dysfunction is to be limited. Finally, the role of the therapist in community development, as well as individual intervention, is addressed. Primary health care interventions are required not only to address the specific issues affecting homosexual men and women, but also to promote a more positive approach to sexuality for all.",

      "abstract": "Human asexuality has been defined as a lack of sexual attraction to others, although its nature is not well understood. Asexual men's genital and subjective sexual arousal patterns were compared to sexual men's to better understand asexual men's sexual response patterns. Using a penile plethysmograph to measure genital arousal, 20 asexual, 27 heterosexual, and 22 gay cisgender men (M age = 28.28, SD = 9.41) viewed erotic films depicting sexual activity or masturbation, and a subsample engaged in sexual fantasy of their choosing. Questionnaires assessing sexual function and behavior were also completed. Asexual men scored lower on sexual desire and orgasmic function, higher on sexual aversion, and did not differ on overall sexual satisfaction. Compared with gay and heterosexual men, asexual men demonstrated lower genital and subjective sexual arousal to the erotic films but displayed similar sexual arousal when engaging in sexual fantasy. Asexual men's lower levels of sexual excitation rather than their higher levels of sexual inhibition were associated with lower responses to the erotic films. These findings suggest asexual men have preferred sexual stimuli that differ from sexual men and have a similar capacity for sexual arousal as sexual men. Collectively these findings add to a growing literature aiming to understand the nature of asexuality.",

Older adolescents indicated more dating experiences, times in love, passion, identity, and intimacy. They also reported more commitment-related romantic beliefs but less romantic idealization. Across all grades, females indicated fewer times in love and less tendency to believe in love at first sight but greater intimacy and self-consciousness. In addition, predictions of psychosocial intimacy were examined.

      "title": "Mixed Emotions: An Incentive Motivational Model of Sexual Deviance",
      "abstract": "Sexual offending behavior is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon. Most existing etiological models describe sexual offending behavior as a variant of offending behavior and mostly include factors referring to disinhibition and sexual deviance. In this article, we argue that there is additional value in describing sexual offending behavior as sexual behavior in terms of an incentive model of sexual motivation. The model describes sexual arousal as an emotion, triggered by a competent stimulus signaling potential reward, and comparable to other emotions coupled with strong bodily reactions. Consequently, we describe sexual offending behavior in terms of this new model with emphasis on the development of deviant sexual interests and preferences. Summarized, the model states that because sexual arousal itself is an emotion, there is a bidirectional relationship between sexual self-regulation and emotional self-regulation. Not only can sex be used to regulate emotional states (i.e., sexual coping), emotions can also be used, consciously or automatically, to regulate sexual arousal (i.e., sexual deviance). Preliminary support for the model is drawn from studies in the field of sex offender research as well as sexology and motivation research.",

      "title": "Normal feline behaviour: ‚Ä¶ and why problem behaviours develop",
      "abstract": "Practical relevance: Cats are descended from a solitary, territorial ancestor, and while domestication has reduced their inherited tendency to be antagonistic towards all animals larger than their typical prey, they still place more reliance on the security of their territory than on psychological attachments to people or other cats, the exact opposite to dogs. Many feline problem behaviours stem from perceived threats to this security, often due to conflicts with other cats. Others are more developmental in origin, often caused by inadequate exposure to crucial stimuli, especially people, during the socialisation period. Strongly aversive events experienced at any age can also contribute. A third category comprises normal behaviour that owners deem unacceptable, such as scratching of furniture. Evidence base: This review identifies three areas in which basic research is inadequate to support widely employed concepts and practices in feline behavioural medicine. First, classification of cats‚Äô problem behaviours relies heavily on approaches derived from studies of their behavioural ecology and, to some extent, extrapolation from canine studies. Few studies have focused on cats in the home, the environment in which most behavioural disorders are expressed. Secondly, cats‚Äô chemical senses (olfactory and vomeronasal) are far more sensitive than our own, making it difficult for owners or clinicians to fully comprehend the sensory information upon which they base their behaviour. Thirdly, although the concept of psychological distress is widely invoked as an intervening variable in behavioural disorders, there are still no reliable measures of distress for pet cats in the home. Global importance: Psychological distress of some kind is the primary cause of many of the behavioural problems presented to clinicians, but surveys indicate that many more cats display the same clinical signs without their owners ever seeking help. The welfare of this ‚Äòinvisible‚Äô group could be improved by veterinarians taking a more proactive approach to educating their clients about the behavioural needs of pet cats.",

We used multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis to connect young adult participants‚Äô (N = 128) self-descriptions of twelve identities to their sexual motivations and ideals. Identities clustered along two semantically distinct dimensions: Dimension 1 was anchored by family identities on one side and non-family identities on the other; Dimension 2 was anchored on one side by friend/romantic relationships and achievement-based social identities on the other. Those who cited intimacy (e.g., sex as an expression of love) and enhancement (e.g., gratification; to feel good) sexual motivations were more likely to describe their sexual identities and gender identities as distinct from other identities, especially for women. Idealizing physically passionate relationships was positively linked to a higher distinction between sexual and non-sexual identities, and between gender and personal identities and family identities. The mental structuring of identities may inform sexual relationship motives, ideals, and expectations.",

These feelings often began immediately or very shortly after the birth, and with one exception, were specific to one child; such characteristics are best encapsulated by the term 'maternal bonding disorder'. Twenty-nine of the women were multiparae; first-borns were not significantly more likely to be the focus for such feelings. There was no direct evidence of predisposing maternal personality traits or previous experiences. Postnatal mental illness and recalled severe pain during labour were significantly associated with such disorders which, in their severe forms, did not occur in the absence of postnatal mental illness.The nature of the link between postnatal mental illness and disorders of maternal bonding remains unclear. Because, in multiparae, the disorder often 'missed' the first child, factors such as maternal personality traits or early childhood experiences cannot be regarded as sufficient causes.",

      "abstract": "Very frequently the psychiatrist is confronted in his practice with having to deal with marital difficulties that occur during the climacteric and post-climacteric age in marriages that, until then, seem to have been more or less reasonably satisfactory. In many cases, these difficulties are not very serious though troublesome; enough to make the relationship between the spouses unpredictable and shaky. In others, however, the marital relationships are completely disrupted, misunderstanding between husband and wife is complete, every constructive communication and intimacy disappears and they feel that no way out is left for them but separation or divorce, that when really accomplished proves practically always to be catastrophic for both. On the basis of clinical observation, the author tries to show how these difficulties are the expression of inability, in varying degrees, of the ego in both spouses in facing and/or solving successfully the crisis of the typical nuclear conflict of this stage of life: ‚Äúgenerativity vs. stagnation‚Äù. As a result, a regression occurs that manifests itself in a great impairment and impoverishment of interpersonal relationships and a lack of mutuality. In the individual one observes a diminishing of productivity that often leads him to anger and despair.",

      "abstract": "One hundred and nine men (38 per cent single, 48 per cent married) participated in a survey of the prevalence of erectile and ejaculatory difficulty in a non-clinical sample. Perceived aetiology of erectile difficulty was also investigated. Twenty-three per cent of the sample were currently experiencing sexual problems, with ejaculatory difficulty approximately three times as prevalent as erectile difficulty. Nearly one-quarter had experienced erection difficulties at some time and, of these, 68 per cent had remitted without formal treatment. Most frequently cited 'causes' of erectile difficulty were 'psychological' rather than 'physical', 'practical' or specifically 'sexual,' with relationship factors including communication between partners being perceived as particularly important. The presence of erectile and/or ejaculatory difficulty was related to sexual dissatisfaction but not to ratings of relationship happiness. Men having sexual relationships outside their permanent relationship found their partner less sexually attractive and rated themselves as less happy than those men not having affairs but the two groups did not differ in terms of presence of sexual difficulty or sexual dissatisfaction. The limitations of a sample biased towards younger, more educated men, are discussed.",

While being in a relationship or not is unrelated to antisocial behavior, romantic partner characteristics (antisocial behavior and antisocial influence) are associated with greater antisocial behavior. As males age, they become increasingly resistant to romantic partner characteristics. In contrast, females become increasingly vulnerable to the effects of romantic partner characteristics on antisocial behavior as they age, particularly when these relationships are relatively shorter. Females in shorter romantic relationships with partners who are antisocial or exert antisocial influence are at risk of persisting in antisocial behavior.",

      "title": "THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE CHANGE OF SEX OPERATION",
      "abstract": "The syndrome of male transsexualism is characterized by a life-long preference for the feminine role, predicated on the conviction of belonging to the female sex. This conviction is held and persists despite the painfully obvious fact of normal male anatomy and genitalia, before and after puberty, and in the absence of delusional ideation or psychosis in the majority of transsexuals studied. He is disgusted with the development of his primary and secondary sexual characteristics, to the point where the male transsexual frequently contemplates and occasionally performs self-mutilation of his genitalia. He prefers normal, heterosexual men as sexual partners, and rejects homosexual men or the idea that his sexual activity is homosexual. Feeling he belongs to the female gender, he considers it appropriate to have a love relationship with a man, and he feels ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù in a relationship with a woman, considering this ‚Äúhomosexual.‚Äù There is some evidence that sex or overt sexual activity, whether it be considered homosexual or heterosexual, plays a minor or secondary role. The transsexual may decide to pass and become accepted as a female, either before or after sex reassignment surgery, depending upon individual circumstances. The postoperative results of 121 male transsexuals who have obtained sex reassignment surgery are reviewed. A satisfactory outcome, as indicated by improved social and emotional adjustment, is 10 times more likely than an unsatisfacory result. Improvement is enhanced if the transsexual has functional use of an artificial vagina, obtains a legal change of gender status and freely passes in society as a member of the opposite sex. At the present time one is impressed with the lack of success in attempting to alter gender identity, once established, by traditional psychotherapy. This fact, together with the apparent success of sex reassignment surgery, compels one to accept the surgical treatment of transsexualism on an experimental basis until the initial results can be verified or contradicted or until alternative treatment procedures prove successful.",

While it is now widely accepted that sex differences are modulated by the hormonal status of female participants (menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptive use), the question, whether hormonal status and sex hormones also modulate participants sex role orientation has hardly been addressed previously. The present study assessed sex role orientation and hormonal status as well as sex hormone levels in three samples of participants from two different cultures (Northern American, Middle European). Menstrual cycle phase did not affect participant's masculinity or femininity, but had a significant impact on reference group. While women in their follicular phase (low levels of female sex hormones) determined their masculinity and femininity in reference to men, women in their luteal phase (high levels of female sex hormones) determined their masculinity and femininity in reference to women. Hormonal contraceptive users rated themselves as significantly more feminine and less masculine than naturally cycling women. Furthermore, the impact of biological sex on the factorial structure of sex role orientation as well as the relationship of estrogen to masculinity/femininity was modulated by culture. We conclude that culture and sex hormones interactively affect sex role orientation and hormonal status of participants should be controlled for when assessing masculinity and/or femininity.",

      "title": "[Aging and sexuality in women].",
      "abstract": "A large number of biological, psycho-relational and socio-cultural factors are related to women's sexual health and they may negatively affect the entire sexual response cycle inducing significant changes in sexual desire, arousal, orgasm and satisfaction during the entire reproductive life span. In spite of the high prevalence of sexual problems with increasing age, sexual retirement is not an inevitable consequence of the passage of time and a high proportion of men and women remains sexually active well into later life, a result of changing attitudes toward sexuality and the availability of effective treatments for sexual dysfunction. Population-based studies reported an age-related decline of sexual functioning and an additional adverse effect of menopausal status. Ageing per se interferes with the level of sexual performance, but sexual behaviour of midlife and older women is highly dependent on several factors such as general physical and mental well-being, quality of relationship and life situation. Sex hormones, mainly low levels of estradiol, are relevant for the lack of sexual awareness and vaginal receptivity in naturally menopausal women. Even diminished levels of androgens, as it more frequently occurs in surgically menopausal women, has a negative impact on desire and sexual responsiveness. Several hormonal treatments have been used locally or systemically to alleviate sexual symptoms, especially by using estrogen plus androgen preparations and tibolone, with noticeable results on drive, enjoyment, lubrication, ability to reach orgasm and initiation of sex. However, sexual counseling and individualized management is mandatory to obtain meaningful and long-lasting results in clinical practice.",

A convenience sample that included graduate and undergraduate students (N = 176; mean age = 37) completed a five-factor measure of personality as well as measures of spirituality, religiosity, shame, guilt, and sexual attitudes and experiences. Spirituality was negatively correlated with sexual permissiveness, and engaging in high risk sex. The moral emotion of shame increased when people had multiple sex partners within the past three months while those more spiritual or connected to God were less likely to have had sex after use of alcohol and/or drugs. Also, the more often someone attended religious services the less likely they were to have had multiple partners within the past three months. A sense of alienation from God predicted shame and guilt, but shame and guilt themselves did not predict sexual practices. These findings suggest that sexual attitudes and experiences are related to both spirituality and religious practices independently of personality, whereas they have no relationship to shame and guilt.",

Then the congestion either is ignored or not interpreted as sexual. An anhedonic or even a dysphoric response to the sensations of genital congestion are further possibilities. This model allows for various subtypes of arousal disorder and thus facilitates a choice of therapeutic intervention.",

Principle findings are that in spite of severe genito-sexual dysfunctions the majority continued having intercourse and about half felt orgasmic. Sexuality maintained its pre-injury significance for nearly all subjects, and most characterized their sexual lives as at least to some extent satisfactory. Loco-motor impairment and autonomous dysreflexia were more frequently given as causes of reduced sexual pleasure than were sexual dysfunctions. High spinal cord severance and lack of regular partner were negative factors for continuation of satisfying sexual experiences. Thus, genital sexual dysfunction is but one factor determining level of sexual satisfaction after a spinal cord trauma as many younger tetra- and paraplegics appear to be able to identify new and gratifying ways of sexual fulfillment.",

There is a decline in sexual interest correlated with the life-span, but the negative effects of age on desire are related to health problems. Moreover, sexual desire is more correlated with personal attitudes toward sexuality than with biological factors and diseases. Several predictors account for the pursuit of an active sexuality (including the presence of a partner, good health, having good sexual self-esteem, enjoyable past experience, an attitude that values the importance of sex in couple relationship), but the most decisive factor to successfully face the specific markers of aging is the ability to adapt to a more sensory sexuality, less focused on performance and coitus.

There are four basic patterns: (a) The higher one's social status the lower one's distress; (b) women are more distressed than men; (c) married persons are less distressed than unmarried persons, and; (d) the greater the number of undesirable events in one's life the greater one's distress. The major forms of distress are malaise (such as lethargy, headaches, and trembling hands), anxiety (such as feeling afraid, worried, or irritable), and depression (such as feeling sad, worthless, or hopeless). Sociological theory suggests that alienation, authoritarianism, and inequity produce distress. The research indicates that distress is reduced by control, commitment, support, meaning, normality, flexibility, trust, and equity. The presence or absence of these accounts for the social patterns of distress.",

      "abstract": "Aspects of sexual function, partnership responsiveness and fulfilment after stroke were, together with sexually performance orientated and stigmatic attitudes, investigated in 51 subjects. Erectile and orgastic spectatoring were frequent after stroke and were in the males significantly associated. Retarded ejaculation occurred for no males before but for 15% after the stroke. Marked decreases in different kinds of caressive behaviour were followed by discontentment and up to and about half the subjects felt that sexual partnership responsiveness had deteriorated. After the stroke the commonly occurring reduction in general sexual satisfaction was significantly associated with symptoms of increased sexual dysfunction, disturbed partnership responsiveness and reduced sexual fulfilment. The high prevalence of sexual maladjustment in stroke victims appears mostly to be psychogenic. Important precipitating factors are performance orientation and sexual stigmatism. Moreover, lack of sexual information and counselling may contribute to deterioration of partnership sexuality.",

      "abstract": "This narrative study explored how late adolescents (N = 64 dyads) jointly told stories about romantic relationships during casual conversations with same-sex friends. Stories about romantic problems were four times more prevalent than stories about romantic nonproblems, and relationship instability was the most frequent type of romantic problem. Furthermore, discussions of romantic problems (versus nonproblems) were particularly likely to be softened or mitigated by projecting a detached, relaxed, or unknowing stance. Case studies of such conversational mitigation vividly illustrate how these primarily White, heterosexual, late adolescents conavigated the vagaries of developing serious and intimate bonds without appearing too invested or troubled by their romantic problems. The findings have implications for understanding the co-construction of social and personal identities.",

      "abstract": "Berpacaran merupakan suatu tahapan bagi manusia untuk membangun attachment dengan lawan jenis yang umumnya dijalani saat berada di usia dewasa awal. Konflik tidak dapat dihindari dalam hubungan pacaran dan isu ini sering dikaitkan dengan masalah komunikasi. Self-disclosure dianggap menjadi salah satu cara untuk meminimalisir konflik. Individu yang merasa aman dalam membangun attachment memiliki kecenderungan untuk lebih banyak melakukan self-disclosure dan komunikasi secara langsung dibandingkan individu yang merasa tidak aman dalam membangun attachment. Studi ini bertujuan untuk meneliti apakah attachment yang terdiri dari dua dimensi, yaitu anxiety dan avoidance, memiliki pengaruh terhadap self-disclosure pada 72 pria dewasa awal yang sedang berpacaran. Penelitian dilakukan secara kuantitatif dengan menggunakan instrumen penelitian yaitu Experiences in Close Relationships-Revised dan Revised Self-Disclosure Scale. Hasil menunjukkan bahwa terdapat pengaruh negatif yang signifikan antara attachment anxiety terhadap self-disclosure (R2=.09, F= 7.127, p&lt;.05) dan attachment avoidance terhadap self-disclosure (R2=.22, F= 20.258, p&lt;.05). Artinya, semakin tinggi tingkat attachment anxiety dan/atau attachment avoidance seseorang, maka semakin rendah tingkat self-disclosure seseorang, dan sebaliknya. Namun, saat diperhitungkan bersama sebagai sebuah konstruk, hanya attachment avoidance yang memiliki pengaruh signifikan terhadap self-disclosure. Penemuan lain yang berkaitan dengan attachment dan self-disclosure juga turut didiskusikan.&#x0D; Kata Kunci: attachment, self-disclosure, berpacaran, dewasa awal",

Regardless of one's role in providing care to patients, most practitioners do not have experience about discussing sexuality and intimacy in a frank, direct, and authentic manner. Addressing sexuality issues early on in the assessment and treatment of the patient allows the practitioner to open up a line of communication with the patient so that these issues can be addressed as they come up in the future.

      "abstract": "Consensual non-monogamy (CNM) refers to romantic relationships in which all partners agree to engage in sexual, romantic and/or emotional relationships with others. Within the general framework of CNM, subtypes of relationships differ in the extent to which partners intend for love and emotional involvement to be a part of their multiple relationships (that is, some relationships may prioritise love over sex with multiple partners, or vice versa). The present study examined whether individuals were more likely to stigmatise relationships that: (i) focus on loving more than one person (which is characteristic of polyamory), (ii) focus on having sex without love (which is characteristic of swinging lifestyles), or (iii) involve having sex without love without a partner's participation (which is characteristic of open relationships). In the present research, participants were assigned to read a definition of one of the three CNM relationship types (i.e. a swinging, polyamorous or open relationship) and to indicate their attitudes towards individuals who participate in those relationships. Results show that swingers were overwhelmingly perceived more negatively (e.g. less responsible) than individuals in polyamorous relationships and that people in open relationships were sometimes perceived more negatively (e.g. less moral) than people in polyamorous relationships. Overall, findings suggest that people are more uncomfortable with the idea of strictly sexual relationships (i.e. swinging relationships) than relationships involving multiple romantic/emotional attachments (i.e. polyamorous relationships).",

      "abstract": "Introduction The context of stigma, in which many homosexuals live, exposes them to discrimination/stigmatization and promotes the internalization of negative attitudes about sexuality. Battle feelings of rejection and isolation may lead to the development of internalized homophobia (IH). Objectives To elucidate the risk factors of IH and how the latter affects mental health. Methods Literature review (PubMed). Results IH has been associated with lower levels of emotional stability, rejection sensitivity, impairments in emotion regulation and a tendency to turn against the self. Studies have connected IH to depression, poor self/relationship wellbeing, sexual discrimination, addictions, shame, body dissatisfaction, suicidal ideation, binge eating/drinking, partner violence and victimization. Higher levels of attachment anxiety and avoidance, outness, religiosity and internalized stigma were correlated with higher IH levels. The key factors relating to suicide include lack of acceptance by family and/or self, negative feelings about sexuality/gender and appearance dissatisfaction. In traditional/religious societies, heterosexual orientation is a strong norm and homosexuality is considered unacceptable leading LGBT individuals to report higher depressive symptoms and increased levels of IH. Due to heterosexist ideals, IH is a predictor for heterosexual marital intention, protests against LGBT and use of masculinity as a compensatory strategy. Conclusions Policies in support of individuals who have recently come out should be improved to reduce the development/effects of IH and take the social and sexual environments of rural gay men into account considering ways to increase service accessibility (e.g internet). Future research is needed to further understand the association between IH and mental health, social and cognitive mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Research on masturbation has indicated that, contrary to traditional beliefs, masturbation has been found to be a common sexual behavior and linked to indicators of sexual health. While there are no general indicators of ill health associated with masturbation, it can be powerfully negative or positive for many individuals. As an example, it is widely used in sex therapy as a means of improving the sexual health of the individual and/or relationship. Promoting masturbation as a means of a public health strategy for sexual health is highly controversial; however, there are arguments and evidence that suggest that this may be an important part of any public health approach to improving sexual health. There is a need for more research on the impact of masturbation on self-esteem, body image, sexual functioning and sexual satisfaction and methods for using masturbation to promote sexual health. There is also a need for more of a theoretical approach to the formation of hypotheses to be tested.",

      "abstract": "The contrast between the potent, aggressive male and the impotent female is so widespread that when anything gives a male a sense of weakness, inadequacy, or incompleteness, he seizes upon the contrast and begins to suspect that he is lacking in virility, a thing so unendurably disgraceful that his whole life becomes one intense, unremitting effort to prove to himself and all the world that this is not so. That is the and when one is obsessed with it, he soon develops the neurotic constitution--always determined to be the superior male, always tense and overbearing except when he is exhausted, and, of course, always subject to the physical symptoms that such a purgatorial life involves. When suspicion or accusation of inferiority leads to a protest in women, it is by no means always a masculine protest. An uncomfortable sense of inferiority is very common, indeed, with women. Its victims attribute it to a variety of causes. They care about all kinds of social relations; they want to be like other girls they admire; and their self-respect is not so steeped in thoughts of worthy masculinity that it is marked. The dominant thoughts and impulses of youthful human beings are more social than sexual, and their social ambitions are not all couched in terms of brute force.

For gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, this questioning phase is often triggered by feeling sexual attraction to someone of the same sex or gender; however, for asexual individuals, questioning may start with the realization that the person does not feel‚Äîand has never felt‚Äîsexual attraction to anyone, regardless of sex or gender. Thus, psychotherapists and other counselors have an ethical duty to respect their clients‚Äô sexual orientation and not to discriminate against, deny service to, or demean clients on the basis of sexual orientation. Because asexuality is newly recognized as a sexual orientation, however, relatively few resources exist on cultural competency with asexual or potentially asexual clients. Finally, asexual individuals may have to navigate the implications of their asexuality in terms of cultural and social expectations for sex, relationships, and childbearing.",

      "abstract": "Little research has been conducted to examine paraphilic sexual interests in nonclinical samples. The little that exists suggests that atypical sexual interests are more common in men than in women, but the reasons for this difference are unknown. In this study, we explored the prevalence of paraphilic interests in a nonclinical sample of men and women. We expected that men would report greater arousal (or less repulsion) toward various paraphilic acts than women. We also examined putative correlates of paraphilias in an attempt to explain the sex difference. In all, 305 men and 710 women completed an online survey assessing sexual experiences, sexual interests, as well as indicators of neurodevelopmental stress, sex drive, mating effort, impulsivity, masculinity/femininity, and socially desirable responding. As expected, significant sex differences were found, with men reporting significantly less repulsion (or more arousal) to the majority of paraphilic acts than women. Using mediation analysis, sex drive was the only correlate to significantly and fully mediate the sex difference in paraphilic interests. In other words, sex drive fully accounted for the sex difference in paraphilic interests. The implications of these findings for understanding the etiology of atypical sexual interests are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Problematic sexual behaviors are frequently encountered in the treatment of patients suffering Dissociative Identity Disorder and related forms of dissociative disorders. These may include unfortunate patterns of ready acquiescence or submission to overtly or potentially aggressive or sexual approaches/encounters, subtle and/or overt seductive signaling and behaviors, and even overt sexually provocative patterns of verbalizations and actions. This paper discusses the possibility that in some instances, sexual behavior has become weaponized; that is, deployed in circumstances under which assertiveness and/or aggression or other self-protective measures might be expected, probably because such behaviors were not within the range of the possible or were not understood as potentially successful for some victims of trauma. Clinical manifestations are described and discussed. An animal model in which sexual behaviors substitute for aggressive behaviors is described. A speculative hypothesis is offered, postulating that in some cases, such patterns in traumatized humans might represent an epigenetic response to exogenous trauma. Exploration of this model may lead to improved understandings and approaches to trauma victims who manifest such behavior, hopefully destigmatizing them further, facilitating reduction of their shame and guilt, and supporting their recoveries. Clinical interventions are suggested.",

Physiological and psychological factors play a role together in the etiology and prognosis of sexual dysfunctions. Sexual health is not just the absence of disease, dysfunction or disability; it is defined as the maintenance of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being related to sexuality. Difficulties experienced in sexual life are not only related to biological problems in the genitals, but can also be affected by the psycho-social structure of the individual and the traditions and customs of the culture, religious and political factors. In this article, a case report of a 29-year-old male who experienced situational nocturnal ejaculation as loss of control over ejaculation, which has not been reported before in the category of sexual dysfunctions, is presented.",

      "abstract": "Individuals who are socially connected are happier and healthier than their more isolated counterparts. Over the past few decades, researchers have established that both the quantity and quality of our social relationships are unequivocally important when it comes to our physical and mental health, and our risk of mortality. Although the link between social relationships and mental health is well established in a couple, we have only just begun to identify explanations for this link. Recently, social scientists have discovered that the link between social relationships and health is explained by our behaviours (e.g., smoking, exercise, diet), various psychosocial factors (e.g., social support, mental health, cultural norms), and physiological processes. Aggression in marital relationship is defined as a manipulative, physical or non-physical form of aggression meant to negatively impact the development of relationship by social exclusion or harming the social status of a victim by spreading or behaving negatively. Research findings suggest that even infrequent experiences with relational aggression victimization are associated with lower subjective well-being such as depression, loneliness, and positive affect. This case study investigates the existence of relational aggression in a couple and the relationship between relational aggression and own subjective well-being. The participant in the study is married and from nuclear family. The study tries to investigate aggression level through the case study method and relaxation, yoga, meditation techniques used which was used to resolve the aggression and helps to achieve well being.",

A spouse is expected to be a sparring partner, one who will always be there to share the good and bad times. Unfortunately, this situation doesn‚Äôt always happen. One of the factors leading to this unhappiness is the presence of emotional abuse. Emotional abuse is a psychological violence which has the contribution in decreasing the victims self confidence. Article describes various patterns of emotional abuse, characteristic of the abuser, consequences of the abuse, and how to respond to the abuse. There are also some suggestions to prevent or either cope the emotional abuse. The method used in this research is literature study. As a conclusion, emotional abuse in marriage relationship can be prevented by getting to know the partner personalities before the marriage. If emotional abuse occurs in a husband and wife relationship, the victim alone or together with the partner should seek professional help.",

At least 15 per cent of women with symptoms of cystitis have no organic basis for their complaints. In psychiatric studies it has been noted that sexual conflict is the primary etiological factor in these patients. In some cases, continuance of the disorder leads to irreversible organic change. Urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency, burning or retention are most common in women and become an automatic response to anxiety-provoking or sexual stimuli. In men, functional urinary symptoms are relatively infrequent. Often they indicate problems of genital dysfunction. Complaints of impotence, penile pain, testicular pain, or non-specific urethritis stem back to difficulties in their sexual lives. Many of the patients have symptoms of a generalized anxiety tension state due to sexual problems.A purely organic consideration of genitourinary disorders will lead to erroneous conclusions and unsatisfactory therapeutic results. The psychosomatic approach-that is, considering both physical and psychological aspects-will explain many hitherto difficult cases.",

To examine this possibility, this study assessed directional bias and tracking accuracy in new parents‚Äô perceptions of their partner‚Äôs daily physical attraction to them. Fifty-nine couples completed 21-day diary tasks during pregnancy, 2 weeks after childbirth, and 15 weeks after childbirth (i.e., up to 63 diary days). Both mothers and fathers experienced increased appearance insecurity and decreased sexual frequency and sexual satisfaction across the transition. Moreover, at times when new parents reported higher appearance insecurity or lower sexual satisfaction, they underestimated their partner‚Äôs physical attraction to them, but were not more likely to notice day-to-day fluctuations in their partner‚Äôs attraction. Results highlight the misperceptions that can occur during this pivotal life transition.",

      "abstract": "Purpose Definitions of rape and sexual aggression have varied widely in the research literature, resulting in a wide range of estimates for perpetration and remaining questions as to the factors that may affect involvement in sexual violence. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach The current study uses a sample of college men to assess multiple forms of measurement of sexual aggression and theoretical predictors. Findings Findings indicate that the different measures of sexual aggression (broad vs narrow; hypothetical vs behavioral) are significantly correlated with each other. Additionally, many theoretical predictors (rape myths, low self-control, sexual entitlement, and pornography use) are consistently related to all measurement forms. However, some variables (masculinity, peer support for violence against women, sexual partners, and alcohol and drug use) are only related to broad measures of sexual aggression, and some are related only to hypothetical (i.e. certainty of apprehension) or behavioral measures (i.e. fraternity membership). Research limitations/implications Because of the chosen approach, the results may lack generalizability. Findings do, however, point to important considerations in defining sexual aggression moving forward. Practical implications Results point to the importance of aiming policy and programs at the particular characteristics that most consistently impact sexual aggression. Originality/value This paper addresses lingering questions about the impact of differences in definition and measurement on understanding sexual aggression.",

Hierarchical negative binomial regression analysis is used.Between 1 in 4 and 5 older adults who are married exhibit moderate or strong emotional or social loneliness. Stronger emotional and social loneliness is observed in adults whose spouse has health problems, who do not often receive emotional support from the spouse, who have nonfrequent conversations or are in disagreement, or who evaluate their current sex life as not (very) pleasant or not applicable. Emotional loneliness is stronger among women in second marriages, whereas marked social loneliness is especially characteristic of older men with disabled spouses. Moreover, smaller social networks and less contact with children also increase emotional and social loneliness in later life.Differentiating marital quality and gender provides greater insight into emotional and social loneliness in married older people.",

      "abstract": "Although most sexting among adolescents occurs in the context of romantic relationships, researchers have not fully investigated how relationships involving sexting differ from those that do not. This study assessed how individual and relationship characteristics differ by whether adolescent dating partners sext (N = 269). Adolescents in sexting relationships were more likely to report sexual intercourse with their dating partner compared to those who did not sext, scored lower on measures of self-reported relationship competency, and were in relationships characterized by more abusive behaviors and verbal conflict, as well as less positive support. Boys who sexted their dating partners reported less positive intimacy in their relationships than girls who sexted. Adolescents in relationships where one partner sent more sexts than the other did not report more negative relationship behaviors relative to non-sexters and those who sent equal numbers of sexts. Lastly, relationships with and without sexting did not differ on whether they had broken up six months later. Results suggest that sexting may be a characteristic of lower-quality adolescent romantic relationships, but more information about the sexting context is needed. Implications for understanding sexting as both a normative feature of adolescent romantic relationships and as a risky sexual behavior are discussed.",

      "abstract": "In contrast with traditional considerations, sexuality is often perceived today as being rather compatible with religion/spirituality and morality. However, there may be some inherent opposition between (a) sexuality (thoughts, affects, and pleasure) and (b) religion/spirituality (attitudes, motives) and (interpersonal) morality (dispositions, behavior). The two imply, respectively, self‚Äêenhancement versus self‚Äêtranscendence, disinhibition versus self‚Äêcontrol, and disgust indifference versus sensitivity. We hypothesized that sexual experience attenuates spiritual and moral concerns and behaviors. In three online experiments, young adults were asked to recall a personal sexual experience. Compared to a control condition, sexual induction diminished spiritual behavioral intentions (Experiments 1 and 2), in particular among those with high individual disinhibition (Experiment 1), as well as behaviors of prosociality and integrity/honesty (Experiment 3). The effects were independent of individual religiousness/spirituality. These findings suggest that combining sexual pleasure with self‚Äêtranscendence and moral perfection, even if a legitimate ideal, is not an easy enterprise.",

Working in integrated teams and under the upcoming changes in reimbursement, primary care providers will be able to screen for, assess, treat, and/or refer sexual problems to colleagues within and outside of their practice. This requires a small but significant increase in the team‚Äôs level of knowledge about sex. Sexual problems have multiple etiologies: physical, including hormonal and structural, individual/psychological, and relationship-based. These causes interact with one another and require concurrent, rather than sequential, interventions. Major sexual problem areas include low and/or discrepant desire levels, difficulty becoming aroused (erectile dysfunction in men, low excitement in women), difficulty in achieving orgasm in women and men, premature ejaculation, and sexual pain in women. Working through integrated, multidisciplinary teams, much more can be done for patients in this important area of health.",

      "title": "(290) Exploring the Link Between Conformity to Masculine Ideologies and Responses to Sexual Rejection in Cisgender Men and Cisgender Women",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Sexual rejection occurs when a person‚Äôs sexual advances are terminated by a potential sexual partner, leading to responses that may disregard the partner‚Äôs choice, such as attempts to entice or express resentment. Traditional masculine ideologies (TMIs) could play a role in motivating enticing or resentful responses. TMIs often emphasize superiority, encompassing power, control, dominance, and frequent sexual activity. When individuals adhering to TMIs face sexual rejection, they may experience feelings of inferiority and respond with enticing or resentful behaviors to reassert superiority. Objective Explore links between TMIs and the use of enticing and resentful responses following experiences of sexual rejection. Methods A German-speaking sample of 351 cisgender men and 345 cisgender women (age: M = 28.11, SD = 8.05) were randomly assigned to read one of two hypothetical stories in which participants should imagine being sexually rejected by their partner (rejection condition), or engaging in sexual activity with their partner (no-rejection condition). Afterward, participants had to report how they would react to sexual rejection. TMI was assessed with the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory. Results Compared to cisgender women, cisgender men more often would react with enticing tactics (Œ≤ = .77, p &amp;lt; .001). Compared to participants who were rejected, participants who were not rejected more often would react with enticing tactics (Œ≤ = .43, p &amp;lt; .001). Participants with higher levels of TMIs (being a playboy, dominating women, holding heterosexual self-presentation) more often would react with enticing tactics (Œ≤ = .18, p &amp;lt; .001; Œ≤ = .15, p &amp;lt; .001; Œ≤ = .11, p &amp;lt; .001, respectively). Compared to men with higher levels of TMI (heterosexual self-presentation), women with higher levels of TMI (heterosexual self-presentation) more often would react with resentful responses (Œ≤ = .68, p &amp;lt; .001). This effect was reinforced through sexual rejection, as opposed to no sexual rejection (Œ≤ = -.63, p &amp;lt; .001). Conclusions When sexual rejection hasn‚Äôt occurred men are more inclined to enticing behaviors. This tendency may stem from potential misunderstandings about desires and consent after initial sexual intercourse. Conversely, when sexual rejection does occur, resentful responses are more common among women adhering to a heterosexual self-presentation. Heterosexual self-presentation might align with adherence to traditional sexual scripts in which men are not expected to decline the sexual advances of a desiring woman. Consequently, rejection may be perceived as a direct challenge to their identity as a woman, triggering feelings of resentment. Therapists can apply these findings to better assist individuals or couples in their sexual relationships. By examining how adherence to traditional gender norms and scripts influences reactions to sexual rejection, therapists can help clients recognize these influences and promote respectful responses that honor all partners‚Äô desires and boundaries.

Sexuality in fact includes the physiological, behavioural and relational aspects of human sexual life, which are variously influenced by psychological factors (e.g. sexual fantasies, desire, arousal, psychosexual orientation, and the choice of the sexual object), as well as social and organic (vascular, nervous, and endocrine) factors. From a functional point of view, a normal penile erection may be defined as an erection which permits the penetration of a lubricated vagina without additional assistance. Concerning the erectile mechanism, the haemodynamic changes in the penis require a high degree of central and peripheral nervous coordinated control and an unaffected endocrine system.",

What pleases women is the use of their bodies to satisfy male desires.

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Despite increasing legal protections and supportive attitudes toward sexual minorities (e.g., those who identify as lesbian, gay, and bisexual [LGB]) in recent decades, suicidality remains more common among this population than among heterosexuals. While barriers to societal integration have been widely theorized as determinants of suicidality for the general population, they have not been comprehensively explored to explain the sexual orientation disparity in suicidality and/or compared to more established contributors. Methods Data come from the cross-sectional Swedish National Public Health Survey, which randomly collected data from individuals (16-84 years of age) annually from 2010 to 2015 (1,281 (2.2%) self-identified as LGB). Analyses examined sexual orientation differences in suicidality (i.e., past-12-month ideation and attempts), and explored the role of barriers to societal integration (i.e., not living with a partner or children, unemployment, and lack of societal trust) in explaining this disparity over-and-above more commonly explored psychological (e.g., depression, substance use) and interpersonal (e.g., discrimination, victimization, lack of social support) suicidality risk factors. Results Compared to heterosexuals, suicidal ideation and attempts were more common among both gay men/lesbians (AORideation: 2.51; AORattempts: 4.66), and bisexuals (AORideation: 3.76; AORattempts: 6.06). Barriers to societal integration mediated the association between sexual orientation and suicidality even in models adjusting for established risk factors for suicidality. Conclusions The disproportionate barriers to societal integration that LGB individuals experience seem important contributors to the elevated risk of suicidality among sexual minorities. Preventive interventions should consider innovative ways to foster societal integration within sexual minority populations and to adjust hetero-centric social institutions to better include sexual minorities.",

So, to get more knowledge about this issue, a comparative study has been designed on the sample of 100 individuals of age range (18-25) years with the help of Social Anxiety questionnaire for Adults (SAQ-A-30), and this study had been majorly conducted on the adults so as to examine the Gender differences (male/female) in the issue of suffering from social anxiety. This questionnaire also focuses of 5 sub-dimensions like, Speaking in public/talking with people in authority, Interaction with the opposite sex, Assertive expression of annoyance, disgust, or displeasure, Criticism and embarrassment and interaction with strangers.

Sexual activity of older people society usually describe using pejorative terms as an inappropriate, bizarre or obscene, but these labels are different than reality. Hormonal changes and other physiological changes associated with aging affect sexual interest. Erectile dysfunction is a problem in men increasing with age. There is no evidence that premature ejaculation is more common in older age. Cross-sectional studies showed no difference in sexual dysfunction between older and younger women. Age is not a barrier to sexually transmitted diseases. The most common pathogenetic factors for male erectile dysfunction are vascular diseases. In women, the most important symptoms of sexual dysfunction are lack of emotional wellbeing and a sense of intimacy during sexual intercourse.",

      "abstract": "Pregnancy is one of the most critical periods of women life which can make physical, mental and behavioral changes.These physical and psychological changes may also lead to changes in sexual and marital relations of couples (1, 2).Conflicts and challenges of couples associated with pregnancy and multiple physical and psychological changes during pregnancy reduce quality of the sexual relation (3,4).During pregnancy and even months after childbirth, desire for sexual activity decreases and rate of sexual dysfunctions compared to pre-pregnancy increases.This can cause emergence of considerable turmoil in relations between spouses (5).Couple's relationship quality during pregnancy is largely influenced by their sexual relations and specific set of beliefs and opinions that have been exist around the world which know no borders (6).As the pregnant women report lower levels of sexual desire and sexual intimacy comparing with non-pregnant women (3), stressful physical, emotional and financial factors resulting from pregnancy may have a negative effect on the emotional and sexual intimacy.Attitudes and sexual behaviors during pregnancy are affected by sexual value systems, indigenous culture, traditional and religious beliefs (7).Some of the beliefs such as change of mental image of one's own body (body image), discarding the sexual activity and feeling guilty about sexual relations during pregnancy, decreased feeling about being attractive to the husband, fear of harming the fetus, fear of miscarriage and preterm delivery, etc may have negative effect on the individual sexual response and finally on the relationship of couples, that it cause anxiety and lack of confidence of them (8-10).About 86% to 100% of couples keep their sexual activity during pregnancy; most of women show decreased sexual desire and frequency of sexual intercourse as the pregnancy is progressed (11).Although sexual desire, performance and satisfaction of pregnant women and husbands are unpredictable and may increase, decrease or remain unchanged during pregnancy (7,12), Fok et al showed that more than 60% of women and 40% of their spouse experienced decrease sexual desire and arousal during pregnancy, and more than 80% of women and their spouse were concerned about harmfulness of sexual activity on the fetus (13).Although continued sexual activity during pregnancy, without proper principles, lead to complications for mother and fetus, medical science has not placed restrictions on sexual activity in a healthy pregnancy and the balanced sexual relationship can be continued during pregnancy apart from high-risk groups (14).Results of meta-analy-",

      "abstract": "Research on intimate relationship dynamics around depression has primarily focused on heterosexual couples. This body of work shows that wives are more likely than husbands to offer support to a depressed spouse. Moreover, when wives are depressed, they are more likely than husbands to try and shield their spouse from the stress of their own depression. Yet, previous research has not examined depression and relationship dynamics in gay and lesbian couples. We analyze in-depth interviews with 26 gay and lesbian couples (N = 52 individuals) in which one or both partners reported depression. We find evidence that dominant gender scripts are both upheld and challenged within gay and lesbian couples, providing important insight into how gender operates in relation to depression within same-sex contexts. Our results indicate that most gay and lesbian partners offer support to a depressed partner, yet lesbian couples tend to follow a unique pattern in that they provide support both as the non-depressed and depressed partner. Support around depression is sometimes viewed as improving the relationship, but if the support is intensive or rejected, it is often viewed as contributing to relationship strain. Support is also sometimes withdrawn by the non-depressed partner because of caregiver exhaustion or the perception that the support is unhelpful. This study points to the importance of considering depression within gay and lesbian relational contexts, revealing new ways support sustains and strains intimate partnerships. We emphasize the usefulness of deploying couple-level approaches to better understand depression in sexual minority populations.",

      "title": "Environmental effects on reproductive health: the endocrine disruption hypothesis.",
      "abstract": "R eproductive health is exquisitely sensitive to characteristics of an individual's environment-including physical, biological, behavioral, cultural and socioeconomic factors. The relative effects of these features may vary in different parts of the world or even within a country. For example, in populations with high rates of sexually transmitted diseases or in areas with inadequate health care resources, untreated infections may pose the greatest threats, increasing women's risk of experiencing premature delivery, fetal loss or prenatal mortality. Furthermore, the infants of women with such diseases risk acquiring the infection during delivery and are vulnerable to other complications during the neonatal period.' In societies where cultural norms favor large families, women may suffer health problems resulting from frequent childbearing. Similarly, malnutrition increases a pregnant woman's susceptibility to poor outcomes. In some regions, workplace and industrial pollution, as well as substances that are used commercially or in the home, may pose the greatest threats. Exposure to lead, for instance, is associated with fertility impairments in both women and men, as well as with the risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth; exposure to mercury in certain forms may cause birth defects and neurological disorders. A rnumber of solvents contribute to the risk of spontaneous abortion and birth defects, and some of these substances may be a factor in hypertensive disorders during pregnancy and male infertility. Epidemiological studies have proven the adverse reproductive health effects of some pesticides, and mounting evidence suggests that other of these products also are harmful to reproductive health.2 Both man-made and naturally occurring materials that appear to interfere with hormone synthesis or action are among substances whose effects on reproductive health are strongly suggested, if not clearly established. Recent research pointing to the possible role of so-called endocrine disrupters in a variety of reproductive health problems in wildlife, laboratory animals and humans has engendered considerable controversy in scientific circles. Some scientists question the valhdity of the findings on a variety of grounds, while others have used them to outline agendas for further research and relevant policymaking. As the endocrine disruption debate continues to occupy researchers, it also is gaining attention among the public. During the past several years, articles and opinion pieces about reproductive health problems and endocrine disruption have appeared in newspapers and in popular science, business, news and general interest magazines.3 Public interest groups have produced monographs reviewing the subject,4 and the trade publications of industries whose products have been labeled endocrine disrupters have carried articles and editorials seeking a balanced reading of the evidence.5 A new round of coverage followed the publication in early 1996 of Our Stolen Future: Are We Threatening Our Fertility, Intelligence, and Survival?-A Scientific Detective Story.6 The book, written for lay readers, chronicles the development of the endocrine disruption hypothesis and considers its implications. Much of the popular coverage of the issue has reflected great attention to presenting both sides of the question in a manner that will inform but not alarm the public. Some of it, however, has been less successful at establishing a context for the findings, clearly distinguishing facts from hypotheses, and communicating a measured view of the implications both of what has been demonstrated and of areas requiring extensive additional research. The public has a right and a need to know about issues with a potential for substantial public health ramifications; sensible voices on both sides of this debate acknowledge the need for additional research and risk assessment, clear priorities for dealing with documented risks and dissemination of verifiable information that can help individuals make informed health decisions. The endocrine disruption hypothesis promises to remain a focus of researchand debate-for some time to come. Therefore, without minimizing the importance of other environmental risk factors for men's and women's reproductive health, this report focuses on what is known about hormone disrupters, areas that are being explored and the potential implications for public health and policy.",

      "abstract": "The impact of hormonal contraception on mental and sexual health has long been either ignored or considered to be much less important than the cardiovascular, metabolic and cancer risks. In recent years the interest in these side effects, having an impact on the quality of life of users, has grown due to several reasons. In the last decades different scientific approaches to gain empirical evidence about the type and extent of negative effects of hormonal contraceptives on mood and sex did not result in clear evidence-based statements due to the complexity of the interaction between contraceptive methods and mental and sexual health (inconsistent measurement of patient reported outcomes, multiplicity of intervening variables etc). Based on an understanding of the biological, psychological and sociocultural factors contributing to the mental and sexual health of the individual user, and the individual impact of hormonal contraception, which can have negative, positive or neutral effects on mood and sexuality, an individualized approach is proposed to integrate mental and sexual health into the practice of contraceptive counselling and care.",

While a number of significant correlations were noted between these measures for all Ss, marked sex differences were found. Social constriction and assertion were related negatively for females, but unrelated for males. Similarly, social constriction was related to suspicion in females, but not males. With respect to factors of openness to experience, assertion was related positively to receptiveness to unconventional views of reality, openness to hypothetical or theoretical ideas, aesthetic sensitivity, and general openness for females only. For males, negativism and irritability were related positively to loosely defined ego boundaries and related negatively to deliberate systematic thought, while suspicion and guilt were related positively to systematic thought. For females, resentment, indirect hostility, and total hostility correlated with access to unconscious processes. Physical assault was associated with assertion, access to unconscious processes, openness to unconventional views of reality, and general openness for females, but not for males.",

      "title": "Who is hurting whom: Self-harm in adolescence",
      "abstract": "In adolescence, the system of values, the ways to find pleasure, the experience of being loved, being a male or a female, are put to the test due to the presence of sexually mature body. In many cases, what goes relatively smoothly in normal development can be stressful for some adolescents. Despite that, adolescents find ways to respond and to use their experiences constructively, in an effort and with a desire to enter the social and sexual world of adults. Still, there are adolescents whose experiences are completely different and whose adolescence is riddled with problems. They live haunted by their own fantasies and no matter how much they try to keep the cause of suffering or hatred outside themselves, they inevitably face the experience of their bodies being the source of abnormality and of not being able to do much else but giving in to illness. Crucial change that should take place in adolescence for an individual to reach psychic maturity is the weakening of relations with primary objects, which enables the creation of new object relations. In self-harming adolescents, however, there is inability to give up the bond with the mother - any internal attempt to break this bond brings the feeling of unbearable loss. Basically, the adolescent's relationship with their mother is highly ambivalent, and the feelings fluctuate from intense hatred to intense love. Careful monitoring brings up the conclusion that these are narcissistic personalities with primitive and punishing superego. In this article, we have used the psychoanalytic theoretical concepts as a basis for understanding the psychopathology and psychodynamics of adolescents whose act of intentional and conscious attacking of one's own body is one of the main reasons for seeking psychiatric help, which will be illustrated by presenting individual and milieu therapy of an adolescent girl treated at the Day Hospital for Adolescents of the Institute of Mental Health.",

      "title": "Schone schijn of niet? Een fake good/fake bad onderzoek naar de invloed van een mannelijke of vrouwelijke onderzoeker op de sociale wenselijkheid bij een vragenlijst over emancipatie",
      "abstract": "Sociaal wenselijk gedrag is een fenomeen dat voor bijna iedereen bekend zal zijn, of het nu is om jezelf in bescherming te nemen of om een ander niet te kwetsen. Het aanpassen van gedrag of mening om niet af te wijken van sociale normen komt veel voor, zowel in het dagelijks leven als in wetenschappelijk onderzoek. Veel voorkomende situaties zijn: het niet geven van een eerlijke, negatieve mening over iemand anders of het niet willen bespreken van persoonlijke informatie over financien of seksueel gedrag. Dit gedrag komt ook terug in wetenschappelijk onderzoek naar onder meer politieke en maatschappelijke opinies. Het kan er voor zorgen dat resultaten onbetrouwbaar worden en onderzoek onbruikbaar wordt. Het blijkt dat onderzoeken naar persoonlijke gegevens, zoals stemgedrag of seksualiteit, gevoelig zijn voor sociaal wenselijk gedrag. Respondenten in een onderzoek met gevoelige vragen geven antwoorden waarmee ze een betere indruk van zichzelf denken achter te laten of geven antwoorden die beter aansluiten bij de algemene publieke opinie. Om dit sociaal wenselijk gedrag in onderzoek te ondervangen, is het belangrijk te weten wanneer er een grote kans is op sociaal wenselijk gedrag door respondenten en welke maatregelen dit gedrag verminderen. \r\nEen onderwerp waarvan wordt verwacht dat het gevoelig is voor sociale wenselijkheid, is emancipatie. Er zijn al veel gelijke rechten tussen mannen en vrouwen, vooral in de westerse wereld, maar nog steeds blijkt dat vrouwen op veel gebieden een achtergestelde positie hebben ten opzichte van mannen. Vrouwen krijgen minder salaris voor hetzelfde werk, bekleden minder posities op topniveau en zijn meer verantwoordelijk voor zorgtaken dan mannen (Portegijs, 2010). Een actuele situatie is de verkiezing van een nieuwe Amerikaanse president. Was Barack Obama bijna acht jaar geleden de eerste gekleurde president van Amerika, nu is Hillary Clinton in de race om de eerste vrouw te worden die deze functie bekleedt. Dat niet iedereen even gelukkig zou zijn met een vrouwelijke president, komt naar voren in het onderzoek van Streb et al. (2008). In de publieke opinie was er grote steun voor een vrouwelijke president van Amerika, maar in het onderzoek naar de sociale wenselijkheid van die opinie bleek dat het een heel gevoelig onderwerp is. Ruim een kwart van de respondenten gaf aan zelfs van slag te zijn bij het vooruitzicht dat een vrouw leider zou worden van het land en stelde de antwoorden voor de opiniepeiling overdreven positief te hebben ingevuld (Streb et al, 2008).\r\nSociale wenselijkheid is hiermee een interessant onderwerp om verder te onderzoeken, vooral in combinatie met een maatschappelijk relevant thema als emancipatie. In deze scriptie staat de volgende onderzoeksvraag centraal: heeft het opnemen van geslachtkenmerken van de onderzoeker in de instructie en vragenlijst invloed op de sociale wenselijkheid van de respons? De vragenlijst die in dit onderzoek wordt meegenomen is afkomstig van de Eurobarometer 2015. Dit is een onderzoek dat eerder door de Europese Unie is uitgezet om in verschillende Europese landen te meten wat de opinie is over emancipatie en ongelijkheid tussen mannen en vrouwen. Nederland is niet meegenomen in het onderzoek, wat betekent dat de vragen zijn vertaald alsmede zijn aangepast aan de onderzoeksvraag van deze scriptie. \r\nHet onderzoek is verricht volgens de fake good/fake bad methode om te meten in welke mate de vragenlijst gevoelig is voor sociaal wenselijke antwoorden. De fake good/fake bad methode is niet bedoeld om de eigen mening van respondenten te achterhalen, maar om te bepalen welke antwoorden sociaal wenselijk of sociaal onwenselijk zijn. Wanneer er een significant verschil bestaat tussen deze twee mogelijkheden, is er sprake van een vragenlijst met gevoelige vragen.",

The deep reasons for family disruption are incapability of true love or inability to build or keep it.

Among frequent direct reasons there are increasing independence of women, loss of mutual understanding and mutual trust (as a consequence of adultery and abnormal jealousy), incorrect choice of a partner in life, incompatibility of characters or values. Singlehood is often predetermined by physical disability (group I), passive or negative attitude to marriage, revaluation of freedom and independence values, immoderate requirements to partners, consumer attitude to life, infertility, alcohol and drug abuse, hypersexuality and asexuality.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although an impressive body of knowledge exists about the attitudes toward and correlates of short-term sex, little is known about men's and women's motives for seeking casual sex partners and for engaging in casual sexual encounters. Men and women college students who had entered casual sexual liaisons were asked to describe the reasons or motives that prompted their behavior in a free response, essay format. As expected, men and women generated similar reasons. Specifically, both genders emphasized intraindividual factors (e.g., sexual desire, sexual experimentation, physical pleasure, alcohol use) and factors associated with the casual sex partner (e.g., attractiveness) as reasons for their short-term sexual encounter(s). In addition, however, a number of gender differences were found. Men more than women emphasized social environmental reasons (e.g., status enhancement, normative peer group behavior), whereas women more than men cited interpersonal reasons (e.g., increase probability of long-term commitment from sex partner) for casual sex. These results are in accord with predictions generated by social context and evolutionary models of human mating.",

Most relationships are brief. If the victim is able to form a lasting relationship both she and her partner will be confronted with the effects of her trauma. They face relational and sexual problems. It is difficult for the partner to accept her trauma emotionally. Therapy, usually carried out individually or in groups and without the partner, often fails to prevent the breakdown of their relationship or marriage. The partner's presence in or involvement with the treatment has proved very helpful provided the relationship has possibilities for change.",

      "abstract": "The hypothesis that female dominance inhibits mating whereas male dominance facilitates it, and seemingly incongruous findings suggesting that dominant women take more initiative and are more interested than others in sex, are explored through comparison of feminist and control subjects, ie, women who were expected, a priori, to be located at widely separated points on a theoretical dominance continuum. Principal findings are the following: (1) sexual initiative and satisfaction appear to be greater among feminists than others, (2) there is no difference between groups in frequency of coitus in a present (or most recent) sexual relationship, but (3) there is a tendency for feminists to have had less stable first marriages than control subjects. These findings do permit more than one interpretation: the greater sexual satisfaction combined with marital instability among feminists may reflect their energy and willingness to change an unsatisfactory condition, or, in addition, the more general proposition that personal power is associated with positive sexual response in both men and women, so that there is minimal complementarity along this dimension. Both cultural and biologic factors appear to contribute to the relative instability of feminists' marriages.",

      "abstract": "Normal male sexual function depends on the sexual response cycle, which consists of an anticipatory libidinous state (sexual motive or desire), effective vasocongestive arousal (erection), orgasm, and resolution (detumescence). Libido is defined as the biological need for sexual activity and frequently is expressed as sexseeking behavior. Its intensity is variable between individuals as well as within an individual over a given period of time. Little is known about the physiological basis of libido. Erection, however, is associated with significant psychological and physical changes. This is the ultimate response to multiple psychogenic and sensory stimuli from imaginative, visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and genital reflexogenic sources, which trigger several neurological and vascular cascades that produce penile tumescence and rigidity sufficient for vaginal penetration. The sensation of orgasm is accompanied by two sequential functions: emission and ejaculation. Emission, mediated by contractions of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and urethra, produces a sensation of ejaculatory inevitability and deposition of semen in the posterior urethra. Generalized muscular tension, perineal contractions, and involuntary pelvic thrusting (every 0.8 seconds) usually follow and lead to the expulsion of semen from the urethral meatus. The resolution phase returns the penis to the flaccid state and provides a sense of general pleasure, well-being, and muscular relaxation. During this period, men are physiologically refractory to subsequent erection and orgasm for a variable amount of time. (For further information on normal male sex physiology, see Chapter 3.)Disorders of the sexual response may involve one or more of the cycle‚Äôs phases; these may be generalized or limited to certain situations or partners or may be lifelong (i.e., there has been no evidence of any effective sexual performance, generally due to persistent intrapsychic conflicts) or acquired (dysfunction arises after a period of normal function). Although there are no universally acknowledged defining criteria, a period of persistence over three months has been suggested as areasonable guideline for clinical concern. Isolated dysfunction of the erectile mechanism is the most common problem, but generally, disturbances may occur in some or all of the subjective components of desire, arousal, and pleasure and the objective components of performance, vasocongestion, and orgasm, although any of these may be affected independently.",

As\r\nsexual harassment violates an individual's fundamental rights, the perpetrator may\r\nbe subject to criminal prosecution besides a range of disciplinary measures, up to and\r\nincluding dismissal from employment. Further, such ojfensive conduct has the\r\ntendency of creating an intimidating, hostile and ojfensive work environment\r\nwhich can adversely affect the industrial relations climate in the organisation.\r\nSexual harassment comes within the ambit of gender discrimination. In quid pro\r\nquo harassment, a tangible loss is involved where the superior with authority to\r\napprove job assignment, evaluation and benefits, solicits sexual favours as a\r\nprerequisite of getting such benefits. If the unfavourable treatment was due to the\r\nemployee's refusal to accede to the sexual demands, it may well fall within the scope\r\nof the gender discrimination. Similarly, terminating the victim's employment\r\ncontract merely because the victim could not withstand the conducts of sexual\r\nharassment at the workplace comes also within the scope of gender discrimination.\r\nHence, the issue of sexual harassment and gender discrimination in the context of\r\nMalaysian law and practice forms the basis of this paper.",

A survey of Sanskrit poetry shows that it was not so in the context of ancient India, despite the kƒÅma≈õƒÅstras‚Äô dictates. Parts of women‚Äôs bodies are occasionally likened to certain items of food (mostly fruit and nectar), and can sometimes be drunk, but are rarely said to be eatable. Lovers who are madly in love or suffer from the pangs of separation lose their appetite, and in consequence become thin. In contexts of love-in-union, wine, but not food, is frequently consumed and appreciated for its aphrodisiac qualities. Except in some cases when the pairs of lovers are animals, or at least animal-like, descriptions of food consumption do not lead to the erotic flavour (≈õ·πõ·πÖgƒÅra-rasa), but rather lead to the comic (hƒÅsya), sometimes disgusting flavour (bƒ´bhatsa-rasa). Food descriptions were probably considered improper for poetry, because food had too many unerotic associations, being a favourite topic of Sanskrit ritual, legal and medical treatises.",

      "title": "An examination of disengagement among elderly people in a low income public housing facility",
      "abstract": "Six general hypotheses guided the development of the study: The older person experiences progressive disengagement from society resulting in feelings of isolation, depression, frustration, and despair; the aging person is dissatisfied with the degree of this process of social disengagement; the aging person gains satisfaction by participating in activities which lead to individual growth and/or benefit to others; the aging person lacks capacity and/or desire to participate in many activities or to continue the full-time roles of parent, job holder, and citizen; the aging person would like to choose his activities according to his desires and needs; and the aging person will more likely participate in activities if he is able to obtain adequate health care and has financial security. Descriptive and statistical inferential tests were used to analyze the data. A relatively small percentage of possible disengagement in the recreational, occupational, and family life areas occurred during the individual's life span from age 40 to age 70. The percentage of possible disengagement in these areas increased dramatically in the life span from age 70. Most of the respondents rejected loneliness and depression and felt in good spirits most of the time. A tendency toward less and less contact with others was seen. Statistically significant differences were found between activities which were presently enjoyed which were basically individual and passive in nature; and activities respondents would plan for themselves, which were of a significantly more social nature involving them in rewarding activity with others. Statistically significant differences were found between interest in the activity program available at Northwest Tower, basically recreation and entertainment; and the activities respondents would include in their program, mainly designed for self-enhancement or benefit to others. Statistically significant differences were also found between the number of activities available and the smaller number desired. The findings suggested that the preponderance of the respondents desired to withdraw from major responsibilities outside their household. Of those who desired responsibilities such as occupation, family or civic, they were prevented from assuming them most of the time because of their increasing age, deteriorating health, and lack of money. These were also the main factors operant in restricting their activity and preventing them from enjoying satisfactory ways of living. The majority of opinions as to society's responsibility to the aging suggested that intervention was necessary to provide financial security, health care, and better and cheaper methods of transportation. The findings of the study suggested the importance of more intensive research in planning programs directly related to meeting the individual needs of elderly people.",

      "abstract": "This study addressed itself to the causes attributed to, extramarital sexual involvement, and the association of these causes with sexual jealousy. The results did not show any significant actor-observer difference; in general both spouses attributed their own and their partners' affairs to similar causes. Most frequently mentioned were situational factors and a need for novelty and excitement. Only one sex difference did show up: a need for sexual variety was more often attributed to males than to females. The attribution of marital deprivation and aggression were significantly related to jealousy. Among males, the attribution of a need for variety was linked to jealousy, while among females, perceived pressure of the extramarital partner appeared to be an important factor. Other situational attributions were not related to jealousy. It is suggested that jealousy has a somewhat different meaning for males andfemales, and that this difference is typical for sex roles in general.",

Hypotheses were based on five possible explanations for gay men's marriages: (a) differences in sexual orientation (i.e., bisexuality); (b) internalized homophobia; (c) religious intolerance; (d) confusion created because of childhood/adolescent sexual experiences; and/or (e) poor psychological adjustment. Previously married described their families' religious beliefs as more fundamentalist than never married. No differences were found between married' and never married' ratings of their sexual orientation and identity, and levels of homophobia and self-depreciation.

      "abstract": "Only within the past decade have social scientists commonly recognized the phenomenon of sexual desire as a distinct and vital component of human sexual response. Of the various factors believed to be associated with sexual desire, gender (biological sex) is presumed by many theorists to be one of the most important. Limited empirical work suggests that men experience desire more frequently than do women; however, sex differences in intensity or level of desire have yet to be examined. This study explored both the self-reported frequency and intensity of sexual desire among an ethnically diverse sample of 676 men and women. As hypothesized, men reported experiencing a higher overall level of sexual desire than did women. Sex differences also were found with respect to frequency of sexual desire. Men reported experiencing sexual desire more often than did women and, when asked to estimate the actual frequency with which they experienced desire, men's estimated frequency (37 times per week) was significantly higher than women's (9 times per week). These results do not imply that men always feel desire or that women lack sexual desire. In fact, virtually every participant in this study reported feeling sexual desire on a regular basis. This suggests that desire may be the most universal sexual response experienced by both men and women.",

      "abstract": "Sex assignment of children born with ambiguous genitalia is a difficult and responsible decision based on limited empirical evidence regarding future development of gender identity/role, sexual orientation, and sexual functioning. Sex of assignment and rearing has appeared to be a prognosticator of future gender identity, usually better than the other criteria of sex (chromosomes, gonadal tissue, prenatal and postnatal hormonal profiles). The decision to assign a sex is guided by the prognosis of the ``optimal'' sex for the newborn, of which the elements are an overall sex-appropriate appearance with a stable gender identity; good sexual function, preferably combined with reproductive function if attainable; minimal medical procedures; and a reasonably happy life given the limitations. The limited follow-up studies indicate that this is a reasonable policy, although a limited number of subjects will experience gender dysphoria later in life and will cross over to the other sex. This is more often the case in subjects assigned to the female sex with considerable prenatal or postnatal androgen exposure. Children in this predicament must receive guidance well into adulthood. It may be difficult to engage in sexual relations when the anatomy of the genitalia (often operated upon) is not fully normal.",

Inappropriate sexual behavior often elicits feelings of anxiety, embarrassment, or unease in the caregiver and the result is often disruption in continuity of care for the patient. The cause of inappropriate sexual behavior varies among individuals and careful assessment of the etiology of the behavior is the first essential step in intervening. Nursing interventions focus upon providing opportunities for expression of appropriate sexual behavior while attempting to extinguish inappropriate sexual behavior.",

      "abstract": "While most studies on sexuality in later life report that sexual desire declines with age, little is known about the exact nature of age effects on sexual desire. Using self-reported dyadic sexual desire relating to a partner, dyadic sexual desire relating to an attractive person, and solitary sexual desire from a large (N > 8000) and age diverse (14.6-80.2 years) online sample, the current study had three goals: First, we investigated relationships between men and women's sexual desire and age. Second, we examined whether individual differences such as gender/sex, sexual orientation, self-rated masculinity, relationship status, self-rated attractiveness, and self-rated health predict sexual desire. Third, we examined how these associations differed across sexual desire facets. On average, the associations between age and both men and women's sexual desire followed nonlinear trends and differed between genders/sexes and types of sexual desire. Average levels of all types of sexual desire were generally higher in men. Dyadic sexual desire related positively to self-rated masculinity and having a romantic partner and solitary desire was higher in people with same-sex attraction. We discuss the results in the context of the evolutionary hypothesis that predict an increase of sexual desire and female reproductive effort prior to declining fertility. Our findings both support and challenge beliefs about gender/sex specificity of age effects on sexual desire and highlight the importance of differentiating between desire types.",

Participants provided global, retrospective descriptions of their emotional characteristics at an initial session, and then provided momentary emotion ratings as well as details about the social context in which they experienced their emotions over a one-week period. We predicted and found that sex-related differences in emotion in global self-descriptions, but not in the averaged momentary ratings of emotion. Furthermore, only sex of the interaction partner elicited sex differences in emotionality; participants experienced and expressed more emotion when in opposite-sex dyads. Although most of the other context variables were themselves associated with emotional experience or expression, suggesting that they were emotionally evocative, none emerged as elicitors of sex differences in emotional experience; felt intimacy in the interaction was associated with sex differences in ratings of emotional expression. Together, the findings present certain caveats to the widely held belief that women are the ''more emotional'' sex.",

      "title": "The Universality of Emotional Child Abuse.",
      "abstract": "Emotional child abuse is virtually inevitable in the context of the traditional nuclear family and often has a more detrimental effect on children than other, more widely publicized forms of maltreatment. Clinical, statistical, and empirical evidence shows that normative child-rearing practices in Western culture have pathogenic properties and effects. Parental abuse in the traditional nuclear family often results in the personal suffering, limitation, and maladjustment of children. Manifestations of this abuse include: (1) behavior based on parental hostility such as verbal abuse, sadistic socialization, and lack of respect for a child's boundaries, spontaneity, and individuality; (2) destructive practices including permissiveness and inconsistency; (3) overly restrictive or harsh moral codes; and (4) defenses and addictive patterns which tend to transmit from parents to children. A number of factors are involved in the psychodynamics of emotional maltreatment: (1) parents' ambivalent feelings toward themselves and their children; (2) their projection of their negative traits Onto their children; (3) a confusion of emotional hunger with love; (4) the exclusivity of traditional couplings; and (5) the utilization of the child as a symbol of immortality. The more parents were deprived or abused during their formative years, the greater the impairment of their parental functions. The nuclear family is not inherently detrimental to human mental health, but it has evolved into a destructive institution. Only by dealing with the issues that make families dysfunctional can family life be made more supportive and constructive for children. (Contains 118 references.)

      "title": "Sexual Motivation",
      "abstract": "Across cultures, gender plays a significant role in sexual motivation and the pursuit of either short‚Äê or long‚Äêterm mating strategies. Perhaps the most basic motivation for sexual behavior is the reproductive imperative (though this is not necessarily a conscious motivation). From an evolutionary perspective, men have developed an adaptive desire for sexual variety, in order to maximize their reproductive success. Because the minimum parental investment required of men (a single insemination) is much lower than that required of women (internal gestation), men can increase their reproductive capacity significantly by mating with multiple women. This desire for sexual variety is reflected in findings that men seek short‚Äêterm mates much more than women do, men prefer to have more sexual partners than women do, and men require a shorter period of acquaintanceship before engaging in sex than women do. Under some circumstances, women require a shorter period of acquaintanceship than is typical for the gender. Women with declining fertility think more about sex, have more frequent and intense sexual fantasies, are more willing to engage in sexual intercourse, and report actually engaging in sexual intercourse more frequently than women of other age groups. Evidence also suggests that women sometimes preferentially engage in short‚Äêterm mating relationships. They may be motivated to engage in these short‚Äêterm sexual relationships for a number of reasons, including immediate acquisition of resources and an effort to determine the partner's potential suitability for a long‚Äêterm mateship. It is also not uncommon for women to find a replacement mate before terminating an existing mateship.",

Some cultures implicitly support a man's right to have affairs, or even several wives, while others have a moral stance against infidelity. Severe marital strain may precipitate extra-marital liaisons or affairs. Frequent travel, overwork, sexual difficulty, or accumulating chronic anger all pose different risk factors from those stemming from individual developmental vulnerability. A man or woman using the internet for sexual interest may be spending time on internet sites and finding heterosexual or homosexual internet partners for emotional exchange and/or for internet sex. For one couple, having a normal but oedipally sexualised child will feel like an attack on the same-sex parent, while for another couple the developmental sexualisation of a teenager threatens. Long-standing sexual difficulty or inactivity pose risks. These surface factors then trigger unconscious issues.",

Schizoids are more frequently single, childless and live alone, while hysterics are married, remarried or divorced, have one child and live with their partner and the child. With nearly the same education and intelligence, schizoid patients are more often workers/skilled workers, pupils/apprentices/students or have no profession; hysterically structured individuals, being predominantly women, are more frequently housewives. Nearly half of the most frequent triggering events are equally distributed in both structure groups; these are particularly events signalling a change during development, which, in degree of severity, can just as well be minor threshold situations as serious reverses. With an earlier age of onset, schizoids decompensate significantly more often in \"developmental stages\", whereas hysterical patients are more likely to do so in connection with events of \"love-sexuality\" and those which provoke hysterical anxieties. Of the 15 most frequent events, only 6 each occur in either the schizoids (starting school, puberty, moving away from home, entering into a heterosexual relationship in terms of a casual encounter, beginning an apprenticeship or studies, failure in a test) or the hysterically structured individuals (vacation, marriage, pregnancy/delivery, marital disharmony, extra-marital relationship and severe illness of the patient).",

      "title": "Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID): Befragung von Betroffenen und Erkl√§rungsans√§tze",
      "abstract": "Apotemnophilie, Amputee Identity Disorder oder Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID) bezeichnen das intensive Gef√ºhl, der K√∂rper w√§re ‚Äûkompletter‚Äù nach der Amputation eines Gliedes. Der Artikel diskutiert die Frage nach √ºbereinstimmenden Pers√∂nlichkeitseigenschaften Betroffener und fragt nach Motiven. Anhand von Aussagen von 9 Personen werden Beispiele f√ºr ausl√∂sende Erfahrungen zitiert. Im Gegensatz zu anderen Kindern waren die Betroffenen oft vom Anblick eines Behinderten fasziniert. Im Artikel wird untersucht, ob das entsprechende K√∂rperteil h√§ufiger Erkrankungen zeigte. Geschildert wird typisches Pretending-Verhalten. Gepr√ºft wird, ob es Parallelen zu k√∂rperdysmorphen Erkrankungen (BDD), Fetischismus oder Wahn gibt. Diese fielen gering aus, in der Mehrzahl ist der Wunsch auf ein spezifisches K√∂rperteil fixiert, die Betroffenen sind sich der Absonderlichkeit ihres Begehrens v√∂llig bewusst und hadern mit dem Pro und Kontra. Sexuelle Motive fanden sich bei etwa einem Drittel. Einige der Befragten befanden sich in √§rztlicher oder psychologischer Behandlung; dies brachte den Amputationswunsch nicht zum Verschwinden. Bei mehreren der unter BIID-Leidenden wechselte der Amputationswunsch von einer Seite auf die andere. Dieser Befund ist mit der g√§ngigen Theorie einer ZNS-L√§sion nicht erkl√§rbar. Diese Menschen haben eher das Ideal eines ‚Äûperfekten‚Äù K√∂rpers, der einen Arm oder ein Bein nicht umfasst. Die meisten bewundern die Sch√∂nheit eines Stumpfes und sehen Amputierte als ‚ÄûHelden‚Äù, die trotz der Behinderung ihr Leben meistern. BIID ist keine einheitliche St√∂rung, sondern man muss mindestens 3 Achsen trennen: 1. St√§rke der neuronalen Dysfunktion, 2. psychische Komponenten (z. B. sekund√§rer Krankheitsgewinn) und 3. Intensit√§t des sexuellen Interesses.",

      "title": "Experiences of social isolation and loneliness in middle-aged and older autistic adults",
      "abstract": "Background Young autistic people often experience social isolation and loneliness. Despite social isolation and loneliness increasing in later life in non-autistic populations, no studies have examined whether middle-aged and older autistic adults are at an increased likelihood of these experiences. Methods 428 adults (autistic n = 265) aged 40‚Äì93 years (mean = 60.5 years) completed questionnaires related to social connectedness/isolation, loneliness, and mental health. Group differences and associations were examined. Results The autistic group was less socially connected and lonelier than the non-autistic group. While there were few gender differences in social connectedness, women were lonelier than men in both groups, including when controlling for age and mental health. Social connectedness decreased with age in both groups, loneliness only increased with age in the autistic group. For both social connectedness and loneliness, age associations were significantly stronger in men than women. Conclusions Autistic adults may be particularly susceptible to social isolation and loneliness in midlife and older age. While autistic women were lonelier than autistic men, autistic men may be at greater risk of increasing social isolation and loneliness with older age. This study highlights the need for evidence-based interventions to address social isolation and to reduce loneliness for autistic people as they age.",

Fifty male and 50 female introductory psychology studencs (M.,. = 20.2 yr.) described their actual and ideal selves on 10 specially selected semantic differential scales. Analyses of variance on each scale yielded a significant (9 < .05) main effect of se!f-description.

For both actual and ideal selves men described themselves as mote rational than did the women. There was a significant effect of sex and an inreraction of self-description by sex for the dimension of dominating-submissive. Subsequent t tests indicated men described themselves as more dominating than did women on both the actual and ideal selves; ideally, the men wanted to be even more dominating, in contrast to [he women who showed no shift in chis dimension between their actual and ideal self-descriptions.

Women described their actual selves as communal (tender). androgynous, i.e., neither dominating nor submissive, rational nor emotional, and somewhat agentic (active, tense) ; ideally, the women wanted to be communal (relaxed, render, imaginative), agentic (active, rational), and somewhat androgynous (neither dominating nor submissive).

      "abstract": "Recently in Ukraine there has been a tendency to the spread of crime against minors, which can be explained by a decrease in the standard of living of the country‚Äôs citizens, which leads to the marginalization and degradation of the population. Today, the most resonant crimes are crimes that infringe on sexual freedom and sexual integrity of the person. Criminal statistics show that in Ukraine there is a deterioration in the crime situation and an increase in the number of crimes against children on sexual grounds.The article examines crimes against sexual freedom and sexual inviolability committed against children, the social danger of which is obvious. The author notes that most sexual crimes are committed by persons from the child‚Äôs immediate environment: family members ‚Äì father, stepfather, grandfather, uncle, or well-known persons (for example, friends of the parents). Therefore, such crimes leave deep mental trauma for the affected persons, causing negative changes in social behavior, often causing sexual deviations. It has been established that crimes against sexual freedom and sexual inviolability of the child have a high level of latency, which is explained, firstly, by the age of the victims, who do not always understand that a crime has been committed against them. And secondly, intimidation and threats from the rapist force children to keep silent about the facts of sexual violence.The article notes that such crimes are distinguished by the specificity of recurrent manifestations, as well as certain criminological signs and characteristic features of the personality of a criminal who carries out sexual violence against minors.The trend towards an increase in the number of these crimes is of interest to practitioners who need the results of a criminological analysis of the personality of a criminal in order to develop a set of measures to prevent such crimes. Therefore, there is a need for further criminological research of sexual crimes against children.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual behavior is ubiquitous and diverse. Beyond the sex act itself, sexuality permeates our culture and our daily lives. Therefore, as with all of the behavioral disorders, distinguishing ‚Äúnormal‚Äù from ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù sexuality can be difficult. For example, there are no bright lines separating ‚Äúlow‚Äù sexual desire from ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sexual desire, or ‚Äúpremature‚Äù ejaculation from ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ejaculation. Whether a person even is bothered by a particular aspect of his or her sexuality is significantly influenced by personality, previous developmental experience, extent of education about sex, satisfaction with one‚Äôs relationships in general, and surrounding cultural attitudes about sex. Consider premature ejaculation. DSM-IV defines this as persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration, and before the person wishes it. The definition is deliberately subjective, taking into account the quality of the individual‚Äôs sexual relationship. Paradoxically, this subjective definition may be more reliable and valid than a definition based on the exact interval between penetration and ejaculation as measured by a stopwatch. Thus, while a man who ejaculates within a minute of vaginal entry might be considered by some people to be ‚Äúpremature,‚Äù if he and his wife engage in a half-hour of very pleasurable foreplay, followed by mutual orgasms after a minute of pleasurable intercourse, he could not be considered to have a sexual ‚Äúdys function.‚Äù",

      "title": "Modelli Matematici di Storie D'Amore",
      "abstract": "In questo articolo sono descritti i principali risultati finora ottenuti nel contesto della modellistica delle relazioni d‚Äôamore. I modelli sono di tipo descrittivo e stu- diano l‚Äôevoluzione dei sentimenti di due individui a partire da uno stato iniziale di indifferenza fino al raggiungimento di un regime sentimentale stazionario, periodi- co, o addirittura aperiodico. I modelli pi`u semplici sono costituiti da due equazioni differenziali (una per lei e una per lui) contenenti le informazioni essenziali sul mo- do con cui ogni individuo reagisce all‚Äôamore e al fascino dell‚Äôaltro. Analizzando i modelli si possono ricavare, senza bisogno di alcun dato, le propriet`a fondamentali delle storie d‚Äôamore tra individui di varie categorie: sicuri o insicuri, non polarizzati o polarizzati (tra cui, platonici o sinergici), ... Cos`i facendo si capisce, ad esempio, perch¬¥e in coppie di individui sicuri ci sia una marcata tendenza ad aumentare il proprio fascino nella fase del corteggiamento, o perch¬¥e piccole scoperte riguardanti il partner possano avere conseguenze (positive o negative) sorprendentemente grandi (catastrofi). Coppie di individui insicuri hanno invece una decisa propensione ad interrompere la relazione dopo un certo tempo. Infine, si scopre che regimi sentimentali altalenanti sono possibili a causa della copresenza di insicurezza e sinergismo e che le crisi ricorrenti possono lentamente sparire o attenuandosi o rarefacendosi nel tempo. In conclusione, per mezzo di questi modelli, propriet`a come quelle appena descritte, note agli psicanalisti che le hanno scoperte esercitando la loro professione, sono finalmente capite e spiegate: un risultato di indubbio valore. Tutti i fenomeni sopra citati riguardano coppie estremamente semplici, in cui l‚Äôevoluzione della storia d‚Äôamore `e dominata dalle interazioni tra i partner. Ma nella realt`a le relazioni interpersonali sono molto pi`u complesse perch¬¥e risentono anche dell‚Äôambiente sociale in cui la coppia vive. Successi e insuccessi nella pro- fessione, problemi di salute, lunghi e ripetuti periodi di assenza forzata, esistenza di importanti passioni, come quelle tipiche degli artisti, sono tutti fattori che in- terferiscono, anche notevolmente, con l‚Äôevoluzione dei sentimenti. Per modellizzare coppie cos`i complesse, `e necessario far uso di modelli con tre o pi`u equazioni diffe- renziali, che possono essere analizzati solo per via numerica. Tali modelli possono spiegare anche regimi sentimentali caotici e, quindi, imprevedibili. Finora ci`o `e stato fatto solo per un numero limitato di casi, in particolare per relazioni tenden- zialmente instabili come quelle triangolari. Tuttavia, i risultati ottenuti sono cos`i incoraggianti da far pensare che l‚Äôintero settore scientifico debba, in tempi brevi, espandersi significativamente. Il lettore che desideri approfondire quanto esposto in questo articolo potr`a fare riferimento al libro ‚ÄùModeling Love Dynamics‚Äù, pubblicato nel 2016 daWorld Scien- tific (autori: Sergio Rinaldi, Fabio Della Rossa, Fabio Dercole, Alessandra Gragnani e Pietro Landi).

Vordergr√ºndig ist allen Jugendlichen daher bewusst, dass Selbstbefriedigung keine k√∂rperlichen Nebenwirkungen hat. Bei psychischen Auswirkungen bestehen manchmal nach wie vor Bef√ºrchtungen, dass Selbstbefriediung zu einer sexuellen Abstumpfung und Empfindungslosigkeit f√ºhren k√∂nnte. Doch selbst wenn auf k√∂rperlicher Ebene vordergr√ºndig keine negativen Auswirkungen der Selbstbefriedigung gesehen werden, sind diese Bef√ºrchtungen nicht vollkommen verschwunden. Immer dann, wenn ungewohnte oder unerwartete k√∂rperliche Wahrnehmungen auftreten, werden diese sofort mit der Bef√ºrchtung in Verbindung gebracht, sie k√∂nnten durch Selbstbefriedigung entstanden sein. Wenn w√§hrend der Pubert√§t beispielsweise die Haut am Penis oder auf den Hoden dunkler wird oder Talgdr√ºsenektopien in diesem Bereich auftreten, f√ºhren diese v√∂llig normalen Hautver√§nderungen zur Verunsicherung und zu der Frage, ob es m√∂glicherweise an der Selbstbefriedigung liegen k√∂nnte.

      "title": "Psychosocial aspects of sexuality in adolescents with visual impairments",
      "abstract": "According to the ecological model, all sexual activity results from experiences gathered during the biologically based process of socialization. Therefore, analysis of the impact that visual impairment has on the psychosexual functioning of adolescents should consider not only the functional aspect but mainly the sociocultural aspect. Specific upbringing and education conditions in childhood and adolescence (e.g.: compulsory schooling in a special center - often in a live-in environment, parental overprotectiveness, lack of or unadapted sexual education curricula, etc.) may hinder learning of typical interpersonal interaction patterns and delay one‚Äôs sexual identification process. The limited range of social experiences may result in a low mentalization of the need, and, in consequence, a lack of its stimulation, which manifests itself, for instance, in a lower frequency of autoerotic behaviors among blind adolescent boys as compared to their nondisabled peers. Moreover, a lowered self-esteem and sense of interpersonal attractiveness relating to the lack of acceptance of one‚Äôs disability, awareness of being dependent on others, and negative reactions of people around which are based on false beliefs about blind people‚Äôs sexuality can also make it difficult to build close relationships and form emotional and sexual bonds. A review of studies on the sexuality of blind and visually impaired adolescents does not allow unambiguous conclusions to be drawn about the course of this group‚Äôs development. The data collected are generally descriptive in nature and do not fully reflect the specificity of sexual functioning in the whole population of adolescents with visual impairments as, frequently, the studies were conducted with small samples and did not take into account different types and severity of visual impairment. Also, discrepancies in the findings relating to individual aspects of psychosexual development may be due to differences in instruments used by researchers as well as to the sociocultural nature of the approach to sexuality that is specific to the country where the study was carried out.",

      "abstract": "Breakups do not always mean the end of a romantic relationship. Ex-partners often remain in contact for practical reasons (e.g., they work together, have children), they redefine their relationship into a friendship, and sometimes they reconcile their romantic relationship. This entry reviews the research on on-again/off-again dating relationships (also termed cyclical relationships). Although personality characteristics or relationship dispositions do not differentiate which couples develop a cyclical nature in their relationships and which do not, the evidence suggests they do differ in their interaction dynamics. On-off partners are more likely to report less positive and more negative (e.g., conflict) interactions. They are also more likely to report psychological and physical aggression. They also experience less satisfaction and more relational uncertainty than their non-cyclical counterparts. In post-dissolution phases, however, ex-partners in cyclical relationships have greater sexual satisfaction and more ambivalence about their relationship, which might help explain their repeated reconciliations. Yet, despite on-off partners reporting lower relational quality in general, there are some partners who capitalise on the transitions to improve the relationships. Additionally, the seemingly unstable fluctuations in these relationships might actually denote a stable pattern for some partners.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is perceived either as result or prerequisite of love or as working in tandem with love in romantic relationships. Hendrick &amp;amp; Hendrick (2002) proposed a theory and a measure capturing the lay perceptions of the love-sex link. The PLSS (Perceptions of Love and Sex Scale) comprises four themes/subscales, Love is Most Important, Love Comes Before Sex (‚Äúlove themes‚Äù), Sex is Declining, Sex Demonstrates Love (‚Äúsex themes‚Äù). We examined the validity of PLSS in the Greek context, across two age-groups, young (18-40) and middle adults (41-65), and whether the themes predicted relationship satisfaction and duration. Greek participant (N=631) in romantic relationships responded online to the PLSS and other measures of relationship constructs (e.g., passionate, companionate love, sex, satisfaction). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the PLSS maintained its fourfold structure. The PLSS sexual themes correlated more strongly with relationship constructs than love themes. Young adult women stated that Sex was Declining less than middle adult ones and reported shorter relationships than men. Irrespective of age-group, Sex is (not) Declining, Love is Most Important, and Sex Demonstrates Love predicted satisfaction. Love Comes Before Sex and Sex is Declining predicted duration among young adults. Sex is Declining was the only predictor of duration among middle adults. Our findings suggest that love and sex work in tandem but sexual themes are more important for the Greek population. The study corroborated the validity of PLSS in the Greek context, demonstrating its sensitivity to capture cultural developments in conceptions of intimacy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Disorganized attachment is most prevalent among high-risk populations, such as maltreated children. Recent attachment literature has demonstrated that one of the best predictors of attachment disorganization is an ‚ÄúUnresolved‚Äù parental state of mind regarding a loss or an abuse in the parent's own attachment history. However, although classification in the Unresolved (U) category is always accompanied by specification of the type of trauma that is unresolved (loss, physical abuse, or sexual abuse), much of attachment research has focused on unresolved attachment as one category. The current paper reviews the empirical literature on the parenting outcomes associated with different subtypes of U. The literature demonstrates that parents who have experienced loss or abuse in childhood, which remains unresolved, exhibit atypical care-giving behaviors. Specifically, a history of loss or childhood sexual abuse is found to be associated with more passively withdrawn parental interactions, whereas a history of physical abuse is related to increased negative and hostile interactions. In addition, there appears to be differences in caregiving behaviors between parents whose underlying attachment state of mind is secure versus insecure.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality, which in its more mature, genital expressions includes sensuality as the earliest phase of \"affection\", regards the area of object relations, of desire‚Äîan area that is exquisitely drive-oriented and requires a quota of healthy aggressiveness, and is therefore conflictual. Some men of an advanced age, feeling that their sexual ability is at stake, can be even more exposed to the compulsive risk of regressing to phallic defences by entrusting their own identity and self-esteem to their possibility of performing the sexual act. Mature genital organisation‚Äîthat is, full recognition of oneself and of the other in his or her entirety‚Äîis an ideal for men as it is for women. Perhaps for a woman the problem, although equally as crucial, can be less obvious since she can easily dissimulate to herself and to her partner because she does not have to \"show\" or \"demonstrate\" anything at the concrete level about her ability to enjoy or give pleasure.",

Women are more susceptible to these disorders, showing more severe symptoms and a higher likelihood of chronicity. Suicide rates also vary by gender, with men experiencing higher rates of completed suicide and women having higher rates of suicide attempts. The underlying mechanisms for sex/gender differences in these disorders are multifactorial, with significant roles played by biological factors such as sex hormones, the endocrine/immune system, the neuroimmune system, and the neuroregulatory system. Psychosocial and sociocultural factors also contribute to these differences. Sex/gender differences in the diagnosis and treatment of depression and anxiety disorders remain poorly understood. However, research indicates that there are sex differences in drug response and metabolism and that sex hormones may influence the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy. Women generally have better access to and response to treatment than men, although the evidence for sex/gender differences in treatment outcomes is limited, and further research is needed to better understand these differences.",

      "abstract": "1. The functional sexual phases of four species of Pacific coast gastropods with protandric consecutive sexuality have been investigated with regard to the conditions which control the change of sexual phase and particularly with respect to the influence of association or mating on the individual's sexuality. 2. In none of these species nor in six species previously studied is association a prerequisite for the development of the functional male phase, although isolation of these males after a prolonged mating period usually terminates the male phase promptly. 3. In nine of the ten species studied intimate association or permanent mating of the young male with one or more individuals in the female phase tends to accentuate the masculine characteristics and to postpone sexual transformation by prolonging the male phase. In five of these ten species the influence of association is very conspicuous; in four it is apparent but not conspicuous; in only one is the evidence inconclusive. 4. There seems to be no evidence that the accentuation and prolongation of the male phase by association is due to any masculinizing chemical secretion or hormone which passes through the water from the body of the female to that of the male, as some investigators have assumed; it seems more probable that stimuli received by the male through the sense organs in his penis and tentacles during association with the female are of such a nature as to influence his masculine characteristics, presumably by the mediation of hormones secreted within his own body. 5. Sexual maturity and sexual metamorphosis in these mollusks, like other types of metamorphosis in animals, are subject to environmental influences and can be accelerated, postponed or inhibited experimentally, but the sequence of sexual phases cannot be reversed.",

When heterosexuals have casual sex, previous research same author indicates it is typically the woman who sets the boundaries. If she's not interested, usually nothing will happen. When men and women in the study met, about half of the men said they were interested in having sex with the woman, whereas most women were uninterested initially. So the women in the study basically have little interest in having casual sex at first unless they find the man really attractive and strong. But evidently, a man who gave the impression of wanting to have sex with anyone, anytime, was not what most women were looking for. That could be why men acted way less interested in sex than they really were. Men who are overly eager do not come across as attractive.",

      "title": "Psychosexuality in Schizophrenia‚ÄîSome Endocrine Considerations",
      "abstract": "Numerous features of the schizophrenic psychosis point to an immature level of psychosexual functioning. The question is raised whether this is due to deficiency of sex hormone. It is pointed out that sexual behavior in animals is largely determined by this factor: mating activity can be prevented by castration and precocious sex behavior can be induced by the use of primary sex hormones. The schizophrenic patient, however, usually has normal genitalia and probably excretes sex hormone in an approximately normal amount. Furthermore, castration in human beings seldom if ever gives rise to schizophrenia, nor does that operation have much influence on the psychosis if performed after its development. Although quantitative alterations in the sex hormone titre show little correlation with the psychosis it is theoretically possible that variations in responsivity to the hormones might be a factor. That such responsivity varies widely under different conditions is well known. Dissociation between the somatic and the psychodynamic reactions to the sex hormones is also possible under numerous conditions, e.g., precocious puberty in boys and girls is commonly not accompanied by much eroticism. Dissociation between sex hormone production and mating response can be demonstrated experimentally by the induction of lesions in the hypothalamus. Another theoretical possibility is that schizophrenia might be induced by imbalance in the titres of circulating androgen and estrogen as homosexuality is believed by some to be produced. This possibility is controverted by the infrequency with which administered sex hormone benefits homosexuality and by the fact that acquired sex reversal in man does not lead to schizophrenic symptomatology. Whether or to what extent schizophrenia might be due to qualitative abnormalities of sex hormone production is discussed. Evidence is cited that certain animals are more responsive in terms of sex behavior to stallion-urine extract than to testosterone. Evidence of aberrant sex hormone production in man is, however, lacking. Likewise lacking is evidence that the psychosexual perturbations of schizophrenia might be due to abnormalities in the metabolism of normal sex hormone. It seems probable that the psychosexual disharmony of schizophrenia is not to be ascribed therefore to immediate abnormality in either amount, balance or chemical nature of the sex hormones. The possibility remains that abnormal responsivity to these hormones might account for the psychosis and that successful normalization of the responsivity might be an effective therapeutic procedure.",

The topics covered in sex counseling include impotence (62.5%), premature ejaculation (11.7%), ejaculation dysfunction (13.0%) in case of male, and frigidity (19.1%), sexual aversion/fear (23.0%), and functional disorders of sexual organs (22.4%) in case of female. Frigidity and vaginismus as well as most male problems are within the scope of sex counseling and therapy, but many of the female complaints are psychological and they require marriage counseling. Sexual awareness is both inherited and acquired. 6 weeks after fertilization the presence or absence of Y chromosome already begins to influence both structural and functional development of fetus, and its influence continues throughout our lives. Free creative expression of sexual awareness is bound to clash with social conventions, and that conflict causes stress in some individuals and maturity in others.

      "abstract": "Most men and women remain sexually active into mid-life and beyond. However, sexual functioning in peri- and postmenopausal women, and their partners, is widely variable. Somatic symptoms, psychological issues, partner's physical, psychological, and relationship status are all important to one's perceived quality of life, and may greatly affect sexuality. These wide-ranging influences complicate assessment, diagnosis, and subsequent management of sexual problems. A number of factors influence sexual functioning in menopausal women. There are age-related changes that are unrelated to menopause, which include changes in drive, body image, and general health status. Beliefs about menopause and sexuality impact sexual functioning in women. Changes in relationship status and the physical health of a partner may also influence sexuality. Physiologic changes, directly related to menopausal hormone changes, often impact sexual functioning, both directly and indirectly. Health care providers can play an important role in treating sexual problems and enhancing sexuality in aging patients. Effective evaluation will result in accurately determining the source(s) of an individual's or a couple's sexual dysfunction. Treatment may include the following: basic education about sexuality and sexual functioning, normalizing sexual activity in aging adults, medical management of symptoms or problems that are interfering with sexual desire or activity (such as HRT for vaginal atrophy or in reduction of hot flashes), referral for treatment of the partner's physical or psychological problem, and/or sex therapy to treat a sexual dysfunction or to manage a chronic physical problem that requires a change in a person's or couple's typical sexual repertoire. This paper includes a detailed case history of a couple to illustrate the concepts mentioned above.",

      "title": "Examining Sexual Violence as a Predictor of Sexual Ambivalence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual ambivalence can be defined as an experience of sexual behavior as both wanted and unwanted, to some degree, in a particular sexual situation. Despite ambivalence, individuals often decide to participate in these sexual experiences. There are several related and overlapping reasons as to why people ultimately decide to engage in sexual activity, including a history of engaging in a particular sexual behavior or being intimate with a prior partner. There is also evidence to suggest that experiences of sexual violence are related to sexual ambivalence. The present study explored whether prior experience with both a sexual activity and a partner, as well as sexual violence, predicted sexually ambivalent behaviors. Participants were 932 college students who completed a one-time survey about their sexual experiences. Results demonstrated that women were more likely than men to report experiencing sexual ambivalence, and women experienced more ambivalence before, during, and after a sexual encounter. Men were more likely than women to experience ambivalence during and after a sexual activity. A history of sexual violence victimization was associated with experiencing sexual ambivalence prior to engaging in a sexual behavior. Prior experience with a sexual partner or sexual activity was predictive of ambivalence during a sexual encounter, as well as engaging in a sexual activity despite ambivalence. These findings suggest that there are gender differences in sexual ambivalence, and that sexual violence impacts sexual-decision making. We hope these findings can inform sexual violence prevention and sexual education programs.",

The major factor motivating the sexual behaviour of these women was the overwhelming importance to them of maintaining the dependent relationship upon a male with a total and blind acquiescence to his wishes. Of lesser importance were acting out against parents, a strong sexual drive, the need to prove oneself a woman and a desire, conscious or unconscious, to have a baby. Much guilt was aroused by the use of or insistence on birth control measures; these implied responsibility for sexual activity, the use of such measures was precluded. Contrary to other reports, nausea, vomiting and obstetrical complications occurred with the same frequency as in married women. The course of the pregnancy did not appear to be affected in any way. It was concluded that a weak ego structure was more basic to their behaviour than the unconscious drive to have a baby, or the acting out of unconscious fantasies which often have been assumed in the previous literature. The results suggest that the mild nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is of physiological rather than psychological origin, and that the course of pregnancy is not as readily affected by unhealthy motivation for having the baby as has often been assumed.",

In older women, the major problems are reduced libido, poor lubrication and inability to climax. In males, erectile dysfunction is the central problem. Health problems are the major reason for a decline in sexuality with ageing. Drugs for the management of erectile dysfunction (phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors) and new delivery systems to treat low libido (patches, nasal, gels, injections of testosterone) are revolutionizing sexuality in older persons. There is increased awareness of the special needs of the older homosexual. Paraphilias are life-long and do not necessarily disappear with ageing.

In this sample, SSS were similar across participants with monosexual vs. plurisexual patterns of attraction. However, a few significant effects emerged. Cisgender women with low attraction to any gender reported significantly lower romantic/passionate self-schema relative to women with at least some attraction to one or more genders. In contrast, cisgender men with exclusively same-gender attractions reported higher open/liberal self-schema relative to men with either exclusively other-gender or plurisexual attractions. Novel to this study, 22% percent of participants reported attractions to gender non-binary and gender non-conforming people, and these attractions significantly predicted SSS.

      "abstract": "Abstract The role of personality in marital sexual satisfaction was investigated in 102 married couples, studying three major measurable personality dimensions‚Äìextraversion-introversion, neuroticism, and psychoticism. The results indicated that for females greatest sexual satisfaction in marriage occurred when the male's personality was essentially identical to the female's for extraversion-introversion and neuroticism; for these same couples, however, the males sexual satisfaction was not related to such personality similarity or dissimilarity. Interestingly, for males, greatest sexual satisfaction in marriage was found when spouses were essentially identical in the personality dimension of psychoticism. Thus, all three personality dimensions were shown to be related to sexual satisfaction in marriage. Personality \"fit\" between marital partners would appear to be important for sexual satisfaction, with females perhaps being more sensitive to personality than males. If the three personality dimensions are ranked in terms of their psychiatric illness implications, from extraversion-introversion (least) to neuroticism to psychoticism (most), one might speculate that females resonate to the more normal aspects of personality, relative to males who may resonate to less healthy aspects of personality. These results have not before been reported in marital analyses. They open up a fascinating range of new approaches to understanding the sources of male and female marital sexual satisfaction.",

Research has shown that a high proportion of men with AD develop erection problems, but causes of their erection difficulties are not understood. 3. Research has shown that inappropriate sexual behavior in AD patients is uncommon, although it can be very troubling to the family and health-care provider if it occurs. 4. More professionals need to be trained to discuss sexual issues openly and sensitively with AD patients and partners and to offer useful clinical suggestions.",

      "title": "When insecurity dampens desire: Attachment anxiety in men amplifies the decline in sexual desire during the early years of romantic relationships",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual desire is typically high during early relationship stages and decreases gradually over time. In the present research, we adopted an attachment‚Äêtheoretical perspective to investigate why sexual desire for romantic partners erodes more rapidly for some people than others. We employed two samples of developing relationships (dating couples, N = 62; and newlyweds, N = 175) and examined the effects of attachment insecurities on sexual desire in prospective longitudinal designs. Results showed that attachment anxiety moderated the trajectory of men's sexual desire, such that over time, highly anxious men declined in desiring their partner, whereas less anxious men's desire did not drop. Attachment avoidance also predicted lower levels of initial desire in both sexes. These findings suggest that avoidance generally interferes with relationship initiation for both sexes, whereas anxiety in men interferes with the maintenance of desire over time, possibly because of sensitivity to increasing interdependence.",

      "abstract": "Individuals often report experiences that conform to objective definitions of sexual harassment, but rarely report the subjective perception that they have been sexually harassed. The present research proposed that individual difference factors may mediate this commonly observed discrepancy. It was hypothesized that erotophobia, sexual inexperience, youth, sex role traditionality, repressing defensive style, and need for social approval have a weak inhibitory effect on reports of objectively defined experiences of sexual harassment, but a strong inhibitory effect on subjective perceptions that one has been sexually harassed. Results showed that individual difference factors including erotophobia, repressing defenses, and need for social approval were associated with fewer reported objective experiences of sexual harassment, while the base rate of subjective perception that one had been sexually harassed was very low, and this subjective perception was generally unassociated with individual difference factors. Discussion focuses on individual difference characteristics and motivation to ignore or to fail to report objective experiences of sexual harassment, and on suggestions for further research into the very high base rate of objectively defined experiences of sexual harassment and the very low base rate of perceived sexual harassment.",

      "abstract": "Some important psychosocial factors which lead to unwanted pregnancies -- fear, embarrassment, conflicting priorities, and subconscious motivation -- are reviewed along with the need for nurses to be aware of their own attitudes about contraception and sexuality when counseling clients about contraception. Individuals may hesitate to use effective contraceptive methods because of reported side effects or because they fear the judgmental attitudes of others. Embarrassment about discussing anything related to sexuality or having a medical examination can mean a woman will avoid certain contraceptive methods. Frequently, contraceptive use is subordinated to some other concern, reflecting a lack of maturity, an inability to focus objectively or to plan, to assume responsibility, to accept one's own behavior. Priorities commonly affecting contraceptive use include: the \"nice girls don't\" ideology; \"it won't happen to me;\" \"excitement is taking risks;\" loneliness; and crises and pressures. Although pregnancy may be rejected when it actually happens, it may be desired in part. The desire for pregnancy may be operating at a subconscious level. Additionally, pregnancy may be used to deal with or avoid conflicts in relationships, to ease guilt, or to make up for losses. Nurses counseling clients in family planning clinics can help their clients do a cost/benefit analysis of contraceptive use and pregnancy should it occur. A way to help women explore their available options is group sessions. Nurses should be aware of the goals of family planning work and help each client explore for herself the ramifications of the use of each of the available contraceptive methods.",

      "abstract": "Recent research has focused on the once-married and associations between various aspects of same-sex sexuality (i.e., desire/attraction, behavior and identity) and divorce from a different-sex spouse. In this paper, we theorize that same-sex sexuality could be associated with either shorter or longer marital duration, and we use data from the 2011‚Äì2013 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) to examine the associations between three aspects of same-sex sexuality and marital duration among those who married and divorced once (N=617). Among the once-married/divorced, same-sex sexuality substantially reduces marital duration by approximately 18‚Äì24 months, on average, net of other variables. Supplemental analyses indicate that these associations do not differ by sex/gender but do differ in nuanced ways for individuals who are bisexually attracted (identified) compared to those who report, respectively, same-sex only or different-sex only attraction (heterosexual, bisexual and lesbian/gay identity). Between-group differences in age at marriage exert a substantial influence on the associations between same-sex sexuality and marital duration documented in the supplemental analyses of bisexuality. We discuss our findings in relation to the extant literature, the limitations of available data, and directions for future research.",

In realta la sessualita espressa da pazienti con Demenza puo essere espressa, talora drammaticamente, sotto forma di comportamenti sessuali inappropriati (ISB). Sulla definizione di tali sintomi comportamentali, non c‚Äôe al momento, nella letteratura scientifica internazionale una concordanza di vedute, tuttavia gli ISB comprendono una qualsiasi forma di agito verbale o fisico messo in atto in un contesto socialmente inappropriato. Esempi di ISB sono: esposizione dei genitali in pubblico o nel luogo di ricovero, masturbazione in pubblico e forme di aggressione sessuale nei confronti di degenti, operatori o familiari tanto che questi aspetti sono spesso fonte di preoccupazione, imbarazzo e fatica per chi si relaziona con questa tipologia di pazienti. La ricerca e di conseguenza la letteratura disponibile sui trattamenti e al momento piuttosto limitata. Interventi di tipo non farmacologico (tecniche comportamentali, strategie di distrazione, terapia occupazionale) possono essere efficaci se personalizzate. Numerosi trattamenti farmacologici (con antidepressivi, antiandrogeni, antipsicotici, ed anticonvulsivanti) vengono utilizzati empiricamente, tuttavia solo poche evidenze sono disponibili nella letteratura scientifica riguardo l‚Äôefficacia e la consistenza degli effetti collaterali, tanto che non esistono chiare linee guida in grado di precisare quali siano da considerare trattamenti di prima o di seconda linea.",

The Social Discrimination and Maltreatment Scale (SDMS) meets this requirement but is, as a result, somewhat lengthy (36 items). This article introduces a short form of the SDMS containing only half the number of items but generally retaining the psychometric qualities of the original measure. The 18-item Social Discrimination and Maltreatment Scale‚ÄîShort Form (SDMS-SF) consists of six SDMS stem items (e.g., I have been disrespected, People made cruel or demeaning jokes about me) each of which is rated according to how often it had happened ‚Äúbecause of my sex,‚Äù ‚Äúbecause of my race,‚Äù and ‚Äúbecause of my sexual orientation or gender identity.‚Äù In the SDMS online sample ( N = 528), SDMS-SF Sexism, Racism, and Cisheterosexism subscales were validated by confirmatory factor analysis and were internally consistent (Œ± = .91‚Äì.95) and highly correlated with the original SDMS subscales ( r = .94 in all cases). All SDMS-SF subscales correlated with self-reported anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress (mean r = .29), corresponding to a medium effect size. In all but one instance, related SDMS and SDMS-SF subscales did not differ significantly in the strength of their association with symptomatology. Together, these results suggest that the SDMS-SF is a reliable and valid measure of social discrimination, generally equivalent to the SDMS despite containing only half as many items.",

      "abstract": "Loss of desire for sexual activity is the commonest presenting\n\nfemale sexual dysfunction and often the hardest to treat. Whether this loss of sexual desire should be seen as abnormal or simply as a variation of normal has long been debated. Much literature is available on female loss of desire, considering sexuality for women from various angles. The American PsychiatricAssociation's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), which gives our working classification of psychosexual dysfunction, would classify it as hypoactive sexual desire disorder and sexual aversion disorder.\n\nMasters and Johnson's original ‚Äúhuman sexual response curve‚Äù helps us to understand loss of desire in the context of the normal sexual response. This diagrammatic representation describes increasing sexual pleasure against time ‚Äî(desire for sexual activity followed by arousal, orgasm, and finally resolution. It is important to remember, however, that the physiologies of desire, arousal, and orgasm are separate entities and therefore are not dependent on each other. Women with loss of desire (hypoactive sexual desire disorder) can have good sexual functioning. In essence, they will not initiate sexual contact.\n\n\n\nThe normal female sexual response.

The answer is not clear, and, certainly early in loving relationships, physical arousal closely follows any sexual thought. Initially, we have a sexual thought, which then facilitates the arousal mechanism through neurological pathways. The thought could be anticipation of the evening ahead or a memory of a previous sexual encounter. Women who do not desire sexual activity can operate quite well sexually once engaged in the sexual encounter. Touch around the clitoris and genital area facilitates neurological pathways, producing good arousal, good lubrication, and on to orgasm.\n\nMuch research into sexual desire is being undertaken, but ‚Ä¶",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objective Mates high in physical attractiveness are in short supply, which means that not all people are able to find mates who are sufficiently attractive. Threshold models of mate preferences suggest that when physical attractiveness minimums are not reached, other traits possessed by a potential partner may play a lesser role in mate choice. However, few studies have sought to understand mating decisions when those minimums are not met. Methods In this experiment ( N = 186), participants rated images of (pre-rated) unattractive opposite-sex others for long-term and short-term relationships after learning dealbreaker or dealmaker information. Results While participants did not find targets highly desirable or physically attractive (as a stimulus check), men were more willing than women to have casual sex, and that men and women reported similar desirability ratings towards long-term partners. Learning dealbreakers was associated with less desire for the targets than dealmakers, but women‚Äôs lack of interest was insensitive to mating context, whereas men found the target especially undesirable in the long-term context. Additionally, men were willing to consider a long-term relationship with a physically unattractive partner who possessed dealmakers, but not one who possessed dealbreakers. Conclusions Our discussion focuses on men and women‚Äôs mating decisions when potential partners fail to meet minimum thresholds for physical attractiveness. Future research is needed to explore the magnitude of the effect of meeting or failing to meet one‚Äôs minimum thresholds for physical attractiveness.",

      "abstract": "Female high school students' experiences and perceptions of gender roles and gender stereotypes is largely missing from research on sexual health and dating violence.The aim of this study was to examine how adolescent females perceive of and experience gender roles and gender inequity in dating relationships.A secondary data analysis of seventy in-depth interviews from a larger study on adolescent females' perceptions of healthy and unhealthy dating relationships was conducted.The majority of participants were 16 or 17-year-old, almost 80% self-identified as Caucasian or African American, and the majority were 11th or 12th graders.Five themes emerged: 1) Biology, socialization or what? with subthemes 1a) Biology and 1b) Socialization; 2) Experiences and perceptions of power and control in relationships; 3) The conundrum of stereotypes: challenges, confrontations, confusions; 4) The importance and motivation of sex; 5) Communication, caring, commitment, with subthemes, 5a) Males not wanting committed relationships, females wanting them, 5b) Who cares?Males do not care and females care deeply, and 5c) Role reversals.Public health programs can be strengthened by inclusion of the voices of adolescent females.Programs promoting healthy adolescent relationships should engage adolescent males and females, utilize role models, and focus on collective action.",

Si bien, las conductas en ambas instituciones tienen algunas coincidencias (asedio del hechor, ausencia de consentimiento de la victima y el perjuicio en el empleo u ocupacion), se reconocen relevantes diferencias. Asi, en el acoso laboral, el hostigamiento no tiene por finalidad obtener algun favor sexual, y ademas debe tener una cierta periodicidad o duracion mas o menos extendida en el tiempo. En cambio, en el acoso sexual un solo hecho que revista gravedad suficiente puede satisfacer el ilicito laboral, sin que sea necesario una repeticion o duracion mas o menos prolongada.

      "abstract": "The efforts of bisexual+ people to make their sexual orientation visible are associated with positive and negative outcomes, but little is known about the temporality or directionality of these associations. Using data from a 28-day diary study with 208 bi+ individuals, we found that bi+ visibility attempts were concurrently associated with more positive affect, higher identity affirmation, less depressed/anxious affect, as well as more anti-bisexual experiences and rejection sensitivity. Prospectively, the likelihood of consuming alcohol (but not marijuana) was higher the day after making a visibility attempt, and positive affect was higher the day before making an attempt. Making visibility attempts in contexts that may have been more supportive (e.g., with friends, partners, and lesbian/gay individuals) was associated with more positive outcomes (e.g., more positive affect), while making attempts in contexts that may have been less supportive (e.g., with family, strangers, people who are unaccepting of bi+ identities, and heterosexual people) was associated with more negative outcomes (e.g., higher rejection sensitivity and more discrimination). These findings suggest that the contexts in which visibility attempts are made may play an important role in the impact that bi+ visibility attempts have on stigma-related stress and wellbeing.",

However, this idealization can fade once couples marry and experience routine daily living. Highly passionate (i.e., quickly accelerating) courtships, replete with idealization, likely make partners vulnerable to subsequent declines in marital affection‚Äîor disillusionment. To test this notion, 168 newlywed couples provided retrospective survey and interview information on how passionate their courtship was and brief series of daily assessments of affectionate behavior during the first 2 years of marriage. Results from multilevel analyses showed that respondents who experienced highly passionate courtships reported their spouses as behaving more affectionately toward them as newlyweds, but experienced declines in perceived affectionate expression as the marriage progressed. Results persisted after controlling for possible confounding variables (e.g., age at dating onset, courtship length, premarital love, cohabitation, and conflict). Findings support the disillusionment model.",

      "abstract": "For millennia, relationships have developed between animals and people through the context of work, sport, companionship, or some combination of these activities. Often, a bond between animal and human results, which is based on affection and/or respect. In the research environment, it is not uncommon for a bond to develop between the investigator, veterinarian, and/or animal care technicians and the animals with which they work; and such a bond can be just as strong for a mouse as it is for a dog. Circumstances that foster the formation of these bonds include the close and frequent contact between the researchers and their animals during studies or during training of animals to particular tasks, the long periods of time many research animals live in the facilities (often years), the dependency of the animals on the animal care staff for their daily needs, and the veterinarian/patient relationship, which is not unlike that of private practitioners and client-owned animals. In addition, overlaying the fundamental relationship with the research animal are special bonds that can form with certain animals. Among those that engender a special attachment are animals that are particularly friendly, amusing, or intelligent; animals requiring extra supportive care; animals that show courage; animals that represent a milestone in a particular scientific advancement; and animals that reflect humans' own strengths and foibles. The development of these relationships is enriching to both personnel and animals inasmuch as people who care about their animals are committed to promoting and ensuring the well-being of those animals.",

      "abstract": "Emotional expression plays a vital role in men‚Äôs mental health. However, emotionality is still perceived as a feminine response and its restriction is enmeshed in male identity. Gay men‚Äôs supposed relationship to femininity infers they are less emotionally restrictive. This paper offers evidence and theory that counters this. A quantitative study (n = 300) was undertaken on self identified heterosexual and gay adult men contacted through targeted social media websites. Research questions explored if there were differences in emotional restriction in gay and heterosexual men, and if stereotypical gender characteristics (masculinity, femininity) influence these variations. Constructs and corresponding scales measured conflicted gender roles, restricted emotionality and gender role scores. Findings revealed no statistical emotional restriction differences between gay and heterosexual men. However, there were significant differences in their gender roles. Specifically, heterosexual men‚Äôs emotional restriction was dictated by a combination of high masculinity and low femininity scores (which calculates a masculine category), and the avoidance of femininity suggested by low femininity scores. Gay men‚Äôs higher femininity scores and reduced frequency in the masculine category would (mistakenly) suggest lower emotional restriction scores. The findings suggest that gay men construe femininity differently to heterosexual men, affecting their emotional expression.",

The most frequent cause of this is premature ejaculation in the male. Only the selfishness of the male, and of physicians who are generally males, has made it possible to overlook the fact that such a state of affairs, if it becomes stabilized, must lead at least to functional disturbances. The female sex, which has subjected itself to the male viewpoint in morals as in other matters, has so completely adopted this ideal of femininity that it holds the opposite attitude to be impossible for itself, even in thought. The female sex provides a great contrast to this. All sexual excitement is methodically kept away from girls but also in fantasy.",

      "abstract": "Four males with idiopathic sexual precocity and 14 males with sexual precocity secondary to virilizing adrenal hyperplasia were seen in a longitudinal study of psychosexual development for up to 18 years. The distinguishing psychological traits of sexual precocity in the male so far uncovered are: a tendency to high IQ, as previously reported by Money and Lewis (17) and Money and Meredith (18); increased energy expenditure, especially in infancy; a possible increased incidence (by no means universal) of behavior tantrums and impulsive anger; early occurrence of the capacity for frankly sexual imagery in dreams and daydreams, its content, however, determined by cognitional experience; and early establishment of the capacity for erotic and sexual arousal in relation to visual imagery and visual perception as well as tactile sensation. It is possible, though not proven, that by influencing development of central nervous system pathways in utero, or by a triggering mechanism later in pubertal childhood, androgen may be responsible for these various traits. The psychological maturation of males with physical sexual precocity otherwise keeps in step with that of boys of the same chronological and/or social age. Accelerated social maturation may be deliberately fostered in order to bridge the gap between chronological age and physique age.",

Adolescence is a time of important biological, physiological, neurological, behavioural and social transitions towards adulthood. This period of transition is characterised by higher impulsivity, increased sensation-seeking behaviour, higher risk-taking behaviours relating to substance use and/or sexual experimentation, an increased sense of self-awareness/invincibility, and a higher importance of social relationships involving partners and peers rather than parents and older siblings. Not surprisingly, the psychological stressors of going through adolescence, coupled with major hormonal, physiological and identity development and peer pressure (to fit in with dominant peer norms), result in enormous stress levels that sometimes lead to a variety of mental health disorders, e.g. inadequate coping and/or support structures.",

The analyses of dyadic panel data of adults in Germany including about 1,000 infidelity events showed that infidelity was preceded (but not followed) by a gradual decrease in relationship functioning in perpetrators and victims. There was little evidence of rebound effects in the aftermath of infidelity, with the exception of unfaithful women and individuals with lower initial relationship commitment who returned to the pre-event level of well-being or even exceeded it, providing support to the expectancy violation theory (vs. the investment model of infidelity). By showing that well-being starts to decline before infidelity happens, this study provides a differentiated view on the temporal dynamics of infidelity and well-being and contributes to the literature on romantic relationship dynamics and major life events.",

      "abstract": "\"A woman's sex life ends with the menopause; Sex is for the young, I'm too old to bother with all that; older people are asexual.\" \"Later life sexuality in women is about words, images, ritual and fantasy as it is about the body\" Sexuality in older adults especially the sexual behavior of older women has been shrouded in discreet silence distaste and ignorance (Oppenheimer 2002).1 Recent literature however has demythologised sexuality and revealed that men and women continue to be sexually active well into old age. A recent study from US reported in the New England Journal of Medicine (Lindau et al. 2007)2 reports that 73% of those 57-64 age, 53% of those 65-74 years of age and 26% of those 74-85 years of age reported to being sexually active (defined as any mutually voluntary activity with another person that involves sexual contact, whether or not intercourse or orgasm occurs). In all groups, sexual activity for men was higher. It is interesting that 35% of all women and 13% of all men interviewed said \"sex was not at all important\". It is recognized that leading an active and fulfilling sexual life is related to physical health, ability to function sexually, availability of a partner and perceptions of self esteem and body image (Lindau 2007; Clarke 2006).2,3 Overlying all of these is the personal knowledge, attitude and perceptions of the role of sexuality and sexual behaviors in wellbeing. With the 'Baby Boomer' generation coming of age as 'Older Adults', this presentation will explore whether the discourses of positive ageing have created the sexy ageless consumer as a personally and socially responsible citizen. Is the availability and apparent popularity of adult on-line dating for relationships; gyms and health fads for the healthy body; drugs and devices (sex toys such as the Eros clitoral device, and ben-wa balls); cosmetic treatments (Clarke 2006)3 and now surgical procedures for the body beautiful (Goodman et al. 2007)4 indicative of a need for assistance in sexuality?

      "abstract": "La violencia contra la pareja constituye, actualmente, la forma mas alarmante de violencia interpersonal. Sin embargo, a pesar de la magnitud del fenomeno, existe una tendencia general a restringir el foco de interes a la dimension fisica del mismo. De esta forma el estudio del maltrato psicologico es relegado a un segundo plano, ignorando aquellos trabajos que evidencian la presencia de agresiones psicologicas con secuelas de gravedad equiparada o superior a las de naturaleza fisica, aunque las primeras presenten una mayor dificultad en su deteccion.Diferentes investigaciones establecen una vinculacion entre una amplia gama de sintomas psicologicos y comportamentales consecuentes a la violencia psicologica en la pareja, con varias de las dimensiones de la inteligencia emocional. De esta forma, las parejas con elevadas tasas de conflictividad responsables de la instauracion de la dinamica relacional violenta, parecen responder en el plano interpersonal con registros comunicativos alejados de la inteligencia emocional o de competencias como la empatia, el autocontrol y la cooperacion hacia sus parejas. En la presente investigacion se analiza el maltrato psicologico en las relaciones de pareja (desvalorizacion, hostilidad, indiferencia, intimidacion, imposicion de conductas, culpabilizacion y bondad aparente) y su relacion con el nivel de competencias emocionales (emotividad, eficacia, rigidez e ilusion) que presentan los miembros que conforman la misma. Se desarrollo en el contexto de la Universidad de Extremadura (Espana). La seleccion de la muestra fue aleatoria y se compuso de 1 080 estudiantes universitarios/as. De ellos, 332 varones y 748 mujeres de edades comprendidas en cuatro categorias que abarcan el intervalo de 17 a 23 anos o mas. Una vez seleccionada la muestra establecimos un calendario para la aplicacion de los instrumentos, conjuntamente con los decanos, directores de centros universitarios y secretarias academicas. La aplicacion de los instrumentos se realizo de forma colectiva en una sesion en horario de manana y tarde, durante los cursos academicos 2007/2008 y 2008/2009. Los resultados del estudio confirman la presencia de patrones de violencia psicologica en las relaciones de pareja de los estudiantes universitarios/as. Destacan como subfactores de maltrato psicologico ejercidos con mayor frecuencia en estos jovenes los situados en el factor Indiferencia, en oposicion a aquellos menos habituales comprendidos en el factor Bondad aparente. En cuanto a la relacion entre las conductas psicologicamente abusivas y las competencias emocionales durante el noviazgo, se evidencian diferencias significativas. Finalmente se confirma la presencia de correlaciones significativas en la mayor parte de los factores y subfactores del maltrato psicologico en la pareja y las diferentes competencias emocionales. Los hallazgos del estudio sugieren en terminos generales que los indicadores del maltrato psicologico en la pareja comienzan a manifestarse durante las relaciones de noviazgo, concretamente: trivializaciones, reproches, no empatia ni apoyo, juzgar, criticar, corregir, insistencia abusiva, acusaciones, etc. Se aprecia como la manifestacion mas habitual la falta de implicacion afectiva que imposibilita la empatia, el apoyo y el respeto hacia la individualidad de la victima, promoviendo conductas de monopolio por parte del agresor en la pareja. Asimismo se confirma la existencia de una mayor tendencia al empleo de las diferentes manifestaciones de violencia psicologica por parte de aquellos estudiantes universitarios/as con recursos emocionales mas precarios. Datos que adquieren una mayor consistencia conforme revisamos los multiples estudios que actuan como soporte empirico. En este sentido, el mayor reto es la promocion del analisis cientifico de la violencia psicologica en las relaciones de noviazgo, asi como su orientacion al diseno de programas de prevencion primaria centrados en el desarrollo de la educacion emocional como elemento central para el establecimiento de relaciones de parejas plenas y saludables.",

      "abstract": "Male sexual aggression against children is a serious and alarmingly common social problem. Treatments for the perpetrators have been only moderately successful. Perhaps a reason for this has been the absence of a unified model of etiology and treatment that includes the most salient motivational factors unique to various subtypes of perpetrators. Such a model would have to be sufficiently flexible to account for the various sexually aggressive modes of expression without being unnecessarily complex or simplistic if it is to be clinically useful. Specifically with respect to sexual aggression against children, a quadripartite model is proposed that includes physiological sexual arousal, cognitions that justify sexual aggression, negative affective states, and personality problems as motivational precursors that increase the probability of sexually aggressive behavior. The relative prominence of these precursors is used as a guideline for assessing and treating particular subtypes of perpetrators. Failure to consider the primary motivational precursor during the initial stages of treatment also may account for the limited success of current treatments.",

      "title": "Good is generally more alike than bad in the information ecology: Investigating the case of (the ABC model of) group stereotypes",
      "abstract": "On most if not all evaluatively relevant dimensions such as the temperature level, taste intensity, and nutritional value of a meal, one range of adequate, positive states is framed by two ranges of inadequate, negative states, namely too much and too little. This distribution of positive and negative states in the information ecology results in a higher similarity of positive objects, people, and events to other positive stimuli as compared to the similarity of negative stimuli to other negative stimuli. In other words, there are fewer ways in which an object, a person, or an event can be positive as compared to negative. Oftentimes, there is only one way in which a stimulus can be positive (e.g., a good meal has to have an adequate temperature level, taste intensity, and nutritional value). In contrast, there are many different ways in which a stimulus can be negative (e.g., a bad meal can be too hot or too cold, too spicy or too bland, or too fat or too lean). This higher similarity of positive as compared to negative stimuli is important, as similarity greatly impacts speed and accuracy on virtually all levels of information processing, including attention, classification, categorization, judgment and decision making, and recognition and recall memory. Thus, if the difference in similarity between positive and negative stimuli is a general phenomenon, it predicts and may explain a variety of valence asymmetries in cognitive processing (e.g., positive as compared to negative stimuli are processed faster but less accurately). In my dissertation, I show that the similarity asymmetry is indeed a general phenomenon that is observed in thousands of words and pictures. Further, I show that the similarity asymmetry applies to social groups. Groups stereotyped as average on the two dimensions agency / socio-economic success (A) and conservative-progressive beliefs (B) are stereotyped as positive or high on communion (C), while groups stereotyped as extreme on A and B (e.g., managers, homeless people, punks, and religious people) are stereotyped as negative or low on C. As average groups are more similar to one another than extreme groups, according to this ABC model of group stereotypes, positive groups are mentally represented as more similar to one another than negative groups. Finally, I discuss implications of the ABC model of group stereotypes, pointing to avenues for future research on how stereotype content shapes social perception, cognition, and behavior.",

Overall findings indicated that an orderly developmental sequence underlies the coming out process; however, not all subjects progressed in a predictable fashion from and awareness of same-sex feelings thought behavior to eventual self-labeling, self-disclosure, and final stabilization of a positive gay identity. A number of individual differences emerged: 18% of the sample labeled themselves √¥homosexual√∂ in the absence of any overt same-sex sexual experience, 22% arrived at homosexual self-definitions while participating in a long-term relationship with another man; 23% adopted homosexual self-definitions only after involvement in such a relationship. Fifteen percent of the respondents indicated that they had not acquired a positive gay identity (i.e., were not glad to be gay). These individuals differed from the remainder of the sample on a number of significant measures reflective of psychological health. Significant difference was also found among three cohort groups with respect to age at occurrence of particular milestone events. Findings form the present investigation was explored in relation to both the theoretical conceptions and available empirical data concerned with homosexual identity formation.",

Second, these cultural norms are modified by the migration/immigration experience. Third, these norms, beliefs, and practices are continually influenced by the process of acculturation as these men try to adjust to life in the United States. The effects of the first two domains may vary by the degree to which a particular immigrant community remains socially and culturally insulated from the mainstream community. Conceivably, the effect of home country and migration/immigration would be less significant for those who were either very young at the time of immigration or are born in the United States.",

      "abstract": "Research has shown that child sexual abuse victims are overrepresented among sexual abuse offenders, leading to the sexually abused‚Äìsexual abuser hypothesis. However, a large proportion of child sexual abuse victims do not go on to sexually offend, and such individuals are labeled as resilient victims. Surprisingly few studies have looked at why some male victims of sexual abuse do not go on to offend. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 47 resilient men focusing on their beliefs as to why they had not gone on to sexually abuse others. Results revealed four themes for why the victims did not offend: empathy, morals, lack of sexual desire, or a combination of the previous three. In regard to the process of developing their resiliency, some participants claimed they made a conscious decision, whereas others reported the decision was an unconscious one. The various factors that were reported as contributing to the conscious or unconscious decision (becoming aware of sexual abuse, admitting the experience had happened to them, empathy, social support, and lack of sexual desire to abuse) are discussed, along with the four themes, and the implication of these results for prevention. Finally, conclusions are drawn that the victim‚Äìoffender pathway is far from inevitable as most participants stated their reason for not offending was directly related to their own experience of sexual abuse victimisation.",

      "abstract": "According to the object relations theory, romantic partners are chosen on the basis of similar, complementary emotional needs and that creates a promise on the conscious and unconscious level that all that was missing in the previous relationships of an individual would be repaired through this relationship. However, in any longer relationship the breach of expectations is inevitable (destruction of an idealized image of the partner), which leads to disappointment. The destiny of the relationship depends on the way in which partners will deal with the frustrating knowledge that their idealisations will not be realised, or the level of maturity of the relationship and each partner, which is a test that many do not pass. It is commonly known that divorce rates are higher than ever before, and some divorces become high-conflict relationships in which all emotions caused by the breakdown of the relationship swirl into one common aspect ‚Äì parental functioning. This paper is focused on the couples who experience a difficult breakdown of their relationship ‚Äì with a lot of anger, hostility, distrust, and sometimes with the incidents of verbal and/or physical abuse, accompanied by lengthy and distressing court proceedings. It is noticeable that the conflict has a role of redefining the dynamics of their new partnership relation, and at the same time it serves as a defense of a person who does not have to deal with and face with complex unpleasant emotions that are a part of every divorce. Unable to accept, analyse and tolerate the unpleasantness of the emotions brought by divorce, these couples often use defense mechanisms of splitting and projections. The usage of these mechanisms leads to the dynamics which is characterised by a cycle of harassment, retaliation and failed reparation attempts that in turn lead to further splitting and projection, often with the resulting outcome of a high-conflict divorce. Couples remain connected and locked in mutual patterns of conflict interactions, in a kind of a tango of loving hate in a manner which restricts their capacity to separate on emotional and daily practical level. After presenting two cases from practice that describe the outlined psychodynamic terms and the interactions of partners differently, practical implications which are possible in direct work with former partners will be presented.",

Although ED can exist for only psychogenic reasons, organic ED is almost always associated with some degree of psychogenic dysfunction; thus, nonpsychogenic ED is actually mixed. In the past, when the principal treatment for ED was penile prosthesis implantation, the distinction between psychogenic and organic or mixed ED was of considerable importance. Since many of today's treatment options are nonsurgical, this distinction is less critical. For men who are contemplating surgical treatment, such as penile prosthesis implantation, however, it is still desirable to exclude temporary or potentially reversible forms of erectile impairment, such as psychogenic ED. Erectile dysfunction must also be distinguished from other sexual disorders, such as decreased libido, premature or retarded ejaculation, painful erections or orgasm, and erectile deformity. Of course, any of these disorders may coexist.",

Most of these characteristics were universally present where detailed information about the nature of family relationships was accessible. Before the offence, there were obvious signs in the man's behaviour indicating a deterioration in his mental health, which in turn affected his ability to cope with the separation. Apparently none of the men (with one possible exception) sought treatment for their mental illness, but I could not verify this because most of them had committed suicide.",

      "title": "Psychological mediators of sex differences in emotional support: A reflection on the mosaic",
      "abstract": "* The papers in this issue begin to answer some questions about factors that help to explain sex differences in emotional support processes. More important than the tentative answers these papers provide are the enduring questions they pose. In particular, these papers raise significant questions concerning (a) the frequency, size, and meaningfulness of sex differences in emotional support, (b) the circumstances that lead such differences to be more and less prominent, and (c) the reasons why such differences exist and how we can best understand them. In concluding this special issue of Communication Reports (CR), I want to reflect briefly on each of these questions. Sex Differences in Emotional Support: How Many, How Big, and How Important? All of the studies appearing in this issue of CR report statistically significant sex differences in varied aspects of emotional support. But one should not conclude from this that sex differences in emotional support are generally widespread or large. Because the editorial focus of this special issue centered on psychological mediators of sex differences in emotional support, a prerequisite for a paper's inclusion was the existence of some statistically significant sex difference in a relevant dependent variable. After all, it doesn't make sense to examine potential mediators when there is no relationship to mediate! Although this selection principle makes sense on editorial grounds, it necessarily precluded consideration of whether sex differences in emotional support are either typical or sizeable. Importantly, many studies have not found statistically reliable sex differences in key emotional support variables (e.g., Cutrona & Suhr, 1994; Goldsmith & Dun, 1997), even when research designs have permitted detection of differences that might exist (e.g., large samples providing high levels of statistical power; highly reliable assessments minimizing measurement error). Indeed, there is good reason for believing that, at least with respect to emotional support, men and women exhibit more, and larger, similarities than differences (see the discussions by Kunkel & Burleson, 1998; Vangelisti, 1997). Finding no discernable sex differences in specific aspects of emotional support may be as theoretically and practically significant as the detection of large, reliable differences. As just one example of this, Susanne Jones and I recently found that the effectiveness of comforting messages exhibiting different levels of person centeredness, as delivered by peer helpers in actual interactions, was not qualified by the sex of either the helper or recipient (Jones & Burleson, in preparation). This finding, in conjunction with others (e.g., Kunkel & Burleson, 1999), suggests that both men and women are most comforted by messages that help them explicitly articulate and elaborate their distressed feelings, and this remains true regardless of the sex of the helper. Such findings have obvious practical and theoretical import, precisely because there are no reliable sex differences. For example, they indicate that men and women should not be given intercultural communication training in how to comfort members of the opposite sex because both sexes are most comforted by the same types of messages. We should, then, avoid becoming so enamored with sex differences that we overlook stronger, more interesting, and more important similarities (Vangelisti, 1997; Wood & Dindia, 1998). However, it is also the case that when sex differences in emotional support are detected they are quite consistent in their direction. Specifically, sex differences for varied aspects of emotional support consistently indicate that women are more supportive than men. For example, the five studies included in this special issue of CR indicate that, compared to men, women: (a) produce comforting messages exhibiting higher levels of person centeredness (Samter; MacGeorge et al. ‚Ä¶",

It encompasses various terms such as alcohol abuse, dependence, addiction, and colloquially, alcoholism. Research has consistently highlighted the significant toll that alcoholism can take on the spouses of individuals struggling with alcohol addiction. Living with a spouse who struggles with alcoholism can be incredibly challenging and emotionally taxing. It can have significant impacts on one's mental and physical health, as well as on the dynamics of the relationship and family life. The typologies of wives of alcoholics categorize the various coping and behavioral patterns these individuals may adopt in response to their spouse's alcoholism, including enabling the behavior, adopting a victim mindset, compensating by being overly competent (the hero), displaying oppositional behavior (the rebel), or withdrawing emotionally and socially to protect themselves. The dynamics of alcoholism in a marriage can erode trust, communication, and intimacy, often leading to a breakdown of the relationship if left unaddressed. Seeking professional help, such as therapy or support groups, can be crucial for both spouses to navigate the challenges of alcoholism and work towards healing and recovery, either individually or as a couple.",

      "abstract": "The topic of sexuality and intimacy is beginning to receive more attention within the current recovery-oriented framework in mental health, but the experiences of sexuality and intimacy among people with SMI have not been extensively researched yet. This lack of attention can be found in clinical practice as well. Even though some people ... read more with SMI report (temporarily) decreased needs in the field of sexuality and intimacy due to mental health problems, most have the same desires when it comes to sexuality and intimacy as the general population. However, the amount of unmet needs in these fields seems to be much higher. The research described in this dissertation focusses on the experience of sexuality, intimacy among people with severe mental illnesses, and thus entails studies that enhance knowledge on the barriers that people with SMI encounter when navigating their sexual and romantic lives. Personal stories, examples, experiences and views of those encountering these barriers have helped deepen the understanding of these factors. The most important conclusions are: ‚Ä¢ People with SMI have sexuality and intimacy needs that are largely similar to those observed in the general population. ‚Ä¢ However, people with SMI experience barriers for sexuality and intimacy, some of which were (indirectly) related to having a SMI. ‚Ä¢ These barriers are: self-stigma, sexual trauma, diminished social skills, lower (sexual) self-esteem, symptoms and psychotropic side-effects. ‚Ä¢ In some, these barriers lead to a need for care. Childhood sexual abuse is associated with higher needs for care concerning sexuality and intimacy in adulthood. ‚Ä¢ Needs for care concerning sexuality and intimacy are rarely met. ‚Ä¢ Most clients welcome a conversation about sexuality and intimacy. ‚Ä¢ Group interventions focused on sharing experiences and learning from each other are valuable, especially in young adults. ‚Ä¢ Further quantitative explorations showed that intimacy is mainly associated with selfstigma. Sexual disfunctioning is associated with sexual self-esteem and psychotropic side effects, while sexual autonomy is associated with sexual trauma and sexual selfesteem. ‚Ä¢ Sexual trauma may increase the risk of having a sexual dysfunction.

      "title": "Societal influences on attribution: Blaming some victims more than others.",
      "abstract": "Researchers have paid little attention to societal (as opposed to social) influences on attribution. The two present studies demonstrate the influence of sex, and its societal definition as gender, on attributions in the context of victimization. Across several types of assault and in different situations, more blame was attributed to female victims than to male victims. The type of blame attributed also varied by sex of the victim: (a) more blame was attributed to the character of female victims than to that of male victims, and (b) more blame was attributed to the behavior of male victims than to that of female victims. These attributional patterns were particularly strong among respondents with traditional gender role attitudes. Implications of these findings for the major attributional approaches are reviewed. The socioeconomic status, race, or sex of an actor may influence attributions about the behavior of that individual. The application for unemployment benefits by middle-income persons or by whites (both increasingly common phenomena), for example, may be attributed to different causes than applications for such benefits by members of the workingclass or by blacks. These different attributions, in turn, may influence the outcomes of such applications, or the self-esteem of the applicants and their families. Each of these factors‚Äîsocioeconomic status, race, and sex‚Äî is the basis of a societal stratification system. The influence of such variables on the process of attribution, though not entirely ignored, has received little theoretical or empirical attention. Thorough consideration of the importance of societal and other omitted variables for the many theories of attribution of cause, blame, responsibility, or personal traits is a major theoretical endeavor.

      "abstract": "Orgasm is a \"goal\" of much sexual activity, and a source of potentially intense pleasure and fulfillment, yet can be fraught with difficulty or distress. Relatively little social science research has explored people's experiences around, and their meanings related to, orgasm, and indeed other sexual pleasures, especially with young adults. This study aimed to provide a rich exploration of the meanings associated with orgasm and sexual pleasure during sex with a partner, to understand the social patterning of orgasm experience. A qualitative survey was used to collect data from 119 sexually experienced British young adults (81% women, mean age 20, 92% heterosexual). A descriptive form of thematic analysis that prioritizes participants' meanings and experiences was used to identify and explore patterns in the data. Five main themes are reported here: (a) orgasm: the purpose and end of sex; (b) \"it's more about my partner's orgasm\"; (c) orgasm: the ultimate pleasure?; (d) orgasm is not a simple physiological response; and (e) faking orgasm is not uncommon. These (mostly not gendered) themes demonstrate the complex and contradictory meanings around orgasm, and reveal meaning to be dependent on situation and context. However, they do resonate strongly with widespread discourses of sexuality that prioritize heterosexual coitus, orgasm, and orgasm reciprocity.",

      "title": "The Influence of Biology and Commitment Beliefs on Jealousy Responses",
      "abstract": "Research on biological sex differences in romantic jealousy suggests that males are more upset by sexual infidelity and females are more upset by emotional infidelity. Researchers identify two types of jealousy (i.e., sexual and emotional) and two types of commitment (i.e., sexual exclusivity and relational duration). The type of jealousy experienced may be a rational or emotional response to different commitment beliefs rather than dependent on biological sex. A sample of 230 college students completed various measures of commitment and jealousy as part of an online survey. People who valued sexually exclusive relationships were more distressed by sexual infidelity. People who valued long-term relationships were more distressed by emotional infidelity. Commitment beliefs predict jealousy responses irrespective of biological sex. Relationships, whether they are with family, friends, or a significant other, have a major effect on a person‚Äôs mood and general well being. If people have satisfying relationships, they are happy. If people‚Äôs relationships are not satisfying, then they may become sad or depressed (Aro, Nyberg, Absetz, Henriksson, & Loennqvist, 2001). Because relationships have an impact on a person‚Äôs well being, it is important to understand the dimensions of relationships. Commitment beliefs and jealous responses are two aspects of relationships that can affect a person‚Äôs mood and well-being. Several theories have attempted to explain the differences between people in their commitment beliefs and jealous responses. Evolutionary theory (Buss, Larsen, Weston, & Semmolworth, 1992) credits fertilization with the basis of jealousy differences between females and males. Sociocultural theories (e.g., interdependence theory and the doubleshot hypothesis), however, credit relationship beliefs for differences in commitment between people, independent of biological sex. The current study explores evolutionary and social theories as possible explanations for differences in commitment beliefs and jealous responses.",

      "title": "Gender Dysphoria",
      "abstract": "Persons who experience persistent, clinically significant distress about their anatomic sex or assigned gender role have been recognized since antiquity. In DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013), these individuals can be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in adults appear in Box 39- . Persons with presentations that meet diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria in DSM-5 would have received a different DSM diagnosis‚Äîusually either transsexualism or gender identity disorder (GID)‚Äîprior to 2013. Consequently, some expert recommendations and empirical studies relevant to the treatment of adults with gender dysphoria refer instead to persons with transsexualism or GID. A brief explanation of these terms is therefore indicated. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gender Dysphoria in Adolescents and Adults 302.85 F64.1 A marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and assigned gender, of at least 6 months' duration, as manifested by at least two of the following: A marked incongruence between one's experienced/expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics (or in young adolescents, the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). A strong desire to be rid of one's primary and/or secondary sex characteristics because of a marked incongruence with one's experienced/expressed gender (or in young adolescents, a desire to prevent the development of the anticipated secondary sex characteristics). A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender. A strong desire to be of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one's assigned gender). A strong desire to be treated as the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one's assigned gender). A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender (or some alternative gender different from one's assigned gender). The condition is associated with clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Specify if: With a disorder of sex development (e.g., a congenital adrenogenital disorder such as 255.2 [E25.0] congenital adrenal hyperplasia or 259.50 [E34.50] androgen insensitivity syndrome). Coding note: Code the disorder of sex development as well as gender dysphoria. Specify if: Posttransition: The individual has transitioned to full-time living in the desired gender (with or without legalization of gender change) and has undergone (or is preparing to have) at least one cross-sex medical procedure or treatment regimen‚Äînamely, regular cross-sex hormone treatment or gender reassignment surgery confirming the desired gender (e.g., penectomy, vaginoplasty in a natal male; mastectomy or phalloplasty in a natal female). When disorders involving distress about anatomic sex or assigned gender role first entered DSM in 1980 (DSM-III; American Psychiatric Association 1980), they appeared under the superordinate category gender identity disorders. Their defining feature was said to be \"an incongruence between anatomic sex and gender identity\" (p. 261), where gender identity referred to a person's fundamental sense of being male or female. Adults with persistent discomfort about their anatomic sex and a desire to live as members of the opposite sex could receive a diagnosis of transsexualism in DSM-III and DSM-III-R (American Psychiatric Association 1987). They can still receive this diagnosis in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10; World Health Organization 1992). Males and females with transsexualism are often referred to as male-to-female (MtF) and female-to-male (FtM) transsexuals. In DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 2000), the diagnosis of transsexualism was replaced by the diagnosis of gender identity disorder ; as a result, this term applied to both the superordinate category and a specific diagnosis within that category. It has long been recognized that not all adults with GID (the superordinate category) have presentations that meet full diagnostic criteria for transsexualism or GID (the specific diagnosis). Accordingly, both ICD and DSM have consistently provided one or more residual diagnoses for persons with nonclassical or nontranssexual types of GID. These diagnoses could be applied to individuals whose presentations fulfilled some but not all diagnostic criteria for transsexualism or GID (i.e., who were subthreshold for these diagnoses) or who had alternative gender identities but did not identify as the opposite sex (e.g., men who identified as eunuchs and sought only castration, not complete sex reassignment; Johnson et al. 2007). In the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria, the new term experienced/expressed gender ‚Äîa neologism for gender identity ‚Äîencompasses a wider range of identities than just the opposite sex. Consequently, it appears that many persons who would previously have been diagnosed with residual or nontranssexual forms of GID would now be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. DSM-5 nevertheless includes two residual diagnoses for persons whose presentations do not meet full criteria for gender dysphoria: other specified gender dysphoria and unspecified gender dysphoria. The DSM-5 descriptions of these diagnoses appear in Boxes 39- and 39- . DSM-5 Other Specified Gender Dysphoria 302.6 F64.8 This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria . The other specified gender dysphoria category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for gender dysphoria . This is done by recording \"other specified gender dysphoria\" followed by the specific reason (e.g., \"brief gender dysphoria\"). An example of a presentation that can be specified using the \"other specified\" designation is the following: The current disturbance meets symptom criteria for gender dysphoria, but the duration is less than 6 months. DSM-5 Unspecified Gender Dysphoria 302.6 F64.9 This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria . The unspecified gender dysphoria category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for gender dysphoria, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis. Because the diagnosis of gender dysphoria is so broadly encompassing, it is useful to distinguish between adults with gender dysphoria who experience transsexualism and those who experience nontranssexual forms of gender dysphoria. These terms are relatively unambiguous and remain widely used both in clinical settings and in the scientific literature (e.g., Hembree et al. 2009), even though transsexualism has not been a formal DSM diagnosis since 1994. The term transgender can be used to denote persons with significant cross-gender identification or gender-atypical feelings or behaviors, whether or not they meet diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria.",

In a recent national poll, 95 percent of Americans professed a belief in God, and 67 to 75 percent of respondents reported that they pray on a daily basis [1]. Research findings showed that although regular attendance at church was not necessary, a strong personal importance placed on spirituality or religion was most protective against major depression in people who were at high familial risk. Religious beliefs serve an important function in the daily lives and attitudes of most of us. Religious activity embraces beliefs, experiences, and practice. Conversely, a person‚Äôs fervent religious practices can also signify other, gloomier facets of his or her mental health. The term used to define such a case is hyperreligiosity in the case of religious beliefs. The question of excess or hyper becomes a factor when the religion begins adversely affecting people‚Äôs social behavior and their ability to function rationally. A number of potential genetic and pathophysiological causes of violence and aggression have been investigated over recent years. Research now points to the discovery that impulsive aggression and violence arise as a consequence of defective emotion regulation circuitry in the brain.",

      "title": "Western Sport and Spiritualism",
      "abstract": "Abstract Sport activity of achievement-oriented (professional, Olympic, spectacular character) is first of all exposition of rivalry and striving for variously understood sports success (resulting from measurable or discretionary criteria). It refers to winning a competition or taking another expected place as well as to other forms of satisfaction, such as financial gratification or social (political, ethnic, professional) recognition. Spirituality is here neither an aim, nor an expected value - it constitutes rather an additional or redundant quality. A competitor focuses his/her attention first of all on the main aim assumed in planned or current rivalry. Emotional sensations which are experienced by athletes before, during or after competitions testify to mental and emotional stress which accompanies sports combat. It is also difficult to associate spirituality or spiritualism with sport for all - like, for example, that of health-oriented character - sport of the disabled, physical education, sport of playful character or physical recreation. That difficulty results from the fact that neither spiritualism, nor spirituality inspires for physical activity in the abovementioned fields; neither spiritualism, nor spirituality is the outcome of activity in the realm of sport for all. Exceptions are constituted by ancient Olympic Games as well as by some experiences connected with recreational forms of tourism mediated through achievement-oriented sport (also by pre-Columbian Native American societies and Maoris aboriginal population of New Zealand). For example Hellenic Olympic Games were a highly spiritualized form of sports rivalry - including also rivalry in the field of art, and especially in the field of theatre. They were one of numerous forms of religious cult - of worshipping chosen gods from the Olympic pantheon. On the other hand, during mountain hiking and mountain climbing there can appear manifestations of deepened spirituality characteristic for the object of spiritualization of non-religious, quasi-religious or strictly religious qualities. I would like to explain - at the end of this short abstract - that spiritualism (which should not be confused with spiritism) is - generally speaking - first of all a philosophical term assuming, in ontological and axiological sense, that spiritual reality, self-knowledge, consciousness or mental experiences are components of the human being - components of a higher order having priority over matter. They constitute, in the anthropological context, beings of a higher order than the body. Spiritualism according to its popular interpretation means spirituality. Qualities which are ascribed to that notion in particular societies can be determined on the basis of empirically oriented sociological research. They make it possible to determine various ways of interpreting and understanding that notion as well as views or attitudes connected with it.",

      "title": "Sex differences in unipolar depression: Evidence and theory.",
      "abstract": "A large body of evidence indicates that women are more likely than men to show unipolar depression. Five classes of explanations for these sex differences are examined and the evidence for each class is reviewed. Not one of these explanations adequately accounts for the magnitude of the sex differences in depression. Finally, a response set explanation for the sex differences in depression is proposed. According to this explanation, men are more likely to engage in distracting behaviors that dampen their mood when depressed, but women are more likely to amplify their moods by ruminating about their depressed states and the possible causes of these states. Regardless of the initial source of a depressive episode (i.e., biological or psychological) men's more active responses to their negative moods may be more adaptive on average than women's less active, more ruminative responses. The epidemiology of a disorder can provide important clues to its etiology. When a disorder only strikes persons from one geographical region, one social class, or one gender, we can ask what characteristics of the vulnerable group might be making its members vulnerable. A frequent finding in epidemiological studies of mental disorders is that women are more prone to unipolar affective disorders than are men (Boyd & Weissman, 1981; Weissman & Klerman, 1977). A number of different explanations have been proposed to account for women's greater vulnerability to depression. Previous reviews of these explanations (e.g., Weissman & Klerman, 1977) have been quite brief and uncritical. In this article, the evidence for sex differences in unipolar depression first is summarized, then the most prominent explanations proposed for these sex differences are discussed in detail. These explanations include those attributing the differences to the response biases of subjects, as well as biological, psychoanalytic, sex role, and learned helplessness explanations. Although most of the proposed explanations for sex differences in depression have received some empirical support, not one of them has been definitively supported and not one as yet accounts for the magnitude of sex differences in depression. In the final section of this article it is suggested that differences in the ways that men and women respond to their own depressive episodes, whatever the origin of these episodes, may be an important source of the sex differences observed in depression.",

However, research is divided regarding whether, and how, desire is experienced as a relationship progresses. The authors examined relationship duration and its effect on sexual desire in a sample of 170 undergraduate men and women between the ages of 18 and 25 years. Hierarchical multiple regression results indicated that women's sexual desire was significantly and negatively predicted by relationship duration after controlling for age, relationship satisfaction, and sexual satisfaction. Men's sexual desire, however, was not significantly affected by the duration of their romantic relationships. These findings suggest that men and women may have different experiences with sexual desire as relationships progress and that sexual desire might be affected by different factors depending on one's gender. Possible reasons for these results are suggested and therapeutic implications are discussed.",

In both cases there are chronic perceptual, cognitive, and social dsyfunctions that are associated with chronic changes in neuronal structure and connectivity. Deprivation can be more subtle too, such as being raised in a low socioeconomic environment, which is often associated with poverty. Such experience is especially detrimental to language development, which in turn, limits educational opportunities. Unfortunately, the effects of some forms of socioemotional deprivation are often difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate. In contrast, adding sensory or social experiences can enhance behavioral functions. For example, placing animals in environments that are cognitively, motorically, and/or socially more complex than standard laboratory housing is associated with neuronal changes that are correlated with superior functions. Enhanced sensory experiences can be relatively subtle, however. For example, tactile stimulation with a soft brush for 15 minutes, three times daily for just two weeks in infant rats leads to permanent improvement in a wide range of psychological functions, including motoric, mnemonic, and other cognitive functions. Both complex environments and sensory stimulation can also reverse the negative effects of many other experiences. Thus, tactile stimulation accelerates discharge from hospital for premature human infants and stimulates recovery from stroke in both infant and adult rats. In sum, brain and behavioral functions are exquisitely influenced by manipulation of sensory experiences, especially in development.",

      "abstract": "Hostile sexism (HS) expresses attitudes that characterize women who challenge men's power as manipulative and subversive. Does endorsing HS negatively bias perceptions of women's behavior and, in turn, create animosity within intimate relationships? Committed heterosexual couples reported on their own behavior and perceptions of their partner's behavior five times across a year (Study 1) and daily for 3 weeks (Study 2). Men who more strongly endorsed HS perceived their partner's behavior as more negative than was justified by their partner's reports. Furthermore, more negative perceptions of the partner's behavior mediated the links between men's HS and feeling more manipulated by their partners, behaving more negatively toward their partners, and lower relationship quality. This indicates that men who endorse HS behave more negatively toward intimate partners and experience lower relationship satisfaction because their antagonistic attitudes toward women in general permeate the way they perceive those partners.",

      "abstract": "The central premise is that a significant amount of sex offending stems from unusual or inappropriate sexual preferences that appear in early adolescence, are relatively stable, and immutable. In those ways, they are like more ordinary sexual preferences, generating sexual impulses that are insistent. Individuals are strongly tempted to act on them, alternatives to satisfying them are unfulfilling, and complete long-term control of such impulses is unlikely. Yet, since individuals with sexual preferences for inappropriate objects or activities are neither morally nor legally permitted to act on them, they find themselves in a terrific bind. The public is, to some extent, correct to not trust the individuals with such preferences and to attempt to monitor or control them. However, most such efforts appear ineffective and counterproductive. Recidivist sex offenders are particularly worrisome. The possibility of voluntary castration for such offenders, in lieu of preventive detention or other more restrictive measures, is explored.",

      "abstract": "What is the nature of eroticism? What is the role of eroticism in sexual interaction? The answers to these questions are explored as are their implications for the understanding and treatment of sexual desire problems. To the extent that sexuality has typically been defined in the sex therapy literature in terms of a pattern of physiological and observable, behavioral events, the phenomenology of erotic experience has been overlooked. Eroticism involves the intent to contact and arouse another. The erotic experience is to be found with a partner who values enhancing sexual pleasure for each other for its own sake rather than as a means to a goal, for example, tension release, orgasm, intercourse. The erotic encounter involves the shared exploration of sexual wishes, dreams, and fantasies. It is argued that eroticism is a central component in the maintenance of sexual desire. The absence of eroticism is linked to the prevalence of chronic sexual dissatisfaction and inhibited sexual desire among those who are otherwise fully functional. The taboos surrounding sexual arousal and the seeking of sexual pleasure are examined. The value of eroticism for the individual and the couple is discussed in terms of deepening of self-knowledge, self-affirmation, mutual trust, and intimacy. Implications for clinicians are addressed. A shift in paradigms is recommended from the prevailing one, focusing on sexual function versus dysfunction, to another that emphasizes the potential for sharing erotic experience.",

Rape is a one of violence that is not distinguish with gender, age, socio-economic status, place and time.

Suffering includes social burdens in society, fears of pregnancy and the onset of illness or infection, and others. As a result of rape causes physical and psychological damage to rape victims. Psychological losses can affect the daily life of rape victims as a psychological impact. Psychological effects on rape victims appear with symptoms that appropriate to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), including sadness, depressed mood, insomnia, loss of interest in usual activities, negative self-concept, self-blame, feeling useless and guilty, difficult to concentrate, often think about suicide or death. Compensation for rape victims needs to be obtained by considering the psychological condition. There has not yet been any compensation for the psychological impact on rape victims. About compensation has been regulated in Law No. 31/2014 Regarding Amendment to Law No. 13/2006 concerning Protection of Witnesses and Victims. the regulation does not include compensation for psychological effects. In this regard, it is necessary to address the urgency of regulating compensation for psychological effects on rape victims.",

      "title": "Equitable Fraud: Material Exploitation in Domestic Settings",
      "abstract": "The security and well-being of older adults in the grey zone - not incapable but more vulnerable - is a key area of concern among practitioners and legislators. The diminished capability associated with disease may be gradual and spotty, a grey zone that can last for years. Other, non-medical factors are also significant: vulnerability arises by reason of an individual's total life situation, including relationships, education, experience, personality, and connection to society. Protecting the interests of the vulnerable but capable has been considered in terms of protection from abuse, and/or in terms of capacity. Each approach has significant conceptually structural problems. Unless a very narrow definition of is used (essentially replicating the criminal offences dealing with assault and theft) adult protection legislation has inappropriately paternalistic aspects; older adults are entitled to make objectively foolish choices, take risks, or prefer new, disreputable friends over older, staider ones. Older adults do not require protection from the consequences of their own choices, freely made. A finding of incapacity would resolve the difficulty by simply re-categorising the vulnerable person as incapable, a response that will often be excessive and result in an unwanted and unnecessary loss of independence. Modern least-intrusive adult guardianship legislation attempts to modify that all or nothing outcome through a scheme of graduated capacities. In reality neither paradigm - abuse or capacity - realistically captures or appropriately responds to the range of situations in which the vulnerable but capable adult requires the assistance and support of the law. Those situations are most accurately understood with reference to the conceptual framework of equitable fraud.",

      "abstract": "Immoral actions, including physical/sexual (e.g., incest) and social (e.g., unfairness) taboos, are often described as disgusting. But what about immoral thoughts, more specifically, thoughts that violate religious beliefs? Do heretical thoughts taint the purity of mind? The present research examined heretical disgust using self-report measures and facial electromyography. Religious thought violations consistently elicited both self-reported disgust and anger. Feelings of disgust also predicted harsh moral judgement, independent of anger, and were mediated by feelings of \"contamination\". However, religious thought violations were not associated with a disgust facial expression (i.e., levator labii muscle activity) that was elicited by physically disgusting stimuli. We conclude that people (especially more religious people) do feel disgust in response to heretical thoughts that is meaningfully distinct from anger as a moral emotion. However, heretical disgust is not embodied in a physical disgust response. Rather, disgust has a symbolic moral value that marks heretical thoughts as harmful and aversive.",

While characteristics of both victims and perpetrators can modify the risk for EA, few studies have focused on perpetrators. This study examined the number and type of perpetrator-victim relationships and perpetrator profiles for EA experienced in the prior year, by abuse type and sexual orientation and gender identity of the abused. Data are from community-dwelling Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging participants aged 65 or older at follow-up 1 (n = 23,466). Heterosexual men and women reported being abused psychologically and physically most often by spouses or partners. Gay and bisexual (GB) men reported being abused psychologically most often by non-family, non-friend ‚Äúothers‚Äù. Lesbian and bisexual (LB) women reported psychological and financial abuse most often by siblings or other family members, and physical abuse by non-family, non-friend ‚Äúothers‚Äù. Heterosexual women were abused financially most often by their children, and both heterosexual and GB men reported more financial abuse by ‚Äúothers‚Äù or friends. Overall, 15% and 5% of participants reported abuse by multiple perpetrators of psychological and financial abuse respectively. LB women experienced more EA overall (18.8%), by multiple perpetrators (31% for psychological abuse, 66.5% for financial abuse) including by their siblings and other family members. These results have important implications for mitigation and preventive measures. They also highlight the need for further research concerning sexual minorities experiencing multiple abuse types and/or abuse by multiple perpetrators.",

Women scored higher in self-doubt and disappointment than men, but not in betrayal-anger. When the other variables were included as independent variables, women showed still more self-doubt than men when their partner committed adultery, and this was especially true for women of low self-esteem. Emotional dependency and one's own extradyadic sexual experience reduced all jealousy responses, whereas previous experience with adultery of the partner had a mitigating effect upon disappointment, especially among women. It is concluded that in general neither men nor women can be said to be more jealous, but that among women self-doubt and adaptation to the partner's adultery is a quite common pattern.",

In recent years, increase in disorders of male reproductive system may be associated at least some extent with these factors; which are enhanced by some of new emergent life style habits. A detailed study is required based on the data i.e., excess use of mobile phones and impact of mental stress on male reproductive health. This review highlights the role of various life style factors, environmental stresses and occupational exposures in male reproductive functions and their negative feedback in declining semen quality, increased oxidative stress as well as sperm DNA damages in male. Increase in reproductive disorder in male may be correlated at least in part with these factors, which are further added by some of new emergent life styles. Sub-fertile and/or even normal individuals have some control over their reproductive function by adopting healthy lifestyles.",

Many of them struggle with depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), sexual dysfunction, and self-harming tendencies. Research shows that children who experience such abuse are significantly more vulnerable to being revictimized sometimes not just once, but repeatedly throughout adolescence and even adulthood. Alarmingly, studies indicate they are up to 35 times more likely to be abused again than those who have not faced childhood sexual trauma. This increased susceptibility is often rooted in feelings of self-blame, worthlessness, and shame.This issue becomes even more disturbing when we look at children who live on the margins of society those without shelter, family care, or institutional protection. Children on the streets, in slums, or those forced into child labor such as rag-picking or begging are especially exposed. With no stable home, adult supervision, or legal protection, these children are not only easier targets for sexual predators, but they also lack the means to report abuse or even understand what is happening to them. For many of them, trauma becomes a silent companion unspoken, untreated, and slowly destructive.",

As hypothesized, all master status Ss were particularly likely to be mindful in social interactions; they recalled detailed information about the situation and often took their partner's perspective during the interaction.

The urinary incontinence repercussion is known also sanitary, social and economic context; but also in daily work it has profound effects in. It has a very negative impact on multiple aspects of the living, so much in the social environment (minor social interaction or major isolation), in the physical, in the sexual, in the psychological (loss of autoesteem, depression), and in the labor atmosphere (absenteeism, fewer relation with partners). The urinary incontinence effect in the quality of life is equal, or more importantly than the clinical symptomatology of this dysfunction for the person who suffers from urinary incontinence, and it has being underestimated for a long time the trouble valued by the patients with urinary incontinence.

      "abstract": "Aim. The aim is to present the results of research on the sexual nervousness of men and women.&#x0D; Methods. 87 Ukrainian men and women were interviewed. For the analysis of the obtained results, methods of statistical processing of data were used.&#x0D; Results. It has been established that there are differences between men and women in terms of sexual nervousness, attitudes towards pornographic materials, sexual arousal, friendly and exchange approaches to sex, signs of positive relationships with others and self-acceptance. Men are more focused on careful approach to sex and woman on friendly approach. Men are more loyal to pornographic products and reach sexual arousal faster. They have higher levels of sexual nervousness. For both men and women, sexual satisfaction is related to a reduction in sexual nervousness and an increase in a sense of feasibility in a sexual way. Dissatisfaction with a men‚Äôs sex life is related to emotional discomfort. With the growth of sexual-neurotic feeling and sexual actions the desire for a technically perfect sexual act increases neglecting other aspects of relationships and partner‚Äôs wishes. Women who are dependent on others tend to reject themselves and dissatisfaction with their sexual lives increases.&#x0D; Conclusions. Male and female sexuality is associated with many factors of the individual‚Äôs mental life. The experience of subjective well-being and quality of life includes sexual satisfaction.&#x0D; Sexual nervousness is closely related to personal nervousness, which in turn is a set of negative emotional feeling, expressed destructive and inconsistent personality traits, and impedes efficient social and psychological functioning. Sexual nervousness is defined as dissatisfaction, disappointment in sex life that leads to neurotic sexual response ‚Äì difficulties in controlling the sexual urge, confusion, anxiety, etc.",

Sexual dysfunction can be defined as a change in any component of sexual activity, which may cause frustration, pain and decreased sexual intercourse. Although it is known that chronic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), influence the quality of sexual life, sexual dysfunction is still underdiagnosed, due to two reasons: both patients fail to report the complaint because of shame or frustration, and this subject is rarely called into question by doctors. Rheumatologists are increasingly willing to discuss areas which are not directly related to drug treatment of joint diseases, such as quality of life, fatigue, and education of patients; however, sexuality is rarely addressed. The aim of this review is to present some useful concepts to Rheumatologists for orientation of their patients with RA with respect to sexual function/dysfunction, some considerations concerning the role of these professionals in order to instruct the patient, general notions about sexual function, including practical concepts about the more appropriate sexual positions for patients with RA, and a multidisciplinary approach to sexual dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Self-enhancement and self-protection are constrained by reality. But to what extent? Broader constraints, often considered powerful, such as East-Asian culture, religion, mind-body practices, and prison environments are not particularly effective deterrents. Narrower constraints, also considered powerful, such as self-reflection and mnemic neglect, are not very helpful either. Deliberate and systematic laboratory efforts, both at the intrapersonal level (e.g., explanatory introspection, salience of one's faults) and the interpersonal level (e.g., accountability, relationship closeness), can boast success in constraining self-enhancement and self-protection strivings, but the success is mixed, difficult to implement, and probably short-lived. The doggedness (potency and prevalence) of self-enhancement and self-protection are due to the functions or social benefits with which they are associated or confer: psychological health, goal pursuit and attainment, leadership election, and sexual selection. These functions are traceable to our species' evolutionary past.",

      "abstract": "introduction Experimental investigations and clinical observations have yielded a great deal of evidence concerning the effects of castration upon the sexual capacity of male mammals. The sequalae to adult castration in human beings are ambiguous. Some patients describe pronounced and fairly prompt reduction in erotic responsiveness and capacity for sexual performance. Other castrated men claim that normal libido and potency are retained for several decades (Lange 1934, Daniels and Tauber 1941). This extreme variability might be due to any one of several causes. (1) It is possible that individuals vary endocrinologically, and that extragonadal androgens are in some cases sufficient to support an essentially normal sex life. (2) Claims for continued virility may be false. (3) The patient‚Äôs expectations and desires may exert a powerful control over his sexual capacities with the result that castration provides a welcome excuse for inactivity or, in contrast, that hormonal deficiencies are compensated by increased ‚Äúpsychic‚Äù (cerebral) stimulation.",

      "abstract": "Few studies have investigated the association between religion and suicide either in terms of Durkheim's social integration hypothesis or the hypothesis of the regulative benefits of religion. The relationship between religion and suicide attempts has received even less attention.Depressed inpatients (N=371) who reported belonging to one specific religion or described themselves as having no religious affiliation were compared in terms of their demographic and clinical characteristics.Religiously unaffiliated subjects had significantly more lifetime suicide attempts and more first-degree relatives who committed suicide than subjects who endorsed a religious affiliation. Unaffiliated subjects were younger, less often married, less often had children, and had less contact with family members. Furthermore, subjects with no religious affiliation perceived fewer reasons for living, particularly fewer moral objections to suicide. In terms of clinical characteristics, religiously unaffiliated subjects had more lifetime impulsivity, aggression, and past substance use disorder. No differences in the level of subjective and objective depression, hopelessness, or stressful life events were found.Religious affiliation is associated with less suicidal behavior in depressed inpatients. After other factors were controlled, it was found that greater moral objections to suicide and lower aggression level in religiously affiliated subjects may function as protective factors against suicide attempts. Further study about the influence of religious affiliation on aggressive behavior and how moral objections can reduce the probability of acting on suicidal thoughts may offer new therapeutic strategies in suicide prevention.",

Sex lies on the margins of any reach towards the erotic, and with it comes a suffocating mix of fears, concerns and constraints. In its usage as an adjective in English, 'erotic' is typically used as a qualifier, pointing to a particular aspect or quality of experience. For instance, if someone were to use the term 'erotic relationship' it would generally be assumed that this implied sexual activity. As with the expression of erotic energy, the 'goodness' of sex is assessed pragmatically, and with critical attention to issues of consent, power and the impact on all involved. A pragmatic assessment of the behavior and consequences that emerge from either an encounter with the erotic or an engagement in sexual behavior is better assessed through a rigorously pragmatic lens where the welfare of all are considered.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Rational choice theory outlines that human behavior is based on the perceived costs and benefits that will result from any given behavior. Before engaging in any behavior (criminal or not) the individual rationally weighs the costs and benefits associated with the outcome of the behavior. If the perceived benefits of the behavior outweigh the costs then the individual ‚Äúrationally‚Äù chooses to engage in the behavior. This ‚Äúrationality,‚Äù however, is compromised when individuals find themselves intoxicated and/or sexually aroused, especially in regards to sexually aggressive behavior. Alcohol-induced intoxication has repeatedly been associated with sexual aggression and/or rape. Based on the literature, sexual arousal too has been associated with an increased likelihood of self-reported male sexual forcefulness against female targets. Male perceptions of the legal and social consequences associated with sexually aggressing against, or raping, a female acquaintance are obscured when intoxicated, and to a lesser degree when they find themselves sexually aroused. Aggressive educational programs may help to curb the overwhelming rates of date/acquaintance rapes, especially if initiated early on in the public's academic or social careers. In addition, it is imperative then for the courts and psychologists dealing with sexually aggressive offenders to recognize the effects that alcohol-induced intoxication and sexual arousal may have had on the rational decision-making process of the perpetrator.",

We suggest that moral opposition to these behaviors may partly stem from their perceived effects on men‚Äôs sexual responses. We hypothesized that (a) people would stereotype men as having relatively less control of their sexual urges (i.e., lower sexual self-control) compared to women and that (b) stereotypes about men‚Äôs sexual self-control would uniquely predict attitudes about women‚Äôs mundane (but potentially sexually arousing) behaviors. Five studies show that (a) people stereotyped men (vs. women) as lacking sexual self-control (Study 1) and (b) endorsement of this stereotype was associated with opposition to public breastfeeding and immodest clothing (Studies 2-5). The effects hold even after controlling for potential confounds and seem specific to relevant moral domains, although women (vs. men) tend not to view these behaviors as moral issues.",

Sexual satisfaction is patterned by gender, relationship status, sexual exclusivity, and expectations of relationship duration, but not by sexual orientation. Historically, women's sexual pleasure/satisfaction has been deemed more ‚Äúunspeakable‚Äù than men's.",

      "abstract": "In Brief A large component of women's sexual desire is responsive rather than spontaneous. Therefore, women's motivation and ability to find and respond to sexual stimuli to experience sexual arousal and subsequent sexual desire is crucial, but complex. In ongoing relationships, a woman's motivation appears to be largely influenced by her emotional intimacy with her partner and her wish to enhance it. Drugs (including androgen replacement therapy) aimed at increasing women's spontaneous sexual wanting (less characteristic of women in long-term relationships) or their arousability may have a role if other psychologic factors affecting arousability are addressed in tandem. A woman's sexual arousal is composite and complex, correlating well with how mentally exciting she finds the sexual stimulus and its context and poorly with objective genital blood flow changes. Drugs aimed at increasing the latter, including phosphodiesterase inhibitors, may have a role if there is prior careful enquiry as to whether genital engorgement is present but not attended to or is physically absent. Psycho-physiologic studies to date suggest the former is common in women presenting with arousal disorder. Defining the components of desire and arousal lacking in women with sexual dysfunction is necessary to establish benefit from pharmacologic intervention.",

      "abstract": "Trachten we de gegevens van resultaten van de hoofdstukken III t/m VI met elkaar in verband te brengen, dan zien we het volgende:\r\nSubstraatstimuli in het gebied, waarin vrouwtjes voorkomen wekken balts en zoekgedrag bij het mannetje op. Ontmoet het mannetje sexe-genoten in dit milieu, dan reageert het agressief en raakt nu en dan in gevecht met de andere mannetjes. Hierbij heeft het grotere en sexueel sterker gemotiveerde mannetje de grootste kans als overwinnaar uit het duel tevoorschijn te komen, Zijn gedrag verschilt dan duidelijk van dat van de verliezer. Zolang het mannetje niet heeft gecopuleerd blijft de kans, dat het wint van een bepaalde rivaal, die eveneens niet heeft gecopuleerd, betrekkelijk constant. Als het mannetje verliest bij het eerste treffen sluit dit nog niet uit, dat het van het andere mannetje kan winnen. Het zoekgedrag, dat na agressieve contacten wordt gemodificeerd tot marionettengang brengt het mannetje in de onmiddellijke nabijheid van vrouwtjes. Zoekgedrag wordt dan beeindigd en visuele prikkels (misschien ook olfactorische) richten het baltsgedrag op het vrouwtje.\r\nHet vrouwtje is waarschijnlijk bij de eerste ontmoeting nog niet tot paren bereid; de agonistische contacten tussen mannetjes duren dan voort. De grotere en sexueel sterker gemotiveerde dieren hebben daarbij de meeste kans de directe omgeving van het vrouwtje bezet te houden. Bepaalde factoren uit bet baltsgedrag waarschijnlijk vooral het ritme van bewegingen en vibraties immobiliseren het vrouwtje tenslotte, ten gevolge van aanraken door het mannetje of op grond van visuele prikkels treedt kanteling van het abdomen op. \r\nDan kruipt het mannetje op vormprikkels, afkomstig van het vrouwtje spelen hierbij een rol en de copulatie vindt plaats. Vrouwtjes, welke niet worden bevrucht, kunnen na drie maanden nog op de hierboven beschreven wijze tot paren bewogen worden. Bij bet mannetje daalt na een periode van sexuele activiteit de agressiviteit ten opzichte van andere mannetjes. Komt het in dit stadium tot een agonistisch contact tussen dit mannetje en een ander, dat nog geen periode van sexuele activiteit heeft doorgemaakt, dan treedt het laatste mannetje als winnaar op.\r\nVeldwaarnemingen zullen het hierboven getekende beeld nog moeten bevestigen. Net name de regels, welke voor het agonistische gedrag beschreven zijn kunnen met elkaar een belangrijk selectie-mechanisme vormen, waarbij selectie plaats vindt in de richting van sexueel sterker gemotiveerde dieren en misschien in de richting van grotere dieren. Het is van belang te weten, of dit mechanisme in de natuur inderdaad werkzaam is, of dat misschien het potentiele effect ervan door andere factoren in de leefwijze en het gedrag van Pardosa amentata wordt geneutraliseerd.",

A traves de la historia se han conocido una diversidad de AS cada uno caracterizado por un tipo de conducta durante el acto criminal. Los asesinos en serie estan especificamente motivados por una multiplicidad de impulsos psicologicos, sobre todo por ansias de poder y compulsion sexual. Con frecuencia tienen sentimientos de inadaptabilidad e inutilidad, algunas veces debido a humillacion y abusos en la infancia y/o el apremio de la pobreza, tambien bajo estatus socioeconomico en edad adulta. Sus crimenes compensan esto y les otorga una sensacion de potencia y frecuentemente venganza, durante y despues de cometer los delitos. El conocimiento de sus acciones aterroriza a comunidades enteras y con frecuencia confunden a la policia, consecuencias que son incentivo para su sensacion de poder. No se sabe con certeza el numero de AS que hay. En Estados Unidos se cree que el rango va de 150 a 350; siendo de estos un 89% varones , motivados no solo por el hecho de matar sino tambien para cumplir sus fantasias aun despues del homicidio. El 50% tienen motivaciones sexuales, siendo el hombre mas agresivo que las mujeres constituyendo esta agresividad como instrumental. Se considera que cada individuo presenta una susceptibilidad a esta agresividad de acuerdo al tipo de trastorno de personalidad, involucrando areas especificas del cerebro a nivel de la corteza y del sistema limbico asi como neuromoduladores.

      "title": "Evaluation of sexual dysfunction in LUTS/BPH patients.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION : Sexual dysfunction affects a couple‚Äôs relationship and the quality of life of the patient a nd the partner irrespective of age. Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms suggestive of BPH is highly prevalent among the elderly. So too are the symptoms of sexual dysfunction in old age. But the symptoms of sexual dysfunction are not concentrated upon, both by the patient and the physician at least in our country. Sexual dysfunction manifests mainly as erectile dysfunction (ED), ejaculatory disorders, or decreased libido/hypoactive sexual desire (HSD). Men with moderate-to-severe LUTS are at increased risk for sexual dysfunction. Though reduced rigidity and reduced ejaculate volume are the highly prevalent symptoms in ageing men, reduced rigidity and pain on ejaculation are considered to be most bothersome, affecting the quality of life. Sexual dysfunction is much more prevalent in patients with LUTS/BPH than in men without them, even after controlling for confounding variables such as age and co morbid illnesses. Hence LUTS/BPH is considered to be an independent risk factor for sexual dysfunction. 3 The reason for the association being a common underlying pathology or the psychological effect of LUTS / BPH on sexual function needs to be confirmed. Despite a decline in the frequency of sexual intercourse, as well as in overall sexual functioning, most elderly men report regular sexual activity and consider their sex life as an important dimension of their quality of life (QoL). However, most patients with LUTS/BPH experience a negative effect of LUTS on their sex life. AIM & OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in LUTS/BPH\r\npatients. To assess the effect of LUTS/BPH effect on sexual function. To assess the treatment effect of LUTS/BPH on sexual function. MATERIALS & METHODS : Between June 2007 and November 2007, all patients admitted into our ward with LUTS/BPH were included for evaluation. These patients were admitted for either evaluation or intervention for LUST/ BPH.\r\n Informed consent obtained from all eligible patients. All patients after admission were given the linguistic version of IPSS & MSHQ. Pts who are literate were asked to fill up the questionnaire. (Self administered questionnaire) . Pts who were not able to fill up (for various reasons like illiterate, poor eye sight, not able to understand the contents) were interviewed personally. To avoid interviewer bias, the same interviewer interviewed all pts. All details regarding the pts demographics, scoring, results will be entered into a proforma Post treatment effect evaluation was done at the end of 3 months following treatment. CONCLUSION : The prevalence of sexual dysfunction in patients with LUTS is 70%. The severity of sexual dysfunction correlates with severity of LUTS. Ejaculatory function deteriorates after treatment of LUTS/BPH.",

      "title": "Accommodation Processes During the Early Years of Marriage",
      "abstract": "Sometimes married life is blissful ‚Äì intimacy and companionship are easy, feelings of trust and commitment are strong, partners treat one another with love and consideration, and the marriage seems indestructible. Unfortunately, many couples encounter periods when life is not so easy ‚Äì times when intimacy and companionship are hard work at best, good times are a distant memory, trust and commitment are sorely strained, and the marriage verges on collapse. Much of married life unfolds in a middle ground between these extremes, in a state where good times are punctuated by dissatisfying incidents of greater or lesser intensity. The manner in which couples negotiate this intermediate state appears to be crucial to maintaining a long-term, enduring marriage. This chapter deals with one important feature of the \"middle ground\" of marriage by analyzing an interaction phenomenon termed accommodation. Interaction sequences involving accommodative behavior are initiated when one partner engages in a potentially destructive act, such as behaving in a thoughtless manner, saying hurtful things, yelling at the partner, or worse. Accommodation refers to an individual's willingness, when the partner has enacted a potentially destructive behavior, to (a) inhibit impulses to react destructively in turn and (b) instead behave in a constructive manner.",

There is robust research and information regarding its biological aspects specially its endocrine base, yet the psychosocial aspect is quite interesting and debatable due to its variability among different cultures and climates. There are certain subthreshold response in form fear and loss of reproductive life to no more ability to reproduce and a feeling of loss of femininity. The period of menstruation simulated to reproductive age or fertility is around half of their lives; therefore, loss of fertility or reproductive life may be a source of stress specially among tribes where long reproductive age period is desired on the cultural belief that this will lead to a large family size that is considered as a symbol of success. Psychological factors such personal or inter-psychic (personality, self-esteem, and coping skills) and intra-psychic (relationship issues and social support) may contribute in the onset, course, and repose to perimenopausal period. There are certain psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depressive disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric syndrome related to premenopausal period that must be screened.

Del calendario a las actitudes La descripcion de la primera relacion sexual ofrece tambien un punto de vista sobre el conjunto de la actividad sexual de los individuos. Actualmente, esta fase se desarrolla de forma muy distinta a la habituai hace cincuenta a≈àos. La edad media de las mujeres en el momento de la primera relacion se ha rebajado en mas de tres afios en medio siglo. No ob- stante, las diferencias entre hombres y mujeres no se han reducido con el curso de las gene- raciones. Para los hombres, este momento sigue siendo un paso del aprendizaje sexual, mientras que para las mujeres indica una primera relacion preconyugal o conyugal. Dentro de cada generacion, algunos individuos experimentan una entrada precoz en la vida sexual, mientras que otros experimentan una entrada tardia. Una entrada tardia en la sexualidad esta ligada a ciertos factores que retardan la maduracion social, como por ejemplo el hecho de seguir estudios de larga duracion. Pero una entrada precoz –æ tardia a las relaciones sexuales tambien es signo de una actitud determinada hacia la sexualidad, y de forma mas amplia ha- cia la pareja, y hacia la vida familiar. Los individuos sexualmente mas precoces tienen una vida mas compleja que los demas : el numero de separaciones a lo largo de su vida es mas elevado, y tienen un repertorio de practicas sexuales mas diversificado. Los que entran tar- diamente en la vida sexual tienen un perfil mas tradicional : tienen un numero muy inferior de parejas y habitualmente un unico conyuge a lo largo de su vida. Rechazan una separa- cion entre pareja, sexualidad y sentimiento. Estas diferencias de actitud y comportamiento son muy marcadas entre los nombres. En cambio, son menos marcadas entre las mujeres, especialmente entre las generaciones menos jovenes ; las mujeres tienden a asociar sistema- ticamente sexualidad y sentimiento.",

      "title": "Principles of Marital Therapies and Behavior Therapy of Sexual Dysfunction",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Sexual functioning is not only a coordinated process of body systems ‚Äì the vascular, endocrine, and neurological ‚Äì but also a complex bio-psycho-social process. Compounding these are the factors such as societal and religious beliefs, health status, personal experience, ethnicity and sociodemographic conditions, and psychological status of the person/couple. All these together interplay a coordinated response for sexual functioning. Any interference in each of these systems and factors can lead to sexual dysfunction (SD). It affects many men and equal number of women across their lifetime. As much it plays a role in species propagation, the human sexual functioning is also recreationally, psychologically, and spiritually important. Any problem in sexual functioning affects the quality of life, emotional bonding among couples, and marital disharmony, in many. EPIDEMIOLOGY Epidemiological survey done in the United States reported that more than 30% of men and 40% of women suffer from some form of SD, with premature ejaculation (PME) in men (21%) and low sexual desire in women (22%) being the most common. There are similar figures from European countries where 34% women and 15% men reported low sexual desire. Looking at an Indian perspective, a study conducted at Chandigarh found a diagnosis of sexual problems in 10% of males attending psychiatry and medical outpatient department. In another study, among rural population of South India, it was noticed that of study population those above 60 years of age and sexually active, erectile dysfunction (ED) was reported in 43.5% of males, PME in 10.9%, hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in 0.77%, and anorgasmia in 0.38%. However, data of female population showed that 28% had arousal dysfunction, 16% had HSDD, 20% had anorgasmia, and 8% had dyspareunia. NOSOLOGICAL SYSTEMS AND THE INDIAN CONTEXT A common problem of western nosological systems is that it is difficult to establish diagnosis of SD in an Indian context. As shown in table 1 are comparison of the commonly diagnosed sexual dysfunctions in ICD 10 & DSM5. Many of SDs commonly encountered by Indian clinicians are not included in these classifications, taking into account the vast diversities in culture, belief systems, religion, and educational level. Indian researchers have consistently alluded to the existence of certain unique socioculturally determined sexual clinical conditions, such as Dhat syndrome and apprehension about potency. Even though Dhat syndrome finds itself a coding in ICD-10 under other neurotic disorders (F48.8), the diagnosis of apprehension about potency does not find even a mention. A commonly held belief in most of the Indian subcultures about masturbation and \"night falls\" resulting in loss of potency and affecting marital conjugal relations does not correlate with western nosology. In many culture, masturbation is considered to be responsible for watery semen or sideways curvature or shrinkage of penis. The exaggerated apprehensions in males centered societies on sexual performance on \" First wedding night (Suhaag raat)\" commonly the performance anxiety also need special mention. Leucorrhea with or without infective origin is considered as female Dhat syndrome.Table 1: Comparison of diagnostic categories of ICD-10 and DSM-5 of sexual disorders (Avasthi et al., 2017)PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT A patient-centered frame work is required for better evaluation and management of sexual problems. Principles of evidence-based medicine may be followed in both men and women in diagnostic and treatment planning and adoption of common management approaches for SD. Despite all the advancement in the knowledge and research of sexual medicines, marital therapy and behavioral therapies remain the mainstay of management of SD. The guidelines aim to serve the purpose of enlisting key principles of marital therapy and behavior therapies for the treatment of SD. As a core principle, practicing clinicians are expected to consciously adopt the patient's perspective and respect the feelings, expectations, ideas, and values of their patients. Some of the basic principles of patient-centered approach are given in Table 2.Table 2: Principles of treatmentFORMULATION After complete assessment, the first step in the management is to provide the patient/couple a brief and simple account of the nature of their problems and possible contributory factors are shown in table 3.Table 3: Nature of the problem & contributory factorsTREATMENT OPTIONS Treatments for various SDs can be by classified into general and specific measures. Sex education and relaxation exercises are primary modalities as a general measure of treatment, while the specific measures can be either of pharmacological treatments and nonpharmacological measures such as behavior therapy or a combination of both. The nonpharmacological management spectrum has an array of options including many types of psychotherapies, such as Master Johnson's behavioral therapy or its modifications, interpersonal, psychodynamic, rational emotive therapy, systematic desensitization, ban on sexual intercourse, and skill training in communication of sexual preferences. There is a lack of comparative analytical study evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of these psychotherapies. The available data through studies have purposive sampling, do not describe their sample adequately, have not used verified or standard definitions for various disorders, and have neglected the therapist variables. Results available from such studies cannot be generalized. The behavioral measures of Master Johnson or its modifications are the most popular and have been found to be most useful among all the techniques, which have been used. SELECTION OF TREATMENT The final selection of treatment relies on patient/couple's choice. As a prerequisite, the therapist should inform the patient/couple about the available modalities which would help them make a reasoned choice. Before the start of treatment, agreed treatment goals need to be established. As a part of initial evaluation, therapist should start by taking a detailed psychosexual history which can also involve screening questionnaires to assess the sexual knowledge and attitude. Second, the basic investigations to rule out any physical pathology should me a must on checklist. This approach helps to ascertain the type(s) of SD. As discussed, the first step involves establishing the probable etiological basis of the dysfunction, i.e., differentiating the dysfunction as organic in origin, psychological in origin, or a combination of both. In case of organic origin of SD, refer the patient to the concerned specialists and investigate and treat accordingly. Some patients may have psychological factors, contributing to maintenance of SD of organic origin. These patients are difficult to treat as they require very good liaison between the psychiatrist and the physicians, wherein the physician should also have adequate knowledge and the right approach to treat the patient in co care. Patients diagnosed with psychogenic SD should be evaluated for sexual knowledge, relationship issues, presence of comorbid psychiatric disorder, motivation, and psychological sophistication of the patient for treatment. An important aspect of treatment of SD is assessing the sexual knowledge and relationship issues, as many a time the patient/couple may not have any SD per se, but the reported complaints may be arising due to faulty beliefs or relationship issues. If any of these two factors are found to be contributing to the SD, these need to be focused, and once they have been adequately addressed, the SD is to be reassessed and if present needs to be treated adequately. In the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorder, the next step involves ascertaining whether is it primary or secondary (primary psychiatric disorder causing SD; secondary ‚Äì psychiatric disorder is secondary to SD). The patient with primary comorbid psychiatric dysfunction or those who have prominent psychiatric symptoms (may be secondary in origin) first adequately treat the psychiatric disorders before focusing on the treatment of SDs. GENERAL NONPHARMACOLOGICAL MEASURES Sex education Sex education or psychoeducation is the primary step for the treatment of any SD. It aims at normalization of the individual's experiences and reduction of anxiety about sex by providing accurate and scientific information. A special emphasis needs to be given to those areas which are directly related to the patient's problem. Many figures, diagrams, and reading material to couple/patient as possible for reference and illustrations are provided. The basic aim is to establish a rapport with the patient/couple and make him/her understand the problem in a language and intellectual level they understand. At least four sessions are taken to teach relaxation and provide sex education. Never forget to address the sexual myths or misconceptions. A common problem found in a relationship or a sexual problem is a myth arising out of cultural beliefs, lack of education, religious systems, or even ignorance shown by the person himself/herself. Improper sex education is a major reason among individuals facing problems with partner about sex expectation ‚Äì how, what, and when it should happen. One of the components of sex education is to help the individual and his or her partner alters any sexual beliefs that interfere with the individual's enjoyment of sex. Some of these apply equally to both men and women, while others will be more relevant to one gender than the other. Relaxation exercises Relaxation therapy should be taught to patient using Jacobson's progressive muscular relaxation technique or Benson Henry relaxation technique. This can be combined with the biofeedback machine so as to facilitate objective evidence and mastering of anxiety by the patient. Specific nonpharmacological management of sexual dysfunction The specific nonpharmacological measures vary according to the type of SD. One of the important components of the specific measures of treatment includes homework assignment for the couple. It is important to remember that many of these measures are carried out simultaneously. Table 4 highlights the key points in psychotherapeutic interventions.Table 4: Key points of psychotherapeutic dysfunctionHomework assignment for the couple The homework assignment provides a structured approach, which allows the couple to rebuild their sexual relationship gradually. The stages of this program labeled using the terminology introduced by Master and Johnson (1970) are nongenital sensate focus, genital sensate focus, and vaginal containment. There are some basic principles of giving and carrying out the homework assignments as shown in Table 5.Table 5: Principles of giving and carrying out the homework assignmentsNongenital sensate focus This is the first but one of the most important assignments which can help the couple to establish physical intimacy which is comfortable and relaxed. It promotes open communication about feelings, expectations, and desires. This stage is aimed to help the partners develop a sense of trust and togetherness. By encouraging communication, increasing awareness, and relieving anxiety, intimacy among the couple is increased with understanding about each other's concerns. Abstinence from sexual activity include touching each other's genitals and the women's breast to prevent reappearance of anxiety, which is usually thought to be a very huge compounding factor in such scenarios. Promote them to enjoy general physical contact and then gradually rebuild their physical relationship. Every couple reacts variedly to these sessions according to the nature of their problem. A wide range of responses from couple vary, with some findings of this process, from very enjoyable to a complete negative reaction. In some cases, it will be appropriate for the therapist to just acknowledge the problem and reassure and encourage the couple. In some cases, therapists have to explain that it is understandable and expected, but that to overcome a sexual problem like theirs, it is necessary to approach it in a systemic fashion, and with due course of time, they will begin to get pleasure out of their sessions and these would come as spontaneous behavior. At times, more serious difficulties in the form of negative responses to persistent breaking of the ban on sexual intercourse or irregular in homework assignments are also seen. Let the partners express their feelings and anxieties in such cases, and change focus of therapy temporarily to alleviate anxiety or misconceptions. Genital sensate focus The couples, who successfully go through the nongenital sensate focus sessions, need to be told to move to the genital sensate focus sessions. These sessions again depict contrasting interest of some couples as with the nongenital sensate focus, i.e., highly pleasurable to some to highly aversive to some. It is very important that the therapist specifically encourages partners to focus on pleasurable sensations as this stage is particularly likely to generate anxiety and insecurity, especially about intimacy or sexual arousal. Techniques for dealing with SDs also need to be introduced at this stage of treatment. Vaginal containment By now, many couples resolve their difficulties, and this stage becomes a minor protocol in such couples. This is an intermediate stage as it introduces sexual intercourse to the therapy program. For couples with dysfunctions such as ED, PME, and vaginismus, this is an extremely important stage as vaginal penetration is the key step. During a session, the couple is instructed that when they both are sexually aroused and comfortable, the women can introduce her partner's penis into her vagina. The partner is instructed to then lie still, concentrating on any pleasant genital sensations. The best position to attempt vaginal containment is female superior position or a side-to-side position. The couple should be asked to maintain containment as long as they wish, and then, they can return to genital and nongenital pleasuring. This exercise of vaginal containment can be repeated up to three times in any one session. After establishing comfort till this level, the couple can introduce movement during containment, with preferably women starting the movements first. This completes the general program of sex therapy, and now, the treatment needs to include superimposition of treatment for specific SDs. Take feedback constantly after every session and clarify any doubts or misconceptions. Homework assignments for single male Principles overlap for the management of SDs in single males. Provide the subject with sex education and thought relaxation exercises. Tables 6 and 7 the principles of homework assignments for single male with SD and PME. Counsel and reassure the patient in the end and encourage him to now indulge in heterosexual experience after a few days without any hurry or overt expectations. The experience should be free from guilt, fear, and anxiety to be carried out in familiar surroundings.Table 6: Homework assignments for single male with erectile dysfunctionTable 7: Homework assignments for single male with premature ejaculationSpecific nonpharmacological management for lack of sexual desire in men Over and above the general measures, there are no particular procedures used in the treatment of this problem. Emphasis should be kept on setting the right circumstances for sexual activity, reliving anxiety, establishing satisfactory fore play, resolving general issues of relationship between couple, and focusing attention on erotic stimuli and cognitions. Usually, desire disorders have a substantially poorer response to psychotherapy (<50%) than other forms of SD (‚â•70%). In addition, conventional sex therapy techniques (e.g., sensate focus) are generally inadequate which makes therapy more difficult. Thus, it requires a more flexible and client-based approach to treatment. Approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), systems approach, script modification, clinical hypnosis, guided fantasy exercises, and sexual assertiveness training have been tried by many authors with variable results. CBT emphasizes the role of thoughts and beliefs in perpetuating the maladaptive behavior and is useful when beliefs held by the patient or couple about norms or responses are contributing to the sexual problem. The \"systems\" approach targets dynamics between the couple and allows assessing the extent to which SD is used by the couple to maintain a \"sexual equilibrium\" within the relationship (i.e., the way SD is used to regulate intimacy or to allow the share of blame between partners for the failure of the relationship). Specific nonpharmacological management for erectile dysfunction Men with psychogenic ED will usually start experiencing erections during either nongenital or genital sensate focus. Educate them that this has happened as a part of improvement of the treatment. Any negative suggestions of not having an erection during the initial phase can have the opposite effect. When an erection develops, men with ED often have difficulty attending to the erotic stimuli. They are focused on the quality of erection, size and girth of penis, and anxiety of maintaining the attained erection. The therapist needs to specifically encourage the man to focus his attention on the pleasurable sensations he experiences during the partner's genital caressing (the use of a lubricant can often heightens these sensations), areas of his partner's body that he finds arousing, and the pleasure of witnessing his partner's sexual arousal. Specific nonpharmacological management for premature ejaculation Behavioral management is the first line of therapy where ever possible. Stop‚Äìstart or squeeze techniques are the specific behavioral techniques for PME. They are usually introduced during sessions on genital sensate focus. Developed by Masters and Johnson, the stop‚Äìstart technique is highly effective for the treatment of PME with up to 90% success rate. The technique focuses to increase the frequency of sexual contact and sensory threshold of the penis. It is best carried out in the context of sensate focus exercises because some males ejaculate so early that direct stimulation of the penis of any kind can trigger ejaculation straight away. Starting with nongenital caresses allows the male more time to identify the sensations that occur immediately before ejaculation. The stop‚Äìstart technique consists of the man lying on his back and focusing his attention fully on the sensation provided by the partner's stimulation of his penis. When he feels himself becoming highly aroused, he is to indicate this to her in prearranged manner at which point she needs to stop caressing and allow his arousal to subside. After a short delay, this procedure is repeated twice more, following which the woman stimulates her partner to ejaculation. At first, the man may find himself ejaculating too early but usually gradually develops control. Later, a lotion can be applied to the man's penis during this procedure, which will increase his arousal and make genital stimulation more like vaginal containment. The squeeze technique is an elaboration of the stop‚Äìstart technique, and probably, one needs to be used if the latter proves ineffective. The couple proceeds as with the stop‚Äìstart procedure. When the man indicates he is becoming highly aroused, his partner should apply a firm squeeze to his penis for about 15‚Äì20 s. While applying the pressure, to inhibit the ejaculatory reflex, the forefinger and middle finger are placed over the base of the glans and shaft of the penis, on the upper surface of the penis, with the thumb placed at the base of the under surface of the glans. Repeated this three times in a session along with the stop‚Äìstart technique, and on the fourth occasion, the man may ejaculate. Both these procedures appear to help a man to develop more control over ejaculation, perhaps because he gradually acquires the cognitive techniques associated with ejaculatory control, or perhaps because he gradually becomes accustomed to experiencing sexual arousal without getting anxious. Stop‚Äìstart technique and squeeze technique have been documented to have anywhere between 60% and 95% success rates. FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION Female SD is a highly prevalent condition that encompasses four primary domains: HSDD Arousal disorder Orgasmic disorder Sexual pain disorder. TREATMENT OF SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION Historically, psychoanalysis was the treatment for sexual difficulties in the earlier half of the twentieth century. However, behaviorism emerged as another therapeutic option by the end of the 1960s. The psychobiological approach emerged in conjunction with the onset of medical progression in the 1980s is still emphasized today. The treatment for SD has ultimately shifted from mental health professionals to physicians in tandem with ongoing medical advancements. TREATMENT OPTIONS Patient and partner education Consultations Psychotherapy Behavior modification Pain management Sexual pharmacology Evaluate medications Alternative medicine Treat systemic illnesses Structured sexual tasks Sexual devices. COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY The cognitive behavioral treatment procedures differ among most of these sexual disorders. Hypoactive sexual desire disorder and female sexual arousal disorder In DSM-IV-TR, the condition of low or reduced sexual desire is referred to as HSDD and is described as \"persistent or recurrent deficiency (or absence) of sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. This disturbance causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.\" Female sexual arousal disorder is defined in the DSM-IV-TR as \"a persistent or recurrent inability to attain or to maintain until completion of sexual activity an adequate genital lubrication-swelling response of sexual excitement that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.\" Treatment Low sexual desire is a consequence of problematic functioning in other domains of sexuality, the partner relationship, or the physical and psychological condition of the female client or her partner as implicated by the circular model of sexual desire. Treatment should focus on helping the client to increase the rewards necessary to experience stronger motivation to engage in sexual activity. The other aspects of the woman's sexual functioning such as her sexual arousal response and lubrication during sexual stimulation, her ability to experience orgasm, and reduction of pain during sex should also be emphasized. The skills of her partner or her own erotic stimulation can be improved by treatment and thus help to relieve her partner's SD. Through nonsexual domains of the relationship, the rewards the women experiences can be increased and punishment reduced. In a CBT of HSDD, interventions based on the sensate focus approach are often combined with other CBT interventions. Female orgasmic disorder Female orgasmic disorder (FOD) is described as a persistent or recurrent delay in, or absence of, orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase, that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty. The DSM-IV-TR describes subtypes of FOD as (1) lifelong (primary) versus acquired (secondary) and (2) generalized (never experiencing orgasm) versus situational (reaching orgasm only with specific stimulation). Treatment The cognitive behavior approaches for FOD generally include behavioral exercises, such as systemic desensitization, sensate focus, and directed masturbation. It focuses primarily on changes in attitudes and thoughts decreasing anxiety and increasing orgasmic ability and sexual satisfaction Sexual pain disorder: Dyspareunia Dyspareunia is defined as recurrent genital pain associated with sexual intercourse that causes distress and interpersonal problems. Sexual pain is frequently associated with lack of sexual arousal/lubrication and the persistent difficulty to allow vaginal entry of a penis, and thus, the latter criteria may be difficult to establish. The following more inclusive revision of the definition of dyspareunia: \"'persistent or recurrent pain with attempted or completed vaginal entry and/or penile vaginal intercourse\" has been recommended by an international consensus committee. Provoked vestibulodynia disorder (PVD) was formerly referred to as vulvar vestibulitis syndrome. This is perhaps the most frequent type of superficial dyspareunia in premenopausal women. PVD is defined as burning or pain that is localized strictly to the vestibule of the vulva and is provoked by pressure or friction in the vestibule. To understand psychopathology of Dyspareunia Refer Figure 1.Figure 1: Psychopathology of DyspareuniaTreatment Achieving pain control by the woman themselves is the purpose of CBT. It focuses on reducing catastrophic fear of pain and reestablishing satisfying sexual functioning, with an aim of reducing muscle contraction in the pelvic floor and promoting lubrication during sexual activity. The ultimate goal is pain reduction during the sexual act. CBT is often delivered in a group format, with 8‚Äì10 sessions over a 10‚Äì12-week period. The treatment package includes: Education and information about vestibulodynia and how dyspareunia affects desire and arousal and a multifactorial view of pain Education about sexual anatomy Progressive muscle relaxation, abdominal breathing, and Kegel exercises Vaginal dilatation Distraction techniques focusing on sexual imagery, rehearsal of coping self-statements, communication skills training, and cognitive restructuring. A behavioral intervention focuses on pelvic muscle tension, using biofeedback electromyography (EMG) with visual feedback. Women are trained to use a vaginal EMG sensor and a biofeedback device in the clinic and are then asked to complete a standard pelvic floor training program at home twice a day consisting of pelvic floor contraction exercises of various durations, separated by prescribed rest periods. Participants receive eight 45-min sessions over 12 weeks. Specific nonpharmacological management for dyspareunia Treatment of dyspareunia involves sex education besides general measures and sensate focus. The sex education need to focus on the aspect of adequate arousal, and the couple may also be helped by specific suggestions for modifying their usual intercourse positions. Couples should avoid positions that lead to deep penetration (such as vaginal entry from the rear) and instead adopt positions in which the woman is in control of the depth of penetration (woman on top) or in which penetration is not too deep (side-by-side or \"spoons\" position). Another important aspect of treatment of dyspareunia due to psychological causes helps the woman become aroused by teaching the sensate focus program. It is likely that woman with repeated pain experience on intercourse will tense up on future occasions in anticipation of further pain. Such tension may actually increase pain as the muscles may be more resistant to penetration. Due to this, relaxation exercises before intercourse may be helpful. Progressive muscle relaxation before sexual activity may allow the women to reduce the body tension, while more specific relaxation exercises just before intercourse may help to relax the muscles around the pelvic region and may enhance arousal. A woman should acquire a number of coping techniques for minimizing the likelihood of pain. Positive self-talk may also be helpful. Such self-talk can involve the woman reminding herself that she is in control of the situation and she will be the one to determine when penetration is to occur and how deep penetration will be. Sexual pain disorder: Vaginismus Vaginismus is defined as an involuntary contraction of the musculature of the outer third of the vagina interfering with intercourse, causing distress and interpersonal difficulty. As per an international consensus committee's revised criteria, vaginismus can be defined as \"persistent difficulties to allow vaginal entry of a penis, a finger, and/or any object, despite the woman's expressed wish to do so. There is variable involuntary pelvic muscle contraction, (phobic) avoidance, and anticipation/fear/experience of pain. Structural or other physical abnormalities must be ruled out/addressed.\" The Circular fear-avoidance model of vaginismus is described in Figure 2.Figure 2: Circular fear-avoidance model of vaginismusTreatment The use of systematic desensitization has a relatively long history in the treatment of vaginismus but has surprisingly little empirical support. Gradual exposure exercises for homework, with gradual habituation to vaginal touch and penetration, usually beginning with the woman's fingers or artificial devices specifically designed for this purpose, are encouraged. Specific nonpharmacological management for vaginismus Many women who present with vaginismus have a negative attitude toward sex, and quite a few are victim of sexual assault. Some may also believe that premarital sex is wrong or sinful. This belief may be so ingrained that, even when intercourse is sanctioned by marriage, it may be difficult to relax physically or mentally during sexual intercourse. The cause of vaginismus may be a fear that is instilled by friends or family by suggesting that the first experience of intercourse is likely to be painful or bloody. Fear of pregnancy is another important cause of vaginismus. The sex education needs to focus on clarifying normal sexuality and reducing negative attitude for sex. The specific management involves the following stages: The woman should be helped to develop more positive attitudes toward her genitals. After fully describing the female sexual anatomy, the therapist needs to encourage the woman to examine herself with a hand mirror on several occasions. Extremely negative attitudes may become apparent during this stage, possibly leading to failure to carry out the homework. Some women find it easier to examine themselves in the presence of the partners; others may only get started if the therapist helps them do this first in the clinic. If this is necessary, a medically qualified female therapist is to be involved Pelvic muscle exercises are intended to help the woman gain some control over the muscles surrounding the entrance to the vagina. If she is unsure whether or not she can contract her vaginal muscles, she may be asked to try to stop the flow of urine when she next goes to the toilet. She can check that she is using the correct muscles by placing her finger at the entrance to her vagina where she needs to be able to feel the muscle contractions. Subsequently, she is advised to practice firmly contracting these muscles for an agreed number of times several times a day After becoming comfortable with her external genital anatomy, she is advised to explore the inside of her vagina with her fingers. This is to encourage familiarity and to initiate vaginal penetration. Negative attitudes may also become apparent at this stage (e.g., concerning the texture of the vagina, its cleanliness, fear of causing damage, and whether it is \"right\" to do this sort of thing). The rationale for any of these objections is to be explored. At a later stage, the woman might try using two fingers and moving them around. Once she is comfortable inserting a finger herself, her partner needs to begin to do this under her guidance during their homework sessions. A lotion (e.g., K-Y or baby lotion) can make this easier. Graded vaginal dilators can be used. However, clinical experience has shown that the use of fingers is just as effective When vaginal containment is attempted, the pelvic muscle exercises and the lotion are used to assist in relaxing the vaginal muscles and making penetration easier. This is often a difficult stage and the therapist therefore needs to encourage the woman to gain confidence from all the progress made so far. Persisting concerns about possible pain need to be explored, including how the woman might ensure that she retains control during this stage Once containment is well established, the couple is asked to introduce movement during containment, with preferably women starting the movements first. With this, the general program of sex therapy is completed, and now, the treatment needs to include superimposition of treatment for specific SDs. COUPLE THERAPY Zimmer's (1997) study showed that at follow-up, women suffering from SD who received combined marital and sex therapy experienced more treatment gains. Couple therapy that addresses the specifics of the impact of SD on the marriage has been documented (Bagozzi, 1987; Zimmer, 1987; Russell, 1990). These therapies often focus on the theme of increasing intimacy. The assumption is that if the therapy enhances intimacy between the couple, sexual satisfaction will increase. Following are therapeutic didactic models that lend themselves well to teaching and instruction. Couples seeking therapy often are locked into a rigid belief that the partner with low desire has a problem that requires fixing. To develop new interactional rules that will support more expansive behavior, the intervening clinician requires a tool to shift the couple's thinking. The initial step involves a therapeutic intervention employed by strategic theorists called reframing or normalization, which is used to shift the partners' perception so that the couple can interact in a less rigid and more complex way. Reframing is successful if it manages to invest a given situation with new meaning. This is useful because reframing allows the therapist to affirm the couple in concrete thought rather than in conjecture. Because the Basson model of the sexual response cycle can readily be described and illustrated to the couple, it facilitates joining the couple at the level of content while introducing new meaning to the couple's experience. If accepted by the couple, it may support new behavior that will establish new patterns of mutual influence. Therefore, the therapeutic intervention of reframing/normalizing may be all that is required, regardless of whether the woman or the man of the couple presents with low desire. TERMINATION OF TREATMENT The termination of the treatment must be planned carefully. The various strategies and component of termination are as follows: Prepare for termination from the start of treatment The patient/couple should be told about the likely duration of therapy at the beginning of the treatment. Setting the time frame will encourage the patient/couple to work on the homework assignments. Toward the end of treatment extend the intervals between sessions The intervals between the last two to three sessions need to be extended to 2‚Äì3 weeks. Prepare for relapse The therapist needs to prepare the couple for relapse. About three-fourth of men will experience recurrence of their problem following treatment. Hence, treatment also needs to assist men to cope well with relapse. Most recurrences occur in a temporal pattern (i.e., will occur more at certain times than at others) and usually improve naturally or with self-initiated restart of treatment techniques. The understanding that relapses are normally expected helps to reduce the anxiety and sense of failure that may otherwise prolong erectile difficulties.

      "title": "Missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls: A case for abuse screening in at‚Äêrisk paediatric populations",
      "abstract": "American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people experience the highest rates of homicide and violence in the USA and Canada.1 This propensity for violence and sexual crimes has manifested as the crisis referred to as Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, with more than 5000 young women having suffered homicide, kidnapping or trafficking in the USA.2 AI children are not exempt from these statistics. When compared to non-AI populations there is a statistically significantly higher proportion of AI/AN reporting of emotional, physical and sexual abuse.3 This same disparity is also true regarding emotional and physical neglect.3 Abuse and violence affect all communities, but as paediatric providers, many of the patients we treat lack the vocabulary, maturity or both to express their needs, rendering them particularly vulnerable. These conversations can be difficult, especially when there is fear that the questions asked might alienate or offend the families we are trying to serve. Medical trainees are often uncomfortable in screening for child abuse, particularly, during encounters where the signs are subtle or unrelated to the chief complaint. Medical schools and residency programmes often lack the curriculum needed to educate trainees on how to approach suspected abuse cases or the resources available to families.4 Additionally, the lack of a standardised approach to survey for abuse further complicates effective recognition and management. However, evidence suggests that residents who learn to address family psychosocial issues, including violence and abuse, are more likely to screen for these issues in practice and ultimately connect patients with needed resources.4 Several validated screening tools, including the International Society for Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (IPSCAN) Child Abuse Screening Tool for Children (ICAST-C) and Escape Form have demonstrated effectiveness at screening children for abuse.5, 6 The Escape Form evaluates risk based on the patient's history, the development of the child, the appropriateness of interaction between the child and caretakers, the consistency of the physical examination compared with the history, if there was a delay in seeking care and other safety concerns.6 Results from this form provide an ‚Äòat-risk score‚Äô that creates an objective manner of evaluation that can allow for consistency in evaluation. Review of this model has demonstrated an increase in abuse screening, trainee comfort with screening and most importantly, an increase in detection of cases that is five times higher when compared to cases of children that were not screened.6 The American Academy of Pediatrics offers several resources through ‚ÄòThe Resilience Project‚Äô aimed at addressing violence and toxic stress at both the medical practice and policy levels.7 This online resource provides tools for families, care givers and providers who treat children and youth exposed to violence.7 The implementation of the ‚ÄòTraining Toolkit‚Äô may prove valuable to trainees and early career physicians, helping them to learn the different types of violence that our paediatric patients may experience. The expanding education on patient and family-centred communication throughout clinical training may better equip future paediatricians to identify abuse and develop the confidence to start the appropriate dialogue to curb its effects. This national crisis of violence against AI/AN women and girls challenges paediatricians to find ways to address the gap in protecting girls from becoming the missing and the murdered. Screening both for abuse and family wellness is a critical step for paediatricians in addressing this crisis. Gaining the confidence to implement these skills can be undoubtedly challenging. Structured teaching and guidance can empower residents to identify abuse and will be a life-changing event for trainees and the families we treat.",

      "abstract": "Allegations of Parental Alienation (PA), the systematic disparaging of one parent by the other parent aimed at alienating their child's affections, as a basis for child custody decisions are highly controversial. Claims of parental hostility or allegations of child sexual abuse in custody cases may trigger concerns about PA. Family court professionals (N = 280) rated young children's accuracy of report (e.g., suggestibility, honesty) in general and also read three custody scenarios varying as to whether or not they included allegations of parental hostility or child sexual abuse, or no such allegations. For each scenario, the alleged alienating parent's gender was experimentally varied between subjects. Participants rated the likelihood that each case involved PA. For the scenario that included allegations of child sexual abuse, professionals who viewed young children as more inaccurate reporters or who read about the mother (rather than a father) as the alleged alienator were more likely to rate the scenario as involving PA. For the scenario that described parental hostility but no child sexual abuse allegations, professionals who were older or female were more likely to judge the scenario as involving parental alienation when a mother (rather than a father) was the alleged alienator, whereas there were no significant predictors of responses to the no-allegation scenarios. Findings are discussed in relation to the difficult task of evaluating custody cases for PA when parental hostility or child sexual abuse is alleged.",

      "abstract": "Addiction, which is one of the major problems of society and is spreading severely day by day, is considered a complex process where an individual develops an uncontrollable desire for a substance or behavior, continues this desire, and has difficulty ending it despite both physical and psychological harm. Food addiction is a type of addiction where individuals consume food not only to meet their physiological needs but also uncontrollably for emotional and psychological satisfaction. Individuals with food addiction tend to eat to cope with emotional states such as stress, anxiety, and depression, leading to unhealthy eating habits and weight problems. In such addictions, the treatment process requires addressing not only the improvement of physical symptoms but also the emotional and psychological factors that trigger the addiction. Although food addiction usually arises from depression or other psychological disorders, in some cases, individuals may feel the need to eat to feel better after experiencing abuse. This situation can become uncontrollable, leading to food addiction, which negatively affects both the mental and physical health of individuals. This study is a case study of a 41-year-old woman named S.A., who developed food addiction as a result of sexual abuse by her parent at the age of 13. The gradual progression of the abuse and the subsequent development of food addiction are examined in detail, along with the effects of EMDR and CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) on overcoming the food addiction.",

      "abstract": "The results of a survey conducted among 535 elderly people living in their own homes in urban areas make it possible to analyse the familiar and social relationship of this population. Cohabitation becomes rare as age increases and as most people, especially women, lose their spouses. More than half of the elderly people surveyed had good contacts with family and/or friends, but, for about a quarter of them, social relations were extremely rare. The authors of this article try to define the influence of age, sex, matrimonial status and the socio-professional milieu on the various forms of relationship. These data lead to the identification of a number of groups of people particularly exposed to the risk of isolation: former manual workers or persons having had very subordinate functions (this generally corresponds to a low level of schooling); people who were divorced or separated; men having lost their spouses (overall, men have somewhat fewer contacts than women with family and friends). Widows, though 25% of them were very isolated, generally had good family and social relationships; nevertheless, they often felt at a disadvantage in social life. Practically, the aim of the authors will not be to tackle isolation and solitude of the aged in general, but to design specific measures which will meet the real needs of the various groups at risk.",

Participants reported their personal expectations, experiences, and beliefs about the sexual expectations of the \"average woman\" and \"average man\" in relationships with or without strong physical attraction and emotional involvement. Results show that, in general, men expect sexual intercourse after significantly fewer dates (approximately 9‚Äì11) than women do (approximately 15‚Äì18). In addition, expectations were related to actual experiences for women, but not men. Participants also tended to exhibit pluralistic ignorance about sex, believing in a norm for the average person of their gender that was considerably more permissive than were their own standards. The average man and woman were perceived as expecting sex earlier within a relationship and irrespective of physical attraction or emotional involvement. In contrast, most men and women only expected sex when they were attracted to a partner, although men were more likely than women to expect sex in the absence of emotional closeness. Implications of pluralistic ignorance and gender differences in sexual expectations are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Extant surveys of people's attitudes towards human reproductive cloning focus on moral judgements alone, not emotional reactions or sentiments. This is especially important given that some (especially Leon Kass) have argued against such cloning on the ground that it engenders widespread negative emotions, like disgust, that provide a moral guide.To provide some data on emotional reactions to human cloning, with a focus on repugnance, given its prominence in the literature.This brief mixed-method study measures the self-reported attitudes and emotions (positive or negative) towards cloning from a sample of participants in the USA.Most participants condemned cloning as immoral and said it should be illegal. The most commonly reported positive sentiment was by far interest/curiosity. Negative emotions were much more varied, but anxiety was the most common. Only about a third of participants selected disgust or repugnance as something they felt, and an even smaller portion had this emotion come to mind prior to seeing a list of options.Participants felt primarily interested and anxious about human reproductive cloning. They did not primarily feel disgust or repugnance. This provides initial empirical evidence that such a reaction is not appropriately widespread.",

      "abstract": "A graphically structured adjective check list was used to assess prescriptive and reactive norms of emotion in 128 social events. Both prescriptive and reactive emotion norms exist for all 128 events. Norms center on a specific emotion in about one-third of the events, and otherwise on a general affective tone. Both prescriptions and reactions occasionally cluster into conflicting norms regarding the expected emotion for an event. Prescriptive norms diverge from reactive norms in almost half of the events, though in only a few events do prescriptions require the opposite of people's emotional reactions. Feeling no emotion occasionally is the norm ; prescribed nonemotionality occurs fairly often for medical relationships, but not in relationships of other institutions based on rational objectivity. Prescriptive norms are the same for a woman and a man, except that a woman is expected to emote more intensely in some interactions. Reactive norms vary by sex, however, in about one-fifth of the events. On the whole, females are disposed to emote with somewhat more displeasure, arousal, and vulnerability than males.",

Audiences vary in their reactions; what‚Äôs wrongful in one audience may be acceptable in another‚Äîhence, deviance is relative to audience, society, subgroup, context, and historical time. Typically, reactions express negative attitudes toward the violations of a strongly-held norm. Such reactions are varied, and include condemnation, withdrawing from the presence of the offender, and the unwillingness to join in interaction with the offending party or parties. Most members of the society can perform a mental experiment to picture what these reactions are likely to be for a range of audiences. The researcher conducted a survey among 60 park-goers to determine what is considered wrongful in the park. In the park, multiple parties put on performances of extremely eccentric or deviant behaviour. Felonious crime is very rare in the park; milder forms of deviance are common, however, including offensive staring and selling marijuana. Public gay sex, which used to be common, has all but disappeared there.",

      "abstract": "In this case report, we represent a male anorexia nervosa case and discuss its psychodynamics in the frame of psychoanalytic theories. Males account for %5-15 of all eating disorders. History of a criticism or a teasing for fatness by relatives or friends is very common in males before the onset of the illness. Males who are in occupations or athletic pursuits that emphasize body weight, or who work in potential high-risk jobs, and who are homosexual are at increased risk for eating disorders. Potential high risk jobs include appearance-based jobs, jobs traditionally held by women and food related jobs. Comorbid psychiatric disorders, mainly depression and anxiety disorders, and especially for bulimic males, substance-related disorders and cluster B personality traits with marked impulsivity are common. When family dynamics are considered, a father who is psychologically distant from his son, and an \"over-protective, over-involved and over-dependent\" mother have been described. Separation difficulties and lack of boundaries within covertly conflictual relationships have been noted in a number of clinical reports. The only difference in clinical presentation between males and females is; males rarely use medicine in order to lose weight and weight changes throughout the illness are more common in males. In this case report, a male anorexia nervosa case's psychodynamics are discussed under the influence of his psychiatric illness and his childhood history.",

      "abstract": "Masa remaja akhir merupakan masa dimana individu mengalami perkembangan minat terhadap lawan jenis dan mulai mempersiapkan diri untuk menjalankan tugas perkembangan masa dewasa, terutama dalam memilih pasangan hidup dan membentuk keluarga. Perkembangan minat heteroseksualitas pada remaja ditunjukkan dengan adanya masa pacaran. Pasangan yang berpacaran akan memiliki dorongan seksual yang besar sehingga dapat melibatkan mereka dalam interaksi seksual, seperti melakukan hubungan seksual ketika berpacaran (premarital sex).\r\nTerjadinya\tperilaku premarital\tsex\tini\ttidak\tterlepas\tdari\tadanya\r\nmotivasi/dorongan dalam diri individu. Adapun tiga motif utama yang dapat mendorong remaja melakukan premarital sex, yaitu intimacy, feeling of affection, dan experience erotic pleasure motives. Salah satu faktor yang dapat mempengaruhi motivasi mahasiswi remaja akhir untuk melakukan premarital sex adalah persepsi mereka mengenai virginitas. Hal ini dikarenakan dalam konsep virginitas mengandung pengertian sebagai suatu kondisi perempuan yang belum melakukan hubungan seksual dengan lawan jenisnya, dan umumnya secara fisik ditandai dengan utuhnya selaput dara. Oleh sebab itu, penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui apakah ada hubungan antara motivasi untuk melakukan premarital sex pada mahasiswi remaja akhir dengan persepsi mengenai virginitasnya.\r\nSubjek penelitian yang digunakan (N=77) adalah mahasiswi remaja akhir berusia 18-22 tahun, sedang dan/atau pernah berpacaran, dan berkuliah di Fakultas Psikologi Universitas Katolik Widya Mandala Surabaya. Pengambilan sampel penelitian ini menggunakan teknik incidental sampling, dan pengumpulan datanya menggunakan skala motivasi untuk melakukan premarital sex dan skala persepsi mengenai virginitas. Data yang diperoleh dianalisis menggunakan teknik korelasi non parametrik kendall's tau b.\r\nHasil analisis datanya mendapatkan koefisien korelasi(rxy) sebesar -0,429 dengan p= 0,000 (p<0,05) yang berarti bahwa ada hubungan negatif yang signifikan antara motivasi untuk melakukan premarital sex pada mahasiswi remaja akhir dengan persepsi mengenai virginitasnya. Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa semakin tinggi motivasi yang dimiliki oleh mahasiswi remaja akhir untuk melakukan premarital sex maka persepsinya mengenai virginitas akan semakin rendah (negatif), begitu pula sebaliknya.",

Relationships play a major role in the lives of each individual irrespective of gender, age and other significant demographic factors. Obsession with relationships may occur with friends, peers, opposite gender, or anybody whose significance is more to the person concerned. When such obsession occurs, the person tends to get engrossed and lost either in the joy or the sorrow of the relationship. It mostly occurs among people in relevant or irrelevant relationships, who tend to live or not live together, who may have in-secured thoughts about the partner, and for several reasons not restricted to the mentioned.

It is best to distinguish it from envy, with which it is often conflated or mistaken. Strictly speaking, envy occurs in the setting of a dyadic relationship and refers to the feelings that are aroused by the characteristics or attributes of another person, whereas jealousy occurs in the setting of a triangular relationship and refers to the feelings triggered by the relationship or potential relationship between two other people within the triangle (Klein, 1977). It is also best to make clear at the outset that jealousy is not a basic emotion such as fear, anger or sadness. It is a complex emotion that is a composite of several different emotions triggered by a social situation. The feelings making up this composite include anger, fear, sadness, guilt, envy and sexual arousal. The social setting is usually the perceived potential or real loss of a sexual partner to an imaginary or real sexual rival.",

      "title": "Toward Prevention of Childhood Sexual Abuse: Preschoolers‚Äô Knowledge of Genital Body Parts",
      "abstract": "This study examined preschool children‚Äôs knowledge of their genital and non-genital body parts. Results indicated that almost all preschool children knew the correct terms for their non-genital body parts, but few knew the correct terminology for their genitals. The importance of this skill in preventing childhood sexual abuse is discussed. Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a serious public health problem. Although definitions vary state by state and in various research programs, CSA is generally defined as sexual contact between a child (under the age of 18) with a person who is at least 5 years older. According to the American Psychological Association (2001), a central characteristic of any abuse is the dominant position of the adult that allows him or her to force or coerce the child into sexual activity. Child sexual abuse may include fondling a child's genitals, masturbation, oral-genital contact, digital penetration, and vaginal and anal intercourse. However, it is not solely restricted to physical contact; such abuse could include non-contact abuse, such as exposure, voyeurism, and child pornography. With close to 100,000 confirmed cases of CSA in the United States during 2005 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2007), efforts to prevent CSA are needed. One public health approach to the prevention of CSA offers child-focused personal safety education programs, usually implemented in schools and preschools. The primary focus of most school-based personal safety programs is to strengthen a child‚Äôs ability to recognize and resist assault (primary prevention), although they often have a secondary prevention focus as well. The secondary prevention objective is to encourage victims to disclose abuse and to improve adults‚Äô responses to these disclosures so that children can receive early intervention and protection to reduce the negative consequences of sexual exploitation (Wurtele, 1998). Successful disclosure of abusive incidents relies partly on the child‚Äôs ability to describe inappropriate activities involving the genitals and to correctly label the genitals. When children disclose CSA using incorrect or idiosyncratic terminology (e.g., ‚ÄúShe touched my monkey,‚Äù or ‚ÄúHe kissed my muffin‚Äù), they may not be understood and are thus unlikely to receive a positive, supportive response to their disclosure. In contrast, disclosure using correct terminology is more likely to be understood, resulting in a more positive outcome for a child‚Äîe.g., by ending the abusive situation and obtaining therapeutic assistance for the child (Kenny, Thakkar-Kolen, Ryan, Runyon, & Capri, 2008). Furthermore, children who lack sexual knowledge may be more vulnerable to sexual abuse. Some sexual offenders avoid children who know the correct names for their genitals because this suggests these children have been educated about body safety and sexuality (Elliot, Browne, & Kilcoyne, 1995). One convicted offender (who had assaulted 75 children by the time he was stopped) reported that when children knew the correct terms for their different body parts, he would leave them alone (Sprengelmeyer & Vaughan, 2000). Along with facilitating disclosure, teaching proper names for all body parts helps children develop a healthy, positive body image (Wurtele, 1993; Wurtele, Melzer, & Kast, 1992). As Honig (2000) states, it gives children ‚Äúnaming power‚Äù (p. 17) just as they have the power to",

      "title": "Autogynephilia in Some Bisexual Cisgender Men",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although some bisexual men experience conventional sexual attraction to both males and females, others have less obvious sexual interests underlying their bisexual identity, attraction, or behavior (i.e., bisexual phenomena). Accordingly, it has been proposed that some men‚Äôs bisexual phenomena are motivated by autogynephilia, a male‚Äôs propensity to be sexually aroused by the thought or image of being a woman. For these men, sexual attraction to males is secondary to their autogynephilia, rather than a reflection of conventional attraction to males. The present study examined how common autogynephilia is among bisexual cisgender men, and how autogynephilic bisexual men may differ from non-autogynephilic bisexual men in their sexual interests and behavior, uncertainty about their sexual orientation, and gender-related experiences. We recruited a large sample of bisexual-identified men ( n = 254) via Prolific to complete an online survey. Of the sample, 35% ( n = 89) endorsed at least half of the items on a measure of core autogynephilia. Consistent with past research on autogynephilia, autogynephilic bisexual men reported more paraphilic sexual interests than non-autogynephilic bisexual men. Of clinical importance, autogynephilic bisexual men reported less certainty about their sexual orientation, elevated childhood and adult gender nonconformity, and elevated gender dysphoria relative to non-autogynephilic bisexuals. These findings suggest that a substantial minority of bisexual men experience autogynephilia, and that future research should consider the unique experiences and needs of autogynephilic bisexual men, including how else they might differ from other bisexual men.",

Until recently, this question has been approached mainly in terms of the presence of psychiatric illness, deviant sexual interests and/or impaired psychosocial development. Empirical research has as yet generally failed to demonstrate this approach to be adequate. It is estimated that only about 40% of juvenile sex offenders appear to show some kind of psychological or developmental deviance. The theoretical framework that is presented here approaches sexual abuse committed by juveniles in terms of normal developmental processes, next to deviant processes. It describes this behaviour, and its presence or absence, as a result of the interaction of biological, psychological and situational factors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There is extensive research focusing on sexual dysfunction, decreased frequency, and sexual effects of aging, however few studies explore older adults‚Äô subjective sexual experiences. Consequently, ageist myths prevail that older adults are neither sexually active nor desirous and the quality of their sexual activity must be extremely poor due to dysfunction and older bodies. The aim of this study was to determine how older adults assess their sexual experiences, what aspects are important, and their sexual outlook through survey research with a sample of individuals age 60+ (N=556). The results found older adults are overwhelmingly positive about their sexual experiences along with a realistic recognition of aging effects. Almost all, 85%, are sexually active, partnered and/or solo sex. Satisfaction is high indicated by 45% extremely/very satisfied with both quality and frequency and by a majority rating recent sexual experiences above average on a 1 to 10 scale and a third ranking it as ‚Äúgreat sex‚Äù (8+). Their positivity is further evidenced as 80% describe their recent sexual experiences as fun and 67% answered exciting, despite 60% also recognizing it is predictable and more challenging, and 72% admitting it‚Äôs not their best sex ever. Sexual desire remains high as the majority look forward to their next sexual experience and 70% anticipate an unlimited number of orgasms in their future. Consistent trends were found across all 4 age groups. This study‚Äôs findings are significant for reframing the myths and demonstrating that older adults are sexually interested and having overwhelmingly positive sexual experiences.",

      "abstract": "Who would ever have thought that the result of the last ten years of sexual freedom and liberation, absence of obscenity laws, all sorts of scientific sexual research, the woman's liberation movement, X-rated movies and increased sexual education would be in some strange way a diminution of sexuality. I am not gainsaying the gains. They have been necessary and they have been tremendous. But it is also time to assess the losses and to see if anything can be done to minimize them. The losses seem to me to come out of a changing focus about sex from a spiritual-psychological one to a technical-anatomical one. People have somehow forgotten that sex-the essence of sexuality-always has been and still is in the mind. Passion is still not anatomical. Learning 37 different positions is not necessarily going to make sex more exciting. Men and women have very powerful and exciting orgasms in their dreams. There is no technique or anatomical stimulation there. Lightly touching the hand of a person you are romantically in love with or a person who is taboo may be more exciting than participating in an orgy. Somehow we all should know these basic facts about sex, but the emphasis of the past ten years has made us forget them. And in the forgetting we have lost a great deal of the excitement about sex. The first porno film can be a tremendous turn-on. But the fiftieth hardly is. Similarly we all were very turned on by the past ten years giving us license and removing restrictions and inhibitions. But now that that thrill-and it certainly was a thrill-is over, where are we? That thrill-like the first porno film-is gone. Other thrills we used to have are also gone-or at least diminished. Some people who have not lost the thrill are the ones who have a special perversion. I do not like to use this word because it has so many pejorative connotations. Yet it is a technically correct word and I know of no other one that specifically defines the drive of a person who has combined some very unconscious emotional gratification with his sexuality in an unusual form of sexual expression and who experiences a great deal of emotional satisfaction through it. I remember hearing a hetero-",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Loneliness is a painful and distressing feeling that leads to a malaise where a person feels alone, despite being surrounded by people, feeling that he or she lacks support, especially of an emotional nature. It is most common in adolescence, but is also prevalent in old age. Objective: To identify the opinion of elderly persons in relation to feelings of loneliness. Methodology: The respondents were 73 elderly men and women living at home but attending day care/social centers. A random convenience sample was used, consisting of elderly persons who were able and wished to respond to a short, duly tested questionnaire with mixed response questions. Confidentiality was respected throughout the study. Results: In 78.1% of respondents, a significant person was a family member who was not a spouse (especially daughters and granddaughters); 79.4% reported feeling sometimes or rarely/ never feeling lonely. Widowed or divorced elderly persons were those who most frequently referred to sometimes feeling lonely. To reduce loneliness, they suggested various forms of interaction and activities in which communication predominated. Intergenerational solidarity was also cited. Conclusions: Although loneliness is described as an increasing problem for the elderly, its frequency was not high among those interviewed, perhaps because the respondents engaged in social activities. A longitudinal study aimed at elderly persons who stayed at home, with a representative sample of the elderly population in a given region, who participated or did not participate in social activities, is recommended to provide a broader perspective of the views of the elderly about loneliness.",

We propose that anxiety stemming from heightened social evaluation concerns‚Äîwhen amplified and psychologically decontextualized‚Äîcan decrease spontaneous interest in intimate sexual interaction while leaving intact or intensifying asocial/idiosyncratic erotic interests. Higher scores on an ‚Äúerotic diversion risk‚Äù index (EDR: social anxiety, sensory processing sensitivity, dissociation in sexual situations) was linked to greater sexual compulsivity. Consistent with our model, higher EDR predicted a lower proportion of intimate versus asocial/idiosyncratic erotic thoughts when social evaluative threat was salient; this relationship was reversed when threat was not salient.",

A sense of defilement or stigma is unavoidable in the face of societal disgust and hatred both for those who are alcoholic and for those who are lesbian or gay or bisexual.

The child victim of sexual abuse, may be initially seen with specific or nonspecific signs and symptoms of the abuse.

      "abstract": "This discussion, which reviews the fertility determinants literature from a sociopsychological or individual perspective, summarizes literature addressing the determinants of individual fertility, i.e., an individual's decision to use or not use an effective contraceptive method. Complete or definite answers about fertility determinants do not exist, but enough is known to provide an overview. From the 259 articles, monographs, and books examined and classified, 6 main classes of determinants were formed and analyzed: demographic; sociopsychological; experiential or behavioral; informational, including knowledge about reproduction and birth control; husband and wife interaction; and environmental. Gaps in the existing literature about these determinants are identified and a sociopsychological model integrating existing knowledge is proposed. In general, the following groups of individuals have relatively high fertility and/or relatively low or ineffective contraceptive use: low socioeconomic status, adolescents and people aged 40 and older, Catholics and highly religious, rural, many siblings, unemployed women or working women who do not attach great importance to their careers; and ethnic minorities. Sociopsychological determinants of fertility and contraceptive use have been classified into 2 groups: personality traits and values and attitudes. In general, the evidence linking values and attitudes to fertility-related behavior is stronger than personality traits, but some promising work in the personality area is being conducted. In general an early age at 1st marriage related to higher fertility, and duration of marriage positively associated with fertility as is a younger age at 1st birth. In general, there is a positive correlation between contraceptive knowledge and contraceptive behavior. Certain aspects of the husband/wife relationship, including the allocation of roles and responsibilities between husband and wife and the scope and frequency of their communication--are related to their fertility and contraceptive use. The extent to which family planning programs contribute to fertility decline, over and above the effects due to modernization and development, remains unanswered empirically. The following gaps in the literature were observed: the need for more research on the role of the male partner in determining fertility and contraceptive use, the experiential or behavioral determinants of fertility and contraceptive use, employment history, environmental aspects, and integration of the area into theoretical framework(s) capable of empirical verification.",

These reasons are five in number: homosexuality is held to be unnatural, abnormal, a perversion, morally wrong or sinful and aesthetically repellent or disgusting. The first three of these unfavourable characterisations of homosexuality apply to it primarily as an orientation, a disposition to engage in homosexual activity, whether the disposition is manifested or not. The other two, the moral and aesthetic ones, so far as most of their proponents are concerned, apply only to homosexuality, as manifested in actual conduct. The desire to sin, after all, is a necessary condition of virtue. There is no merit in not doing things one has no desire to do. Similarly the desire to do something disgusting is hardly, in itself, disgusting.",

      "abstract": "Most people in Euro‚ÄêAmerican and industrialized societies strongly believe in fidelity and most are, in fact, sexually faithful to their romantic partners. However, infidelity (also called extramarital or extrarelational sex) does occur. Several factors increase the likelihood of infidelity (e.g., gender, frequent travel); of these, relational factors (e.g., conflict, dysfunctional communication) are the most powerful. Infidelity has many negative consequences. The cheating partner often experiences guilt, anxiety, and fear; the cheated‚Äêon partner typically experiences feelings of jealousy, anger, self‚Äêdoubt, and betrayal; and the relationship itself often does not survive. Researchers who study responses to (imagined) infidelity generally find that both men and women consider emotional infidelity (their partner falling in love with someone else) to be more upsetting than sexual infidelity (their partner engaging in sexual activity with someone else). However, two sex differences are commonly found: when asked to select the most distressing event, more men than women select sexual infidelity, and more women than men choose emotional infidelity. Although scholars continue to debate the origin of these sex differences, all agree that infidelity is an upsetting and destructive event in the life of most monogamous relationships.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety is defined as fear or worry to a perceived, imminent challenge or threat either in the present or the future. The experience would be an exaggeration in the perception of situational threats. This may cause muscular tension and guarded behaviors. The prevalence of anxiety among adults in Pakistan is 34% (range 29-66% for women and 10-33% for men).1 There is a high prevalence of anxiety in adolescents more in male gender, 22.5% 2, and an estimate of 65% in the shelter homes and 51% in the community samples of children.3 Variation in anxiety is attributable to the difference in perception and symptoms related to a threatening situation. For example, Generalized Anxiety is characterized by excessive worry about numerous things. In Social Anxiety the individual is fearful or avoidant of social interaction and situations that involve the possibility of being scrutinized. Separation Anxiety refers to fear of separation from an attachment figure. Stage Fright is characterized by a consistent failure to speak at public occasions. Among students it is common to experience Exam or Performance Anxiety, which falls under the umbrella of generalized anxiety disorder. Performance anxiety presents with worries about failure in regards to accomplishing something specific or a fear of failing to perform effectively in similar situations. It is generally noted that anxious students perform poorly and are less motivated in highly evaluated exam situations as compared to a relaxed student.4 Multiple factors can lead to the development of anxiety among students negatively impacting their performance that include; self-doubt, insufficient preparation, fear of scrutiny, and facing failure.5 Anxiety is curable and at the same time treatable. Anxiety gets worse when not attended to by engaging with appropriate services. Among students, clarity in their study goals and a stepwise approach towards their future goals can help ease the burden and the tension (anxiety) about it. A good routine and healthy eating habits have always been noted with mental well-being. Conducting a self-evaluation to determine one‚Äôs strengths and areas for improvement and adopting a clear, feasible study plan coupled with consistency has been proven very effective.",

Sociosexuality occurs in primates (prosimians, monkeys, and apes) in many forms including urinary marking, facial expressions, vocalizations, grooming, playing, mounting, and anogenital sniffing, touching, inspecting, and rubbing. Sociosexual behavior takes place between individuals of various combinations of ages and sexes. In some species such as bonobos, sociosexual activity starts in infancy and can occur as many as 30 times a day, while in other species like chimpanzees, it starts later in life and is less frequent. Sociosexual behavior can take the form of sexual competition‚Äîcompetition between members of the same sex for a mate in the form of fighting or even blocking ovulation in less‚Äêdominant individuals. Sociosexuality is interpreted as strengthening relationships, acts of dominance, reparation after fights, and reducing tension. Most data on nonhuman primate sociosexuality indicate that behaviors occurring outside of reproduction may increase future matings and/or reproductive success.",

However, few of these ideas have been tested empirically, and the limited research on the systemic functioning of incest families has resulted in contradictory findings. Results from a study describing couple and family system characteristics of 54 father-child incest families are reported. Both mothers and father perpetrators in the families were assessed. Findings from this study indicate that when compared to normative scores parents in incest families report greater than average social isolation, higher levels of family control and moral-religious emphasis, and lower emphasis on personal independence and individuation. Support was not found for an enmeshed level of family cohesion, as is often reported in the clinical literature. Nearly one-half of the couples reported clinically significant relationship distress and high levels of desired behavior change by their partner. Over one-half of the couples also reported substantial sexual discord in their relationships. The clinical and research implications of the findings are discussed.",

      "title": "A Review on Paraphilias",
      "abstract": "Sexual deviations are disorders in which the individual has fantasies, sexual desires or behaviors that are repetitive and sexually provocative and often include inhumane issues for at least 6 months. Since these people¬†¬† usually make various legal problems for both themselves and others, this disorder is of special interest. Different models have discussed on the etiology of sexual deviations among of which the special psychoanalysis of Freud have investigated this disorder more comprehensively. In Freudian‚Äôs psychoanalysis, sexual deviation has a neurosis structure and shows that sexual deviated has in fact accepted the deprivation of the mother,¬† but is still trying to return to the bosom of the mother and the denying father. Also, in self-psychology the sexual deviant who has had wrong repeating scenarios in regards to his/hers relationship with parents or as a sadistic seeks to create a temporary and false glorious sense of confidence, to create¬† a¬†¬† grandiose self who is self- sufficient and does not need anyone. In many cases body organ justifications are also considered for sexual deviations. Among the examined patients in psychiatric clinics, 74% had hormone level disorders,¬† 27% had neurologic symptoms, 24%, had chromosomal disorders, 9%¬† had epilepsy, 4% had abnormal EEG, 4% had major psychiatric disorders¬† , and 4% had mental retardation .Some sources propose 9 identifications for sexual deviation which include: Fetishism, Pedophilia, Exhibitionism, Voyeurism, Sexual Masochism, Sexual Sadism, Transvestic fetishism, Frotteurism and Paraphilias. The treatment of sexual deviations has great complexity due to its coincidnce with psychiatric disorders such as personality disorders, as well as other factors such as the patients‚Äô shame and modesty and not stating their problems. The treatment of sexual deviation is considered to have four general purposes including a) reducing sexual desires b) giving insight and understanding to the patient c) controlling external stimuli d) treating concurrent disorders.The treatment of sexual deviation involves extensive ranges of biological therapies to mental therapies.¬† One of the major approaches to psychotherapy in the treatment of sexual deviations is the insight oriented approach that causes a person to improve his interpersonal skills and to find an acceptable method for sexual gratification. Treatment in groups through specific procedures and guidelines and practices can also help the patients. When a person has other psychiatric disorders, pharmacotherapy can treat concurrent biological problems of the individual as well as reducing sexual and obsessive desires. In rare cases where the problem is very serious or causes legal conflicts, surgical treatment is recommended. Keywords: Review, Paraphilias, ¬†Transvestic, Justice, Frotteurism",

      "abstract": "An Orientation to Conflict Conflict is like sex: it is an important and pervasive aspect of life. It should be enjoyed and should occur with a reasonable degree of frequency, and after a conflict is over the people involved should feel better than they did before. Some psychiatrists and social scientists have given conflict a bad reputation by linking it with psychopathology, social disorder, and war. Conflict can be dysfunctional, but it also can be productive. It has many positive functions, including preventing stagnation and stimulating interest and curiosity. It is the medium through which problems can be aired and solutions developed. It is the root of personal and social change. The practical and scientific issue is not how to eliminate or prevent conflict but rather how to have lively controversy rather than deadly quarrels. A conflict exists whenever incompatible activities occur. The incompatible actions may originate in one person, group, or nation (intrapersonal, intragroup, or intranational) or they may reflect incompatible actions of two or more persons, groups, or nations (interpersonal, intergroup, or international). An action that is incompatible with another action prevents, obstructs, interferes, injures, or in some way makes the latter less likely or effective. A potential conflict exists when the parties involved perceive themselves to have incompatible values, interests, goals, needs, or beliefs.",

Self-ascribed masculinity-femininity (Self-M-F) and gender-related interests showed the largest heterosexual-homosexual differences (respective ds = .60 and 1.28 for men, and -1.28 and -1.46 for women) and the largest sex differences (respective ds = 2.83 and 2.65). Instrumentality and expressiveness showed much smaller heterosexual-homosexual and sex differences. Big Five traits showed a number of small-to-moderate heterosexual-homosexual and sex differences. Bisexual men were much more like gay men than like heterosexual men in their Self-M-F and gender-related interests, whereas bisexual women were intermediate between lesbian and heterosexual women. Homosexual participants were more variable on some gender-related traits than same-sex heterosexuals were. The gender inversion hypothesis-that gay men's traits tend to be somewhat feminized and that lesbians' traits tend to be somewhat masculinized-received considerable support. Results are discussed in terms of biological and psychosocial theories of gender and sexual orientation.",

      "abstract": "A large component of women's sexual desire is responsive rather than spontaneous. Therefore, women's motivation and ability to find and respond to sexual stimuli to experience sexual arousal and subsequent sexual desire is crucial, but complex. In ongoing relationships, a woman's motivation appears to be largely influenced by her emotional intimacy with her partner and her wish to enhance it. Drugs (including androgen replacement therapy) aimed at increasing women's spontaneous sexual wanting (less characteristic of women in long-term relationships) or their arousability may have a role if other psychologic factors affecting arousability are addressed in tandem. A woman's sexual arousal is composite and complex, correlating well with how mentally exciting she finds the sexual stimulus and its context and poorly with objective genital blood flow changes. Drugs aimed at increasing the latter, including phosphodiesterase inhibitors, may have a role if there is prior careful enquiry as to whether genital engorgement is present but not attended to or is physically absent. Psychophysiologic studies to date suggest the former is common in women presenting with arousal disorder.",

      "title": "Masculinity and mental illness in and after men's intimate partner relationships",
      "abstract": "Male suicide continues to be a significant issue worldwide for which there are a myriad of social risk factors. Amongst these, distressed and/or disrupted (i.e., separation, divorce) intimate partner relationships are known to heighten men's mental illness and suicide risk. The current qualitative study offers novel insights to the connections between masculinity and mental illness in and after men's intimate partner relationships. Drawing from in-depth interviews with 47 Canadian and Australian men, three themes were inductively derived: 1) The trouble inside, 2) Breaking up and breaking down, and 3) Finding help. The 'trouble inside' results revealed relationship transitions wherein challenges to couple dynamics flowed from diverse life course events (conflict, illness, bereavement, co-parenting). Partnership transgressions (most often infidelity) also featured to heighten men's mental illness vulnerabilities and threaten the feasibility of the relationship. 'Breaking up and breaking down' chronicled participants' anxiety, depression and suicidality in the aftermath of their relationship ending. Herein, substance use and other maladaptive behaviours were used by men to blunt feelings and/or self-medicate mental illness. These strategies were ineffectual for moving on from blaming partners or grieving the loss of support and social connectedness provided by ex-partners. 'Finding help' included men's eventual self-help, uptake of informal assistance from friends and family, formal professional care services, and the use of facilitated male peer group resources. Norming the use of these diverse help resources were men's alignments to strength-based asset-building masculine ideals, wherein their help-seeking was bridged to, and reflective of their (albeit latent) commitment to better managing their mental health and future relationships. Highlighting the gendered dimensions of mental illness in men's intimate partner relationships, the current study also thoughtfully considers content and contexts for the delivery of tailored upstream suicide prevention programs focussed on men building better relationships.",

      "abstract": "Abstract First sexual intercourse is often viewed as a rite of passage to adulthood. While one's initial coital experience may lead to affirmation of self identity, it is disappointing for many, resulting an feelings of guilt and shame. If guilt feelings do emerge, the likelihood of future sexual dissatisfaction is greatly increased. In particular, women with high leuels of sexual guilttend to perceive less sexual arousal, resulting in less enjoyment from their sexual encounters. The purposes of this investigation were to identify those factors crrelated with feeling guilty about first sexual intercourse and to examine the injuence of guilt about first intercourse on current sexual satisfaction. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to never‚Äìmarried collegewomen, with the subsample for this investigation consisting of 570 women. Significant variables correlated with guilt at first sexual intercourse include uncommunicative mother and father figures, overstrict father figures, uncomfortabkness with sexuality, physiological and psychologzcalsexual dissatisfaction with first intercourse, guilt feelings about current intercourse, and psychological sexual dissatisfaction. These findings have substantial implications for sex researchers, sex therapists, family therapists, and sexuality educators who wish to promote healthy sexuality, through both attitudes and behavior.",

      "title": "Consequences of lonely experience in adolescents",
      "abstract": "The article explores the consequences of experiencing loneliness in adolescents, highlighting the negative impact on mental, physical and social health. Because adolescents feel the need to communicate and receive affection, aspiring to be understood and to have an interlocutor with whom to be honest. This stage of life often comes with emotional intensity, a state of euphoria, periods of sadness and, sometimes, a distancing from family, especially in situations of misunderstanding on the part of adults. The main danger at this stage refers to an excessive concern for oneself or the escape from interactions with others. The inability to form trusting relationships with others generates a feeling of loneliness. Relevant studies on the causes and factors that can lead to social isolation, as well as its effects on adolescents, emphasize the complexity and ambiguity of this phenomenon. The lack of a clear picture of how adolescents experience loneliness suggests that this phenomenon can take various forms. These forms can be manifested in different contexts of social isolation, either by choosing to isolate themselves or being forced to withdraw, and can influence both personal development and a wide range of causes, manifestations and effects on the existence of adolescents. When these needs are not met, there is a risk of developing emotional and social loneliness, the absence of connections with loved ones, and the search for belonging to informal groups. The article also analyzes theoretical perspectives on the fundamental needs of adolescents and how the lack of emotional connections affects personal development. Loneliness is associated with depression, anxiety, low self-esteem, poor academic performance and risk behaviors, such as substance use or suicide attempts. Social isolation also influences physical health by increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and sleep disorders. The article emphasizes the importance of multidimensional interventions for the prevention and management of this phenomenon, recommending emotional support, social activities and the development of communication skills.",

Effects of sexual music videos on viewers' gender schemasResearch suggests that music videos with sexual content have an effect on viewers' attitudes towards gender roles, including gender roles in the context of a sexual relationship [11,7,5].These findings are explained by two theories of cognition, namely, the Social Learning Theory and the Priming Theory.The Social Learning Theory claims that individuals learn from modeled behaviors [12].In this view, the repetition of stereotyped depictions of men and women in the media help shape children's gender schemas, leading children to perceive masculinity and femininity in more traditional and rigid ways [13].Priming may also play a role in how viewers perceive the sexual content of a music video.According to Priming Theory, different stimuli activate different schemas, or blueprints of a construct, which can influence cognition or behavior [14].If audiences consider music videos to be a heavily sexualized media overall, or a particular artist to have a hypersexual persona, they may view individual videos with sex-related schemas already Identifying sexual content in music videosResearch has shown that music video imagery has often been",

The couple's marital style -complementary, conflict minimizing, best friend, emotionally expressive-has important implications for degree of intimacy and the importance of sex in the relationship. When sexuality functions well in a marriage, it's a positive, integral component, contributing 15-20 percent. However, when sexuality is dysfunctional or non-existent it plays an inordinately powerful role, 50-75 percent, robbing the marriage of intimacy and vitality. Especially for best friend and emotionally expressive couples, sexual problems destroy marital viability. There is a need for empirical and clinical exploration of the reciprocal effects of marital style with sexual desire and functioning.",

      "abstract": "Mating interference is defined as any disturbance directed to a mating pair by other individuals, who are hypothesized to improve their mating success by increasing their access to reproductive partners as well as by reducing the mating success of rivals. Interference behavior can take several forms, including highly aggressive acts (sexual interruption) as well as milder forms of interference (sexual harassment) that result in a reduced likelihood of mating to ejaculation. Most reported cases of mating interference behavior in primates occur in species where males actively mate guard, or attempt to ensure female fidelity through direct forms of sexual coercion. However, sexual harassment has also been found in female and immature primates for different behavior strategies.",

This sex difference appears to be real and not an artifact of response bias, patient behavior, or clinician bias. The higher rates of mental illness among women can be linked to aspects of their societal role and particularly to aspects of the marital role. Therapists who treat women whose mental illness is in part a response to the characteristics of conventional sex roles have no treatment alternatives that are not in some way problematic. The treatment alternative chosen has, in the broadest sense, political implications for the society at large.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Hintergrund Die Zahlen von Menschen, die ihre sexuelle Identit√§t nicht als heterosexuell sondern als schwul, lesbisch, bisexuell oder in einer anderen Kategorie definieren, steigen seit Jahren leicht an; man sch√§tzt, dass in westlichen L√§ndern ca. 5% der Bev√∂lkerung zu den sexuellen Minderheiten zu rechnen sind. Diese Studie ist darauf angelegt, die psychischen Problemlagen der sexuellen Minorit√§ten anhand US-amerikanischer Bev√∂lkerungsstudien sowie weiterer wichtiger Studien aus anderen L√§ndern genauer darzustellen. Ergebnisse Zusammenfassend ergibt sich Folgendes: Unabh√§ngig vom Geschlecht liegt der Konsum von Alkohol und anderen Drogen sowie die Abh√§ngigkeit von diesen Stoffen mindestens auf dem Niveau der heterosexuellen M√§nner. Lesbisch/schwule und bisexuelle Frauen sind noch etwas st√§rker durch den Konsum von psychoaktiven Substanzen belastet als schwule und bisexuelle M√§nner. Untersucht man Belastungen durch Depressionen und Suizidversuche, findet man wiederum bei den sexuellen Minorit√§ten h√∂here Belastungen. LSB-Frauen haben die h√∂chsten Raten hinsichtlich Depressionen und √Ñngsten. Dar√ºber hinaus weisen die Daten darauf hin, dass bisexuelle M√§nner und Frauen hohe psychische Belastungen haben. Alles in allem genommen ist davon auszugehen, dass die sexuellen Minorit√§ten einen relativ hohen Bedarf an Behandlungen ihrer psychischen St√∂rungen haben. Dennoch gibt es bislang nur sehr wenige Behandlungsprogramme mit der Zielgruppe: sexuelle Minorit√§ten. Schlussfolgerungen Wir ben√∂tigen dringend deutsche Studien zu sexuellen Minorit√§ten allgemein und besonders zu trans* Personen mit ihren sehr spezifischen Problemlagen. Die Studien sollten neben den Substanzkonsumst√∂rungen der sexuellen Minorit√§ten auch andere psychische St√∂rungen erfassen. Kenntnisse √ºber die psychische Befindlichkeit sexueller Minorit√§ten sind die Grundlage f√ºr optimale Behandlungsgestaltungen.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between rape and homosexuality can be best understood by studying male rape. Offender(s) may deny homosexuality and confuse an aggressive active behaviour with a masculine (even macho) behaviour. They may project their homosexual feelings onto the victim. In the aftermath of rape, the victim may be ashamed of having lost control and may question himself about his real sexual identity. An aspect of female or male rape by a group of males may be an attempt to annihilate latent homosexual tendencies existing between members of this group. Surprisingly, in the short term, post traumatic disorder related to rape and pre-existing psychiatric disorder may develop separately, without substantial interaction. In the famous case of Schreiber described by Freud, homosexuality is assumed to play an important role in the development of paranoid schizophrenia. Cases in which schizophrenic patients (of both sexes) imagine being raped by a member of the opposite sex, may possibly challenge this opinion.",

      "title": "[Sexuality of pregnant women].",
      "abstract": "Over the time when the sexual intercourse has been considered merely one of a number of forms of sexual contact, views on sexuality during pregnancy have undergone considerable transformation. A great many of authors emphasise, that the pregnancy is a stimulus for partners to search for ways to maintain mutual emotional bond, close physical affinity and satisfy sexual needs not necessarily finished with an intercourse. The fact, that one of the two partners is pregnant, imposes some restrictions on sexual life. Not rarely, in particular in the first trimester of pregnancy, a female is little interested in sex. It is due to, inter alia, hormonal changes resulting in nausea, fatigue and increased nervosity. These symptoms contribute to general feebleness and reduction of the level of sexual needs and difficulty to become aroused and sexually ready. In spite of that, a lot of women have the need to keep physical and emotional contact with their partners. For a number of couples, pregnancy becomes a stimulus to search for new ways of pleasing each other in love play, that does not necessarily leads with an intercourse. Most studies concerning sexuality during pregnancy focus on observing sexual activity, physiological changes, mutual relationship of partners, analysis of sexual intercourses and investigation of so-called sexual satisfaction. Examination of sexual satisfaction ruchedes the frequency of sexual contacts, intercourses, foreplay, concurrence of orgasms in the two partners, partners' happiness, sexual satisfaction and mutual heartiness. In some researchers' opinion, sexual satisfaction correlates with the feeling of happiness resulting form being pregnant, pregnant woman's feeling still attractive and experience of orgasm. However, some researchers observe reduced sexual activity during pregnancy, except for the second trimester, when sexual activity is similar to the one outside pregnancy. Pregnant women prefer the following types of sexual activity: non-genital fondling, stimulation of the clitoris, vagina and breasts, oral and anal stimulation and masturbation. Females and their partners are underinformed on sexual life in pregnancy. The research indicates that 68% young mothers were not informed during pregnancy by a gynaecologist or midwife about sexual problems in pregnancy and, in particular, about possibility to derive sexual satisfaction. The research makes it evident, that experiencing sexual satisfaction by pregnant women improves their self-esteem, facilitates mutual relationship between partners and tightens the marital bond.",

      "abstract": "The research is related to social problems. People's lives are actually changing with the times. In the process of the changing, sometimes unexpected conditions arise or should not occur. This unexpected condition gradually becomes a polemic and has a negative impact on people's lives. This condition is called a social problem. Social problems cannot be ignored because they can disrupt global economic and political stability. The discussion of this research focuses on two social problems: poverty and prostitution. Poverty is the condition of a person who has no wealth, lacks, or has very low income and of course cannot fulfill his daily needs; while poverty is also closely related to prostitution. One can become a prostitute because of poverty or circumstances. Prostitution is a sexual activity outside the institution of marriage and is generally carried out by women. These two social problems can be found not only in the novel but also in the real world; so the sociology of literature is used as an approach in this research. The whole research is conducted using a qualitative descriptive method because the focus of the research is related to social problems. The results of the analysis show that this novel provides two descriptions of social problems: poverty and prostitution and these two social problems are clearly illustrated through the data obtained from the novel.",

There are a variety of individual and relational factors that can affect the frequency of sexual relations between romantic partners, such as habituation, age, physical health, psychological well‚Äêbeing, and relationship quality. Declines in sexual frequency can have consequences for the strength of romantic relationships and is predictive of relationship dissatisfaction and dissolution. Promoting open communication, encouraging a communal orientation toward sex, and breaking the cycle of anxiety and avoidance can help strengthen sexual relations for long‚Äêterm married and cohabiting couples.",

In consequence, a drug-like utilization of sexuality becomes necessary to suspend feelings of violence as well as to anaesthetize, if only temporarily, a castrated image of the self, a threatened loss of ego boundaries, or feelings of inner deadness. The primary homosexual wishes of all children, in their dual version‚Äîthe wish to possess the same-sex parent and the wish to be the opposite-sex parent‚Äîalso demands solutions in the sexuality of the adult-to-be. The early mother‚Äìchild relationship may be a decisive factor in laying the foundations for deviant sexual patterns.

      "abstract": "Objectives: Although sexuality is valued throughout the lifespan, older women's sexual expression can be influenced by physical, mental and social factors, including attitudes and stereotypes held by younger generations. By gaining an understanding of what influences negative attitudes toward sexuality and beliefs about sexual consent capacity, the stigma associated with sexuality in late life may be reduced. Method: Using vignette methodology in an online survey, we examined older women's health and young adults' (N = 606; mean age = 18.86, SD = 1.42, range 17‚Äì36) general knowledge and attitudes toward aging and sexuality, personal sexual behavior, religious beliefs and perceived closeness with an older adult on attitudes towards sexual behavior and perceptions of consent capacity among older women. Results: The health status of older women proved important in determining young adults' acceptance and perception of sexual consent capacity regarding late-life heterosexual/autoerotic and homosexual behaviors. Specifically, young adults expressed lower acceptance and more doubt regarding capacity to consent to sexual expression when the older woman was described as cognitively impaired. Additionally, young adults' personal attitudes toward late-life sexuality, but not knowledge, predicted acceptance toward sexual expression and belief in sexual consent capacity. Conclusion: Attention toward the influence of older women's cognitive health and young adults' attitudes toward late-life sexuality may prove beneficial in designing interventions to decrease the stigma associated with sexual activity in later life.",

In the current study, we sought to understand the role sexual attitudes have on sexual well-being among middle-aged and young-old adults. Using a diverse sample of participants over the age of 45 ( N = 384), a path model was analyzed to determine whether sexual attitudes contributed to sexual well-being. The model was then compared by gender. Results indicated: a) only age-relative sexual attitudes significantly contributed to sexual well-being; and b) the model was equally robust for both men and women, even though women held slightly more positive age-relative sexual attitudes than men. Therefore, among middle-aged and young-old adults, sexual well-being may be reduced by harboring negative ageist sexual attitudes. Efforts should be made to reduce stigma surrounding continued sexual activity and expression among the aged.",

      "abstract": "Sexual satisfaction plays an important role in the mental, physical, emotional, and relational lives of all individuals of all sexual orientations. However, the study of sexual satisfaction among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals has been hampered by a number of conceptual and methodological shortcomings. Research on sexual satisfaction has largely been conducted among individuals in mixed-gender relationships, thereby developing and utilizing measures that are heteronormative, penis‚Äìvagina focused, and centered on monogamy. Although conceptualizations and operationalizations of sexual satisfaction in the lives of LGB individuals have been imperfect, some key findings related to this construct can be drawn from the literature. Sexual satisfaction is directly related to relationship satisfaction and quality of communication, and inversely related to homonegativity. It varies by relationship arrangements, commitment levels, living arrangements, individual difference variables (such as age, socioeconomic status, and religious affiliation), and sexual orientation. Research on sexual satisfaction can continue to grow by searching for core elements of sexual satisfaction that might be stable across all orientations, incorporating insights from both quantitative and qualitative methods, and being mindful of traditionally excluded populations, such as individuals who are lesbian, gay, or bisexual.",

The emotional regulation is a process whereby people seek to redirect the course of their emotions. The selection or avoidance of situations is one of these strategies. Faced with an emotionally intense situation, either negative or positive, and from a subjective assessment, subjects anticipate the likely emotional consequences. This can trigger selection or avoidance strategies. The efficacy of this process is based on a balance between search for wellbeing and avoidance of discomfort, in a way that predominantly the result is emotionally positive. Different studies suggest that older people tend, more than younger people, to de seek of maintenance and a predominance of a positive emotionality. The results obtained in this study show common aspects as regard to selection strategy. However, some differences appear. In youth, others attitudes is a source of negative emotions. In middle-age, family problems and political opinions are source of rage. In older people, everything that refers to the negative aspects of ageing, such as sickness and passivity, is avoided. The avoidance in older people doesn‚Äôt imply a scape, but rather neutralization or balance between their social compromise and their emotional equilibrium.",

      "abstract": "Sex offenses to children or young adolescents have become a growing public concern. Chemical castration is currently considered as the best available societal response to child sex abuse. It abolishes testosterone secretion, its effects are reversible and side effects are minor. It has been argued that offering convicted sex offenders with the possibility to be treated may be in contradiction with the bioethics principle of autonomy because the person has really no other choice -- the alternative is usually a lengthy confinement sentence. In view of this controversy, we explored lay people‚Äôs and physicians‚Äô views regarding the acceptability of chemical castration. Fifty participants (among them five physicians) judged the acceptability of castration in each of 36 scenarios consisting of all combinations of four factors: aggressor‚Äôs age (21 vs. 41-year old); (b) victim(s)‚Äô age (5, 8, or 14-year old); (c) aggressor‚Äôs psychiatric status (no psychiatric antecedents, suffers from sexual deviation, or recidivist); and (d) family‚Äôs attitude (hostile to any kind of castration vs. approve castration). Participants‚Äô ratings of acceptability were, on the average, very high, and 68% of participants considered that chemical castration was fully justified in all the cases that were shown. A small minority (8%) considered that first time offenders of young adolescents, without psychiatric antecedents, should not be chemically castrated. Another minority position (24%) expressed doubts regarding chemical castration of first time offenders without antecedents but they never strongly opposed it. Implications for bioethics are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Nella stesura di questa tesi, si sono utilizzati i termini menomazione, disabilita ed handicap considerando la definizione fornita dall'Organizzazione Mondiale della Sanita.\r\n Menomazione: Qualsiasi perdita o anormalita a carico di una struttura o di una funzione psicologica, fisiologica o anatomica.\r\n Disabilita: qualsiasi limitazione o perdita (conseguente a menomazione) della capacita di compiere un'attivita nel modo o nell'ampiezza considerati normali un essere umano.\r\n Handicap: condizione di svantaggio conseguente a una menomazione o a una disabilita che in un certo soggetto limita o impedisce l'adempimento dei ruolo normale in relazione all'eta, sesso e fattori socio\r\n culturali.\r\n Facendo riferimento alla definizione di Handicap come condizione di svantaggio, bisogna sottolineare come gli oggetti e l'ambiente stesso che ci circonda, tramite una pessima o ottima progettazione, possano peggiorare o migliorare le condizioni di vita delle persone, indipendentemente dalla foro condizione fisica. E' infatti dovuta ai fattori socio\r\n culturali non propriamente positivi la presenza della maggior parte delle barriere che oggi impediscono la completa godibilita dell'ambiente (domestico e non) alla totalita delle persone.\r\n Chiaramente, il problema e di maturazione culturale, di avere la sensibilita non solo all'inserimento sociale dell' handicappato, ma anche di essere consapevoli dei diritto di questi a non subire discriminazioni legate al proprio stato. Nell'anno 2000 non e purtroppo difficile trovare sui quotidiani casi di intolleranza o di insofferenza verso queste persone: casi in cui, ad esempio, la persona handicappata, a causa dei parere contrario dei condominio, non riesce ad ottenere (od ottiene con grandi difficolta) l'installazione di un ascensore o di un servoscala, poiche rovinerebbe l'immagine, oppure casi di albergatori che non riescono a far occupare dalle persone senza disabilita fisiche le camere con bagni accessibili a tutti. Le stesse aziende produttrici fanno molta attenzione al modo in cui proporre prodotti accessibili a tutti paura di farli ricadere nella sottofascia per handicappati.\r\n E' pero altrettanto doveroso sottolineare come il diritto di fruire completamente dei luoghi e dei contesto in cui si vive, e espressamente previsto dall'ART. 3 della Costituzione della Repubblica Italiana, che recita: Tutti i cittadini hanno pari dignita sociale e sono eguali davanti alla legge, senza distinzioni di sesso, di razza, di lingua, di religione, di opinioni politiche, di condizioni personali e sociali.\r\n E' compito della repubblica rimuovere gli ostacoli di ordine economico e sociale, che limitando di fatto le liberta e l'eguaglianza dei cittadini, impediscono il pieno sviluppo della persona umana e l'effettiva partecipazione di tutti i lavoratori all'organizzazione politica, economica e sociale dei Paese. \r\n E' stata ritenuta utile una tesi di laurea su questo tema dopo aver riscontrato le grandi difficolta che i disabili devono superare nell'ambiente abitativo, sia quanto riguarda l'autonomia, sia la qualita della vita, in cui tutto e pensato unicamente con criteri ergonomici utenti non disabili.\r\n Gli ambienti domestici in cui si verificano le maggiori difficolta sono la cucina e il bagno. E' stato analizzato l'ambiente della cucina perche il bagno esistono diverse soluzioni progettuali.\r\n La tesi e stata sviluppata in due parti, una parte di ricerca, che ha fornito il sistema\r\n delle prestazioni richieste ed una di progetto, che ha soddisfatto le prestazioni\r\n richieste che si ritenevano prioritarie.\r\n Il sistema delle prestazioni richieste: sono state analizzate le esigenze emerse\r\n dall'intero sistema d'utenza e sono state illustrate tramite una sezione esplicativa\r\n accompagnata da degli elaborati grafici. In dettaglio:\r\n -Le complessita relative ai diversi tipi di utenza: l'utenza d'uso, di produzione, di\r\n gestione e sociale\r\n -Gli ausili necessari agli utenti disabili la deambulazione\r\n -I dati antropometrici degli utenti d'uso\r\n -Le tipologie ambientali ricorrenti in cucina\r\n -Le attrezzature indispensabili in cucina\r\n -Il lavoro che in cucina e necessario compiere durante la preparazione dei pasti.\r\n Il sistema delle prestazioni fornite: il progetto\r\n -Il sistema delle prestazioni fornite si e tradotto, tramite alcuni elaborati grafici, in\r\n un prodotto di produzione industriale:\r\n una postazione che permette la preparazione dei cibi e il lavaggio delle\r\n stoviglie, con caratteristiche di flessibilita di installazione e di componenti,\r\n che permette l'utilizzo sia ad utenti disabili che ad utenti con mobilita non\r\n compromessa.\r\n Sulla base dei risultati della ricerca delle prestazioni richieste, eseguita nell'anno\r\n 1999, e stato sviluppato un progetto preliminare, costituito da elaborati grafici e\r\n tridimensionali che rappresentavano i vincoli e le prestazioni a cui il progetto doveva\r\n rispondere. Nel mese di gennaio 2000 e stato proposto a FRANKE S.p.A., nella\r\n persona dei Dott. Zeno Fontana, una collaborazione nello sviluppo industriale del\r\n progetto preliminare, che ha avuto la durata di circa un anno (gennaio- dicembre 2000) e che ha portato alla realizzazione di un prototipo ligneo in scala 1:1.",

      "abstract": "For various reasons a person may wish to have mental states other than the ones she actually has. Let us consider a few examples. I may wish to have more of a taste for dry wines, since my wine-connoisseur friends serve only dry wines at their parties. Or, I may wish to believe that my spouse is not having an affair, though all the evidence suggests that she is. Or, suppose I strongly disapprove of racially mixed marriages. When an old friend asks me to be her best man in a racially mixed wedding, I may wish that my moral stand on this issue were different. The mental states that I wish for may be desires-as in the case of the dry wines-or beliefs-as in the case of my unfaithful spouse-or moral judgments-as in the case of the racially mixed wedding. It is not uncommon for someone to try to realize these wishes. Such attempts typically involve a project rather than a simple act of will: they can only be achieved in some roundabout way. A common strategy is to act as if one already had the projected mental state. To complete such a project successfully is to acquire the mental state in question intentionally through as if actions.

      "abstract": "Suppression of reproduction refers to the inhibition or impairment of reproductive development, reproductive physiology, and/or reproductive behavior in response to social stimuli. In both male and female primates, cues from or interactions with conspecifics can inhibit reproductive development in juveniles, as well as reproductive physiology and sexual behavior in adults. In males, reproductive maturation may be delayed, and adult testosterone levels and sexual behavior are often reduced, in low‚Äêranking individuals compared to dominants. Female reproductive maturation can be delayed by the presence of a dominant female and/or the absence of an unrelated adult male, while numerous aspects of adult female reproductive function can be inhibited by cues from same‚Äêsex rivals or adult males. Social suppression of reproduction appears to be a mechanism whereby individuals avoid investing in reproductive attempts that are likely to fail due to inauspicious social conditions, thereby increasing the likelihood of breeding successfully in the future.",

And yet, with rare exceptions, the area of erotic transference/countertransference in the treatment of adolescents is largely ignored in analytic writing. The catastrophic prospect of boundary violations, particularly with minors, can lead to a timid avoidance of the erotic in the work with adolescents, yielding is term as ‚Äòerotic insufficiency‚Äô. The body of the adolescent is changing radically before his or her own, as well as the eyes. The emerging bodily experiences of the adolescent (first menstruation, first wet dream, first masturbation to orgasm, etc.) are parts of a ‚Äòvirgin territory‚Äô. Timid avoidance of erotic feelings in the consulting room deprives adolescents of sincere adult thinking in relation to allowing and managing sexual feelings.",

The cohabitors felt repressed by authority and used marijuana, LSD, and speed with greater frequency than marrieds. They entered an ephemeral relationship with more previous sexual experiences of poor quality and were less committed to the relationship, although they were as faithful as married individuals while in the relationship. Cohabitors tended to be more dissatisfied with life, nonconforming, rebellious, fearful of close ties, withdraum, and more likely to experience internal conflicts and bizarre thoughts or behavior. They evidenced greater restlessness, impulsiveness, and scattered interests and energies. Their interpersonal relationships tended in the direction of superficiality, and attitudes of self-criticism seemed prevalent. Cohabiting males were more demanding, sensitive, idealistically and aesthetically inclined, blaming and touchy. Cohabiting females were more likely to be shy and retiring in unfamiliar situations than married females. In general, coha bitors tended to be more discouraged and less well-adjusted than marrieds.",

Evidence suggests that cultural factors are intertwined with these concepts. Exploration of sexual minorities' experiences has been neglected. Recently, a body of evidence is developing concerning this population, with theoretical speculation for changes of ‚Äústressors‚Äù for future generations and implications, particularly, on mental health. Lesbian and Gay (LG) individuals of faith (or spirituality) are susceptible to unique ‚Äústressors‚Äù; however, religion can provide a support network providing protective health benefits. This review systematically explores the existing evidence for the subjective experiences and accounts of LG people of faith. Sexual minority individuals who follow a religion or faith can experience good social support, reducing the risk of negative health outcomes, while for others, potentially serious, negative mental and physical health consequences are experienced (e.g., internalised homophobia, anxiety, rejection and suicidal ideation).",

      "abstract": "On the basis of family histories, a series of psychoneurotic patients in a university psychiatric clinic was compared to a group of their contemporaries not selected as to mental disease. Minor illnesses and family difficulties were disregarded throughout. The results indicated that 2 concepts (intrafamily conflict and mental disease in some member of the family group) are important concomitants of neurosis. The following conclusions were suggested by the data. Mental illness in parents, separation of parents or lack of adjustment between them, rejection by parent figures, parental overrestriction, mental illness in siblings or disturbed relationships between them, and disruption of the subject's marriage are indicated considerably more frequently in those students suffering from psychoneurosis than in the university population at large. Death, prolonged physical illness or foreign birth of parents, extra relatives living in the home, sibling favoritism, lack of siblings, and factors relating to size of sibship or relative ages of siblings are found no more often in the neurotics than in the others. The margin of difference between the two sets of items is great enough to suggest that the same conclusions may be true for psychoneurotic people in general.",

However, this couple accused one another of having low sexual desire. While the wife admitted her desire problem, she primarily blamed her husband's lack of passion for her decreased libido. The husband denied that he has low sexual desire for his wife. He claimed that he is extremely attracted to her, and that she continues to reject him. The treatment model integrated psychoanalytic conflict theory and psychodynamic systems theory. The hypothesis was that underlying loyalty conflicts emanating from each partner's family of origin have been primarily responsible for the couple's sexual symptoms, and therefore must be resolved in order to help the couple achieve a healthier sex life. Following 5 years of treatment, the couple did become closer and less volatile. They have also achieved great financial success. However, their sex life has not prospered to the couple's satisfaction; thus they have decided to continue treatment.",

This study considered whether stress must reach a critical threshold before hindering couples‚Äô sexual activity and physical affection (i.e., a curvilinear association). Couples ( N = 144 couples plus four additional wives) completed two 14-day daily diary tasks during the early years of marriage. Multilevel modeling revealed a within-person curvilinear association between daily stress and sexual activity. Contrary to expectations, the likelihood of sexual activity declined as stress increased from low to moderate, then leveled off as stress continued to increase. For physical affection, a linear effect emerged. On days of greater stress, women, but not men, reported less affection. Further analyses suggested that women‚Äôs stress is more influential than men‚Äôs stress for couple‚Äôs physical intimacy. Findings highlight the nuanced ways in which stress is linked to a vital component of satisfying relationships.",

In these ways it can be recognised as a precursor of the disturbances of sexuality which have been more commonly studied as manifestations of adult emotional life. From the beginning of life physiological growth and functioning can be seen as interrelating with the growth of personality, sensory and sensual experience with infantile 'pre-genital' sexuality, and all linking in many complex ways with the development of character traits and personal relationships. Whereas infantile sexuality is characterised as being experimental and imitative in terms of phantasies about the parental relationship, and predominantly masturbatory in aim, adult sexuality is envisaged as essentially creative and reciprocal.",

Epidemiological and clinical studies show that depression is associated with impairments of sexual function and satisfaction, even in untreated patients. Most antidepressant drugs have adverse effects on sexual function, but accurate identification of the incidence of treatment-emergent dysfunction has proved troublesome, as disturbances of the sexual response can only be detected in a reliable fashion when systematic enquiries are made before and during the course of treatment. Growing awareness of the adverse effects of many antidepressants on sexual function has led to attempts to resolve dysfunction though adjuvant or substitution treatment approaches. There is a need for further studies of the effects of antidepressants on sexual function.",

      "abstract": "There are many methodological problems in current research on the sexual behavior of the elderly. As a consequence the results should more be considered as qualitative cues than as quantitative facts. For the main result (less speed and less intensity) several examples for both sexes are given. The elderly are sexually rather active. Forms of tenderness are more and more important and forms of genital activity lose their former importance. Several influencing factors on sexual behavior of the elderly are described (sex, marital status, health, harmony between the partners, importance of sexuality in the former life). An overview of some theories demonstrates the complexity of the causes of sexual behavior in old age. For the physician it is recommended to discuss possible consequences of medical treatments on sexual life with the patient and his or her partner. In institutions the privacy of the elderly should be respected.",

      "abstract": "The welfare of animals does not invariably coincide with efficient agricultural production. Lack of welfare is the result of maladjustment of the animal to its environment. Maladjustment causing lack of welfare relates to physiology, veterinary medicine and/or ethology. Physiological and veterinary maladjustment may be, but does not necessarily have to be, associated with diminished welfare. Ethological maladjustment resulting in diminshed welfare prevents an action from being performed or being performed satisfactorily, although the animal is prompted to do so. Failure to perform an action or to perform it satisfactorily is due to: (1) absence of specific stimuli (deprivation), (2) obstruction of a particular activity (frustration), (3) absence of satisfaction when the action has been performed. Welfare is a relative concept. Profit is a matter related to welfare. Determining the relationship between welfare and profit is a scientific matter. The choice between welfare and profit is an ethical matter.",

Also the development of negative feelings and\nexperiences represented by the development of specific fears\ncorresponds to the expected developmental trends. Experienced\nfears are shifting from specific, concrete contents to more\ngeneral and abstract ones; there is an increase in the\nfrequency of pro-social fears related to close persons.

      "abstract": "Summary (A) There are data showing beyond question a gender gap, with women living longer than men, especially in economically developed societies. There is greater male vulnerability to the major causes of human death. (B) In lower animals there are data suggesting a female survival advantage to adult life in many species, but the observations do not consider longevity or survival to an advanced age. (C) In laboratory rodents kept under controlled conditions the relationship of sex to longevity is variable, with males sometimes showing greater longevity than females and with life span being dependent on factors like breeding and diet. (D) Similar genetic and hormonal processes operate in humans and in non‚Äêhuman mammals including the genetic mechanism of sex determination, the hormonal consequences of sex determination, and the effects of hormones on processes which affect longevity such as cholesterol levels and immune functions. (E) Causes of death in humans and animals are different, and it seems unlikely, therefore, that the same mechanisms could be determinants of longevity in all mammalian species. (F) Human male and female longevity continue to change, and it is likely that the gender gap will narrow, with societal and medical changes in post‚Äêindustrial societies reducing the male disadvantages in behaviour and in the handling of cholesterol. (G) It remains an important question whether part of the gender gap seen in humans is based on other differences in the basic biology of males and females.",

Neurotic men and women tend to idealize extremely symbiotic-like openness, high dominance and autonomy, concerning the own person as well as the partner. So they aspire to character attributes rather giving rise to problems in relationships than preventing them. Pretentions to the quality of partnerships in the clinical sample are higher than in normal population. Women in the clinical sample aspire to the former social roles of men which causes dispositions of struggles of power. Depressive characteristics of anancastic men are judged as reliability and seriousness by the women whereas men want women to be hysteric, charming, kind, and fond of life so that men dislike women's depressivity. Self-contentment and partner-contentment increase during therapy. Psychic and psycho-somatic symptoms decrease, the partner's support or non-support seems to influence the capability of attaining one's own therapy goals.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Research provides evidence of a distinctive gendered landscape of mental illness, with women and men differing in the types of disorder they commonly experience ‚Äì a landscape that is not specific to Western societies. While there are no marked gender differences in the rates of psychoses like schizophrenia or in dementia, women have higher levels of affective disorders, such as depression, and of anxiety disorders, and men have higher levels of substance abuse and conduct disorders. Consequently the observed gender difference in overall levels of mental illness depends on what disorders are included in the measure. The gendered patterning of mental disorders is now usually linked to differences between women and men in gender‚Äêrelated tendencies to internalize or externalize their feelings, women more often internalizing their feelings and men more often externalizing them. While such differences may be influenced by genetic factors, they also relate to the socialization of women and men in childhood ‚Äì a gender socialization that is linked to the expectations of what is required of them in adult life. Further differences in women's and men's social situations also have a direct impact on the gender‚Äêrelated expression of feelings in the face of life events and difficulties.",

      "title": "[Psychiatric complications of abortion].",
      "abstract": "The psychiatric consequences of induced abortion continue to be the object of controversy. The reactions of women when they became aware of conception are very variable. Pregnancy, whether initially intended or unintended, may provoke stress; and miscarriage may bring about feelings of loss and grief reaction. Therefore, induced abortion, with its emotional implications (of relief, shame and guilt) not surprisingly is a stressful adverse life event. METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS: There is agreement among researchers on the need to compare the mental health outcomes (or the psychiatric complications) with appropriate groups, including women with unintended pregnancies ending in live births and women with miscarriages. There is also agreement on the need to control for the potential confounding effects of multiple variables: demographic, contextual, personal development, previous or current traumatic experiences, and mental health prior to the obstetric event. Any psychiatric outcome is multi-factorial in origin and the impact of life events depend on how they are perceived, the psychological defence mechanisms (unconscious to a great extent) and the coping style. The fact of voluntarily aborting has an undeniable ethical dimension in which facts and values are interwoven.No research study has found that induced abortion is associated with a better mental health outcome, although the results of some studies are interpreted as <<neutral>> or <<mixed.>> Some general population studies point out significant associations with alcohol or illegal drug dependence, mood disorders (including depression) and some anxiety disorders. Some of these associations have been confirmed, and nuanced, by longitudinal prospective studies which support causal relationships.With the available data, it is advisable to devote efforts to the mental health care of women who have had an induced abortion. Reasons of the woman's mental health by no means can be invoked, on empirical bases, for inducing an abortion.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although watching movies is typically enjoyable, they also can elicit discomfort. The present studies investigated what makes some moviegoing experiences emotionally uncomfortable. Using autobiographical memory (Study 1) and scenarios/vignettes methodology (Study 2), young adults remembered watching a movie that had made them uncomfortable or responded to scenarios about watching a particular type of movie with particular co‚Äêviewers (e.g. violent movie with one's spouse). Movies eliciting discomfort were most often dramas (39%) or comedies (26%). Discomfort most often arose from content, particularly fairly explicit sex or violence, and secondarily from the presence of co‚Äêviewers. Often the two interacted, for example, being uncomfortable watching explicit sex with one's parents. In terms of dealing with the discomfort, women were overall more direct and men more avoidant. A sizable minority was glad they had seen the film, in spite of the discomfort, and was open to seeing it again. Arguing from converging evidence, these different methodologies produced consistent results. Copyright ¬© 2010 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Sexual harassment is unwanted and unwanted behavior or attention of a sexual nature and results in disturbing the harasser. Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to: sexual payments for wanting something, coercion of sexual activity, derogatory statements about sexual orientation or sexuality, requests for sexual favors by the perpetrator, speech or behavior that has a sexual connotation; all can be classified as sexual harassment. This action can be conveyed directly or implicitly. The effect is on the victim, who is considered to be causing problems and not the perpetrator. In general, victims will keep their mouths shut, sometimes for a very long time, for these reasons, and there is a fear that they will become targets of abuse. They don't talk about it with friends or family. The healing process will be more difficult when there is denial from the institution, distrust, or blaming the victim. The rampant sexual harassment that is happening in Indonesia is troubling most people. Even during the current covid-19 pandemic, there is an increase in sexual harassment that occurs against women, even worse, it also happens to children who are still underage. Komnas Perempuan identified that during 2001 to 2012, there were at least 35 women who were victims of sexual violence every day. Meanwhile, the data released by Komnas Perempuan during the current covid-19 pandemic is 1,902 cases of sexual harassment that have occurred in Indonesia, as of Saturday, July 3, 2021. In this case, it is clear that there is still a lack of legal protection for cases involving threaten a person's personal personality, especially in cases of sexual harassment to sexual violence.",

In the current study, a thematic analysis was conducted to identify patterns in semi-structured interviews with 47 older adults, aged 60-91. The analysis yielded seven themes that describe why older adults refrain from sex: 1) avoiding confronting sexual dysfunctions, 2) avoiding confronting the aging body, 3) avoiding performance anxiety, 4) being uninterested in sexual activity, 5) taking time to grieve the loss of a partner, 6) avoiding judgment, and 7) seeing sexuality as evolving and changing. Themes were organized according to the bio-psycho-social perspective and based on the axis of personal (self-focused) and interpersonal (partner-focused) motives. It is perfectly acceptable for people to refrain from sexual activity for their own reasons. However, if older adults want to remain sexually active, they should receive complete information about the many possibilities of treating different sexual problems in later life and about the many ways, beyond sexual penetration, one can enjoy sexual activity even in old age.",

      "abstract": "Using traditional clinical approaches and the results of extensive statistical researches of recent years, the author comprehensively analyzed the development and the functioning of a romantic relationship with a narcissist. Love is one of the most popular means providing narcissistic aspirations. Probably, this way is chosen by individuals with the appropriate potential (attractiveness, charm, sexually inviting behavior) to satisfy their own narcissism. It is relatively easy to achieve an idealization from a romantic partner, her/his emotional dependence and power over him/her. Such perspectives create hope for a narcissist to transform his/her life by filling him/herself with the love of the partner, which should compensate childhood emotional traumas and reinforce the narcissist's extremely inflated but fragile self-esteem. Narcissists are extremely successful in the relationship initiation and its initial phase, creating an impression of ideal love. However, they experience significant problems in the later stages of relationship development. They do not want to build a partnership at all, always remain opened to new relationships. When it is no longer possible to increase admiration by his/her partner, they switch to the strategy of rivalry. Through the use of various forms of abuse, exploitation and infidelity, the narcissist strengthens his/her self-esteem, feeling power over his/her partner and her/his emotional dependence. This causes the partner's emotional injuries, who over time also begins to reject and avoid the narcissist. The consequences for the narcissist are: reduced quality of life, low relationship satisfaction and feelings of loneliness. But since narcissism is largely determined genetically, by a history of significant relationships in childhood and provides partially successful adaptation, the prospects for changing the narcissistic style of romantic relationships through psychotherapy are pessimistic. However, psychological help is necessary and effective for a narcissist's romantic partner.",

      "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) involves challenges in social communication and repetitive behaviors, impacting daily functioning. Individuals with ASD face unique difficulties regarding sexuality, often experiencing mismatches between sexual development and social maturity, leading to potential inappropriate behaviors. Social competence deficits may limit their understanding of sexuality, increasing risks of offending or victimization. Gender differences in sexual behavior are evident, with males showing earlier and more frequent sexual activity, while females demonstrate greater flexibility in sexual orientation. This paper presents six clinical cases highlighting the diverse experiences of sexuality and gender identity in autistic individuals, offering insights into the complex interactions between ASD, gender, and sexual behavior.",

      "abstract": "Romantic (typically sexual) relationships are important to personal, physical, mental, social, and economic well-being, and to human evolution. Yet little is known about factors contributing to long-term lack of intimate relationships. We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in ~400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and ~13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g., upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% (SE = 4%) and 14% (SE = 3%) of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56 (SE = 0.17). Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset. Our findings uncover multifaceted correlates of human intimacy and raise important lines of enquiry in the evolutionary and social sciences.",

      "title": "P‚Äì487 Couples undergoing first level assisted reproductive techniques: An Actor-Partner interdependence model of dyadic adjustment, psychological symptoms, alexithymia and romantic attachment on body-image avoidance",
      "abstract": "Abstract Study question The study aims to assess the commonalities and interdependence of couples undergoing first-level Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) as regards body-image avoidance referred to body-image dissatisfaction. Summary answer Partners‚Äô functioning seem specular yet not interdependent, as not showing a couple-as-a-unit modality of functioning. Body-image avoidance is only influenced by intra-personal variables. What is known already: Stressful bodily emotions and body perception related to infertility and ART are critical aspects for people desiring having children. Infertility undermines women‚Äôs self-esteem and body-image, damaging their self-identity as women, while in males infertility associates with body dissatisfaction referring to perceived reduced physical fitness and personal failure, thus undermining their body virility. For infertile women, body-image dissatisfaction associates with reduced marital adjustment, and vice-versa; yet no study has considered how males body-image dissatisfaction associates with marital satisfaction. Nonetheless, couples should be considered as a unit, considering that infertile couples‚Äô adjustment is influenced by their own, and their partners‚Äô, perceived stress. Study design, size, duration The study follows a cross-sectional design and is part of an ongoing transversal and longitudinal project, started in 2012, investigating the well-being of couples undergoing ART. For the present study only a minority of the existing data were considered, thus only including couples at the first level of ART with the intent of investigating couples‚Äô commonalities and interdependence before treatments pervasiveness increases. Participants/materials, setting, methods Minimum N = 79 couples needed to be considered according to Power analysis results. N = 118 couples aged 24 to 46 years (women Mage=34.92, SD = 3.98; men Mage=37.45, SD = 5.25) were included, and declaring trying to get pregnant from 1 to 8 years (M = 3.18; SD = 1.99) and to never had children, although 22.9% of women had at least an abortion. Participants completed the Body-Image Avoidance Questionnaire, Toronto Alexithymia Scale‚Äì20, Dyadic Adjustment Scale, Symptom Checklist‚Äì90-Revised and Experiences in Close Relationships Scale-Revised. Main results and the role of chance The sample presents non-clinical levels of functioning referring to their psychological symptoms, alexithymia and body-image avoidance. Multivariate rank tests show that females report significantly higher levels of body-image avoidance (stat=‚Äì5.73; adj.p=.001), psychological symptoms (stat=‚Äì4.58; adj.p=.001) and romantic anxious attachment (stat=‚Äì3.33; adj.p=.005). These differences were confirmed also after applying multiplicity control. Moreover, bi-variate Pearson‚Äôs r correlations show an association among partners‚Äô dyadic adjustment (r=.293; p&amp;lt;.001), albeit their overall level of dyadic adjustment is low. Significant correlations among partners also emerged as regards psychological symptoms (r=.258; p&amp;lt;.001) and alexithymia (r=.16; p=.05). The couple-effect, thus considering the couple as the unit of analysis, was modeled through an Actor-Partner Interdependence Model. For both partners, dyadic adjustment‚Äôs actor-effect associates with body-image avoidance (women: Œ≤ = 0.133, p=.026; man: Œ≤ = 0.133, p=.026). Furthermore, for both men and women, psychological symptoms‚Äô actor-effect associate to body-image avoidance (women: Œ≤ = 0.467, p&amp;lt;.00; men: Œ≤ = 0.499, p=.001). Comparing the level of influence of actor and partner effects among partners, the psychological symptoms‚Äô actor effect results significantly more influential than the partner-effect (women: Œî = 0.378, p=.015; men: Œî = 0.587, p=.001). Only for males, alexithymia‚Äôs actor effect is significant (Œ≤ = 0.499; p=.001). Limitations, reasons for caution Results should be considered in light of some limitations. Specifically, the cross-sectional study design, lack of a control group with no infertility issues, the use of self-report measures, homogeneity among couples and the sample small sample size (although sample size was appropriate to retain a power of at least .8). Wider implications of the findings: Results support the differentiation of gender-specific psychosocial interventions along the ART path, preventing and mitigating the negative impact of infertility and ART on body-image dissatisfaction and avoidance and on the couples‚Äô well-being.

      "abstract": "Male rats in one group were 5-6 months of age and in another group 20-24 months. These were allowed to copulate under two conditions. At one occasion they mated without any interference of the experimenter and at another they were handled approximately twice a minute. The older males, although sexually less vigorous than the younger males when copulating under non-handling conditions, when handled became quite as active as the younger males. It was concluded that the mating activity is determined not only by sexual stimuli but by non-sexual stimuli as well, and that the decrease in sexual activity characteristic to the old rat can be compensated for by an increase in the non-sexual sensory stimulation of the animal.",

      "abstract": "1 8 1 R F I L M I N R E V I E W C H A R L E S T A Y L O R Abdellatif Kechiche‚Äôs Blue Is the Warmest Color (La vie d‚ÄôAd√®le: Chapitres 1 et 2) is such a fearless piece of moviemaking and acting that it seems an implicit rebuke to the nervousness that now rules our sexual attitudes. Read much of the current writing on sex, listen to discussions among the educated young, and you‚Äôll Ô¨Ånd the expectation that sex should follow the neat strictures of gender theory. Or that it‚Äôs possible to strip the power balance out of sex, which, after all, is a dance of acting and being acted on. Maybe the vehemence of these discussions is the certainty that comes from inexperience or the result of too many emotionally bruising ‚Äì or worse ‚Äì nights in bed. Whatever the cause, there seems to be a desperate need to believe that consent will take the emotional risk out of sex, that sexual hunger or aggression can only ever be threats, and that they have no place in progressive notions of pleasure. And yet when I speak to other people who, like me, loved Blue Is the Warmest Color, the word they most often use to describe their reaction to it is devastated. People talk about coming through this movie as if through the turmoil of a love a‚àöair they know they‚Äôll never get over. They seem both scarred by it and grateful 1 8 2 T A Y L O R Y for the pain, as if the movie has made them feel more alive. The emotional toll Blue exacts is also its gift. At the Cannes Film Festival last May, the jury, headed by Steven Spielberg, hailed the Ô¨Ålm as a great love story and took the unexpected and courageous step of awarding the Palme d‚ÄôOr not just to Kechiche but also to his two extraordinary leads, Ad√®le Exarchopolous and L√©a Seydoux. Accepting the award onstage, the trio were all tears and embraces. The harmony was shortlived : since then, ugly charges and countercharges have passed back and forth between Kechiche and the actresses ‚Äì particularly Seydoux ‚Äì with the women claiming that the extended sex scenes left them emotionally depleted and raw, and Kechiche, feeling betrayed, Ô¨Åring back. Then Julie Maroh, the author of the graphic novel from which Kechiche and Ghayla Lacroix loosely adapted the movie, derided the Ô¨Ålm for being inauthentic to lesbian experience . And the early ecstatic reviews were followed by critical grumblings that the Ô¨Ålm was a classic example of the way the male gaze objectiÔ¨Åes women, with Kechiche‚Äôs critics astonished to Ô¨Ånd that he ignores gender theory and ideology. They‚Äôre right; Kechiche does ignore them ‚Äì because he knows that the strictures theory and ideology impose on art and experience reduce reality, strip it of nuance. But this is all so much noise compared to the Ô¨Ålm itself. Blue Is the Warmest Color is an emotionally overwhelming evocation of the rapture and rupture of Ô¨Årst love. Kechiche avoids both the dewiness of false innocence and the tears of false nostalgia that movies about romantic and sexual awakening usually invite. Blue Is the Warmest Color earns its tears, and they are scalding. Instead of fencing its young lovers within a petting zoo that allows us to mourn our lost youth from a safe distance, Kechiche removes the barriers that separate us from them. He brings the camera so close to the faces of his actresses that he seems to be trying to make their Ô¨Çesh more familiar to us than our own. At times, as they eat or kiss or sleep or merely drink each other in, it‚Äôs easy to believe that he has succeeded. Years ago, in his epitaph for Elvis Presley, the rock critic Lester Bangs began a sentence with the words ‚Äò‚ÄòIf love truly is going out of fashion forever, which I do not believe . . .‚Äô‚Äô Kechiche doesn‚Äôt believe it either.

      "title": "Sexual dysfunctions induced by stress of timed intercourse and medical treatment",
      "abstract": "Is premature ejaculation (PE) during vaginal intercourse really a male sexual dysfunction? Byun et al. 1 wrote ‚ÄòIn men PE is more common than delayed ejaculation. Timed intercourse imposes a substantial degree of stress on men‚Äô. PE is a male sexual dysfunction characterised by ejaculation that always or nearly always occurs prior to or within ‚âà1 min of vaginal penetration, and the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations, and negative personal consequences 2. Sexual medicine experts consider PE only in the case of vaginal intercourse. PE is limited to heterosexual men engaging in vaginal intercourse, as there are few studies available on PE research in homosexual men or during other forms of sexual activity 2. Today PE is considered the cause of the failure to vaginal orgasm in the partner, with negative psychological consequences in males. Byun et al. 1 wrote ‚ÄòThe impact of impending timed intercourse on sexual dysfunction and the behaviour of male partners has only recently been investigated‚Äô. Until a few decades ago during vaginal intercourse PE did not involve discomfort in males because orgasm was not essential for female sexual satisfaction: ‚ÄòUntil the mid-twentieth century, many people (including some medical authorities) believed that women were not capable of orgasm. This belief undoubtedly reflected a cultural bias: sex was seen as something the man did to the woman for his own gratification. Women were told for centuries to do their wifely duties by making themselves available to their husbands for sex‚Äô 3. As a matter of fact the vaginal orgasm does not have any scientific basis and is a theory that was invented by Freud in 1905. The vagina does not have an anatomical structure that can cause an orgasm; a minority of women says they experience vaginal orgasm because this is the term that is explained to them by sexologists. The ‚Äòvaginal orgasm‚Äô that some women report is caused by the surrounding erectile organs, i.e. clitoris, vestibular bulbs and pars intermedia, labia minora, corpus spongiosum of female urethra. Distinguishing between clitoral and vaginal orgasm is not correct from a physiological view point 3, 4. The vaginal orgasm and G-spot do not exist 3-5, therefore the duration of penile‚Äìvaginal intercourse is not important for a woman's orgasm. Even today there exists only one model of physical relations: foreplay, penetration, intercourse, and ejaculation. Many men think long intercourse is the key to having orgasm during intercourse, but long intercourse is not helpful to most women. As male ejaculation does not automatically mean the end of sex for most women, touching and kissing can be continued almost indefinitely. Men think of the preliminaries as an unnecessary delay, and sexologists describe non-coital sexual activity (i.e. partner masturbation and oral sex) by the term ‚Äòforeplay‚Äô, which implies that these acts are preliminary to intercourse, making intercourse the main event, but some people prefer other forms of sexual activity instead of coitus. Intercourse must not be the focal point of sex, ‚Äòforeplay‚Äô is misleading term and it must be discarded 3. Physiologically female sexual satisfaction is based on orgasm and resolution. Women with effective sexual stimulation have the physical capability of being orgasmic at all ages: clitoral stimulation is important for achieving the orgasm 3, 4. Byun et al. 1 wrote ‚ÄòPhysicians and clinicians should acknowledge the potentially harmful effects of timed intercourse on the physical and mental health of men‚Äô. Physicians and clinicians must acknowledge that PE is normal and it is common for any healthy adolescent man. It is important for teenagers to understand that PE is absolutely normal at this age. PE is really normal in adolescent males, especially during their first sexual encounters 3. Men with PE have no negative personal consequences during masturbation: as a matter of fact PE does not exist when the orgasm and ejaculation are obtained by masturbation. By masturbation adolescent will understand their responses and men will be able to gain better control also during intercourse. Masturbation provides a safe means of sexual experimentation, improving sexual self-confidence. In the ‚Äòstop-start‚Äô method the male stimulates the penis manually until him feels that he is rapidly approaching ejaculation, at which time he stops all stimulation until the sense of ejaculatory urgency disappears. Stimulation then begins again, and the stop-start cycle is repeated several times before the man is allowed to ejaculate. In the ‚Äòsqueeze‚Äô technique the man puts his first and second fingers on the frenulum of the penis and places his thumb just below the coronal ridge on the opposite side of the penis. A firm pressure is applied for about four seconds and then abruptly released. The ‚Äòsqueeze‚Äô technique reduces the urgency to ejaculate. It must begin at the early stages of masturbation and continue periodically, every few minutes. In the basilar squeeze the squeezing is at the base of the penis 3. PE has become the centre of a multimillion dollar business: PE during vaginal intercourse is not a male sexual dysfunction. ‚ÄòPE does not exist if both partners agree that the quality of their sexual encounters is not influenced by efforts to delay ejaculation‚Äô and ‚ÄòSome females may be grateful to get it over with quickly‚Äô. 3. Physicians and clinicians must acknowledge two specific methods called the ‚Äòstop-start‚Äô method and the ‚Äòsqueeze‚Äô technique that helps recondition the ejaculatory reflex during masturbation. Non-coital sexual acts after male ejaculation can be used to produce orgasm in women. Physicians, clinicians, urologists, gynaecologists, sexologists, and sexual medicine experts should define having sex/making love, as the situation in which orgasm happens in both partners with or without vaginal intercourse: a definition for all human beings 4, 6. Sexual dysfunctions are conditions in which the ordinary physical responses of sexual function are impaired. The study of the functions of the human body must be made in the subject: questionnaires for male ejaculation and female orgasm must too assess masturbation 7.",

For older people with disabilities (PWD), age and disability status intersect to create unique sexual experiences and needs that have long been stigmatised, resulting in limited access to sexual citizenship. Of particular importance are the socio-cultural realities of ageism and ableism that pose specific challenges to the pursuit of sexual wellness, and can serve to invalidate and/or inhibit access to a rich and beneficial intimate life. These realities are impacted by the varied biological, psychological, social and cultural factors across the life course to shape the sexual trajectory of older PWD.

      "title": "Introduction Into the Diagnostics and Treatment of Premature Ejaculation: Sexuality Has Many Facets",
      "abstract": "This interesting article leaves many questions unanswered. Even though meaningful long-term studies are lacking, the authors neither discussed the course of premature ejaculation between individuals and in the same individual nor whether symptoms are due to a particular sexual partner or to the man‚Äôs form of the day. Etiologically, distress or particular personality traits were left out of the discussion, as were aspects of whether premature ejaculation is the cause or effect of a partner interaction that may be problematic only at second glance, whether the symptoms occur regularly, or whether the same man also has these problems while masturbating. And what about the influence of circumcision? It seems that the regions with a reportedly high prevalence of premature ejaculation ‚Äì such as South America and Asia ‚Äì represent typical macho cultures, rather than focusing on the female orgasm in particular, as the authors claim.\r\n\r\nIf the high prevalence of 30% worldwide (1) is true then this could be due to a physiological variant to the norm. To suggest that this has the status of an illness ‚Äì presumably in order to have reasons for (psycho)therapeutic or pharmacological interventions, financed by the health insurance companies ‚Äì is something that should be subject to critical questioning (2). authors do not mention that human sexuality may have many more facets and be much more subtle (3) than the actual act of intercourse would reflect. From this perspective, in many men, the subjective experience of illness ‚Äì which may well be zeitgeist-oriented and depend on their individual disposition ‚Äì might even be increased. However, a man‚Äôs procreative ability does not seem to be appreciably affected by premature ejaculation. Further, at a time of high global promiscuity, premature ejaculation may be an advantage in terms of procreative strategy, pointedly formulated as in the tried and tested principle: The early bird catches the worm.",

      "title": "Invisible victims: battered women in psychiatric and medical emergency rooms.",
      "abstract": "Violence against women by their male partners is widespread and infrequently identified as a causal factor in multiple physical and psychological problems of female patients in medical and psychiatric settings. Three main countertransferences that interfere with accurate identification of battered women are described: (1) counter- identification, (2)countertransference rage, and (3) countertransference helplessness. Battering men and battered women are found in all levels of society, although younger, lower income, less-educated men who have observed parental violence in their own home are at higher risk of abusing their spouses. Additionally, antisocial personality disorder, depression, and/or alcohol and drug abuse increase the risk of male violence in the home. Contrary to popular belief, the husband-to-wife violence is usually motivated by his need to control her rather than a result of his loss of control. Battered women show no consistent prebattering risk markers, except for a history of parental violence in their family of origin. Violence against women by their male partners is a serious public health problem that has not been adequately addressed by the medical and psychiatric professions. Myths and clinical realities of battered women are described and detailed recommendations for clinical inquiry and evaluation of level of danger are given.",

Two paths seem possible: either sexuality is to be fully enjoyed, or it is for reproduction. For each of these schemas, we start from a given point (sexuality and its characteristics) and we look forward to reaching another point (i.e. satisfying enjoyment or making a child). We also encounter difficulties or conflicts in the given sexuality, in the symptoms, and then look forward to solving the problems and curing the sane person behind the patient. All these schemas can be represented with an arrow between two points: (given sexuality) ‚óè ‚Üí ‚óè (full enjoyment) (given sexuality) ‚óè ‚Üí ‚óè (successful reproduction) (given problems regarding sexuality) ‚óè ‚Üí ‚óè (recovery of a sane sexuality) All of these schemas can be understood in the framework of a mathematical function. This leads from a point in a first set to a point in another set. My thesis is that this does not fit into the field of psychoanalysis.

      "abstract": "Abstract Reasons for having sex and frequency of sex are significant correlates of sexual satisfaction. However, the possible interplay between sexual motives and sexual frequency remains unexplored. Also, prior studies on sexual satisfaction largely focused on heterosexual couples and less is known about the experiences of same-sex couples. Using dyadic survey data collected from 838 middle-aged spouses in 419 gay, lesbian, and heterosexual marriages, this study examined whether the associations between sexual motives and sexual satisfaction differed by sexual frequency and whether these dynamics varied across gay, lesbian, and heterosexual couples. Results showed that intrinsic sexual motives (e.g., for enjoyment and pleasure) were associated with higher sexual satisfaction only in the context of more frequent sex, and this association did not differ for same- and different-sex couples. On the other hand, extrinsic sexual motives (e.g., to please spouse) were associated with lower levels of sexual satisfaction in the context of high-frequency sex only among men married to men and women married to men, wherein the association was stronger for heterosexual couples compared to same-sex couples. These associations were not significant with less frequent sex. Results suggest that while frequent engagement in sex with intrinsic sexual motives benefits middle-aged adults‚Äô sexual satisfaction regardless of relationship type, the sexual satisfaction of individuals married to men is vulnerable to the negative consequences of engaging in sex due to external pressure. These findings highlight the importance of considering how sexual experiences of men and women in midlife same-sex marriages compare to those of different-sex marriages.",

      "title": "Public Health and the Second 50 Years of Life",
      "abstract": "Aging is the maturation and senescence of biological systems. With each additional decade of life, adults will see a number of changes, for example, a slowing in reaction time, psychomotor speed, and verbal memory; declines in strength and walking speed; a decreased rate of urine flow; loss of skeletal muscle; and, of course, greater mortality. They will also see declines in addictive behaviors and crime; a reduction in severe psychiatric disorders; stability in psychological well-being; continuing increases in vocabulary; greater selectivity in friendship and increased contact with close family; less need for novel stimuli; and increases in wealth, leisure time, and altruistic behaviors, among many other changes. The popular understanding of aging mostly stresses negative changes that result in disability, but a more complete understanding should stress both kinds of change, for both are relevant to a public health perspective on aging.\r\n\r\nThese changes may be more prevalent in older people because they are, in fact, true expressions of senescence. Or they may be more prevalent simply because of the greater length of time older people have lived, and hence the greater opportunity they have had to experience the risks or exposures that produce these effects. This is a key distinction. More than likely, some combination of true senescence and greater exposure to risk factors is likely to be responsible for the changes we consider ‚Äúaging.‚Äù For example, the highest audible pitch people can hear declines with age, suggesting that this change is a senescent feature of the auditory system. But it is also likely that long years of occupational exposure to noise, untreated ear infections during childhood, neurological conditions, and an accumulation of minor injuries might contribute to loss of hearing in old age. What happens in the first half of life must surely matter to health in the second half.",

      "title": "Bullying in School and Cyberspace",
      "abstract": "For students, bullying is a significant problem, especially in middle school: up to half of students are involved, either as a bully, a victim, or a bystander. The effects of bullying range from negligible to very severe, including individual psychological difficulties as well as consequences for criminogenic behavior. Theories to explain multidetermined bullying behavior include ecological as well as family-based approaches. Bullying must contain the following elements: unwanted aggressive behavior(s) by another youth or groups of youths who are not siblings or current dating partners that involves an observed or perceived power imbalance and is repeated multiple times or is highly likely to be repeated. This definition describes traditional bullying, in which a person or persons can be seen to be engaged in bullying behavior. Since the late 1990s, cyberbullying has been on the rise. Traditional bullying and cyberbullying differ in the following ways: (a) cyberbullying often means the victim does not know who the bully is; (b) cyberbullying is not a discreet incident; it can be preserved in cyberspace indefinitely; (c) anger rumination, anxiety, depression, and suicidality are more prevalent among cyberbully victims; (d) cyberbullies can exhibit decreased empathy for others relative to traditional bullies; and (e) longitudinal research has found some support that cyberbullies may develop delinquent behaviors in adulthood. Bullying affects a significant proportion of students, between 18% and 31% of students in the United States are likely to be involved in traditional bullying, whereas rates of cyberbullying involvement are close to 59%. Any participation in bullying can affect youth negatively. Being either a bully or a victim can lead to depression, self-harm, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts. Being a perpetrator of bullying and cyberbullying may also increase the likelihood of criminal activity in young adulthood. According to the path analytic model of juvenile delinquency, it is likely that association with delinquent peers and parenting style are related to bullying behavior. Prevention and intervention programs have had some positive effects. Prevention and intervention efforts should concentrate on universal dissemination of effective strategies, including that cyberbullies are not really anonymous. Family and school-based interventions can strengthen adult support while encouraging programs that teach children to respect each other, promoting prosocial development. For traditional bullying, school climate programs in primary school have shown positive effects. Interventions for traditional bullying that are based in family therapy have shown success. Due to the novelty of cyberbullying, few intervention studies are available as yet. Efforts to prevent cyberbullying include setting up anonymous tiplines in schools and sharing up-to-date technological advances with parents so that they can implement those blocks that are available. Finally, there are no specific federal laws in the United States addressing bullying; however, federal regulations do exist to provide frameworks for anti-discrimination laws pertaining to protected classes. Although there are no explicit federal regulations that address bullying, state and local policies have been key components in addressing bullying issues. There has been some evidence that suggest that anti-bullying laws and policies in schools may decrease bullying perpetration. Countries including New Zealand, Australia, and Sweden have passed specific laws to address bullying, while some countries apply laws created to address other infractions to include bullying.",

      "abstract": "Female sexuality (meaning sexual desire, excitement and orgasm) has been of considerable interest in psychiatry. Women's efforts to define and legitimize their own experience of their sexuality have increased in the past 25 years. However, the integration of these new views into the body of psychiatric (especially psychoanalytic) theory has not occurred very actively or successfully. Very little is known about the development of sexuality in childhood and adolescence. This paper looks at various behaviours, interests and events in women's lives that might reveal something about the development of their sexuality. The literature on female masturbation is reviewed and some sex differences highlighted. The literature on interest in babies, the wish to have babies, and menarche is explored for possible associations with sexuality. Rather than sexuality being a central organizer of experience, it seems quite possible that experience is an organizer of sexuality. Therefore, to better understand female sexuality we need to consider the impact of experiences during childhood and adolescence.",

The systemic factors encompassing male same-sex intimate partner violence are multifaceted, permeating the individual throughout many levels of his ecological environment.

The impact of gender differences on mental health has been long recognized, with consequences such as over-diagnosis and pathologization or under-diagnosis of some disorders depending on gender. This also has implications for the treatments that each gender receives. In this narrative review, we will analyze (a) the gender differences in the prevalence of mental disorders, (b) the explanations for gender differences in mental health, including biological, social constructionist, and sociocultural risk factors, and (c) the gender differences in the treatment of mental disorders, including differences in health-seeking behavior and treatment outcomes. Overall, there is a consistent pattern of differences in prevalence, with women more likely to have internalizing disorders (e.g., anxiety or depression) and men more likely to have externalizing disorders (e.g., antisocial personality or substance use). The explanations aimed at disentangling the reasons for these gender differences are complex, and several approaches should be considered to achieve a comprehensive explanation. In addition to biological factors (e.g., hormonal changes), social constructionist factors (e.g., biased diagnostic criteria and clinicians' gender bias) and sociocultural factors (e.g., feminization of poverty, gender discrimination, violence against women, and prescriptive beauty standards) should be considered. Future studies in the field of mental health should consider gender differences and explore the bio-psycho-socio-cultural factors that may underlie these differences.",

Immediately after completing a prior copulation, the male almost invariably makes only brief temporary union of the genitalia with a previously mated female before releasing his hold. Release is equally frequent whether the female be the male's original mate or the original mate of another male. In contrast, recently mated males frequently complete copulation at the first attempt with young virgin females, and virgin males almost invariably complete with recently mated females. The behaviour of sexually experienced individuals was found to depend on male sensitivity (acquired during copulation) to female defensive grooming before and after establishment of genital union. Defensive grooming provides the stimulus to which the sensitive male responds by releasing the female. Male sensitivity to the stimulus declines with passage of time since his last copulation.",

Most researchers have examined condom use self-efficacy and sexual satisfaction. For some constructs, men, compared to women, report better sexual well-being (e.g., condom use self-efficacy and orgasm). Little is known about how sexual well-being changes in emerging adulthood, but it is known that constructs vary by sexual and romantic experience. Emerging adults who are more sexually experienced and engage in behaviors in the context of romantic relationships report better sexual well-being. Many sexual well-being constructs are also linked with less risky sexual behavior and better psychological adjustment (e.g., self-esteem and identity development). Future recommendations include measurement research to better understand overlapping constructs, examining diverse samples, and more longitudinal research.",

Though many of the exact mechanisms are yet to be elucidated, its impacts on the cardiovascular, endocrine, and nervous systems, among others, bestow upon obesity an almost unrivaled ability to devastate the human sexual response. Further, the effects of obesity extend beyond the purely physiologic into the psychologic and have the ability to impair both males and females alike. The downstream sequelae of sexual dysfunction secondary to obesity can significantly impair an individual‚Äôs quality of life, affecting his or her self-esteem, opportunity to form and maintain meaningful relationships, and ability to reproduce if desired, all of which can further promote pro-obesogenic attitudes and behaviors. Thus there is tremendous incentive for appreciation and understanding of the complex interplay between obesity and sexual function, as well as their relation to an individual‚Äôs overall physical and mental health.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Sex/gender-related factors contribute to contextual issues influencing the recognition of autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and modulate how neurodevelopmental characteristics are manifested. This review summarizes the empirical literature to provide directions for improving clinical diagnostic practices. Recent findings Timing of autism and/or ADHD diagnosis, particularly in girls/women, is related to the individual's developmental characteristics and co-occurring diagnoses, and expectancy, alongside gender stereotype biases, of referral sources and clinicians. This is further compounded by sex and gender modulations of behavioural presentations. The emerging ‚Äôfemale autism phenotype‚Äô concept may serve as a helpful illustration of nuanced autism phenotypes, but should not be viewed as essential features of autism in a particular sex or gender. These nuanced phenotypes that can present across sexes and genders include heightened attention to socially salient stimuli, friendship and social groups, richness in language expression, and more reciprocal behaviours. The nuanced female-predominant ADHD phenotypes are characterized by subtle expressions in hyperactivity-impulsivity (e.g., hyper-verbal behaviours). Optimizing neurodevelopmental diagnoses across sexes and genders also requires an understanding of sex-related and gender-related variations in developmental trajectories, including compensation/masking efforts, and the influences of co-occurring conditions on clinical presentations. Summary Equitable diagnoses across sexes and genders for autism and ADHD require understanding of the nuanced presentations and the Gestalt clinical-developmental profiles, and addressing contextual biases that influence diagnostic practices.",

      "title": "Malestar emocional asociado a la orientaci√≥n sexual en personas mayores",
      "abstract": "Introducci√≥n. En la actualidad, pese a haber avanzado en los derechos legales de las personas con diversidad afectivo-sexual, siguen habiendo prejuicios sociales al respecto. Este hecho se ve multiplicado en las personas mayores, que han sufrido una educaci√≥n m√°s hom√≥foba y una mayor invisibilizaci√≥n de su sexualidad, por lo que se hace necesario investigar tambi√©n en esta poblaci√≥n. M√©todo. Participaron 139 personas, de entre 50 y 73 a√±os, con una media de 56,1 a√±os (DT=5,44), siendo el 40,3% mujeres y el 59,7% hombres. El 89,9% se defin√≠an como heterosexuales y el 10,1% como no heterosexuales. Todos cumplimentaron un cuestionario sobre la vivencia de su orientaci√≥n sexual. Resultados. El 50% de personas no heterosexuales, como consecuencia de su orientaci√≥n sexual, se ha sentido rechazado, el 42,9% ha experimentado malestar, el 28,6% sufri√≥ violencia verbal y el 14,3% violencia f√≠sica. As√≠, se observan diferencias significativas entre las personas no heterosexuales y las heterosexuales en diversos aspectos relacionados con su orientaci√≥n sexual, siendo las no heterosexuales las que muestran mayor malestar emocional (œá¬≤=20,61; p&lt;,000), m√°s dudas con su orientaci√≥n (¬≤=15,01; p&lt;,000), han sufrido m√°s violencia verbal (œá¬≤=18,03; p&lt;,000) y m√°s violencia f√≠sica (œá¬≤=18,11; p&lt;,000. Conclusiones. Estos hallazgos confirman que el rechazo social de algunas orientaciones sexuales puede suponer una fuente de malestar emocional, as√≠ como un factor de riesgo para ser v√≠ctima de la violencia. En general, las personas con una orientaci√≥n no heterosexual mostrar√≠an mayor afectaci√≥n emocional y mayor probabilidad de sufrir agresiones. Con el fin de mejorar esta situaci√≥n, cabr√≠a analizar qu√© variables pueden mediar en estos resultados para establecer estrategias adecuadas de prevenci√≥n e intervenci√≥n a lo largo de todo el ciclo vital.",

      "title": "Sexual Abuse of Children",
      "abstract": "Child abuse and neglect refers to any act or failure to act that violates the rights of children and affects their overall optimal health, survival or development. Also sexual abuse in children is defined as engaging a child in sexual acts that the child does not understand, to which the child cannot give informed consent, or which violate the taboos of our society. Sexual abuse may involve direct acts perpetrated against children as well as other non-touching abuses, which include exhibitionism, voyeurism, or the use of children for pornographic purposes.Although precise incidence and prevalence rate data are lacking, sexual abuse of children is common in our country and throughout the world. Child sexual abuse is a universal problem that has frequently passed unrecognized and its victims (both children and perpetrators) untreated. Child sexual abuse results in significant social damage. The physical and psychological consequences of child sexual abuse may result in trauma and has implications throughout the lifespan. Experiencing sexual abuse as a child also has the consequence of contributing to an increased risk of violent victimization, perpetration, self-directed violence and suicide later in life.Despite the importance of the issues, information about sexual abuse in children and amongst adults has not been commonly shared by health professionals. The purpose of this review article is to assist the physician in their investigation of child sexual abuse by exploring the important topics.",

      "title": "Sex in Couples Therapy: Before and after Divorce",
      "abstract": "Although a couple's sexual relationship evolves over time and is sometimes replaced by other forms of intimacy, it is not true that long-term relationships lack sex altogether. However, it may take more energy and creativity for long-time partners to stimulate themselves and each other and to keep their sexual relationship satisfactory. This article suggests that, although it seems contradictory, development of a more individual, autonomous stance in each partner often fosters the relationship, including sex. Falling in love or extramarital sex can be the catalyst that makes it clear that some fundamental elements are lacking in a long-term relationship. Sometimes couples therapy-or reconsidering the reasons to stay in a marriage in another way-helps to bring a couple together again. In other cases, this is not effective, and divorce can be a necessary next developmental step for one or both partners. For children, divorce is never easy, especially when they are adolescents and in their second separation-individuation stage of development. For adolescents, seeing one or both of their parents fall in love again and start a sexual relationship with someone new can be a confusing and upsetting experience. A case example is offered to illustrate these dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Despite widespread contemporary egalitarian norms, research shows that racial bias continues to manifest in many subtle ways. One such way is aversive racism - discrimination that occurs when it may be rationalised on non-racial grounds. This current research investigates whether aversive racism affects perceptions of interethnic relationships. White, female participants (N=130) were shown a romantic couple in which both partners were White (White condition), or in which one partner was Black (Interethnic condition). Within these conditions, half the participants were given unreliable negative information about the relationship (negative information condition), while the other half did not receive this information (no negative information condition). As hypothesised, in the absence of negative information, participants rated the White and interethnic couples equally positively; however, when they received unreliable negative information (i.e. a non-racial justification for negativity) participants rated the interethnic couple more negatively than the White couple. Implications for perceptions of interethnic romantic relationships are discussed. Keywords: aversive racism; romantic relationships.",

      "abstract": "When I first started reading the psychological literature on homosexuality nearly 25 years ago, several omissions were painfully evident.On the positive side, studies were no longer focusing on whether or not lesbian, gay, and bisexual people were mentally disordered; their minds had been rescued from psychopathology with the 1973 removal of homosexuality from the official list of mental disorders.However, the literature I read about 'homosexuals' described people who seemed to spring from nowhere, that is, they were never children or adolescents, and did not seem to have siblings, parents, or grandparents.Nothing in the literature at the time alluded to long-term relationships, or even important friendships.The implicit portrait was of an adult homosexual person, almost always a male, living in a metropolitan area on his own (although having sex on a regular basis -this was not left out!).Although they now had their mental health restored, they still did not have lives.In essence, what was missing was any focus on their development -over their lifetimes in relationship to others, in distinct social circumstances, and at particular historical moments.For example, in the early 1980s, there were no lesbian or gay adolescents in the professional literature.The gerontological literature did not contain older adults who were lesbian or gay.Research on families did not include samesex couples or lesbian, gay, or bisexual parents.Helping to finish this fractured portrait was the problematic methodology used in early studies.Although samples were no longer drawn from clinical settings, researchers used small samples found in a limited set of urban gay venues, and were conducted with a model of sexual orientation that had two boxes, gay or heterosexual.(The bisexual box was added later, and the transgendered person -a new gender -would not appear in the psychological literature until the 21st century.)The psychological findings were decontextualized.Research never included such profoundly important factors as the widespread discrimination based on sexual orientation that sealed many in their 'closets,' the harassment and violence that made fear a normative aspect of daily existence, nor even the fact that their private sexual behavior was illegal in most parts of the country.It was remarkable to me that researchers could make generalizations.",

      "abstract": "Past research suggests that heterosexual men show a category-specific pattern of sexual arousal, showing greater arousal to stimuli depicting women than those depicting men.Gender is not, however, the only factor affecting sexual arousal in men. Research has shown that men regard relationship context as an important factor in sexual arousal.Additionally, men show greater sexual arousal to novel than to familiar sexual stimuli. Sociosexuality, the preference for committed or uncommitted sexual relationships,affects behaviour and partner preferences. The current study investigates the relationship between sociosexuality, gender cues, relationship context cues, and sexual arousal in menby assessing 25 heterosexual men‚Äôs genital and subjective sexual arousal to 18 audio narratives describing sexual or neutral encounters with female and male strangers,friends, or long-term relationship partners. I expect that heterosexual men will show greater subjective and genital arousal in response to stimuli depicting a sexual encounter with a woman than to stimuli depicting a sexual encounter with a man, replicating previous research. I hypothesize that there will be an interaction between gender cues and relationship context, such that men will show greater sexual arousal to stimuli depicting novel female sexual partners (strangers and friends) than to stimuli depicting familiar female sexual partners (long-term partners). I predict that higher sociosexuality scores, indicating a greater preference for uncommitted sexual relationships, will correlate with greater sexual arousal to uncommitted relationship contexts (strangers or friends), whereas lower sociosexuality scores, will correspond with greater sexual arousal to the committed relationship context (long-term partner).",

Se presume que muchas veces determinados vinculos de pareja son un factor de influencia importante en la aparicion y mantencion de este trastorno. Se utiliza como metodologia la revision bibliografica expuesta sobre el tema hasta la actualidad. Encontramos que la relacion de pareja puede ser un factor causante de bajo deseo sexual. Esto sucede cuando hay malestar en uno o ambos miembros de la pareja por no sentirse emocionalmente intimo o cercano al otro. A su vez influyen los problemas de comunicacion y las pugnas o conflictos fuertes. El salir de la etapa de ‚Äúenamoramiento‚Äù conlleva casi siempre una reduccion en el deseo sexual, asimismo los anos de vida en pareja.

It is presumed that the quality of relationships are an important influence in the appearance and maintenance of this disorder. The method used for this work was a literature review about the topic. The results show that the quality of the relationship can be a cause of hypoactive sexual desire. This appears when there is discomfort in one or both members of the couple because of the lack of being emotionally intimate or close to each other. In addition, communication problems and strong conflicts have influence.

      "abstract": "Progress toward gender equality has slowed or stalled in recent years, primarily because gender stereotypes and roles are changing more quickly for women than men. Women are increasingly free to behave more like men, whereas a similar freedom for men (to behave more like women) has been slower to emerge. Expectations governing men remain rigid: They are discouraged from showing weakness/vulnerability and encouraged to assert masculinity by demonstrating strength/toughness. These expectations undermine men‚Äôs emotional flexibility, which not only harms their physical health and well-being but also systematically impedes gender equality efforts. We summarize both the direct and indirect consequences of men‚Äôs relative emotional inflexibility, as well as cultural and psychological barriers to men‚Äôs emotional flexibility development. We then provide empirically based policy recommendations for cultivating emotional flexibility in men, which could in turn foster their physical and mental health, undermine traditional gender stereotypes, and promote broader gender equality in the United States.",

Sex differences can result from differential postnatal experiences (interaction with parents, environment) or from biological factors (hormones and genes) acting pre- or postnatally. The first option is often favored to explain sexual orientation although it is supported by little experimental evidence. In contrast, many sexually differentiated behaviors are organized during early life by an irreversible action of sex steroids. In particular, the preference for a male or female sex partner is largely determined in rodents by embryonic exposure to sex steroids. The early action of these steroids also seems to affect sexual orientation in humans. Indeed, clinical conditions associated with major endocrine changes during embryonic life often result in an increased incidence of homosexuality. Furthermore, multiple sexually differentiated behavioral, physiological, or even morphological traits that are kn...",

It also incorporates the understanding of others' sexual desires, and how to approach and manage intimacy with another person. Although sexual development and sexuality are founded in biology (Harden, 2014; Rodgers & Rowe, 1993), they also evolve from new life experiences that become more prevalent in adolescence, including the tendency to form close, dyadic relationships with peers of the same and other sex, and increased autonomy to spend more time with peers without the presence or supervision of parents or other adults (Impett & Tolman, 2006; Savin-Williams & Diamond, 2004; Zimmer-Gembeck, Ducat, & Collins, 2011; Zimmer-Gembeck, 2002).

      "abstract": "T NHE MAJOR scientific interest in the study of social problems has been focused principally on causation. It is now becoming apparent in sociological research, at least, that causative factors are very elusive things and are not satisfactory handled. Perhaps the etiology of the particular social problems which sociologists study will largely remain speculative and undetermined. Perhaps causation is not very applicable to the study of social problems in the first place. If the emphasis on causation is deflated, one might ask, not what our social problems texts will do, but what truly scientific considerations will be left for the sociological study of social problems? There would remain still a large body of shrewd and better-than-commonsense insights into the nature and characteristics of social problems.' There would remain a slight residue from an interest in behavior sequences or processes, such as may be used to describe the development of criminal attitudes and techniques, the progressive slump to lower levels (demoralization), the mounting tensions of family conflict, and so forth.2 The interest in interaction or behavior sequences has shown a considerable growth but is still largely a matter of qualitative analysis from special cases. There would remain also the contributions from the spatial studies. The rebirth of the Ioo-year old cartographic method, under the miscast name of ecological approach, has yielded many valuable clues as to the variation in intensity of reported incidence of social problems in unit areas. However, the validity of these spatial studies has been seriously questioned.3",

      "abstract": "An individual being viewed in an Ames room usually appears considerably altered in physical size to an observer. However, some married persons perceive less size distortion of their spouses than a stranger. This instance of selective perceptual distortion, known as the Honi phenomenon, could perhaps reflect differential familiarity and/or emotional involvement toward these stimulus persons. Using heterosexual couples as subjects, we investigated familiarity (i.e., length of the relationship), type of relationship (i.e., dating, engaged, or married), and positive cathexis (i.e., love, liking, and trust of one's partner) as possible mediators of this effect and also explored the impact of some judgemental variations. Neither familiarity nor type of relationship influenced relative perceptual distortion of partner versus stranger. Rather, selective perceptual distortion was directly related to the strength of positive cathexis, principally among females. Only women high in positive cathexis exhibited the Honi phenomenon and perceived a stranger as being more distorted than their partners. In contrast, size judgements by men were affected only by the sequence in which stimulus persons were observed. Implications and interpretations of these findings are discussed.",

Yet little is known about factors contributing to long-term lack of intimate relationships. We investigated phenotypic and genetic correlates of never having had sex in ~400,000 UK residents aged 39 to 73 and ~13,500 Australian residents aged 18 to 89. The strongest associations revealed that sexless individuals were more educated, less likely to use alcohol and smoke, more nervous, lonelier, and unhappier. Sexlessness was more strongly associated with physical characteristics (e.g. upper body strength) in men than in women. Sexless men tended to live in regions with fewer women, and sexlessness was more prevalent in regions with more income inequality. Common genetic variants explained 17% and 14% of variation in sexlessness in men and women, with a genetic correlation between sexes of 0.56. Polygenic scores predicted a range of related outcomes in the Australian dataset. Our findings uncover multifaceted correlates of human intimacy of evolutionary significance.",

      "abstract": "Gender differences in the specificity of sexual response have been a primary focus in sexual psychophysiology research, however, within-gender variability suggests sexual orientation moderates category-specific responding among women; only heterosexual women show gender-nonspecific genital responses to sexual stimuli depicting men and women. But heterosexually-identified or \"straight\" women are heterogeneous in their sexual attractions and include women who are exclusively androphilic (sexually attracted to men) and women who are predominantly androphilic with concurrent gynephilia (sexually attracted to women). It is therefore unclear if gender-nonspecific responding is found in both exclusively and predominantly androphilic women. The current studies investigated within-gender variability in the gender-specificity of women's sexual response. Two samples of women reporting concurrent andro/gynephilia viewed (Study 1, n = 29) or listened (Study 2, n = 30) to erotic stimuli varying by gender of sexual partner depicted while their genital and subjective sexual responses were assessed. Data were combined with larger datasets of predominantly gyne- and androphilic women (total N = 78 for both studies). In both studies, women reporting any degree of gynephilia, including those who self-identified as heterosexual, showed significantly greater genital response to female stimuli, similar to predominantly gynephilic women; gender-nonspecific genital response was observed for exclusively androphilic women only. Subjective sexual arousal patterns were more variable with respect to sexual attractions, likely reflecting stimulus intensity effects. Heterosexually-identified women are therefore not a homogenous group with respect to sexual responses to gender cues. Implications for within-gender variation in women's sexual orientation and sexual responses are discussed.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACTOlder adults remain sexually active well into later life; yet, there is no consistency in the literature about what sex means to them. The study described in this paper investigated the understanding of sexual activity as reported by 30 women and men from Poland, aged 65 to 82 (M = 71, SD = 5,24). Semi-structured interviews were thematically analyzed in relation to sexual scripts theory and the participants' specific sociocultural background. The results demonstrate the diversity of opinions on what sex is: from penetrative intercourse, through various expressions of physical intimacy, to emotional intimacy as a central concept. The dominant perception of sex as intercourse among some study participants evolved into an intimacy-oriented and partner-focused activity, with the discovery of fondling and female sexual pleasure as components of sex. Certain life events - such as ending a long-term marriage or engaging in a new romantic relationship - were identified as facilitating this change. Notable similarities in older women's and men's perceptions of satisfying sex in later life were observed. Acknowledging the nuanced meaning of sex for this population can contribute to a better understanding of the specificity of older adults' sexuality.",

We undertook a re-analysis of 125 interviews with older people (aged 55-98) that explored their experiences of widowhood. In this article, we focus on those interviews in which participants described themselves as experiencing loneliness by the spontaneous use of terms such as ‚Äô‚Äôlonely‚Äô‚Äô, ‚Äô‚Äôloneliness‚Äô‚Äô or ‚Äô‚Äôlonesome‚Äô‚Äô. Almost half of the participants (42%) described themselves in that way without any prompting from the interviewer. In terms of understanding and describing the meaning of loneliness, 50% explained loneliness in terms of absence of either their spouse, a physical presence in the house or people. One-third (34%) discussed loneliness in relation to time and place: night, weekends and home, and 4% described the emotional impact of loneliness. Fifteen per cent just said they were lonely without elaboration, assuming a common understanding of what loneliness means. Our findings suggest that widowed people‚Äôs understanding and experience of loneliness resonates with the concept of ‚Äô‚Äôemotional‚Äô‚Äô loneliness, resulting from the loss of significant social and emotional attachment. This has important implications for the types of interventions that may be appropriate for remediating loneliness in this group.",

      "abstract": "The terms \"sex,\" \"sexual,\" and \"sexuality\" are seldom defined with precision in the professional literature. Their meaning is generally left to a reader's intuitive understanding. The term sex may be used to indicate male or female anatomy, the general distinction between male and female genders or between distinctive masculine and feminine behaviors attributed to the two genders, to activities leading to orgasm (8,9) or to penile/vaginal intercourse and reproduction. Sexual and sexuality are used with equal imprecision, referring to the sexual organs, to functions of sexual organs, to sexual drives, or to instincts. Gender, gender identity, and gender roles, on the other hand, have precise definitions derived from recent conceptualizations in psychosexual research. Gender usually indicates the equivalent of male or female anatomic sex. Gender identity refers to one's personally experienced sexual identity, a persistent individual self-awareness of being either male or female without regard to how or with whom one expresses this identity. Gender role involves everything one says or does to indicate his/her gender identity to others (11).",

Family sex communication has been studied with a limited range of adolescent sexual behaviors but not sexual fantasy or desire. Two measures of family sex communication were compared and examined in relation to measures of sexual fantasy, desire, attitudes, and behavior among a sample of 522 females and males in their late adolescence. An expanded range of sexual behaviors was assessed. Family sex communication was not associated with level of sexual fantasy, desire, attitudes, or most sexual behaviors. Causal inferences cannot be made, but parents might consider talking openly with their children about sexual matters without fearing that such communication will ignite their sexual desire or prompt sexual behavior.

By their very nature, such relations open us up to psychological and material suffering that would not be possible absent the particular relationship; even worse, from the non‚Äêdomination point of view, is that this vulnerability seems to be structural in a way exactly analogous to (for example) workplace or social domination. If being powerless to prevent an employer causing me harm constitutes domination at work, then what relevant differences can support the intuition that being powerless to prevent my partner causing me comparable pain is not autonomy‚Äêhostile? I argue for the reassuring view that the obligations and possibility of pain arising from such relations aren't necessarily dominating; they would be so only if we believed that any obligation we have not explicitly agreed to is a restriction on our autonomy, and that is false. I conclude with a note of caution: even though intimate relations aren't necessarily dominating, they will often be contingently so if they take place in a wider social context of domination ‚Äì such as that which we currently inhabit.",

      "abstract": "Recent research suggesting that a high proportion of men and women remain sexually active well into later life refutes the prevailing myth that aging and sexual dysfunction are inexorably linked. Age-related physiological changes do not render a meaningful sexual relationship impossible or even necessarily difficult. In men, greater physical stimulation is required to attain and maintain erections, and orgasms are less intense. In women, menopause terminates fertility and produces changes stemming from estrogen deficiency. The extent to which aging affects sexual function depends largely on psychological, pharmacological, and illness-related factors. In this article I review the physiological sex-related changes that occur as part of the normal aging process in men and women. I also summarize the effects on sexual function of age-related psychological issues, illness factors, and medication use. An understanding of the sexual changes that accompany normal aging may help physicians give patients realistic and encouraging advice on sexuality. Although it is important that older men and women not fall into the psychosocial trap of expecting (or worse, trying to force) the kind and degree of sexual response characteristic of their youth, it is equally as important that they not fall prey to the negative folklore according to which decreased physical intimacy is an inevitable consequence of the passage of time.",

Any biological factors such as vaginal dryness, pelvic floor dysfunction or chronic pain need to be addressed first to help prevent more complex problems developing. Sexual problems may be the cause of or the result of dysfunctional or unsatisfactory relationships. Psychological and emotional factors can create difficulties in sexual response and, equally, they can be the result of unaddressed or untreated biological/medical issues.

La non-recidive qui est le signe de la desistance ne suffit donc pas pour qu‚Äôon puisse parler de resilience car la conformite normative peut etre simplement un abandon adaptatif au meme titre que la delinquance pouvait l‚Äôetre. Meme si une delinquance violente peut etre le fruit d‚Äôun moi faible, d‚Äôune incapacite a tolerer les frustrations ou a controler les ecluses du passe, une grande part de la delinquance repose sur des mecanismes adaptatifs adequats quand bien meme ils sont moralement ou juridiquement inacceptables.

Plusieurs cas nous montrent que ces personnes sorties de la toxicomanie ou de carrieres delinquantes plus ou moins severes se sont appuyees sur un etayage narcissique externe ou sur des mecanismes de defense tournes vers la generativite pour entreprendre des actions sociales altruistes ou des activites educatives ou the√¢trales qui qualifient la resilience secondaire.",

Although menopausal symptoms are primarily considered to be a result of the sometimes intense hormonal fluctuations that are experienced during perimenopause, this does not necessarily exclude the role of psychosocial factors such as demographic characteristics, cultural or ethnic background, attitudes toward menopause, specific lifestyles and habits, specific previous life experiences and personality traits. A review of recent research findings and contributions of these psychosocial factors in the development of perimenopausal symptoms engaged will be presented in this work.

Emerging research indicates a link between suicide and men's active pursuit of hegemonic masculinity via emotional restriction. However, little is known of the continuum of suicidal men's emotional practice, and particularly how men mobilise emotions to actively pursue or resist hegemonic masculine ideals. This theorised life-history study aimed to explore the emotional lives of 18 Australian men who had attempted suicide. Findings indicate that men in this study experienced a range of emotions. However, during childhood, they learned that expressing emotions such as sadness reduced masculine standing, whereas expressing emotions such as anger through acts of violence could enhance masculine status. Although the gendering of emotions offered participants multiple avenues of action to pursue or contest masculine ideals, they remained vulnerable to suicide. For some men, it became impossible to conceal escalating feelings of distress. For other men, displays of anger and violence resulted in job loss, relationship breakdown or criminal conviction. Many participants indicated that suicide presented a means of ending painful emotions. Paradoxically, suicide could also become an alternative means of demonstrating masculinity, whereby the body became both the vehicle and object of violence.",

The frequency at which couples engage in sexual intercourse varies, however, as a function of the partners‚Äô ages, the duration of their relationship, and the type of their relationship. Cohabitors engage in sexual intercourse more frequently than do couples in other types of relationships, followed by married couples, and followed by those in non‚Äêmarital, non‚Äêcohabiting relationships. Older individuals engage in less frequent sexual activity, including intercourse, than do younger individuals, and couples in relationships of longer duration engage in less frequent sexual activity than do couples in relationships of shorter duration. Variables such as race/ethnicity, religious affiliation, and sexual orientation are unrelated to the frequency of sexual intercourse.",

      "abstract": "The article describes the results of the empirical study into sociodemographic correlates and subjective correlates of happiness. The relevance of the study is determined by the fact that the modern world places exorbitant, often conflicting requirements (information-driven, need and motive-based, value-oriented, etc.) on the individual. Our study aimed to define the linkage between the happiness of mature Russians and their satisfaction with different aspects of life. We formed the hypothesis of a connection between happiness and satisfaction with the job, material situation, health, proper rest, inter-spousal relations, and relationships with their children and friends. The results revealed that the feelings of happiness are connected with both objective socio-demographic indicators and the level of satisfaction with different life aspects. Happiness positively correlates with the number of children in a family and income, and also with overall life satisfaction. With age, a subjective sense of happiness ‚Äúfades‚Äù a bit, and the respondents estimate happiness slightly lower (it is more characteristic of the female part of the sample). Men and women do not differ in the level of being happy but there exist some peculiarities in the linkage of happiness with such factors as marital status (being married) and the number of children ‚Äì unlike men, for women these correlations are statistically significant. Also, men, compared to women, are more satisfied with the material situation and inter-spousal relations and less satisfied with their relations with friends. In general, the obtained results complement the data published in academic literature. Thus, it was found that not all factors considered as predictors of happiness in the public mind correlate with the feelings of happiness. For instance, it was revealed that such an essential factor of material wellbeing as homeownership has nothing to do with a sense of happiness: the respondents with and without own homes are equally happy",

      "abstract": "Adult men of different ethnic backgrounds who experienced childhood sexual abuse (CSA) may vary in their reports of the psychological and behavioural impact of CSA on their lives. Empirical studies rarely examine the impact of race/ethnicity or cultural context on the psychological and behavioural struggles of adult male CSA survivors. This study utilised qualitative content analysis to examine the reported CSA-related psychological and behavioural challenges of 150 US men, with equal numbers of Blacks, Latinos and non-Latino Whites. Interview data revealed some ethnic differences: Black men more frequently denied having present day adverse effects than other groups. However, Black men who did report negative consequences of CSA discussed difficulties with substance use and hyper-sexualised behaviour more often than other ethnicities. Latino men reported anger, anxiety, hyper-vigilance, flashbacks and communication problems more often than the other two groups. Black and Latino men also discussed guilt/shame issues and sexual identity concerns more often than Whites did. In contrast, White men more frequently discussed issues related to low self-esteem, loneliness and isolation. These findings suggest that ethnically diverse men may respond differently to CSA experiences and that considerations need to be taken into account when providing healthcare to men with CSA histories.",

They often have a history of trauma. They are depressed and obsessive, attached to their mothers, who discourage attempts at emancipation. The symptoms serve the purpose of keeping them as little girls with negative feelings toward menstruation, sexual maturity, development, and femininity in general. These symptoms comprise self-destructive behavior in the service of removing sexual thoughts, temptation, and activities. Favazza (1987) included both eating disorders and self mutilation in his \"deliberate self-harm syndrome.\" The symptoms, whether they be anorexic, bulimic, or a form of self-mutilation are seen as \"autoerotic in nature and a substitute for normal masturbation\" (Hull & Lane, 1988). Eating disorders and delicate self-mutilation are said to have \"a cathartic, self-purifying, function in that they modulate states of anxiety, sexual tension, anger or dissociated emptiness, and they bring about a tremendous quasi-physical sense of relief\" (Cross, 1993, p. 50). These patients' use of substitutes prevents maturation and growth as women, causing regression to pregenital phases with the use of pregenital defenses, and the demise of the demands of puberty and mature sexuality.",

      "title": "Emotional Neglect and it's Impact Upon the Self",
      "abstract": "Emotional neglect is one of the five sub-types of childhood mistreatment that has been classified by practitioners in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and education. The other four are sexual abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse and physical neglect. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is the least studied area from these five despite being commonly cited by research as being the most likely to occur. Contrary to what one might guess, numerous studies have in fact reported that emotional neglect can have an even greater negative impact upon individuals than the other types of mistreatment, particularly in regards to how individuals view themselves and their place in the world. Emotional neglect can broadly be defined as repeated and consistent caregiver-child interactions that are characterized by emotional unavailability, withdrawal, lack of reciprocity, disinterest or disengagement which lead to the child feeling that s/he is worthless, flawed, unloved, unwanted, endangered, or only of value in meeting another's needs. Previous research has published findings strongly associating childhood emotional neglect with a range of cognitive and behavioral outcomes including but not limited to; depression, anxiety, low self-compassion, shame, guilt, sexually risky behavior, self-destructive behavior, negative schemas, poor emotional regulation, Machiavellianism and so on. Given what we know in relation to the sheer importance of the interactions between primary caregivers and the child, namely by way of Bowlby's attachment theory, it is unsurprising to find that emotional neglect has many detrimental consequences. The reasons for emotional neglect can be numerous. One of the more common reasons behind it include it being passed on from generation to generation (as is also often the case with other types of abuse/neglect); indeed, social learning theory would support the idea that we take a lot of our parenting skills and styles directly from our own parents, even if we perceive them to be negative. Another source may be familial adversity, such as poverty, living within a conflict, or living during a time of persecution. Emotional neglect may also ensue due to the sickness of a sibling or parent, as the physically sick family member often can receive all attention and emotional capital of the family unit. Parental drug or alcohol abuse would place a child at risk of experiencing emotional neglect as would the seemingly more benign yet often just as threatening driven parental styles within which all love is contingent upon meeting pre-set academic or, later in life, professional goals. In the context of Qatar, it is also worth noting that emotional neglect often occurs within family units within which material wealth is abundant, however there is physical or psychological distance between the child and the primary caregiver, say due to a large number of siblings, half-siblings or maid/nursing staff being employed to take on child-rearing duties. Our emotional development, and being raised within a context in which we feel loved and cared for, is vital to the healthy development of the self. Accordingly, I have been looking at how emotional neglect impacts upon the self, that part of us that is believed to be the source of our consciousness and the core of our being. Two specific aspects of the self which I intend to include in my research are self-esteem and memory recall. Both of these areas have not been looked at in the context of emotional neglect research yet both may hold valuable findings that will then allow practitioners to be able to design interventions that will aide individuals in overcoming their emotional neglect. This will also be the first reported study that has used qualitative interviews to assess the impact of emotional neglect. This was also a key for me; through all the research I had reviewed, the emotion in emotional neglect was not being conveyed in the numbers and the statistics. Being a student of science though I know the value of these constructs and it was with both of these ideas in mind that I decided to use mixed methods for this doctorate study. This Ph.D. is currently being carried out by me at Queen's University Belfast, and is being supervised by, Dr Teresa Rushe.",

At every phase of psychosexual development the repressing and inhibitory social forces, both parental and extrafamilial (such as church, school, legal, and local standards), tend to increase the pressures that compel conformance to frustrating and emotionally disturbing standards of sexual behavior. Frustration and inhibition is part and parcel of the socialization process, and restriction of the sexual urges of the child is therefore essential. It is generally recognized that a well-adjusted sex life is important for mental health; therefore, the physician who is interested in both the physical and the emotional well-being of his patients will direct their attention to this essential area of human life.

      "abstract": "Future offenders have more ratings than controls on variables indicating psychopathology. The characteristics which most consistently and significantly discriminate between preoffenders and controls, and which also turned out to be the best predictors of future criminality, are those which previously have been observed in subjects with serious mental disorders. The results indicate that the high degree of psychopathology in subsequent offenders is associated with distortion of body image and with poor reality orientation, i.e. that the most prominent characteristics of future offenders are related to a weakness of the ego. Future offenders seem to have a sufficiently developed ego to handle common tasks. However, their ego fails when they are confronted with unfamiliar and frustrating situations. The inability of subsequent offenders to complete a task properly, with failure on difficult and provocative tasks, shows that they have not developed adequate defence mechanisms and that they have a low tolerance for frustration. They are emotionally immature, instable and impulsive. In short, they are dominated by id impulses. There is no indication of gender confusion (homosexuality) in subsequent offenders. However, there are marked differences between the drawings by cases and by controls regarding characteristics related to sexuality. These findings are interpreted as an exaggeration of masculinity and an abnormal preoccupation with sexuality combined with anxiety for the opposite sex. It is possible that severe criminality, contrary to milder forms of lawbreaking, is associated with elevated self-esteem and extroversion. There are indications that ultimate offenders experience human beings (others or themselves) as deviant, monstrous and inhuman, features which indicate that distorted self-concept and distorted self-perception are characteristics of preoffenders. The findings regarding aggression are inconsistent, just as they were in prior projects. The Draw-A-Person Test (DAP) and Colour Slide Test (CST) findings indicate that preoffenders are more aggressive and destructive than controls, whereas the Hand Test (HT) shows neither more aggression nor more acting-out tendencies in future offenders than in controls. The literature offers conflicting findings regarding depression. The CST results indicate that depression is more common in preoffenders than in controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

In this article, psychological difficulties are understood as any internal barriers, violations, failures, etc., that prevents optimal adaptation, in this case, of migrants. The focus of research by modern scientists is aimed at studying socially disadvantaged migrants and labor migrants. There is not enough research on women who have moved to a new country with their husbands. Four groups of psychological difficulties were identified that impede the successful adaptation of women, as well as the clinical manifestations associated with these difficulties: women&amp;rsquo;s expectations regarding interaction with society do not coincide with society&amp;rsquo;s expectations which contributes to the emergence of frustration and deprivation; the predominance of external motivation when moving to another country (following a husband) results in loss of work and familiar environment which often leads to depression and/or somatization; the predominance of compelled contacts in the structure of communication causes an increased irritability; self-image as a migrant before the move does not coincide with real self-image in a new country generates intrapersonal conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;",

Empirical studies do not show uniform results, but it appears that diabetic women experience more frequent sexual dysfunction in general than age-matched healthy controls, independent of the sociocultural environment. The most frequently cited dysfunctions are desire and arousal disorders, such as lubrication difficulties, while orgasmic capacity appears to be less affected. Direct pathophysiological effects on lubrication are proven, but the impact on mental arousal is unclear. The role of diabetic complications is controversial. The comorbidity with depression plays a major role. Individual coping with the disease and the quality of the relationship are also contributing factors. Patients should be encouraged to talk about their sexual problems, as both biomedical and psychosocial factors have to be explored. Therapeutic interventions include basic counseling, biomedical treatment of atrophy and lubrication difficulties, as well as treatment of comorbidities and/or sex therapy.",

It is not synonymous with gender identity (the knowledge of being male or female) or gender role (outward expression of maleness or femaleness). Gender identity and gender role generally are defined by anatomic and chromosomal gender in both heterosexual and homosexual individuals. Sexual orientation also is not synonymous with sexual activity; many homosexual individuals, especially during adolescence, participate in heterosexual behavior and relationships,1,2 and many adults who identify themselves as heterosexual report homosexual activity during adolescence.3-5 It is difficult to know with certainty the number of people who identify themselves as exclusively or predominantly homosexual. It is more difficult still to estimate the number who have questions about their sexual orientation during adolescence because of the well-known fluidity and complexity of sexual attractions and activities during this period. The original Kinsey study of sexuality reported that from puberty to age 20, 28% of boys and 17% of girls had one or more homosexual experiences. The same survey reported that 37% of adults have had homosexual experiences and that 10% consider themselves to be predominantly homosexual.3,4 In a somewhat more recent cross-sectional study of 13- to 19-year-olds, 11% of boys and 6% of girls reported at least one homosexual experience, with 17% of boys aged 16 to 19 reporting such activities.6",

A complex integration that justify the complexity of human sexual life and his prowess to sexual malfunction. When sexuality is disturbed and no biological cause is found a specific psycho sexological and clinical methodology is required. Design and Method: Our approach is centered on a sexodynamic methodology and involves a careful investigation of the sexual objective behavior as well sexual fantasies and the imaginative world. We also compare the actual sexual behavior with the inner sexual erotic map. The sexual manifest reality is usually easily grasped from the individual and/or couple history. More cumbersome and tricky is the access to the inner emotional and reality. Through the investigation of sexual and dream fantasies as well as their potential development and a focus on gender identity, sexual attitude and relationship to the other and the other sex, the patient, in many cases, is able to better define the boundaries of his personal sexual likes and dislikes and to correlate them with his actual sexual behavior. In this way he can verify his willingness and possibility to go or not beyond his personal and sexual limits. Results: Our approach in very interesting and often allow us to cast a light where others approach seems to have more limitations. Conclusions: Our method allows to confront the problems difficult to investigate with other sexological approaches. In particular, allows the access to the intrapsychic mechanisms with profound impact on sexuality.",

In gender affirmative treatment (GAT), care is approached by listening to the youth, with the input of their parents and caregivers, to best understand how to affirm and validate their gender identity and expression in the context of their health and development.1 It may include any of the following: social interventions (eg, by using asserted name and pronouns), pubertal suppression, hormone treatment, or gender affirming surgery (GAS), with psychosocial support provided throughout.2 Although empirical support of GAT is growing, the literature often minimizes the fundamental, dynamic connection between intimate relationships and one‚Äôs sense of self. For example, intimate activities may be adapted to overcome or avoid gender dysphoria associated with certain sexual parts. Traditional labels (gay, straight, bisexual, etc) may be seen as inadequate and too restrictive given evolving identities. One‚Äôs gender label may influence power dynamics and roles in the relationship. Developmentally, young people are navigating these challenges with gender identity and sexuality simultaneously in a process that is not well understood or supported by medical providers. In this month‚Äôs issue of Pediatrics, Bungener et al2 examined sexual behaviors among transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth during and after GAT. They reviewed previous research suggesting that at the time of referral, before any intervention, TGD youth had fallen in love, ‚Ä¶ Address correspondence to Jason Rafferty, MD, MPH, EdM, Department of Pediatrics, Thundermist Health Center, 450 Clinton St, Woonsocket, RI 02895.

      "abstract": "Some previous work on arthropod development is insufficiently detailed or incompletely reported.Much of the published information in this area is of limited use for the general analysis of life cycles.These difficulties arise primarily because many experiments do not control fully for the strain of the material (and even its specific identity) nor for rearing conditions, do not ade quately take account of the complexity of life cycles and their stages, or are restricted to only part of the life cycle.For example, 285 such factors as variable numbers of instars, sexual differences, abbreviated or hidden stages and dormancies may mean that the \"average durations\" reported apply to an unknown mixture of developmental types.Nor are experiments always designed or results reported and analysed in a logical and transparent manner.Undefined terms may obscure what actual developmental intervals were measured.Highly derived developmental or demographic measures may obscure core data.Statistical information may be inade quate.Such pitfalls are reviewed here, suggesting ways to ensure that results on the duration of development are both valid for spe cific studies and more widely useful.General experimental difficulties, recommended background information that should be provided, recommended life-cycle intervals and their terminology, and recommended ways to report numerical and statistical infor mation are briefly summarized in tabular form.",

We want to redress this deficiency and a surprising number of chapters in the book concern themselves with disorders and diseases that occur in adult males. It is a time of many life events like marriage, fatherhood, divorce, and work-related problems. Men‚Äôs emotions in this phase of life have come under scrutiny by both sexes and the consensus seems to be that adult males are quite afraid of their emotions. This has implications for the manner in which men deal with health symptoms and life crises. The language used to express depressive feelings has an emotional content that may well be rejected or denied by men, and this in turn has important implications for history-taking. The vulnerability of the adult single male to depression and suicide is highlighted in this chapter. Is there such a thing as the male menopause? The author is emphatic that there is not, making his arguments worth sceptical scrutiny.",

      "abstract": "Research on close relationships in later life has received increased attention over the past decade. However, little is known about sexuality and intimacy in old age. Using cross-sectional data from the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II; Mage = 68 years, SD = 3.68; 50% women; N = 1,514), we examine age differences in behavioral (sexual activity), cognitive (sexual thoughts), and emotional (intimacy) facets of sexuality and investigate associations with physical health and psychosocial resources for successful aging. Older age was associated with less sexual activity and fewer sexual thoughts, but not with differences in intimacy. Relative to a reference sample of 22- to 36-year-olds within BASE-II (N = 475), the average older adult reported considerably fewer sexual activity and thoughts (ds > .60), but only slightly lower intimacy (d = .20). Substantial heterogeneity existed among older adults, with almost one third of the 60- to 82-year-olds reporting more sexual activity and thoughts than the average younger adult. Examining correlates of sexuality among older adults revealed that, covarying for diagnosed illnesses and performance-based grip strength, psychosocial factors (e.g., partnered, relationship satisfaction) accounted for considerable shares of variance in sexual activity and intimacy, whereas age and gender explained more of the variance in sexual thoughts. Some psychosocial factors exhibited similar-sized associations with all sexuality facets, whereas other factors operated in more facet-specific ways. To illustrate, participants reporting more loneliness also reported less sexual activity and less intimacy, but not fewer sexual thoughts. We discuss implications of our findings for theories of successful aging. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "abstract": "6points out that one of the main psychosocial factors associated with depression in the Mexican population is precisely being a woman, especially when being a family head or when a woman is exclusively dedicated to housework or to take care of an ill person. Other psychosocial risk factors are related to low socioeconomic status (due to increased exposure to precarious conditions because, although there are no significant differ ences between socioeconomic strata, people from the lowest levels have more severe depression), unemployment (especially men), social isolation, legal problems, experiences of violence, substance abuse and migration. Thus, in general, it seems that women‚Äôs mental health is more vulnerable to be affected by certain social factors; however, it is also likely that men underreport mental health problems because of their difficulty to seek help if any emo tional distress afflicts them. Likewise, it has been noted that depression in men can be ‚Äúhidden‚Äù behind addictive and risk behaviors as well as behind irritability and impulsivity. 7",

However, in considering child abuse and neglect as examples of adverse life events that have the potential to affect development and subsequent psychopathology, the assumption of ‚Äúwell-being‚Äù in the child‚Äôs life prior to the victimization experience may not be a reasonable one. Although certain forms of childhood victimization may indeed be viewed as acute stressors, child abuse and neglect often occur against a background of more chronic adversity in multiproblem homes. Child abuse or neglect may be only one of a family‚Äôs problems. Thus the general effects of other family characteristics, such as poverty, unemployment, parental alcoholism or drug problems, or other inadequate social and family functioning, must be recognized and disentangled from the specific effects of childhood abuse or neglect.",

Availability of family and/or friends as a source of support was found to be most important for satisfactory coping. Loneliness, isolation, loss of former friendships, and ostracism by former intimate friends were some of the perceptions of the widows. Sexual problems, especially frustration, were evident among many widows. Adaptation to sexual frustration included sexual affairs with men who would not ordinarily be considered a partner, such as the married or one's physician. All widows reported that the sexual relationship was salubrious, which has implications for counselors and therapists comforting the widowed or providing death education. Each widow's individual personality and life events affected coping. Increased mental and physical ailments after the death of their spouse, especially in the first year of bereavement were reported by 15 of the 18 widows.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Lesbian dating and courtship were explored based on interviews with 38 predominantly white lesbians (ages 22-63) representing young adult, adult, and midlife age groups. Friendship was found to be the most widely used courtship script across all age groups, followed by the sexually explicit and romance scripts, with friendship and romance scripts being preferred. Unique aspects of lesbian dating cited by participants included freedom from gender roles, heightened intimacy/friendship, the rapid pace of lesbian relationship development, and the effects of prejudice. Friendship was found to be differentiated from romance by two main criteria: emotional intensity and sexual energy or contact. Verbal declarations of interest and nonverbal behaviors were the primary means of communicating sexual attraction. Few lesbians adhered to traditional gender roles in dating, and those who reported assuming the feminine reactive role nevertheless rejected the traditional notion that women should limit sexual contact. Overall, midlife lesbians were more purposive in their dating and more free from gender roles. Specifically, they were more concerned about the \"attachment-worthiness\" of a prospective partner and were significantly more likely than young adults to view dating as having a serious goal, to proceed at a rapid pace, to ask for a date, and to initiate physical intimacy.",

      "abstract": "The human‚Äìanimal relationship is ancient, complex and multifaceted. It may have either positive effects on humans and animals or poor or even negative and detrimental effects on animals or both humans and animals. A large body of literature has investigated the beneficial effects of this relationship in which both human and animals appear to gain physical and psychological benefits from living together in a reciprocated interaction. However, analyzing the literature with a different perspective it clearly emerges that not rarely are human‚Äìanimal relationships characterized by different forms and levels of discomfort and suffering for animals and, in some cases, also for people. The negative physical and psychological consequences on animals‚Äô well-being may be very nuanced and concealed, but there are situations in which the negative consequences are clear and striking, as in the case of animal violence, abuse or neglect. Empathy, attachment and anthropomorphism are human psychological mechanisms that are considered relevant for positive and healthy relationships with animals, but when dysfunctional or pathological determine physical or psychological suffering, or both, in animals as occurs in animal hoarding. The current work reviews some of the literature on the multifaceted nature of the human‚Äìanimal relationship; describes the key role of empathy, attachment and anthropomorphism in human‚Äìanimal relationships; seeks to depict how these psychological processes are distorted and dysfunctional in animal hoarding, with highly detrimental effects on both animal and human well-being.",

      "abstract": "Background. For people with intellectual disabilities there is a difficult balance to be struck between empowering people to claim their sexual rights and protecting them from abuse. Hypothetically, services should be guided by whether a particular person with intellectual disabilities has the capacity to consent to sexual relationships. However, there has been little agreement on how to define such capacity. This study examines the issue of capacity to consent to sexual relationships using a functional approach. Method. Adults with intellectual disabilities ( n =60) and young people presumed in law able to consent ( n =60) were assessed for their sexual knowledge and vulnerability to abuse. Results. Adults with intellectual disabilities were significantly less knowledgeable about almost all aspects of sex and appeared significantly more vulnerable to abuse, having difficulty at times distinguishing abusive from consenting relationships. Nevertheless, some adults with intellectual disabilities scored highly on all measures, especially if they had relatively high IQs and had had sex education. Conclusions. The reasons for the poorer knowledge and increased vulnerability of people with intellectual disabilities are discussed and it is recommended that they should have on-going access to sex education. Implications of the findings for definitions of capacity to consent to sexual relationships are considered.",

The general opinion is that this group of people is characterised by specific psychological and physical functioning and they are thought to have distinct needs and expectations as regards family life. To verify and confirm the above, comparative research was undertaken to find out how young able‚Äêbodied, blind and persons using wheelchairs evaluate marriage. The subject of the research was the importance ascribed to the hierarchy of values related to marriage and family, and the types of needs satisfied through these institutions of social life. The participants were asked to evaluate such phenomena as love, sexual life and parenthood as well as expressing their attitude and opinion on conjugal infidelity. The results obtained do not indicate any significant differences in attitudes and views presented between the groups under consideration. All valued marriage and family life very highly and had similar expectations, however, not all will be able to fulfil their needs and aspirations in these areas. It will be quite complicated, especially so for those who are disabled. All possible failures are caused by, first of all, negative attitudes of the society towards erotic activities of people with disabilities.",

      "title": "The rejected stalker and the resentful stalker",
      "abstract": "One of the commonest forms of stalking is that which emerges in the context of the breakdown of a close relationship. Typically the rejected partner begins to stalk after their partner has attempted to end the relationship, or indicated that he or she intends to end the relationship. The overt aim of the stalking is either to attain a reconciliation or to exact revenge for the rejection. In practice the stalker not infrequently entertains a mixture of both of these goals, the dominant motivation shifting with circumstances and the ex-partner's responses. The usual relationship to give rise, at its dissolution, to stalking is an intimate sexual partnership, but the breakdown of any close relationship in which the rejected partner has invested emotional energy can usher in stalking. In our own experience we have seen stalking emerge following rifts between close friends, parents and their children, longterm work and business partnerships and even therapists and their clients (patients). The essential elements are the stalker's sense of having had his or her rights and prerogatives violated by the unilateral attempt to sever the relationship, combined, to a greater or lesser extent, with a sense of loss at the end of an important relationship. The rage at rejection is often augmented by distress at the perceived unfairness or humiliating nature of the rejection.",

      "title": "FACTORS IN MALE SEXUAL INADEQUACY",
      "abstract": "1) A representative selection of the enormous literature on factors generally held to be causally important in male potency disorders is reviewed. Although some degree of overlap may exist, for simplicity, the subject is considered under the three main \"etiologically presumed\" subgroups: \"organic,\" \"constitutional,\" and \"psychogenic.\" The pathognomonic features of each are briefly outlined. 2) Since most authorities state that \"psychogenic factors\" are dominant in male potency disorders, the review concentrates on a sample of this literature; contributions from a) psychoanalytical, psychoanalytically-oriented, b) eclecticist, and c) behaviorist sources are evaluated. The most frequently asserted \"psychogenic causes\" of male potency disorders encountered are a) anxiety or fear, b) hostility and resentment, c) disgust, d) inversion of the sex drive, e) inhibition, f) personality factors, g) ignorance and misinformation, and h) the functional psychoses. It is concluded that, with the possible exceptions of the functional psychoses and inverted sex drive, where there is a strong clinical likelihood, if not as yet a proven statistical association, no definite statement regarding the etiological importance of the other \"psychogenic factors\" can be made using the presently available material. In most cases, etiological generalizations have been made on inadequate nonspecific data, often derived from single or a few case studies. Another serious criticism relates to interpretation of observations; for example, that anxiety, hostility, disgust, and other such factors or a functional psychosis might coexist with a potency disorder is incontestable, but to assume causality may only rarely be admissible; more often these may be its consequence or a mere coincidence. 3) Some suggestions for improving the methodology of psychological research on etiological factors in male potency disorders are offered and may include a) greater empiricism, b) more stringent criteria for inclusion in any study which should be explicit, prospective, controlled, modest, and replicable by others, c) the use of standard objective validated measuring instruments, and d) the application of appropriate statistical methods. 4) Despite the consensus view widely expressed in the literature that potency disorders are psychosomatie, few, if any, workers have attempted specifically to measure simultaneously and to correlate physiological and psychological responses in these or related conditions. 5) It is suggested that, in the future, a multidisciplinary and simultaneous approach, involving psychiatric, psychological, and physiological parameters will provide better and more valid methods of studying the etiological interrelationships between various \"psychological factors\" and disordered potency.",

The possibilities of the erotic love, for example, are virtually null. When they ask men and women to them which matters more of its pair, the virtues of the good lover only obtain the postulation of a five percent (5%) of the survey ones. Resumen. Los resultados de un sondeo de opinion entre estudiantes universitarios sobre amor en Colombia1 son aterradores. O lo son sus resultados, que no es lo mismo. El amor que brota de la muestra es un amor instrumental, amistoso, institucional, formal, lineal, aburrido y rutinario. No hay sexo, pero tampoco romanticismo. Va a ser posible, a partir de los datos de la encuesta, inferir que el odio que preside dana y extingue la vida en esta republica puede explicarse desde el punto de vista de ese amor tosco, sin pasion, ternura ni lecho que los colombianos practican.",

      "abstract": "Introduction The pursuit of sexual pleasure ‚Äì the drive, aim, object, and satisfaction, to use psychoanalytic terms ‚Äì is a process that is extraordinarily diverse and individualized; it is cultural and symbolic, as well as biological, psychological, (inter) personal, and oftentimes political. As such, sexual pleasure tends to be discounted or misunderstood by health care professionals. This is especially true for alternative or ‚Äúunconventional‚Äù sexual practices, which do not fall within the realm of traditional ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù sex. One example of alternative sexual practices is BDSM, which is an acronym for a broad range of sexual practices that focus on themes of bondage and discipline (B&D), dominance and submission (D/s), and sadomasochism (SM). For the most part, research in this field has been quantitative and has focused on describing the people affiliated with BDSM, while overlooking the importance of the sexual acts themselves, as well as the subjective motivations and desires of these individuals, and how these personal differences are related to risk-taking and/or risk reduction in the context of public health. These factors need to be understood in order to design and implement more effective measures for the prevention of HIV and other STIs.",

Many people complete this process promptly, but at least 25% of the divorced population have significant difficulty completing the psychological divorce and remain attached to their ex-spouses for significant periods of time. The present study examined demographic, personality, and relational characteristics of this population. No personality traits were found to be related to attachment. Several socioeconomic variables were found to be significantly related to ongoing attachment, and characteristics of the relationship to the ex-spouse prior to and following the separation were found to predict ongoing attachment.",

The study found that 96% of the juveniles who had engaged in sex with nonhuman animals also admitted to sex offenses against humans and reported more offenses against humans than other sex offenders their same age and race. Those juveniles who had engaged in sex with animals were similar to other sex offenders in that they also came from families with less affirming and more incendiary communication, lower attachment, less adaptability, and less positive environments. Those juveniles who had engaged in sex with animals reported victimization histories with more emotional abuse and neglect and a higher number of victimization events than other offenders. This would seem to indicate that sex with animals may be an important indicator of potential or co-occurring sex offenses against humans and may be a sign of severe family dysfunction and abuse that should be addressed in the arenas of psychological intervention, juvenile justice programs, and public policy.",

These include: attitudes toward the treatment of animals, attachment to pets, involvement in animal protectionism, animal hoarding, hunting, animal abuse, and bestiality. Women, on average, show higher levels of positive behaviors and attitudes toward animals (e.g., attitudes towards their use, involvement in animal protection), whereas men typically have higher levels of negative attitudes and behaviors (e.g., hunting, animal abuse, less favorable attitudes toward animal protection). The effect sizes of gender differences range from small (e.g., attachment), to medium size (e.g., attitudes toward animal use) to large (e.g., animal rights activism, animal abuse by adults.) In most areas, there is considerable overlap between men and women, with much greater within-sex than between-sex variation. Research on the roles of gender in human‚Äìanimal relationships is hindered by the omission in many reports of gender difference effect sizes and basic descriptive statistics.",

      "abstract": "Men who failed to achieve an adequate separation from their mothers are particularly prone to experience serious distress with their marriages during their middle years, when the wish for intimacy, coupled with a fear of closeness never resolved during infancy, is retriggered. An onslaught of biological, social, and psychological stresses force acknowledgement of previously denied needs for succor, plunging them into battle with their wife-surrogate mother. The resulting counterphobic, hypersexual, ofter self-destructive behaviors are usually falsely interpreted as oedipal. Clinical material in this report strongly suggests this distress is not primarily related to genital sexual issues or fears of castration, but more often concerns issues of autonomy and independence which typically involve the mother and which arose in the toddler or anal phase. Supportive evidence for this thesis from cross-cultural observations, child developmental studies, and primatology is presented, and the usefulness of this view in facilitating clinical work with such men is described.",

      "title": "Physiology of Libido",
      "abstract": "Libido has always been associated with sexual motivation. The Latin root refers specifically to sexual lust, a term that conjures images of highly motivated behavior. Libido is observed in the strength of desire and responding toward a sexual incentive, and therefore can be regarded as a conscious reflection of sexual motivation, which we define here as the energizing force that generates our level of sexual interest at any given time. It drives our sexual fantasies, compels us to seek out and evaluate sexual incentives, regulates our levels of sexual arousal and desire, and enables us to masturbate, copulate, or engage in other forms of sex play. Although sexual motivation is often viewed as an internal process built upon neuroendocrine mechanisms, such as alterations in brain neurochemical function set forth by steroid hormone actions, it is also modulated by experiences and expectations, learned patterns of behavior and underlying neural activity related to sexual arousal, desire, reward, and inhibition. In turn, these aspects of sexual function feed back on mechanisms of motivation, either to increase (as in the case of arousal, desire, or reward, Fig. 3.1a) or decrease (as in the case of reward or inhibition, Fig. 3.1b) the expression of sexual interest or libido. Delineating the neural mechanisms that underlie these aspects of sexual function has been the focus of recent research in animals and humans.",

Research now demonstrates that typically such abuse goes on for decades, is frequently multi-generational and almost inevitably the father (or step-father) is part of some sort of organized abuse network. Victims of such abuse experience extreme fear and shame, are highly dissociative, highly conditioned, and in keeping with an enduring extreme attachment to their primary abuser typically feel fused with their father and indeed do not experience themselves as owning their own body. Invariably the father and other abusers are represented in their psyche in the form of dissociative identity states. This chapter highlights the enduring attachment to the father, the early manipulation of sexual responses and the ways in which a child abused from a very early age remains very controlled by the father with ongoing polymorphous extreme (usually sadistic) sexual abuse.",

Some studies even found no sex differences at all. Many studies comprised gifted/talented subjects. Taking into account the few studies that simultaneously examined the factors 'giftedness' and 'sex' in relation to overexcitability and that yielded conflicting results, our study attempts to clear these heterogeneous findings by investigating a German sample. Our study comprised intellectually gifted (n = 96) and averagely intelligent (n = 91) adults who filled out the 'Overexcitability Questionnaire-Two'. We found no statistically significant interaction of 'giftedness √ó sex'. Women (regardless of their intellectual status) scored statistically significantly higher than gifted and non-gifted men on emotional as well as sensual overexcitability. With regard to the factor 'giftedness', gifted individuals displayed a statistically significantly higher intellectual overexcitability.",

      "title": "Psychosexual stimulation: Sex differences<sup>1</sup>",
      "abstract": "The most extensive material regarding specific sex differences with regard to psychosexual stimulation was up to now presented by Kinsey et al. (1953). Their results, which were derived from questionnaires, show the following trends: 1. Men more often than women were stimulated through isolated stimuli (naked or clothed persons of the opposite sex, genitals of both the same and of the other sex, and pictures of sexual scenes). 2. Women were aroused by continuous stimuli (commercial moving pictures; literary material, e.g. novels, essays, poetry) practically as often as men. These stimuli must be assumed to be more romantic than sexual in nature. One main difficulty in obtaining unbiased results regarding sex specific differences in psychosexual stimulations consisted in the impossibility to exactly define or control the stimuli. So for example, the answer to the question if one was never, seldom, or often stimulated through literature would depend on what type of literature one had read. The results of Kinsey et al. therefore may reflect less the sex specific differences in psychosexual stimulation as the difference in extent and type of experience with psychosexual stimuli. It could be argued that in Western civilization women have fewer possibilities of obtaining experiences with psychosexual stimuli: Due to the traditional picture of woman as sexually passive, the supply of sexual stimuli is mainly oriented to men. A definition and control of psychosexual stimuli is possible only under experimental conditions. We are aware of twelve relevant experiments where both men and women subjects were examined. Of these twelve experiments, eight do not need to be considered in this connection because no information regarding sex was given (Brehm, 1966; Eliasberg, 1961; Koegler 1965); they were based on too few subjects (Clark, 1950; Hess, 1960); there were only two women and",

It was found that marital quality of men and women differs in degree rather than in kind. Although men are more satisfied with their marriages than women, the same factors are important in their assessments. These aspects are more important to the overall marital quality for women, but their saliency varies by stages of the family life cycle. There are indications of differential assessment, with women more sexually fulfilled, while men are more satisfied with spouse's help, time with children, and friendship; results also suggest a greater focus by women on companionship.",

A sociological investigation into the causes of violation of the usually very stringet incest taboo reveals the importance of the typical life-history in these social strata, showing a unique configuration of circumstances. Home is usually left at a very early age; broken homes, psychological tension between the parents, and frequency of child labor tend to minimize the educational influences. The occupational life shows a frequency of change of jobs and even occupations. A declining trend in the occupational career will be observed at the inception of incestuous behavior. Sometime before the beginning of the incestuous relationship between father and daughter the routine of everyday life suffers and interruption from such a cause as accident, economic trouble, or disease. In almost all cases of father-daughter-incest-by far the most frequent type-the father suffers extreme sexual frustation, having been refused sexual intercourse with his wife. These different instances of the life-history have to be integrated into a comprehensive conception of the social attitudes of the patient. Thus, incest is regarded as due to indifference toward social responsibilities and coinciding with an extreme frustation of the sexual drive.",

We analysed the influence of one's biological sex, sexual orientation, and culture on self-presentation during a date. Women more often manifested morally disgusting behaviours and artistic abilities than men, while men more often manifested pathogenically disgusting behaviours and kindness. Homosexual orientation predicted lower frequency of admitting to moral disgust transgressions, and higher frequency of exhibiting artistic abilities.",

      "title": "Barriers to Moderate Physical Activity in Adult Lesbians",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT ABSTRACT Adult lesbians are not sufficiently physically active to achieve physical and psychological health benefits. Lesbians are one of the least understood minority groups. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to use an ecological framework to identify factors internal to individuals and present in their social environments that may impede participation in regular physical activity. Twenty-one self-identified lesbians aged 22 to 61 years participated in one of four focus groups. The lesbian participants reported many general barriers (i.e., obstacles to participation regardless of sexual orientation) similar to previous research with other populations of women, not stratified by sexual orientation, such as being too tired and the lack of a physical activity partner. A number of lesbian-specific barriers (i.e., obstacles unique to being a lesbian) were also identified, such as the lack of lesbian-focused physical activity groups and the lack of same-sex family memberships to fitness facilities. In conclusion, for many of the general barriers, some of the proven and effective traditional intervention strategies are likely to be effective in increasing physical activity participation rates in the lesbian population. However, barriers related to sexual orientation are likely deeply entrenched in the socio-cultural system of American society and require a societal rethinking of attitudes towards lesbians, a cultural change that is not as easily amenable to traditional health promotion interventions.

      "abstract": "This paper examines Kluft's construct of \"weaponized sex\" through the prism of long-term clinical and research involvement with individuals subjected to ongoing sexual abuse during adulthood, a group that by definition has been exposed to more sexual abuse and for longer than any other defined victim population. Examples of the same sort of phenomena described by Kluft are repeatedly observed in therapy with members of this population, but usually not in a dramatic form. As might be anticipated, in order to survive, when an individual is closely attached to a long-term and extreme abuser, the sort of enduring ambivalence carried by the victim towards their primary abuser is manifested in compartmentalized states that wish their abuser dead, while other states in equally compartmentalized ways maintain the attachment via the use of sex-by continuing to be sexually involved with their primary abuser (usually their father), by fantasizing about sex with their abuser, by being sexually involved with those who co-abused with their father, or by staging reenactments with individuals whose sexual behavior re-evokes the abuse by the absent (or deceased) father. The process of healing means that inevitably some manifestations of the responses to such abuse spill over into therapy.",

Propaganda regular and undying of male strength is cause the formation of personality conflict. Methods 35 patients were examined in this age range. Analysis of the data revealed that most patients were observed ejaculation disorder, (which was associated with increased sexual arousal) and erectile dysfunction, due to a number of reasons (personal characteristics, the nature of psychological trauma). Results At a young age, there is an active search for a regular sexual partner. Unsuccessful attempts to prove their sexual viability leads to the formation of non-adaptive systems of personality that was the cause of sexual dysfunction. Is aggravated sexual dysfunction picture of perfectionism. The emergence of sexual dysfunction was also due to misconceptions about the norm of sexual activity. Thus formed resistant obsessive fear of impotence. Patients in this group rarely share their problems in sexual life with a partner, because they fear for their dignity and fear seem weak, vulnerable.

      "title": "[Need for communication and the role of ageist attitudes in its fulfilment: a qualitative study of older people.]",
      "abstract": "The influence of everyday communication of older people on their quality of life and physical well-being finds more and more evidence and is confirmed by the latest researches of gerontologists. However, in the scientific literature, the attitude of older people towards communication, as well as their strategies for maintaining social connections are still poorly documented. While 19,5% of older people living alone recognize that they do not meet with relatives or friends at all, and 22,7% meet with relatives less than once a month, the social participation of older people, and in particular, their communication needs has so far been paid insufficient attention in Lithuania. This study analyzes the perception of communication by the subjects themselves - older people, as well as the variability of their rationales / attitudes in relation to supporting the desired level of communication. The analysis of semi-structured interviews (n=27) revealed a paradoxical contradiction: with a high need for interpersonal contacts, older people living alone who are still relatively healthy and active can have low social activity. Empirical data points to ageism (both explicit and latent), as well as self-ageism acquired by older people throughout life as one of the reasons for not supporting the desired level of communication and relatively weak intergenerational relations in Lithuania.–ò—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –≥–µ—Ä–æ–Ω—Ç–æ–ª–æ–≥–æ–≤ –ø–æ–¥—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–∞—é—Ç –≤–ª–∏—è–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ–≤—Å–µ–¥–Ω–µ–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ–∂–∏–ª—ã—Ö –ª—é–¥–µ–π –Ω–∞ –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∏—Ö –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –∏ —Ñ–∏–∑–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–µ —Å–∞–º–æ—á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ. –û–¥–Ω–∞–∫–æ –≤ –Ω–∞—É—á–Ω–æ–π –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–µ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–æ–∂–∏–ª—ã—Ö –ª—é–¥–µ–π –∫ –æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—é –∏ –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏—é —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–≤—è–∑–µ–π –ø–æ-–ø—Ä–µ–∂–Ω–µ–º—É –ø–ª–æ—Ö–æ –∑–∞–¥–æ–∫—É–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–æ. –≠—Ç–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º–µ –≤ –õ–∏—Ç–≤–µ –¥–æ —Å–∏—Ö –ø–æ—Ä —É–¥–µ–ª—è–ª–æ—Å—å –Ω–µ–¥–æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ –≤–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏—è, —Ö–æ—Ç—è 19,5% –ø–æ–∂–∏–ª—ã—Ö –ª—é–¥–µ–π, –ø—Ä–æ–∂–∏–≤–∞—é—â–∏—Ö –≤ –¥–æ–º–æ—Ö–æ–∑—è–π—Å—Ç–≤–∞—Ö –∏–∑ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞, –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞—é—Ç, —á—Ç–æ –≤–æ–æ–±—â–µ –Ω–µ –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∞—é—Ç—Å—è —Å —Ä–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–∫–∞–º–∏ –∏–ª–∏ –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è–º–∏, –∞ 22,7% –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—á–∞—é—Ç—Å—è —Å –±–ª–∏–∑–∫–∏–º–∏ –º–µ–Ω–µ–µ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–∑–∞ –≤ –º–µ—Å—è—Ü. –î–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç –≤–æ—Å–ø—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∏–µ –æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è —Å–∞–º–∏–º–∏ —Å—É–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç–∞–º–∏ ‚Äî –ø–æ–∂–∏–ª—ã–º–∏ –ª—é–¥—å–º–∏, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –≤–∞—Ä–∏–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –∏—Ö –æ–±–æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π/—É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–æ–∫ –ø–æ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—é –∫ –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫–µ –∂–µ–ª–∞–µ–º–æ–≥–æ —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω—è –æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è. –ê–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑ –ø–æ–ª—É—Å—Ç—Ä—É–∫—Ç—É—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤—å—é (n=27) –≤—ã—è–≤–∏–ª –ø–∞—Ä–∞–¥–æ–∫—Å–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–æ—Ä–µ—á–∏–µ: –ø—Ä–∏ –≤—ã—Å–æ–∫–æ–π –ø–æ—Ç—Ä–µ–±–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –≤ –º–µ–∂–ª–∏—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Ç–∞—Ö –ø–æ–∂–∏–ª—ã–µ –ª—é–¥–∏, –≤—Å–µ –µ—â–µ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –∑–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤—ã–µ –∏ –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã–µ, –ø—Ä–æ–∂–∏–≤–∞—é—â–∏–µ –≤ –æ–¥–∏–Ω–æ—á–∫—É, –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –∏–º–µ—Ç—å –Ω–∏–∑–∫—É—é —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—É—é –∞–∫—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å. –≠–º–ø–∏—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —É–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞—é—Ç –Ω–∞ —ç–π–¥–∂–∏–∑–º (–∫–∞–∫ —è–≤–Ω—ã–π, —Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –ª–∞—Ç–µ–Ω—Ç–Ω—ã–π), –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ –ø—Ä–∏–æ–±—Ä–µ—Ç–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ø–æ–∂–∏–ª—ã–º–∏ –ª—é–¥—å–º–∏ –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç—è–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ —Å–∞–º–æ—ç–π–¥–∂–∏–∑–º –∫–∞–∫ –æ–¥–Ω—É –∏–∑ –ø—Ä–∏—á–∏–Ω –Ω–µ–ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞–Ω–∏—è –∂–µ–ª–∞–µ–º–æ–≥–æ —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω—è –æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏ —Å—Ä–∞–≤–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ —Å–ª–∞–±—ã—Ö –º–µ–∂–ø–æ–∫–æ–ª–µ–Ω—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–π –≤ –õ–∏—Ç–≤–µ.",

      "title": "Viol√™ncia sexual : impactos sobre o desenvolvimento da autoconsci√™ncia e autorrepresenta√ß√µes do self no ciclo de vida",
      "abstract": "Sexual violence against children and adolescents, a modality of sexual violence, is characterized as any sexual act or game, established in heterosexual or homosexual relationships, involving one or more adults and a child or adolescent, aiming at sexually stimulating the victim, or using it to obtain sexual stimulation in erotic, pornographic and sexual practices imposed through enticement, physical force or threats. Considered a public health problem and violation of human rights, this phenomenon produces serious biopsychosocial consequences, including feelings of guilt, low self-esteem, impairment of physical and emotional development, making victims more vulnerable to suicide ideas and attempts, as well as psychosomatic illnesses and sexually transmitted. Although scientific studies have pointed out the consequences of sexual violence in childhood and adolescence on the physical and emotional dimensions of victims, little is known about its influence on the development of self-awareness and self-representations of the self in the life cycle. Based on these assumptions, this study investigates the impacts of sexual violence on self-awareness and self-representations of the self in the life cycle. It is characterized as a cross-sectional and comparative study, involving two groups of participating subjects, divided between victims and non-victims of sexual violence in childhood and/or adolescence. Its sample is composed of 236 subjects, between youth and adults, of both sexes, university students and from different economic classes. The investigation consists of three interlaced studies, the first of which is an ex-post-facto type, in which the participants answered the handout containing a sociodemographic questionnaire and psychometric instruments; and, the second and third, multiple case studies, of the phenomenal and qualitative type, based on semi-structured interviews, using a thematic script. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, Pearson, Spearman and Pearson Bisserial correlation tests, Student's t test, Multiple Regression Techniques, and Similarity Structure Analysis. The qualitative data followed the interpretative model of the double hermeneutics, proposed by Giddens (1984), by which it is possible to unveil the meanings that the subjects themselves constraint from their actions, compared with the sense that the analysts, from theoretical and methodological constructs build in relation to the actions and interpretations of their interlocutors (Geertz, 1987).. Thus, we sought broader understandings about the impacts of sexual violence on the structuring of self-awareness and self-representations of the self; as well as about the aggravating factors for the occurrence of the phenomenon in childhood and adolescence; and, on the meanings attributed to them by those who have violated their bodies and intimacy, which is fundamental to the most accurate understanding of sexual violence in the life cycle.",

      "abstract": "This article contends that youth who engage in persistent coarse sexual improprieties and/or, sexually abusive behaviors are too often viewed primarily through a criminological lens, regardless of their age, gender, judicial status, and/or experiences of past trauma/victimization. Such a posture likely falsifies the clinical perception of the individual referred for \"treatment.\" Assessment and interventions for these youth must be holistic and idiosyncratic, considering numerous multiplex developmental variables (i.e., overall human sexual development, gender identity, sexual identity, sexual orientation, erotic development, intimacy deficits, adverse childhood experiences/trauma), as well as sociological and anthropological fundamentals. The lens for assessing and intervening with youth must also include in its focus the constantly changing Zeitgeist, that is, the spirit or the mood of the times. The proposed lens is applicable to all youth, adjudicated and non-adjudicated. Specific considerations are discussed related to those youth with a history of significant child maltreatment who later engage in persistent coarse sexual improprieties and/or sexually abusive behaviors.",

      "title": "Marginaci√≥n sexual de las personas con discapacidad",
      "abstract": "La salud en la sexualidad es el estado de equilibrio org√°nico y psicosocial que permite al individuo desarrollarse como ser sexuado, y la discapacidad es la reducci√≥n en la capacidad funcional para desempe√±ar las actividades cotidianas en forma √∫til e independiente a consecuencia de un d√©ficit temporal o permanente en las √°reas f√≠sica, mental o social. Existen varios mitos y estereotipos en torno a la sexualidad de las personas con discapacidad; la misma gente es capaz de mermar dr√°sticamente la expresi√≥n sexual de estas personas, como pensar que son asexuales y que dependen de los dem√°s. Tambi√©n existe una devaluaci√≥n de la percepci√≥n corporal que dificulta apreciarse como un sujeto sexualmente atractivo. A esto se suman otros factores que pueden ser considerados un obst√°culo para la vida sexual, como el dolor, el uso de f√°rmacos, incontinencia urinaria o fecal, la dificultad para adoptar ciertas posiciones para realizar el coito e incluso el temor a la muerte. Es indudable que la vida sexual de las personas discapacitadas tiene una especificidad, bien en s√≠ misma, bien por las condiciones en que pueden vivirla. Cada discapacidad supone una cierta especificidad en la forma de vivir la sexualidad, cada discapacitado y cada contexto familiar y social tambi√©n, los discapacitados tienen posibilidades y formas muy diferentes de vivir la sexualidad. Las personas con discapacidad, son personas sexuales y tienen un amplio rango de necesidades emocionales y sexuales y los mismos problemas que las personas con cuerpos h√°biles. Tienen los mismos derechos sexuales y la posibilidad de involucrarse totalmente en interrelaciones emocionales y sexuales.",

      "title": "Impacto de factores econ√≥micos sobre el bienestar subjetivo en poblaci√≥n adulta de la Argentina urbana",
      "abstract": "La incorporacion del bienestar subjetivo en terminos de indicadores de desarrollo humano se fundamenta en la concepcion teorica de que el estudio y la promocion del desarrollo humano deben integrar dimensiones que superen los factores asociados a las condiciones materiales de vida, tradicionalmente considerados como medidas absolutas o excluyentes del bienestar. Aunque es evidente que la relacion entre la satisfaccion de necesidades materiales es condicion para el surgimiento y desarrollo de las necesidades y capacidades subjetivas, no parece estar todo dicho sobre la forma en que un funcionamiento psicologico optimo depende de funcionamientos socio-economicos basicos. Este estudio parte del supuesto de que los fenomenos que remiten al bienestar subjetivo y al bienestar economico-material se vinculan, pero no necesariamente se explican ni determinan mutuamente. El 18,7% de la poblacion presenta algun tipo de sintomatologia ansiosa o depresiva, el 18,2% se siente poco satisfecho con su vida y casi 1 de cada 3 se siente poco o nada feliz. En relacion con los recursos cognitivos, el 23,7% de la poblacion manifiesta afrontamiento negativo, mientras que el 11% presenta creencia de control externo. La condicion de pobreza afecta las probabilidades de experimentar una situacion deficitaria para todos los indicadores seleccionados. Ser pobre por ingresos o indigente incrementa de manera notoria las posibilidades de padecer malestar psicologico, experimentar poca satisfaccion con la vida, sentirse poco o nada feliz, asi como tambien la probabilidad de afrontamiento negativo o creencia de control externo. Entre los individuos en hogares con al menos una carencia relativa a derechos sociales o economicos, se duplica la proporcion de poblacion con sintomatologia ansiosa y depresiva, en comparacion a aquellos que no evidencian ninguna carencia en los derechos sociales y economicos seleccionados. A medida que se incrementa la cantidad de carencias observadas en dimensiones de derechos sociales, la incidencia del malestar psicologico se incrementa. Si bien con distintas proporciones segun el indicador considerado, la presencia de carencias en alguna dimension y la cantidad de estas contribuyen a incrementar de manera importante las probabilidades de experimentar deficit para los indicadores observados. Con diferencias en las proporciones, se percibe para todos los indicadores una incidencia menor para los que no son pobres ni vulnerables por carencias. A excepcion de la experiencia de sentirse poco o nada feliz, se observan ademas niveles diferenciales de deficit para los distintos indicadores segun las categorias de la matriz. Las situaciones de pobreza multidimensional, que son las que presentan de manera simultanea carencias en terminos de ingresos como de derechos multiplican las chances de presentar algun aspecto de malestar subjetivo. Esto se incrementa aun mas para los casos que presentan pobreza multidimensional extrema.",

Then, they attempt to offer a classification based on clinical examples. Secondary sterilities of psychogenic origin are only seen in women who have lost a child in the pre, per or post-partum period. This is even a characteristic example of non organic sterility. Primary sterilities may be psychological in origin, especially by absence of maturation of the child planning project (case of sterilities cured after adoption). They are seen more infrequently: in adult anorexia nervosa, psychological sexual differentiation disorders, masculine women. These difficulties are not easy to approach as much as psychological and organic factors may be entangled. In addition, one question is raised: who should take care of it? The psychiatrist or the gynecologist? Overall, the latter is preferable under the condition that he/she is properly trained. Anyway, it is ultimately the woman's choice.",

Few empirical investigations have been conducted on the preferences of adolescent boys and girls, despite the fact that this developmental period represents a time of awakening romantic and sexual interest. The authors asked 46 teenage boys and girls (average age = 15.09 years) to indicate their preferences for various characteristics in an ideal long-term romantic or short-term sexual partner (randomly assigned). Both sexes emphasized attributes related to physical appeal (e.g., attractive physical appearance, sexy appearance) and sexual drive (e.g., sexual passion, high sex drive, sexual responsiveness) when evaluating a casual sexual partner. Conversely, participants focused more upon intellect and other mentally appealing attributes (e.g., intelligence, humor) when considering a romantic partner. No sex differences were found, suggesting that teenage boys and girls share a similar conception of the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù partner.",

      "title": "Alcohol, Eroticism and Sexual Performance: A Social Interactionist Perspective",
      "abstract": "Impotence and reduction in libido among chronic alcoholic men has been seen to be primarily caused by physiological changes resulting from constant and heavy drinking. Studies of this phenomenon have focused on males, amount of intake, and the correlation of alcohol ingestion with effects on bodily functions, to the exclusion of three social factors that may be a significant part of the sex act: First, the attitudes and behavior of the sex partner of the drinking male as they affect interaction between the two; second, sexual arousal has been studied as an ‚Äúencapsulated‚Äù act, rather than a part of the process of negotiation between partners which may culminate in intercourse; and third, the focus of research on impotence is restricted to the realm of sexual activity, ignoring other aspects of the relationship an alcoholic may have with his sex partner. Additionally, the sex problems of men in marriages (or with sex partners) where alcohol is not a problem is seldom compared with alcoholic men to see if they differ substantially in this area. In a study designed to explore the impact of these social factors on impotence, 76 wives of alcoholics, 28 alcoholic husbands and a control sample of 63 wives and 46 husbands in marriages where alcohol is not a problem were interviewed in depth about their sexual relationship and about other areas of their marriage which surfaced as the most troublesome for wives of alcoholics‚Äîcompanionship, meals, and recreation. Findings suggest that a good portion of the erotic reduction and performance problems that alcoholic men experience are much more complex than physiological decline alone. A complex amalgam of rejection by their partners, which is influenced by the dynamics of their relationship in other areas of the marriage, as well as their different perspectives on what sort of behavior is a suitable prelude to intercourse can be seen to affect sexual interest and/or performance.",

While people wish to talk with their healthcare providers about changes in their intimate and sexual relationships, many barriers exist. Despite a lack of prospective studies to guide assessment of the sexual and intimate needs of people at the end of life, healthcare providers can and should strive for inclusivity by using the multidisciplinary team, asking open-ended questions, and assessing the physical, emotional, psychological, and spiritual needs of their patients. While some physical symptoms can be palliated, the physical and emotional changes that accompany serious illness and the dying process can be normalized and supported by healthcare providers.",

      "title": "Religious Influence and Premarital Sexual Experience: Critical Observations on the Validity of a Relationship",
      "abstract": "Until now, studies of religious influence on premarital sexual experience have made an implicit assumption that the first occasion of sexual intercourse, whether for males or for females, is consensual. However, recent studies by feminist and other researchers have indicated that at least some degree of coercion is present in a sizeable minority of initial occasions, especially for girls and young women. To the extent that such is the case, religious constraints upon sexual activity cannot be considered relevant for the nonconsenting partner. Failure to take this issue into account has partially undermined the validity of even the most recent studies and might account for some anomalies in those studies. Sociologists of religion have long maintained, and their research has usually confirmed, that religiosity at the individual level acts as a constraint upon early sexual activity outside of marriage. This relationship seems to hold whether religiosity is defined as church participation or as commitment to conservative religious beliefs. Sexual activity (the presumptive dependent variable in this relationship) is typically defined as sexual intercourse, with the implicit assumption that at least the first occasion of intercourse (or of any other form of genital contact) was consensual. Respondents in surveys are considered either virgins or nonvirgins on the basis of whether premarital intercourse is admitted, with the usual hypothesis that the rate of virginity will be higher among the religiously committed than",

However the comparative impact of different events, which often co-occur, has not been systematically evaluated, or studies assumed that the impacts are equivalent in both amplitude and duration, that different wellbeing domains are equally affected, and that individuals exhibit hedonic adaptation. We evaluated the individual and conditional impact of eighteen major life-events, and compared their effects on affective and cognitive wellbeing in a large population-based cohort using fixed-effect regression models assessing within person change. Several commonly cited events had little, if any, independent effect on wellbeing (promotion, being fired, friends passing), whilst others had profound impacts regardless of co-occurring events (e.g., financial loss, death of partner, childbirth). No life events had overall positive effects on both types of wellbeing, but separation, injury/illnesses and monetary losses caused negative impacts on both, which did not display hedonic adaptation. Affective hedonic adaptation to all positive events occurred by two years but monetary gains and retirement had ongoing benefits on cognitive wellbeing. Marriage, retirement and childbirth had positive effects on cognitive wellbeing but no overall effect on affective wellbeing, whilst moving home was associated with a negative effect on cognitive wellbeing but no affective wellbeing response. Describing the independent impact of different life events, and, for some, the differential affective and life satisfaction responses, and lack of hedonic adaptation people display, may help clinicians, economists and policy-makers, but individual's hopes for happiness from positive events appears misplaced.",

      "title": "Behavioral and neuroendocrine consequences of social subjugation across adolescence and adulthood",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Social subjugation is a very significant and natural stressor in the animal kingdom. Adult animals defeated and subjugated during establishment of dominance hierarchies or territorial encounters can be highly submissive in future agonistic interactions. While much is know about the biological and behavioral consequences of winning and losing fights in adulthood, little is known about adolescence; a developmental period noted for impulsivity and heightened agonistic behavior. The present studies were undertaken to determine if the behavioral and neuroendocrine consequences of social subjugation are comparable in adolescent versus adult Syrian golden hamsters ( Mesocricetus auratus ). Male siblings were studied from adolescence into adulthood following exposure to counterbalanced episodes of either a benign stressor, i.e., isolation in a novel cage, or the more severe stressor of social subjugation. Results As adults, hamsters with a history of social subjugation in adolescence show high levels of aggression toward intruders as compared to siblings subjugated in adulthood. Sibling controls subjugated in adulthood are highly submissive with little or no aggressive behavior. However, when subjugated in adulthood, hamsters with the earlier history of subjugation are no different than their sibling controls, i.e., adult subjugation promotes submissive behavior. Sexual motivation is high in adult hamsters with adolescent subjugation and testosterone levels remained stable over adulthood. In contrast, sibling controls subjugated in adulthood show lower levels of sexual motivation and reduced levels of testosterone. Release of cortisol during agonistic encounters is blunted in animals subjugated in adolescence but not adulthood. Measures of anxiety are reduced in hamsters with adolescent subjugation as compared to their sibling controls. Conclusion These data demonstrate a pronounced difference in behavior and neuroendocrinology between adolescent and adult hamsters in their response to social subjugation and suggest adolescence is a resilient period in development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The authors suggest that the concept of loss may serve as an organizing principle to clarify many of the dynamics of close relationships. Prior to the ultimate loss of the relationship, there may be intermediate losses that undermine relationship stability. Research on social allergies, or extreme responses to minor annoyances, suggests that relatively mild antigens, if frequently repeated, can gradually cause a loss of feelings of idealization of the partner, comfort with the partner, or feelings of being cared about or respected by the partner. Larger problems may cause loss of major elements of love. The loss of physical attractiveness may, depending on the partner's attributions, be associated with the loss of passion. The loss of desired levels of social support may lead to the loss of intimacy, whereas the loss of customary levels of interdependent behavior may lead to a loss of commitment. The loss of honesty in the relationship may lead to a cascade of other losses. Finally, the partner's differing perspectives on the loss can lead to account-making and the deriving of meaning from the loss.",

      "abstract": "In this study, that follows another one, where the normal characteristics of adolescence that may influence suicidal behavior were focalised, a critical review of the psycho-social elements involved in the matter is done; attention is also given to the clinical picture. The family influences are very important and frequently we find antecedents of suicidal behavior in parents or in near relatives. The homes are usually unhappy with a father absent or \"feeble\". It is not rare the presence of a dominant-rejecting mother. The home is poor in love expressions, and the intra and extra family reactions tend to lead to the youth social isolation. With the changes that normally happens in adolescence, the repressed aggressive impulses increase and tend for discharge at this phase, but usually the youth turns them against himself. The emergent genital sexuality is also perceived as threatening by the parents. Though lacking more detailed studies, it seems that families of suicidal adolescents are very similar to the families of depressive ones. In females, cultural influences such as greater tolerance to suicidal attempts behavior, perhaps explain the higher incidence of this behavior. Men usually use violent methods for consumating the suicide, and often their mental status is more severe than in females. The precipitant factors vary a lot but they usually give evidence of a conflictive situation. It is suspected that often the patient unconsciously puts himself in the difficult situation. The influence of mental illness in the suicidal behavior of adolescents is complicated by several classificatory systems and the possibility of considering abnormal aspects that normally occur during adolescence. In the clinical picture is important to consider the patient report about his suicidal thoughts. The evaluation of the defences, the intensity of the conflict and the suicidal ideas involved, will determine our conduct. An important feature is that, in adolescents, depressive symptoms usually occur as \"equivalents\". The prognostic is worse when it is impossible to modify family relationships and when social life continues unpoverished. In 40% of the cases a new suicide attempt is done, and the risk is greater during the year that follows the first attempt. Prevention may be done by trying to understand and discuss adolescents problems with them in their peer groups. Public campaigns and courses with moral appeals should be avoided because they increase feelings of guilt. Special attention has to be given in each case to social and family situations. An early diagnosis by pediatricians, clinicians, teachers and law authorities is very important. To do this work they need to have instruction about the adolescence developments.",

      "abstract": "ResumenResumenLos celos son un mecanismo psicol√≥gico clave para los hombres y las mujeres, que se activan en respuesta a la amenaza de una relaci√≥n valiosa. Hay diferencia en la respuesta de hombres y mujeres ante una situaci√≥n de celos. En general los hombres se sienten m√°s preocupados que las mujeres por una infidelidad sexual potencial y las mujeres se sienten peor que los hombres ante una hipot√©tica infidelidad emocional. Sin embargo, en las dos investigaciones realizadas se comprueba que algunos factores sociales y culturales‚Äîv.g. g√©nero y deseabilidad social‚Äîmodulan esta asimetr√≠a sexual y apoyan una perspectiva interaccionista que minimiza la dicotom√≠a causal evoluci√≥n versus socializaci√≥n. En ambos estudios se comprob√≥ tambi√©n que, en buena medida, las respuestas emitidas por los sujetos son debidas al artefacto experimental de elecci√≥n forzada utilizado habitualmente. No se encontr√≥ dependencia entre el sexo y el tipo de celos experimentado cuando se controlaban los factores socioculturales y los sesgos delprocedimiento experimental.AbstractJealousy is a psychological mechanism for men and women that is activated in response to a threat to a valuable relationship. There are differences in the responses of men and women facing a situation of jealousy. In general, men feel more bothered than women by a potential sexual infidelity and women feel worse than men in the face of a hypothetical emotional infidelity. However, the two studies show that some social and cultural factors‚Äîe.g., gender and social desirability‚Äîmodulate this sexual asymmetry, and support an interactive perspective that minimizes the evolution versus socialization dichotomy. In both studies it was also shown that, to a large extent, the responses given by the participants are due to the experimental artifact of the choice format normally used. There was no dependence between sex and the type of jealousy experienced when sociocultural factors and the experimental artifacts were controlled.Palabras clave: Celosdiferencias sexualesg√©neropsicolog√≠a evolucionistaKeywords: Jealousysexual differencesgenderevolutionary psychology",

      "title": "Why Sex (Offending) Is Different",
      "abstract": "The central premise of this paper is that a significant amount of sex offending stems from unusual or inappropriate sexual preferences that appear in early adolescence, are relatively stable, and immutable. In other words, they are like the more ordinary sexual preferences with which we are familiar. As such, they generate sexual impulses that are insistent. Individuals will be strongly tempted to act on them, alternatives to satisfying them will be unfulfilling, and complete long-term control of such impulses is unlikely. Yet since individuals with sexual preferences for inappropriate objects or activities are neither morally nor legally permitted to act on them, they find themselves in a terrific bind. The public is, to some extent, correct in not trusting the individuals with such preferences and thus in attempting to monitor or control them. However, most efforts to do so appear ineffective and counterproductive. Recidivist sex offenders are particularly worrisome. The possibility of voluntary castration for such offenders, in lieu of preventive detention or other more restrictive measures, is explored.",

      "title": "Altruism and selfishness",
      "abstract": "Many situations in human life present choices between (a) narrowly preferred particular alternatives and (b) narrowly less preferred (or aversive) particular alternatives that nevertheless form part of highly preferred abstract behavioral patterns. Such alternatives characterize problems of self-control. For example, at any given moment, a person may accept alcoholic drinks yet also prefer being sober to being drunk over the next few days. Other situations present choices between (a) alternatives beneficial to an individual and (b) alternatives that are less beneficial (or harmful) to the individual that would nevertheless be beneficial if chosen by many individuals. Such alternatives characterize problems of social cooperation; choices of the latter alternative are generally considered to be altruistic. Altruism, like self-control, is a valuable temporally-extended pattern of behavior. Like self-control, altruism may be learned and maintained over an individual's lifetime. It needs no special inherited mechanism. Individual acts of altruism, each of which may be of no benefit (or of possible harm) to the actor, may nevertheless be beneficial when repeated over time. However, because each selfish decision is individually preferred to each altruistic decision, people can benefit from altruistic behavior only when they are committed to an altruistic pattern of acts and refuse to make decisions on a case-by-case basis.",

In spite of this it can be said that the biological bases in men and in women are characterized by lower speed and intensity. The old people's attitude towards sexuality in general and their own sexuality is still less liberal than the attitude of younger persons. The frequency of sexual intercourse decreases, mainly because of lack of partners or because of health problems. There are many other forms of sexual behavior; especially, the importance of tenderness is increasing. A theoretical model of factors influencing the sexuality in old age is presented. Practical considerations concerning the prevention in young and in older people, treatment of older people in the physician's practice and their living in institutions conclude the article.",

      "title": "Rejection sensitivity and male violence in romantic relationships",
      "abstract": "Abstract Rejection sensitivity is the disposition to anxiously expect, readily perceive, and intensely react to rejection by significant others. A model of the role of this disposition in male violence toward romantic partners is proposed. Specifically, it is proposed that rejection sensitivity is a vulnerability factor for two distinct maladaptive styles of coping with intimate relationships. Rejection‚Äêsensitive men may attempt to prevent anticipated rejection by reducing their investment in intimate relationships. Alternatively, they may become highly invested in intimate relationships in search of an unconditionally supportive partner. Their low threshold for perceiving and overreacting to rejection, however, heightens their risk of responding aggressively to their partners‚Äônegative or ambiguous behavior. Cross‚Äêsectional data from 217 male college students supported predictions derived from the model. Among college men who reported relatively high investment in romantic relationships, anxious expectations of rejection predicted dating violence. Among men who reported relatively low investment in romantic relationships, anxious expectations of rejection predicted reduced involvement in discretionary close relationships with friends and romantic partners and, more generally, increased distress in and avoidance of social situations.",

      "title": "Sex Differences in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): Short Literature Review",
      "abstract": "The review of the latest foreign literature on the issue of sex differences in ADHD carriers is presented. The analysis of theories on the causes of the prevalence of the disorder among boys and girls is presented, and minor sex differences are highlighted. Therefore, ADHD is more common among boys than among girls, which leads to arguments about the difference valid in the prevalence of the disorder among men and women. Also, many researchers have noticed certain differences in the symptoms and behaviour of girls compared to boys, both in childhood and adulthood. Boys and girls with ADHD appear to be more similar than different, and usually the symptoms are not sex specific, but still there is a difference. In general, these differences are manifested in the fact that girls have problems with the emotional sphere and the predominant inattentive symptoms of ADHD, while boys have problems with the behavioural sphere and the predominant impulsive and hyperactive type of ADHD. Moreover, boys are more aggressive in behaviour than girls, although girls are more likely to manifest verbal aggression than their female peers, who do not have the disorder. It has been found that the difference in the prevalence of the disorder among males and females can be described by the Cognitive Endophenotype Theory, which assumes the influence of generally accepted endophenotypes on the severity of ADHD, that means processing speed, inhibition and working memory. This theory does not preclude theories such as the Mean Difference Model and the Variance Difference Model, which state that men on the average have more severe symptoms than women, and thus the scale of the severity of the ADHD among boys is much wider than among women.",

They are intelligent, gifted and usually untroubled by the variations of their sexual drives, or the occasional fleeting interest in people of their own sex. Their femininity, only faintly noticeable to others, is as a rule well integrated and often put to good use in their professional lives. On the debit side, although they are capable of fairly lasting and deeply satisfying relationships with women, we find a high divorce rate and frequent changes of partners. Some of them can be exceptionally promiscuous, exploiting their capacity to attract women in a wholly effortless manner. Their promiscuity has a striking oral quality, in so far as they give the impression of being sexually insatiable, thus confirming the psychoanalytic observation of the equation penis=mouth. Many of them are little affected by an orgasmic incompetence which is hidden by a reasonable sexual performance. All these men are incapable of a full homosexual contact, though some have experimented with boys in childhood or early adolescence, but never intensely.",

Three categories of missing children are studied: runaways, the largest group of missing children; victims of parental kidnapping; and victims of family abductions. Between 11 and 23 percent of runaways become involved in prostitution; once involved in prostitution, runaways are more vulnerable to rape and pornography. Runaways at the most risk of engaging in prostitution are those who leave home frequently and longer each time, those with a history of serious sexual abuse, those from dysfunctional families, and males who describe themselves as homosexual or bisexual. There is no evidence that victims of parental abduction are at greater risk of sexual exploitation than children in the general population. Sexual abuse sometimes accompanies nonfamily abductions, but public fears may have exaggerated this connection; when sexual abuse does occur during nonfamily abduction, the effects on these children are probably quite severe and long lasting, with the presence of many symptoms more than 4 years later.",

Though the responses of spouses were correlated highly, husbands were more satisfied with the quality of the sexual relationship than were wives. As found previously with more general populations, self-esteem and higher levels of positive regard, communication, and cohesion were related to higher sexual satisfaction for both husbands and wives. For wives, higher socioeconomic status and younger age were related to higher sexual satisfaction, as was the husband's being a current or retired member of the US military. Cultural factors were also important; conflicts over sexual practices related to cultural differences, though limited to about 10% of the subjects, were related to sexual satisfaction for both husbands and wives. Wives' English proficiency was related slightly to sexual satisfaction, but not husbands' proficiency in Korean. For husbands only, marital conflict over cultural differences and rejection by relatives and friends were related negatively to sexual satisfaction. Clinical implications of the results are discussed.",

      "title": "Men‚Äôs Intrasexual Competition",
      "abstract": "Sex differences in obligatory parental investment and reproductive potential cause human females to desire high-quality men as partners. For men, this means that to achieve reproductive success, they must 1) combat other men to gain access to or retain mates, and to guard the resources women need for reproduction and child care, and/or 2) attract women by displaying (sexual) ornamentations or direct provision of resources. These pressures have shaped men‚Äôs physiology, as well as mating-related and other behaviors, and result in intense male‚Äìmale intrasexual competition. In this chapter, I provide an overview of men‚Äôs intrasexual competitiveness, first detailing several important concepts, before focusing on the major domains of these competitions. The research reviewed shows that physical formidability and social status are central to human male‚Äìmale competition ‚Äì although qualitatively different, these dimensions are intertwined, such that formidable men are more likely to excel in physical combat and competition, and as a result attain higher social status and, ultimately, increased reproductive success. Men use an array of tactics to compete with same-sex rivals, ranging from direct aggression and physical contests (e.g., in sports or fights) to (verbal) competitor derogation, and the conspicuous flaunting of possessions, leisure activities, and helping behaviors. Finally, yet importantly, research on the context-dependent fluctuations in men‚Äôs testosterone levels sheds light on the underlying processes of male intrasexual competition. Specifically, increases in testosterone are observed both in preparation for and as a result of male‚Äìmale competitions, and a sharp decline in testosterone after entering in a long-term romantic relationship or during fatherhood suggest a down-regulation of these competitive tendencies.",

      "abstract": "On what we can call the ‚Äúfolk‚Äù conception of sexual orientation, sexual orientation is understood as sex-based attraction, that is, as (partly) attraction on the basis of the perceived sex of the person to whom one is attracted. However, in recent discussions, philosophers have either added gender to sex as the basis of sexual orientation, or have altogether replaced sex with gender. Moreover, this addition or replacement has gone ‚Äì mostly ‚Äì unargued for. This paper argues that a sex-based conception of sexual orientation remains plausible because (1) it is compatible with gender-based attraction, which I argue can be understood as a preference; (2) the reasons so far on offer for adding gender to sex (or for replacing sex with gender) are not convincing; (3) we have good evolutionary and non-evolutionary reasons for thinking that sex is the basis of sexual orientation; (4) we have good reasons to not add gender as a basis of sexual orientation; and (5) a sex-based conception of sexual orientation accommodates the various sexual orientations that have recently appeared, orientations in addition to the folk two (or three) of heterosexuality, homosexuality (and bisexuality), such as pansexuality, skoliosexuality, gynsexuality, and androsexuality. What emerges is a conception of sexual orientation based on the sex of the people to whom we are attracted, but that understands sexual-based attraction in broad enough terms to include surgically altered bodies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This book discusses cases where it‚Äôs unclear whether a person‚Äôs consent to sex should count as valid consent, the kind of consent that makes it permissible for the person they give consent to to have sex with them. Clear cases of coercion, for example, involve the threat of significant physical harm. But what should we say about cases involving the threat of harms that are relatively insignificant or that involve no physical harm at all? Impersonating someone‚Äôs spouse to trick them into saying yes to sex is clearly seriously wrong, but what about the more mundane kinds of lies people tell when they‚Äôre trying to meet someone? It‚Äôs wrong to have sex with someone who says yes when they‚Äôre so drunk they‚Äôre about to pass out and not wrong if they say yes after having a few sips of beer. What, though, should we say about the more difficult cases in the middle where it‚Äôs genuinely unclear whether they‚Äôve had too much to drink? What‚Äôs the most reasonable view about other forms of incompetent consent to sex, like those involving young children, elderly dementia patients, or people born with severe and permanent cognitive impairments? And what about cases of problematic sexual consent that don‚Äôt involve coercion, deception, or incompetence at all? Can a patient give valid consent to sex with their therapist? Can the offer of a large amount of money in exchange for sex invalidate the sexual consent the offer elicits? This book addresses these and related questions.",

      "abstract": "Five cases of filicide committed by mothers are reported. Filicide remains an abnormality, primarily restricted to the female. Faulty relationships to either parent or extremely poor marital adjustment, or both, were present in each case. Four cases were combined with serious suicidal attempts, and a feeling of general inadequacy and inability to raise children was admitted by all mothers. All 5 appeared regretful of the act and state that they would never repeat it. The disparity between logic and affectivity was so strong in each case during commitment of the act that a diagnosis of schizophrenic break was justified in all 5. Motivations of punishment, revenge and secondary gain, as usually seen in ordinary murders were, to all appearances, completely absent. The primarily conceived suicidal attempts of the mothers rule these out almost logically. Thus, the suicidal attempts in no way represent an escape from the legal consequence of having done away with human life. A general feeling of unacceptance led to the suicide, and the \"total-all\"‚Äìincluding anything that belonged to the mother‚Äìhad to abandon earthly existence, hence the combined filicide-suicide. Two cases involved 2 and 3 victims, respectively, the remainder one each. The mode of killing differed: two cases of shooting, one each of choking, poisoning and drowning. Ages of mothers ranged from 27 years to 47 years, of victims from 3 to 14 years.",

      "title": "IS THE HUMAN PERSONALITY MORE PLASTIC IN INFANCY AND CHILDHOOD?",
      "abstract": "The article reviews data, much of rather recent origin, bearing on the assumption that human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood. The available data permit the following conclusions: l. We have no compelling evidence of a predictable relationship between child training practices and later personality. 2. Severe psychological stresses can have as marked effects in adulthood as in infancy and childhood, sometimes having greater effects in adulthood than in childhood. 3. Important personality changes occur after childhood (in the absence of treatment) including the disappearance of marked psychological disorders. 4. Infants reared according to ostensibly ideal methods of infant care show no greater immunity to mental illness than do other children reared differently. Infants reared under apparently inadequate or harmful circumstances do not necessarily develop psychological disorders. 5. Resemblances between patterns of behavior in children and adults can be explained without the hypothesis of a special impressionability or vulnerability of personality in childhood. 6. The initial immobility and the prolonged physical dependency of children upon adults places them at a special disadvantage in that they cannot readily change their environments to obtain new experiences. A lack of new experiences may give to the personality a pattern which appears more fixed than it really is. The assumption that the human personality is more plastic in infancy and childhood than in adulthood remains unproven. Neither is it disproven. We need much further research in this area and this research may eventually show that the human personality is more plastic during childhood in some respects, but not in others.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this research was to identify behaviors in addition to those of an explicitly sexual or romantic nature that men and women define as unfaithful acts in the context of committed dating relationships. We also sought to identify possible gender differences in the proportions of men and women who have engaged in these unfaithful behaviors while in dating relationships. We examined 219 college men's and women's reported involvement in sexual behaviors, romantic attachments, sexual and nonsexual fantasies, sexual attraction, romantic attraction, flirting, and social participation in dyads and groups with someone other than their current or past dating partner. A sizable proportion of both men and women reported engaging in one or more of the behaviors at some point in their dating history. Proportionately more men than women indicated having engaged in sexual fantasies of various types about someone other than their primary partner and reported \"hitting on\" someone else while in a dating relationship. No other gender differences emerged. A unique aspect of this study is that we asked young men and women to determine what kinds of behaviors they considered to be unfaithful rather than only examining sexual and emotional behaviors as has been the case in past research. Further, the few significant gender differences we found indicates that the convergence of men's and women's attitudes about sexuality may now be show in their behavior.",

      "title": "[The concept, the symptoms and the etiological factors of codependency].",
      "abstract": "The concept of codependency stems from the field of chemical dependency. Initially, codependent individuals meant women who dominated their partners and took care of them, while women actually were dependent upon their husbands. Nowadays, it has been recognized that men can become codependent as well, and its presence is not limited only to the relationship. This paper reviews the various interpretations of codependency and the empirical researches on the etiological factors of codependency. The explanatory models of codependency can be placed on a continuum of severity: psychopathology on the level of personality disorder, behavioural addiction, or excessive feminine behaviour. The etiology is mutifactorical: biological, psychological and social elements are also listed among etiology factors. The individual variability of the predisposition to care, failure of prefrontal cortex to inhibit empathic responses, a multitude of aversive experiences in a dysfunctional family (e.g. parental conflicts, emotional abuse, neglect and parentification), changes in the perception of women's role, and the emergence of substance abuse in the family could play a role in the development of codependency. Codependency is often unrecognized. Codependent individuals visit the health care system with stress-related or depressive symptoms which can mask the underlying causes, thus, it is possible that they will only receive symptomatic treatment. Through its trans-generational nature, codependency endangers children growing up in the family.",

Because expressive beliefs correspond to excuses and instrumental beliefs to justifications , it may be a sex difference in moral acceptability of aggression that informs social representation. Participants completed the Expagg questionnaire with reference to an episode of same‚Äêsex or cross‚Äêsex physical aggression and rated the moral acceptability of their behaviour. Women scored higher on Expagg (specifically lower than men on the instrumental scale) but there was no effect of target sex or participant‚Äêby‚Äêtarget interaction. Contrary to expectation, women rated their own aggression as more acceptable than did men and hence this could not explain their lower levels of instrumentality relative to men. Aggr.

Results showed that people who experienced serious negative life events in the past often had less active, less supportive and more strained sibling ties. The group that experienced a physical illness formed an exception, showing more supportive and active sibling ties, but also higher levels of conflict. Results suggest inequality between persons who have experienced negative life events and those who have not in terms of access to positive and supportive sibling relationships.",

      "abstract": "Behaviors that pose risks for an individual‚Äôs health and that also represent important threats for public health, such as drug use, smoking, alcohol, unhealthy eating causing obesity, and unsafe sex, are highly prevalent in low income countries, even though they are traditionally associated with richer countries. Individual choices are an important part of the risky behaviors. Risking Your Health: Causes, Consequences, and Interventions to Prevent Risky Behaviors explore how those choices are formed and what are their consequences. Why do people engage in risky behaviors? Many different explanations have been proposed by psychology, sociology, economics or public health. One trait common to all these behaviors is that there is a disconnect ‚Äì a function of both delay and uncertainty - between the pleasure or satisfaction provided by them and their consequences. Another characteristic of risky behaviors is that they rarely occur in isolation. Peer-pressure, parental influences, networks and social norms often play an important role in initiating, continuing, or quitting those behaviors. Even if they might often be the first to suffer, the consequences of risky behaviors are also rarely limited to the individuals engaging in them. In certain cases, such as second-hand smoking or HIV transmission, the link is direct. In other cases, the link is less direct but not necessarily less real: the long term health consequences of many of these behaviors are costly to treat and could stretch households‚Äô finances and worsen poverty. Finally, these risky behaviors have consequences for society as a whole since they often trigger a non-trivial amount of public health expenditures and lead to declines in aggregate productivity through premature death and morbidity. Changing behaviors is tricky -- public health interventions via legislation with strong enforcement mechanisms can be more effective than simple communication campaigns informing consumers about the risks associated with certain behaviors, since translating knowledge into concrete changes in behavior seems to be hard to achieve. Economic mechanisms such as taxes (especially on alcohol and tobacco products), subsidies (such as free condoms), and conditional/unconditional cash transfers are also used to reduce risky behaviors (for example in HIV prevention). Of great interest to policy makers, academics and practitioners, this book assesses the efficiency of those interventions designed to reduce the prevalence of behaviors that endanger health.",

Past sexual abuse is often discovered in adolescents and adults consulting for mood or sexual identity disorders and addictive behaviors. These patients did not receive any psychological treatment because their parents quickly ‚Äúforgot‚Äù the event. Thus, recovery is impossible: judicial redress has not been started and there is no family recognition of the harm and trauma. The reactions of parents can promote or block the ‚Äúhealing‚Äù process, and unsupported children can feel resentment towards their parents. The request for clarification is left hanging and will influence the psychological makeup of the future adult and the quality of their relationship with their parents.

      "title": "Grievances, Individual and Mobilizing",
      "abstract": "Abstract When individuals collectively challenge authorities via social movements, they typically do so over matters about which they are deeply troubled, have considerable concern, and feel passionately. These troublesome matters or conditions, and the feelings associated with them‚Äîsuch as dissatisfaction, fear, indignation, resentment, and moral shock‚Äîcan be thought of as grievances. They provide the primary motivational impetus for organizing social movement campaigns and for engaging in social movement activities. Although there are various sets of conditions that contribute to the emergence and operation of social movements‚Äîsuch as some degree of perceived political opportunity, organization, and resource acquisition, none of these factors is more important than the generation of mobilizing grievances. After all, it is difficult to imagine most individuals engaging in social movement activity without feeling deeply aggrieved about some condition that is regarded as contrary to the interests, rights, moral principles, or well‚Äêbeing of themselves or others. Consider the adherents of the pro‚Äêchoice and pro‚Äêlife movements, and of those advocating for and against same‚Äêsex marriages in the United States or immigration and tighter border control throughout much of the developed world. Not only are the adherents of one movement deeply aggrieved by the prospect of the other movement achieving its goals, but their passions about their movement are often palpable and thus worn, metaphorically, on their sleeves. Certainly other motivational factors‚Äîsuch as curiosity, the desire for approval, and peer pressure‚Äîmay come into play when considering why people align themselves with a particular movement, but these usually are secondary and largely irrelevant in the absence of deeply felt grievances.",

      "title": "Lesbian Dating and Courtship from Young Adulthood to Midlife",
      "abstract": "Summary Lesbian dating and courtship were explored based on interviews with 38 predominantly white lesbians (ages 22-63) representing young adult, adult, and midlife age groups. Friendship was found to be the most widely used courtship script across all age groups, followed by the sexually explicit and romance scripts, with friendship and romance scripts being preferred. Unique aspects of lesbian dating cited by participants included freedom from gender roles, heightened intimacy/friendship, the rapid pace of lesbian relationship development, and the effects of prejudice. Friendship was found to be differentiated from romance by two main criteria: emotional intensity and sexual energy or contact. Verbal declarations of interest and nonverbal behaviors were the primary means of communicating sexual attraction. Few lesbians adhered to traditional gender roles in dating, and those who reported assuming the feminine reactive role nevertheless rejected the traditional notion that women should limit sexual contact. Overall, midlife lesbians were more purposive in their dating and more free from gender roles. Specifically, they were more concerned about the \"attachment-worthiness\" of a prospective partner and were significantly more likely than young adults to view dating as having a serious goal, to proceed at a rapid pace, to ask for a date, and to initiate physical intimacy.",

      "abstract": "From the old days, people believe that men have less non-commitment in their relationship with the opposite sex, while according to new research women can betray and not be in a relationship with men! Therefore, the ultimate goal of the studies was to identify the main cause and the main pattern of this non-commitment, and to continue to refine and provide solutions to this problem. The fact is that some women in the long-standing relationship and finally commitment in all years will eventually betray their Infidelity and commit themselves. Of course, men may also be betrayed after having had a long relationship with one person. At the same time, none of the parties, ultimately lethargy, refuse to accept their own indignation and Infidelity! With the difference that the method of Infidelity and its causes are different in both sexes, they are completely different. Men, while committing to their own people, if they are fascinated, emotionally or sexually abusive others, on the contrary, women, until they are fully satisfied by their man, Committed to their commitment. But as soon as a person creates and continues to experience the emotions, sexual relations, finances and ... on the part of the man, with the onset of problems between the two, the woman is also drawn to Infidelity and inertia. Most women cannot easily engage in sexually abusive relationships and intimacy with another man, because unlike men, the creation of a new sexual relationship on the part of the woman is quite apparent in the state of affection and self-expression in relation to the previous man. For women: If men learn to respect their own person, emotionally, financially, and financially, there is no reason for a woman to betray her.",

Because many couples fail and do not have the ability to understand the roots of rejection experienced by their partners, or do not really know the dark past the partner can also be due to the lack of openness from the couple related to the past in the family of each partner. Negative effects will be seen after a few months or a few years in marriage then comes the original negative nature that causes anger and hatred towards the couple. The problem is not only that the impact of refusal can lead to sexual immorality or live in uncleanness in the household and even many infidelities occur because of dissatisfaction from each partner. The point in building a partner's household is not to be blind to see and pay attention to their partner enough just to fall in love to see the appearance and sympathetic nature and attention shown by their partner, but more importantly we can see the background of the past and are ready to accept all the weaknesses that are owned by his partner and completes and helps both partners to build a harmonious and happy home.",

      "title": "Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace",
      "abstract": "Workplace bullying and harassment is prevalent in contemporary workplaces with detrimental negative outcomes for targets as well as for bystanders and the organization itself. At any one time, some 3%‚Äì20% of the working population is targeted, suffering reduced motivation and productivity, severe mental and physical health problems, and a risk of exclusion from the organization and even working life altogether. Bullying and harassment is about the systematic and ongoing mistreatment of an employee by other organization members, mostly of a psychological and social nature and often involving a gradually escalating process that may end in severe victimization of those targeted if not properly managed and handled in its early phases. In early phases, by some denoted incivility, the behaviors involved are often subtle, indirect, and discrete, while in later phases they become ever more prevalent and direct‚Äîeven involving threats and open verbal abuse. Bullying may involve work-related behaviors creating a difficult and even dangerous working situation for the target, personally demeaning behavior, acts of social exclusion and non-inclusion, and physically intimidation behaviors. Hence, bullying comes in many shades and forms, as well as at many levels of intensity. Although risk factors and antecedents of this complex problem may be found on many levels, factors in the immediate working environment and the design and management of work are particularly important. Furthermore, bullying is particularly prevalent in working environments characterized by a hostile working climate and in organizations where such behaviors are permitted or even rewarded.",

This research was carried out at the Tilamuta Religious Court using a qualitative approach with an empirical research type. The results of the research show that the causes of disputes and quarrels are; a) Economic problems, household needs are not met while there are children and wife's needs that must be met. b) Third party interference, can come from families who are excessively involved in household relationships or from other people. c) Polygamy is unhealthy, the husband is unable to act fairly and is unable to take responsibility for his two wives. d) Domestic violence/abuse occurs, lack of control of each other's egos and coupled with the husband not being able to control his emotions so he takes it out on his wife. The consequences arising from continuous disputes and quarrels include: (a) Disruption in fulfilling the rights and obligations of husband and wife, (b) Problems regarding child custody, (c) Division of joint Assets",

      "abstract": "Sexual behaviors in children are common, occurring in 42 to 73 percent of children by the time they reach 13 years of age. Developmentally appropriate behavior that is common and frequently observed in children includes trying to view another person's genitals or breasts, standing too close to other persons, and touching their own genitals. Sexual behaviors become less common, less frequent, or more covert after five years of age. Sexual behavior problems are defined as developmentally inappropriate or intrusive sexual acts that typically involve coercion or distress. Such behaviors should be evaluated within the context of other emotional and behavior disorders, socialization difficulties, and family dysfunction, including violence, abuse, and neglect. Although many children with sexual behavior problems have a history of sexual abuse, most children who have been sexually abused do not develop sexual behavior problems. Children who have been sexually abused at a younger age, who have been abused by a family member, or whose abuse involved penetration are at greater risk of developing sexual behavior problems. Although age-appropriate behaviors are managed primarily through reassurance and education of the parent about appropriate behavior redirection, sexual behavior problems often require further assessment and may necessitate a referral to child protective services for suspected abuse or neglect.",

Reactions are operationalized in terms of expressed rejection of the homosexual as indicated by responses to a social distance scale. The major variables examined are sex of homosexual, sex of reactor, and acceptance of two commonly held stereotypes. These stereotypes‚Äîperceived danger and psychological disturbance‚Äîboth suggest that a sense of threat is associated with rejection of the homosexual. A particularly interesting finding was that male subjects are especially rejecting of male homosexuals. Presumably male subjects tend to view the male homosexual as a sexual failure and to perceive him as personally threatening or dangerous.",

It is a primary source of reproduction carrying pleasure/orgasm or pain element in the process. Healthy sexual activities engender orgasmic responses (pleasure) and nurture human growth along healthy lines. Its derangement, however, may cause numerous psycho-biological and behavioural regressions Eugene O‚ÄôNeill is primarily a dramatist of human emotions and is deeply concerned with dramatizing extremes of human behavioural tendencies with marked regressivity. His treatment of human sexuality is an illustration of his dramatizing extremes of emotive and psychological states with predominant regressive pattern in human conduct and attitude towards sexuality. Here he owes a lot to Freud‚Äôs psychoanalytic exploration of human consciousness and his theoretical stance on infantile psycho-sexual development in familial context. Therefore one comes across a persistent mode of incest in familial relation in his plays of different periods. The study, however, highlights here such other areas of human sexuality as marital sexuality, male sexual abstinence/wastefulness, female heterosexuality, prostitution, and neurasthenia with reference to selected plays of different dramatic career to emphasize that there is predominant pattern of regressivity in all these areas of human sexuality that has its negative bearing on human behavioural pattern and conduct.Key words: ¬†Modern American drama; sexuality; behavioural disorders; neurasthenia",

Responses were categorized as Characteristics of Communication (nature of interactions participants had at home about sexuality) and Major Message Content (actual themes of those conversations). Commonly reported characteristics were trouble talking with parents; most conversations happened with mothers; participants feared parents‚Äô reactions; and among lesbian, gay, bisexual groups, feared parents‚Äô discovering their nonheterosexual orientation. Commonly reported message content included use protection and, among women, wait. Women reported messages that were at best, mixed, and at worst, threatening or moralistic. Men reported fewer conversations, and those recalled were more neutral or encouraging, especially from fathers. Parental messages to males and females differed qualitatively, reflected stereotypical assumptions about gender roles, desire, and appropriate conditions under which to have sex, and lacked support for nonheterosexual orientations.",

However, sexuality is not only influenced by the integrity of the genital tract, but also the limbic system and spinal arousal centres. Social and cultural influences on sexual behaviour are in a continuous process of change.This article attempts to highlight the importance of a multifaceted systemic approach to a common and distressing problem.The aetiology of sexual dysfunction is diverse and usually results from a complex interaction of biological, psychological and social factors. Consequently, there is little to be gained from trying to determine whether a disorder is either biological or psychological, as both will be relevant to a certain extent in every case. Even in a case with a clear biological cause (e.g. diabetic neuropathy) the treatment and long term consequences of the secondary sexual disorder will be affected by psychosocial implications.

      "abstract": "Sex-linked mate selection criteria have, more recently, been logically and empirically linked to differences between women and men in subjective distress to violations-of-trust, such as emotional and sexual infidelity. When a woman learns that her partner has formed an emotional attachment to another person, for example, she is especially distressed because she has learned that, if her partner is emotionally unfaithful he is sexually unfaithful as well. The sex differences in subjective distress to a partner's sexual and emotional infidelity were consistent with an evolutionary perspective and the alternative analysis. Gender differences in subjective distress to emotional and sexual infidelity result, according to an evolutionary perspective, from asymmetries in mating strategies pursued by women and men. Sexual infidelity is less distressing because she recognizes that \"men often have sex without being in love\". Men are more distressed than women by sexual infidelity because, for men, sexual infidelity serves as a basis for inferring that a partner is also emotionally unfaithful.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Racial preferences in sexual attraction are highly visible and controversial. They may also negatively impact those who are excluded. It is unclear whether these preferences are merely self‚Äêattributed or extend to patterns of experienced sexual arousal. Furthermore, some argue that racial preferences in sexual attraction reflect idiosyncratic personal preferences, while others argue that they are more systematically motivated and reflect broader negative attitudes toward particular races. In two studies, we examined these issues by measuring the sexual arousal patterns and negative racial attitudes of 78 White men in relation to their racial preferences in sexual attraction to White versus Black people. For both White heterosexual men ( n = 40; Study 1) and White gay men ( n = 38; Study 2), greater racial preferences in sexual attraction to White versus Black people of their preferred gender were associated with more subjective and genital arousal by erotic stimuli featuring White versus Black people of their preferred gender, and with more explicit and implicit negative attitudes toward Black people. Findings suggest that racial preferences in sexual attraction are reflected in patterns of sexual arousal, and they might also be systematically motivated by negative attitudes toward particular races.",

However, it is possible that in the case of regular sexual activity during the middle life and of a adequate partnership the ability of practicising a satisfaying coitus for able partners may exist during the 7th and 8th decade of life.",

      "title": "Developing Sensitivity to Complex Facial Expressions in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "The ability to produce and interpret facial expressions enables humans to communicate vital information in reciprocal social exchanges. In the first years of life, human infants begin to develop the ability to perceive and categorize basic emotional expressions (e.g. happy, sad, angry); however, these abilities continue to improve throughout childhood and into adolescence. Interestingly, very little is known about the developmental trajectory of sensitivity to more socially complex emotional expressions such as resentment, envy, or contempt. Importantly, the research that does exist has been conducted almost exclusively in atypical populations. In this project, we hypothesized that adolescence would be a key period for the emergence of sensitivity to socially complex expressions, largely because a subset of these expressions tend to provide signals about the status of more intimate relationships (i.e., with sexual and romantic partners and/or competitors) that adolescents are only beginning to form with their peers. We also hypothesized that sensitivity to these complex expressions would be fundamentally related to pubertal maturation, which likely influences the motivation to form more intimate, romantic, and sexual relationships in adolescence. To evaluate these hypotheses, we conducted two experiments to measure developmental changes in perceptual sensitivity to detect both basic (e.g., happy) and complex emotional expressions in four groups: pre-pubescent children (ages 6-8), adolescents in early versus later stages of pubertal development (ages 11-14), and sexually mature adults (ages 20-25). We report several age-related changes from childhood to adulthood as well as puberty-related changes in the absence of age-related changes from early pubertal development to late pubertal development.",

      "abstract": "Research conducted over the past decade indicates that a wide range of psychological and interpersonal problems are more prevalent among those who have been sexually abused than among individuals with no such experiences. Although a definitive causal relationship between such difficulties and sexual abuse cannot be established using current retrospective research methodologies, the aggregate of consistent findings in this literature has led many to conclude that childhood sexual abuse is a major risk factor for a variety of problems. This article summarizes what is currently known about these potential impacts of child sexual abuse. The various problems and symptoms described in the literature on child sexual abuse are reviewed in a series of broad categories including posttraumatic stress, cognitive distortions, emotional pain, avoidance, an impaired sense of self, and interpersonal difficulties. Research has demonstrated that the extent to which a given individual manifests abuse-related distress is a function of an undetermined number of abuse-specific variables, as well as individual and environmental factors that existed prior to, or occurred subsequent to, the incidents of sexual abuse.",

Purely mechanical disorders of seminal deposition due to anatomy are to be differentiated from functional libido and orgasmic disorders, from ejaculation problems or the inability to achieve or maintain erections. While pure orgasmic disturbances are almost in all cases due to psychological or psychiatric causes, libido and erectile dysfunction may also have hormonal causes and thus be symptoms of androgen deficiency. Additional clinical symptoms of hypogonadism or objectifiable findings such as testicular atrophy, changes in secondary sexual characteristics, or ejaculate volume allow the organic genesis to be identified in pronounced cases, while in other cases the corresponding indications must be actively sought. Thus, while functional orgasmic and libido disorders are the domain of psychological psychiatric or endocrinological therapeutic approaches, this chapter deals primarily with disorders of seminal deposition and functionally or organically caused disorders of cohabitation.",

      "abstract": "Serosorting (i.e., engaging in unprotected sex with partners known to be of the same serostatus) can be a difficult process for men who have sex with men (MSM) who frequently make assumptions about their partners' serostatus. This process can be further complicated by a partner's dishonesty as well as other individual and contextual factors. The present study specifically examined how assumptions of serostatus made about unknown serostatus partners impact on the sexual behavior of 110 alcohol‚Äìabusing HIV‚Äìpositive MSM. Although previous research has shown that HIV‚Äìpositive MSM are more likely to serosort with other known HIV‚Äìpositive men than with known HIV‚Äìnegative men, our data suggest that unprotected sex behavior may not be specifically driven by whether or not they made assumptions of seroconcordance or serodiscordance. The types of assumptions these HIV‚Äìpositive MSM made about their unknown status sexual partners and the basis for such assumptions were also examined. Owing to the ambiguities involved in assumptions of a partner's serostatus in sexual encounters, the 'unknown status' partner category is analytically distinct from 'known status' categories, and needs to be more fully explored because of its impact on perceived serosorting, rather than actual serosorting, among HIV‚Äìpositive men.",

UK adults (N = 354) completed an online mixed-methods survey on sexual consent during sober, alcohol- and/or drug-involved sex. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Themes for capacity to consent were: (1) \"There is no normative understanding of substance-involved sexual consent,\" (2) \"Moving beyond the binary of consciousness versus incapacitation\" and (3) \"Substance-involved sexual decisions are viewed as irresponsible.\" The findings illustrated that capacity to consent is nuanced and multidimensional, and that people's understandings and experiences of capacity to consent to substance-involved sex are not solely individual, but rather, they are also shaped by their environment. We call for a multidimensional view of capacity to consent, where a standard of \"unimpaired,\" rather than sober, is used and modeled by academics, legislators, and educators.",

      "title": "[Do we need the concept of male climacteric?].",
      "abstract": "The female menopause is considered to be a result of a decrease in the endocrinal metabolic activity of the ovaries. Although the male lacks such a highly visible sign as the cessation of the menstrual flow, the amount of testosterone produced by the aging male does in fact decrease. Recent studies, such as the Massachusetts Male Aging Study show that, between the ages of 40 to 70 years, the mean testosterone level decreases annually by about 1%. Chronic diseases and the use of drugs have a comparable effect. Although it is generally believed that sexual impotence is a major symptom of male menopause, recent investigations have shown that sexual functionability may be preserved into the ninth and tenth decade of life. Sexuality is not merely an instinct or a psychological expression, but is deeply anchored within the personality. Even when, with increasing age, the frequency of sexual dysfunction increases, such changes do not correlate with the decrease in testosterone levels. None of these phenomena take place within an age span that marks them off from the involution processes in other organs. The expression midlife crisis commonly met with in the English literature points up the psycho-social implications. Impotence or a loss of sexuality is not a sequel of aging, but of attitude towards sexuality. The latter is preserved if it is not neglected throughout the course of a lifetime.",

      "abstract": "Sex is one of the three primary human instincts, with self-preservation and social instinct, and is thus well developed in the typical individual. Sexual Dysfunction is referred to as problems that a person or partner encounters during any phase of typical sexual activity - physical pleasure, desire, preference, arousal, or orgasm. A person‚Äôs inability to participate in a sexual relationship as they would wish is how the World Health Organization describes sexual dysfunction. It can affect both men and women and may be caused by physical, or psychological factors. Sexual dysfunction, if not addressed promptly, can significantly impacts fertility. Since sexual dysfunction usually coincides with anatomical as well as psychological factors, a comprehensive sexual history, evaluation of general health, and reproductive health, and identification of any additional sexual problems (if any) are critical while diagnosing sexual dysfunction. The concept of sexual dysfunction is not new to Ayurveda. Classics include various references to it in the context of Yoni Vyapads, Dosha Vriddhi, Kshaya, Ojus, Artava Vaha Sroto Viddha Lakshana, and Manovikaras, along with probable causative factors and solutions. Ayurveda addresses the anatomical, psychological, and endocrinological aspects of sexual dysfunctions. Following Dinacharya, Rajaswala Paricharya, Garbhini Paricharya, and Sutika Paricharya provide extensive treatment regimens by focusing on the overall health of an individual‚Äôs reproductive, psychological, and endocrinological well-being. Female sexual dysfunction is a multifactorial condition that requires a holistic approach. Modern medical treatments offer targeted solutions, while Ayurvedic therapies promote balance and long-term vitality.",

Main findings suggested that gay men scored significantly higher on both solitary sexual desire and attractive person-related dyadic sexual desire subscales, but not on a partner-related dyadic sexual desire subscale, compared to heterosexual men. Despite sexual orientation, partner-related dyadic sexual desire positively predicts sexual satisfaction, whereas solitary and attractive person-related dyadic sexual desire negatively predicts sexual satisfaction in men. Overall, gay men appear to experience higher levels of both attractive person-related dyadic and solitary sexual desire. Also, experiencing sexual desire toward a partner predicts positively, whereas experiencing desire to engage in sexual behavior with oneself and toward an attractive person predict negatively sexual satisfaction in men.",

While consent is critically important, this Article instead focuses on harms to third parties resulting from sexual behavior‚Äîregardless of whether that behavior is consensual. Doing so reveals a dynamic that the conversation about sexual misconduct has not yet fully acknowledged: the presence or absence of consent between participants does not determine whether third parties suffer harm. Sexual behavior does not occur in a vacuum. Rather, it occurs in a particular context and often has significant consequences for other individuals beyond the participants in the behavior.Sexual behavior is problematic when it involves what this Article will refer to as an institutional power disparity: that is, one participant has power over the other as a result of their institutional roles. Institutional power disparities are inherent, for example, in sexual behavior involving a supervisor and their subordinate or a professor and their student.Such behavior risks significant harm to third parties within the institution. Third parties may be injured as a result of sexual favoritism. For example, a worker may be passed over for a promotion in favor of a less qualified worker who is having sex with the boss. Or third parties may suffer harm from a sexualized institutional environment. For example, students may avoid professors who are known for pursuing sexual relationships with students or may find it alienating to be viewed as a professor‚Äôs prospective sexual partner. And the institution itself may suffer harm when sexual behavior involving an institutional power disparity interferes with worker productivity and morale, or with student learning and intellectual growth.Harm to third parties justifies regulation of sexual relationships in the context of an institutional power disparity. In some circumstances, such relationships should be prohibited so long as the institutional power disparity remains. In other circumstances, careful regulation can mitigate potential harms to third parties and to the institution itself.",

Much of it has been confirmed from direct observation, and much has been found from adults, normal and abnormal. This is because the fate of the instinctual energy does not only determine character formation, which means the development of the child in the early years, it also determines normality, the abnormality, the happiness, and the unhappiness‚Äîof the adult human being. So the phases of development in the child's love for the mother reflect at one and the same time the whole range of possibilities of disturbance in adult love relationships.",

      "title": "Opposing orientations in interactions with individuals with Frontotemporal Dementia",
      "abstract": "Clinically, frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is described as primarily affecting personality and interpersonal conduct and resulting in social behavioral disruptions, thus often giving rise to interpersonal conflict. Conflict behavior in both typical and dementia populations is frequently identified as explicit physical and verbal acts such as assault, yelling or insulting, and research often situates conflict and collaboration as opposing dimensions. The premise of this article is to examine the unfolding of moments in which individuals diagnosed with FTD and their carers demonstrate opposing orientations towards an activity in real time interaction: A home nurse needing to fulfill an institutional agenda ‚Äî taking sitting blood pressure ‚Äî seeks the cooperation from an individual who, in attempting to lie down, interferes with this agenda. These moments constitute sources of interactional conflict that carers attempt to resolve. However, often conflict behavior and cooperative behavior are not neatly teased apart; for instance, individuals often display conflicting orientations towards an overarching or guiding activity while cooperating in more immediate and discrete interactional tasks. These verbal/nonverbal conflicts are not large acts of aggression; rather, they may be viewed as arising within the mundane moments of life that individuals face in everyday contexts and frequently.",

      "abstract": "The goal of this research is to examine the specificity of social representations of infidelity among married and unmarried men and women. The hypothesis was advanced that married and unmarried men and women differ in their perception of infidelity. The differences depend on the gender and marital status, and pertain to definition of this concept and the underlying causes. The article employs the methods of questionnaire, content analysis, and the developed by the authors projective technique &amp;ldquo;draw infidelity&amp;rdquo;. It was established that the respondents view infidelity from two perspectives: those who commit adultery (more typical to men), and those against whom adultery was committed (more typical to women). Married individuals more often describe their own infidelity, while unmarried persons describe the infidelity of another partner. The main cause infidelity for men are new sensations (new sexual experience, etc.), while women it is love for another person (strong emotional experiences). Married respondents describe infidelity as a rare, tough, and long-term phenomenon. Unmarried respondents consider infidelity a rather frequent phenomenon that gives new experience in relationships. Women view infidelity as an emotional, passionate, and unique phenomenon. Men tend to assess infidelity as an indifferent, typical, and rational event. The acquired data can be used in family counseling on the problems of infidelity, as well as in psychological counseling overall. The results can also be used in psychoprophylactic work with youth on the question of family and marriage.",

      "abstract": "Incest is a perennial moral taboo. The word usually denotes sexual relations between close family members, and less frequently, in-laws and adoptees. Prohibitions on engaging in these types of sexual relations can be found in every society. The family members prohibited by the criminal law from engaging in sexual relations with each other might have changed and narrowed over the centuries, but this type of deed remains proscribed by most criminal law systems. It is usually noted, however, that the small number of convictions recorded for this type of crime every year is a sign that a clear majority of perpetrators of incest and similar acts go unpunished. Where the legal provisions concerning incest fall short is in their practical ineffectiveness when it comes to preventing victimisation. A general psychological profile of this type of offender has yet to be created, as has a broader profile of the paedophile. This might be difficult because the nature of what causes sexual preference disorders (e.g. paedophilia, sadism and fetishism) has yet to be determined. The results presented in this paper are intended to reveal the character traits that distinguish offenders who incestuously exploit minors and who have been diagnosed as paraphiliacs. The average age of the offenders surveyed was 43 years. This finding accords with results of the studies presented in the international literature, viz. that people convicted of incest and other sexual offences against minors living with them in the same household are older than rapists and paedophiles whose victims do not live with them in the same household. The survey group was dominated by people with primary (including 5 who had completed ‚Äúspecial schools‚Äù at primary level) or vocational education (most common among those convicted). A mere 7 people who could produce a diploma to prove they had finished secondary school were recorded and most of these qualifications were vocational. No one in the group had higher education. Their level of education was found to match their current occupations, i.e. trades or manual labour that did not require any special qualifications, and to bear out the fact that most of them were of average IQ. Everyone in the group had been diagnosed with one or more sexual preference disorders and for this reason they were all completing remedial programs while serving prison terms. This category of convicts was dominated by people diagnosed as repeat heterosexual paedophiles. It is also worth noting that many in the group had been diagnosed with other psychiatric disorders ‚Äì especially alcohol dependence syndrome ‚Äì in addition to sexual preference disorders. The victims were overwhelmingly female (59 or 85.5% of the total). Thirty six of these girls had been sexually exploited by their biological fathers. The sex of the victim would therefore appear to be of crucial importance in terms of threats from friends and relatives living in the same environment.",

Despite overall similarity of the kinds of problems reported by married and cohabiting couples, married women were particularly likely to complain that their husbands did not give them sufficient attention. Husbands were especially unlikely to mention that their wives were too independent. After specifying two alternative behaviors for each partner in the problem situation, couples rated their degree of satisfaction with each of the four resulting behavioral combinations. Wives rated themselves as more unhappy when their problem arose than cohabiting partners rated themselves, and husbands were least unhappy. Wives' overall satisfaction was affected by their problem situation most of all, husbands' least of all, and cohabitors' satisfaction to an intermediate degree.

      "abstract": "Rape is a sexual act committed against a person without consent or without explicit consent. This is a very serious form of sexual violence and violates human rights. Rape can occur in a variety of contexts, including during an intimate relationship, by someone you know, or even by a stranger. This can cause deep physical and emotional trauma to victims, as well as having far-reaching impacts on society as a whole. It is important to take steps to prevent rape and provide support to victims. Rape carried out on women or men usually causes very severe trauma to them. Usually, the person becomes uncomfortable, insecure, and afraid of meeting people. He will feel alone forever, and think about ending himself, because he thinks that he is no longer pure. Usually, rape is committed by someone or several individuals, known or unknown, who deliberately rape the victim. Rape may occur because the perpetrator likes the victim, or because the perpetrator wants revenge on the victim, or there is something else. Women are creatures of God Almighty who are very perfect, because they give birth and breastfeed. In Indonesia, there are still many cases of rape that occur against women and children. The motive may be because the perpetrator likes the victim, or the perpetrator just wants revenge on the victim, or it was planned long ago by the perpetrator. Rape against women or girls is a form of sexual violence that occurs when someone commits a sexual act against a woman without her consent. This may include vaginal, anal, or oral penetration, as well as other sexual acts carried out with violence, threats, coercion, or the woman's inability to provide valid consent. Rape against women is often a form of expression of systematic gender inequality and domination. It is important to remember that rape does not only happen to women, but can also happen to men or individuals of various other gender identities. Nevertheless, rape of women is often in the spotlight due to its high prevalence and serious impact on the well-being of women and society as a whole. Therefore, it is important to continue fighting sexual violence and fighting for gender equality to create a safe and inclusive society for all individuals.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of article: to highlight the results of an empirical research on the gender characteristics of the differential type of reflection in higher education students in relation to social intelligence. Systemic reflection, which allows simultaneous coverage of both the subject and object poles, is found at a high level in all male and almost all female participants; at an average level, it is found in a small number of female participants. Introspection, which promotes focusing on the experiences of both own and other people, is identified at a high level in three-fifths of the male participants and slightly less than one-second of the female participants; at an average level, it is found in two-fifths of the male participants and slightly more than one-second of the female participants. Quasi-reflection, which involves detachment from the real situation due to a focus on an ideal object, is found at a high level in three-fifths of the male participants and slightly more than one-second of the female participants; at an average level, it is found in two-fifths of the male participants and slightly less than one-second of the female participants. No low levels of systemic reflection, introspection, or quasi-reflection were observed. Statistically significant differences were found only in the levels of introspection between male and female participants. Statistically significant correlations between the overall social intelligence indicator and systemic reflection, introspection, and quasi-reflection have demonstrated that reflection is a psychological mechanism of the development of social intelligence in higher education students with special educational needs.",

      "title": "Male victims of sexual assault: phenomenology, psychology, physiology.",
      "abstract": "Myths, stereotypes, and unfounded beliefs about male sexuality, in particular male homosexuality, are widespread in legal and medical communities, as well as among agencies providing services to sexual assault victims. These include perceptions that men in noninstitutionalized settings are rarely sexually assaulted, that male victims are responsible for their assaults, that male sexual assault victims are less traumatized by the experience than their female counterparts, and that ejaculation is an indicator of a positive erotic experience. As a result of the prevalence of such beliefs, there is an underreporting of sexual assaults by male victims; a lack of appropriate services for male victims; and, effectively, no legal redress for male sexual assault victims. By comparison, male sexual assault victims have fewer resources and greater stigma than do female sexual assault victims. Many male victims, either because of physiological effects of anal rape or direct stimulation by their assailants, have an erection, ejaculate, or both during the assault. This is incorrectly understood by assailant, victim, the justice system, and the medical community as signifying consent by the victim. Studies of male sexual physiology suggest that involuntary erections or ejaculations can occur in the context of nonconsensual, receptive anal sex. Erections and ejaculations are only partially under voluntary control and are known to occur during times of extreme duress in the absence of sexual pleasure. Particularly within the criminal justice system, this misconception, in addition to other unfounded beliefs, has made the courts unwilling to provide legal remedy to male victims of sexual assault, especially when the victim experienced an erection or an ejaculation during the assault. Attorneys and forensic psychiatrists must be better informed about the physiology of these phenomena to formulate evidence-based opinions.",

Sexuality is influenced by many things such as family, religion, values, media images of women, personal experience of violence, disease, et. Relationships, both personal and social, are very important to women. If a woman is ambivalent or unsure about her relationship with her husband, her sexual functioning can be negatively affected. For most women, sexuality is a positive, joyful, creative, and connective process. However, because sexuality is so complex, any life experience or illness can affect sexuality and sexual functioning.

      "title": "‚ÄúWhat a Girl Wants‚Äù: What Can We Learn From Animal Models of Female Sexual Motivation?",
      "abstract": "Sexual motivation is notably different than other motivations such as hunger and thirst, because it lacks homeostatic drive. Sexual motivation poses no threat to physical well-being; individual survival is not at stake. Nevertheless, sexual motivation is a powerful drive and is critical for species survival. Understanding the complexity of sexual motivation has the potential to advance our understanding of other motivations, even pathological motivations, such as those associated with substance abuse. The study of motivation that is unique to females has often been neglected. A number of paradigms have been developed to investigate female sexual motivation beyond measuring only the lordosis reflex. Lordosis is a reflexive posture displayed by female mammals in response to male sexual stimulation to facilitate intromission. The lordosis reflex is essential, but studying the drive to mate is compromised in the absence of robust lordosis. Therefore, appetitive measures of sexual behavior (e.g., preferences, solicitation behaviors) are more specific and more sensitive indicators of sexual motivation than lordosis alone. Paradigms designed to study female sexual motivation often provide a female subject with the choice to interact with a sexually vigorous male or either a non-sexual partner (i.e., female, castrated male) or to remain alone. The study of appetitive measures of sexual motivation has elucidated the role of hormones in female sexual motivation, as well as the underlying neural pathways. The present review describes methods for studying female rats to advance our understanding of sexual motivation and sexual dysfunction.",

In fact, although the phenomenon of infidelity is not new, some people are saying that they would never have guessed at all that their partners do so. Infidelity can occur in all circles, including to the police, where a police officer every day to face and must relate to the community. This research is a qualitative description of the type of research that attempted to link psychological phenomena with other aspects that are considered important.\r\nThe results obtained show that the phenomenon of husband's infidelity that occurs because of the need for a friend who can be invited to communicate, physical keterpikatan that occur between husbands and their mistresses, the influence of the existing environment so as to make the husband having an affair, and certainly the perceived sexual satisfaction husband when dealing with the affair. It must be realized that in order to dare to separate himself from the cheating partner is difficult, it takes energy, thoughts, sacrifice, and incredible time. This involves the liver needs, tastes, and biological. The occurrence of cheating actually started because of the situation himself the husband who was in dire need of attention and affection touches to create different nuances of everyday life is her husband.

According to data from a representative sample (Study I, N = 603), existential indifference slightly decreases with age and is especially common among singles and unmarried partners. The existentially indifferent show low commitment to all sources of meaning; they demonstrate particular disinterest in self-knowledge, spirituality, explicit religiosity, and generativity. Whereas their mental health (depression, anxiety) is comparable to that of individuals who experience their lives as meaningful, their psychological well-being (positive affect, satisfaction with life) is considerably lower (Study II, N = 135).",

Optimized support for young women on the autism spectrum is best based on the understanding of their characteristics, targeting resilience and person‚Äìenvironment fit, and taking into account the influences of gendered sociocultural contexts; this often involves not only skill-building and graded exposure for the individual, but more importantly, adjustments to the social and physical environments.",

      "abstract": "Consensual nonmonogamy (CNM) is an overarching term for relationship orientations that differ based on the degree to which consensual sexual and emotional needs are fulfilled outside of a dyad. Despite the diversity of CNM relationship orientations and growing research examining CNM, it is unclear whether the sexual attitudes, inclination to approach/avoid sexual stimuli (i.e., erotophobia-erotophilia), and sociosexuality differ among individuals who identify with distinct CNM relationships. Further, as the agreements made in CNM relationships permit extradyadic relationships, important differences might emerge for CNM and monogamous individuals. A convenience sample (N = 641) of individuals who self-identified as monogamous (n = 447), open (n = 80), polyamorous (n = 62), or swinger (n = 52) provided ratings of their sexual attitudes, erotophobia-erotophilia, and sociosexuality. Results indicated that swingers had the most permissive and instrumental attitudes, were the most erotophilic, and were the most unrestricted sexually. Conversely, monogamists scored the lowest on these traits. No differences emerged between relationship orientations for attitudes toward communion and birth control. These findings have important implications for sexuality research because they reinforce the view that some underlying differences and similarities exist between monogamous and CNM individuals.",

Research will be an essential part of this evolution.\r\n\r\nThere is also an urgent need of education of young promising psychiatrists, learning the complexity of interactions between the psycho-social aspect and the biological one in psychiatry, but also the necessity using of a rigorous methodology.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of topics which need to be investigated in social psychiatry. Some of the most important are:\r\n\r\n- Migration and mental health, especially on the seemingly higher prevalence of schizophrenia among some groups of migrants;\r\n\r\n- Religion, spirituality and mental health; as a matter of fact, they will play an increasing role in the future in the expression of psychopathology, and in psycho-social phenomena such as violence, substance abuse...\r\n\r\n- Women's mental health, especially peri-natal mental health and psychiatry;\r\n\r\n- Ethics and its relative relativity from one culture to another in psychiatric daily practice.",

      "title": "Shame and Male Gender Identity.",
      "abstract": "The literature on the male gender role portrays as lacking weakness, need, doubt, or any of the female values such as sympathy, concern, or empathy. It is contended that Western society develops, reinforces, and maintains gender roles by the emotion shame; many males are motivated in part by an effort to avoid or escape shameful feelings. Shame is basically the felt variation between one's self and one's idealized self--the feeling of not measuring up. Shame arises in early childhood, before the development of certain language skills, so shame may not be readily accessible to verbally organized adult cognitions. Ironically, certain avoidance behaviors maintain many masculine stereotypes: (1) strong and brave; (2) competitive; (3) emotionally unexpressive; (4) problem solver; (5) isolated; (6) sexual, not sensual; (7) dynamic, decisive, and aggressive; (8) controlling; (9) tough and autonomous. These attributes of real men are desirable to some degree but when they are positioned as absolutes and are maintained by shaming and avoidance of shame then these behaviors become dysfunctional and destructive. The author argues for a removal of the limits on behavior and feeling and the re-incorporation of the so called non-male parts back into men's psyches.

There are abusers are often affected by many cognitive biases related to mistaken beliefs about sex roles and distorted ideas about the legitimization of violence to solve problems. This paper is a literature review on the conceptualization of the term gender violence with an emphasis on multi-causal models and the construction of masculinity as explanatory variables of the origin and maintenance of abuse.Cuando se habla de violencia de g√©nero casi siempre se habla de mujeres, pocas veces se lanzan cuestiones sobre los hombres que ejercen esa violencia y sobre las causas y motivaciones que originan y mantienen su comportamiento.

      "abstract": "Summary The problem of involuntary childlessness and its effect on marital happiness has been studied in an investigation involving interviews with 75 childless couples and a matched control of 75 couples with children. Marital happiness in various phases of the couple's relationship is plotted; in childless women this is seen to fall to its lowest ebb during the phase immediately before the problem is brought to the attention of the doctor, whilst in men it occurs whilst waiting for the medical diagnosis to be made. It seems that whilst childless marriages in themselves are not necessarily less happy than those with children (though all the childless couples interviewed had sought to change their situation by seeking medical help) such marriages are based on a different equilibrium from that of couples with children. In childless marriages there is often closer communication between the partners and a greater degree of communis opinio. People with children are sometimes over-careful in their approach to those without children. Attitudes and behaviour with regard to fidelity are seen to differ; the childless couples interviewed were less permissive in this respect than those with children. Alternatives in the form of artificial insemination, adoption, careers and pets are briefly considered.",

      "abstract": "Many researchers take for granted that men‚Äôs mental health can be explained in the same terms as women‚Äôs or can be gauged using the same measures. Women tend to have higher rates of internalizing disorders (i.e., depression, anxiety), while men experience more externalizing symptoms (i.e., violence, substance abuse). These patterns are often attributed to gender differences in socialization (including the acquisition of expectations associated with traditional gender roles), help seeking, coping, and socioeconomic status. However, measurement bias (inadequate survey assessment of men‚Äôs experiences) and clinician bias (practitioner‚Äôs subconscious tendency to overlook male distress) may lead to underestimates of the prevalence of depression and anxiety among men. Continuing to focus on gender differences in mental health may obscure significant within-gender group differences in men‚Äôs symptomatology. In order to better understand men‚Äôs lived experiences and their psychological well-being, it is crucial for scholars to focus exclusively on men‚Äôs mental health.",

Para ello se analizan los encuentros vinculares heterosexuales, para luego proponer algunas contribuciones que faciliten la igualdad sustantiva y la responsabilidad afectivo/sexual. El consentimiento sexual supone un acuerdo para participar en una actividad sexual compartida. Para que sea consensuado, ambas personas deben estar de acuerdo en tener relaciones sexuales, todas y cada una de las veces que surja esa posibilidad. En el caso de los encuentros heterosexuales, a nivel simb√≥lico, social y subjetivo contin√∫a presente la tendencia de que las mujeres sean las encargadas de establecer l√≠mites a los activos intentos masculinos que buscan satisfacer sus deseos sexuales. Por lo tanto, las consecuencias de resistir o conceder dicho acto recae solo sobre las mujeres: proteger o exponer el cuerpo, velar o develar el deseo, aceptar el encuentro; o bien, no tener la posibilidad de negarse. Todo ello aparece ligado a la ‚Äúdisposici√≥n femenina‚Äù que se juega en el √°mbito de lo √≠ntimo, con el argumento sostenido en la idea de supuestas relaciones consensuadas. En este orden de cosas, el consentimiento sexual necesita ser repensado en articulaci√≥n con los intersticios del poder y de los prejuicios sociales vigentes, presentes en las interacciones vinculares heteronormadas.",

When women find themselves on their own there is change and frequently trauma, new circumstances to deal with and new identities to forge. In these new circumstances, as with the discussion on the degrees of marriage, there are degrees of husband absence. In a psychological, as well as a physical sense, husbands are more or less present in the lives of lone women. Women's adjustment involves processes of personal change, the construction of new ways of behaving and the creation of new avenues for the expression of companionship and sexuality. This chapter is about the emotional processes of becoming single and/or alone, the social psychology and the emotional survival of women at the margins and beyond marriage.",

Approved traits such as altruism may not be projected by the non-insightful; they may, however, be projected by the insightful. 11. Altruism is related to the relative value with which relationships are regarded. Relationships which, while prevalent in lay or professional thinking or both, have not been substantiated by the present study include: 1. The individual who attends church or synagogue regularly is apt to be more altruistic than one who does not. 2. The inhibition or control of impulses or desires involved in altruistic behavior is conducive to neurotic symptomology. 3. Those attracted to the sciences are more altruistically inclined than those attracted to law, business, or engineering. 4. The political liberal or leftist is apt to be more altruistic than the conservative or rightist. 5. Professed ease in relationships is correlated with altruism. 6. An child is apt to be significantly more egoistic than the average. Perhaps in the long run the most rewarding product of this study is one that had not been consciously hypothesized: the precipitation from the matrix of a configuration of variables that appears fully consistent with Becker's concept of the sacred pole of the sacred-secular continuum. Appearing as it did as the first dimension to be extracted and accounting for a larger amount of the matrix variance than any of the other seven dimensions which followed (including configurations consistent with the constructs socioeconomic status and social acceptability), it would seem to grant considerable support to Becker's contention that the construct sacred is not only objectively possible but objectively probable.22 If the sacred can be shown by factor analysis to be a dimension underlying the surface relationships between many of the variables of interest to the contemporary sociologist and psychologist, then the construct warrants considerably more attention from the quantitatively-oriented investigator than it has received to date.",

For men with PD, additional factors may play a role. Let‚Äôs think about this in more detail. Impotence implies difficulty with sexual performance‚Äîproblems achieving and maintaining an erection, which should lead to ejaculation. Before considering all the things that can disrupt sexual performance, we should recognize that occasional impotence is common. This is something that can and does happen to even the most macho guy. Men are at their sexual peak during their teenage years and a little after. With passing decades, not only does the urge for sexual gratification decline but also the ability to perform. Hence, as men pass beyond the years when all they think about is sex, occasional impotence is fairly common. We need to accept this, just as we are stuck with the joint pains that never bothered us when we were young, or the middle-age requirement for reading glasses.",

All effects were independent of total time since the couple's last copulation and the man's relationship satisfaction. Discussion addresses limitations of the current research and situates the current results within the broader comparative literature on adaptation to sperm competition.",

The data analysed here consist of anonymous responses to a questionnaire on sexual behaviour and attitudes obtained from a large community-based sample of Australian male twins aged 18-52. Significant heritabilities were observed for a range of psychological and behavioural measures (orientation of present sexual feelings and fantasies, ever having been sexually attracted to a man, attitude to homosexual sex, number of male and female sexual partners), with approximately 42 to 60 per cent of observed variance estimated to be due to genetic influences in these variables. Familial aggregation was also observed in other measures (sexual behaviour in the past twelve months, attitude to heterosexual sex) but it was not possible to determine whether this was due to genetic or shared environmental influences.",

      "abstract": "As we have seen throughout the book, perpetrators may inflict violence on one person to constitute relationships with others. For example, a soldier may kill an enemy in obedience to an officer, or an initiate may kill a member of a rival gang. A perpetrator may kill one member of another group in retaliation for some other member of that group‚Äôs killing a member of the perpetrator‚Äôs group. A man may kill his wife‚Äôs lover to regulate his relationship with his wife, or, in an honor culture, kill his niece‚Äôs lover, and his niece, in order to regulate his relationships with his family and with everyone in the community. As we saw, the Trojan War was all about men fighting men to constitute relationships with other men, or with the gods. In all these and many other cases we have considered in this book, the motive to constitute one or more of the component relationships of a metarelational model morally requires violence in another of the relationships that compose the metarelational model. In general, relationships have moral implications for other relationships with which they are metarelationally linked.",

This penis envy may be simply episodic with some patients, but with others it can be central. Pseudo-desire, promulgated by envy, achieves a semblance of satisfaction, as shown in the phallic attitudes of some women, who are immersed in imitation of the other sex, or at least of the image they have of it. Penis envy will disappear by itself the day the patient no longer has that painful feeling of deficiency which caused it. If one agrees to abandon an object-oriented view of the envied penis‚Äî and to defer all questions concerning the sociocultural legitimacy of the envy‚Äîthen one can undertake a truly psychoanalytical approach. The association of penis envy with conscious or unconscious hatred toward the mother is frequently observed.",

The relational systems of subjugation that maintain such states of terror must, of necessity, destroy any authentic civic space in which individuals can flourish. Similar dynamics characterize child abuse within families. Survival requires the use of varied strategies, the most extreme of which are dissociative in nature, and that result in marked distortions of developmental trajectories across all psychological domains. Such dynamics are mirrored in dissociative systems that, in the absence of intervention, perpetuate the trauma of non-recognition by subjugation and self-objectification, or by omnipotent denial of others' subjectivity. All abusive systems are facilitated by bystanders, whose awareness of what is disavowed is always partial, resulting in a state of knowing and not-knowing. As dynamics shift, bystanders may behave like victims‚Äîpassive, helpless, frightened and frozen, or like perpetrators‚Äîtaking vicarious and voyeuristic pleasure in abuse or actively aiding and abetting the abusers.",

      "abstract": "How the sexuality of a relationship is related to other dimensions of the relationship such as love have received little empirical attention even though intimacy is positively related to sexual satisfaction. There is often confusion and frustration when it comes to sex in marital relationships. So, this study attempts to investigate the relationship of marital sexual satisfaction`s styles and love in married couples. More specific research purposes are: (1) to classify sexual styles by sexual satisfaction factors-sexual enjoyment, sexual burden, sexual monotony, (2) to categorize marital sexual styles matched by husbands` sexual style and wives` sexual style, (3) to explore the relationship of marital sexual styles and companionate love. The study has shown that there are 3 different types of sexual styles; obligational type, desirous type, and impassive type and 9 marital sexual styles; husband`s obligational type-wife`s obligational type, husband`s obligational type-wife`s desirous type, husband`s obligational type-wife`s impassive type, husband`s desirous type-wife`s obligational type, husband`s desirous type-wife`s desirous type, husband`s desirous type-wife`s impassive type, husband`s impassive type-wife`s obligational type, husband`s impassive type-wife`s desirous type, and husband`s impassive type-wife`s impassive type. The values of companionate love was the highest in husband`s desirous type-wife`s desirous type whereas it was the lowest in case of wife`s obligational type. In conclusion, sexual intimacy between a husband and a wife is the most satisfying benefits of marriage. Learning to communicate, meeting each other`s needs, and understanding the differences between men and women- these are the most precious factors that could achieve the goal of physical intimacy.",

      "abstract": "Ageism refers to discrimination and prejudice based on age-related stereotypes. Forms of prejudice such as sexism and racism have been investigated in relation to morality; however, little extant research has considered ageism and moral identity. The purpose of this study was to investigate, among younger adults, whether moral identity symbolization ‚Äì that is, the desire to appear moral to others (i.e., public morality) ‚Äì and/or moral identity internalization ‚Äì that is, wanting to be more moral (i.e., private morality) ‚Äì was associated with ageism among younger adults. College students, ages 18‚Äì29 (N = 688, 75.00% female) enrolled in a psychology course at a large public university in the southern U.S. completed a survey which included the Self-Importance of Moral Identity Scale and Fabroni Scale of Ageism. Men had higher levels of ageism than women. Moral identity symbolization was not associated with ageism; however, moral identity internalization was associated with lower ageism. Results regarding gender are consistent with previous studies finding greater intolerance among men. Among younger adults, moral identity symbolization may not be related to ageism since attitudes about older adults are not germane to public morality the way racism or sexism are. Younger adults who internalize their moral identity ‚Äì that is, they wish to be a more moral person ‚Äì may engage in less stereotyping and prejudice towards older adults.",

      "title": "Sociophilosophical Problems of Sex, Marriage, and the Family",
      "abstract": "The general crisis of capitalism embraces all spheres of the life of society and, in the final analysis, is reflected in the life of each individual. The family is no exception in this regard. Problems of disorganization and disintegration of the family and marriage, the breakdown of traditional moral norms regulating familial and marital relationships and sexual behavior, have become subjects of close attention by philosophers, sociologists, educators, and physicians. The number of items published on these problems increases from year to year. One is struck, in this regard, by the extreme diversity (often mutually exclusive) of criteria in the approaches to the study of these problems. Of course, this may be partially explained by the complexity of the subject under study. But in the case in point, the reason is primarily the presence of acute social contradictions in capitalist society itself, of methodological and ethical pluralism, and of the extreme contradictoriness of the initial theoretical positions characteristic of bourgeois social thought. (_1) For example, within a single collection, Sociology and Social Problems. A Conceptual Approach (2), one may find not only different but even mutually exclusive points of view on the same question. But for all the diversity of starting points, approaches and arguments, styles and methods of presentation, it is still possible to identify two common features that mark all such writings to some extent: 1. The standards of consumer society are taken as model. Withrespect towoman's work in employment [outside the home], this is expressed in the attitude toward her career and her power (in the family). Development of parental roles in the family is associated with parents' capacities to assure, in the course of socializing their children, that they will subsequently advance. The relationships between spouses are regarded as harmonious only if a mutual attitude toward success outside the family and toward a high level of sexual activity, which creates a special kind of prestige, particularly for the man, is achieved. Consumerist attitudes are revealed, perhaps most vividly, in the approach to sexual behavior and corresponding norms of morality. Even in the writings of scholars striving for objectivity, overestimation of the significance and role of sexual activity is a factor. Most works are characterized by a spirit of negation of the traditional norms of sexual morality of Western European culture.",

The purpose of this literature review is to gain a better understanding of the positive and negative influences of socioeconomic factors, cultural/ethnic characteristics, and racial differences on the mental health of children. A review of the literature on the influence of race, ethnicity, and poverty on the mental health of children found that (1) children whose parents are in poverty or who have experienced severe economic losses are more likely to report or be reported to have higher rates of depression, anxiety, and antisocial behaviors; and (2) after controlling for socioeconomic status, African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics are less likely to report or be reported to have such mental health problems. A theoretical construct for this protective effect is related to cultural factors, such as perceived social support, deep religiosity/spirituality, extended families, and maternal coping strategies as buffers against psychological distress.",

Social signals are in fact more intensive and more conspicuous in many cases where captive animals are compared with those in the wild, and certain signals (and their significance) are rendered much more obvious when seen at the highest level of intensity. Only the possible biological function of these signals have been discussed, whilst the underlying physiological causes have been considered only in passing. In addition, the morphological features of the genital signals vary widely from species to species, as is common for other intraspecific signals. Sexual signals also have social significance, presentation acting as a greeting ceremony. In the female the sexual skin activity primarily underlines the sexual presentation. The main source for counterbalancing intra-group agonistic tendencies is behaviour patterns and/or signals from the sexual and brood-care context.",

      "abstract": "En este trabajo de investigacion cualitativa se explora como viven la ausencia de una pareja sentimental estable las mujeres de mediana edad y los efectos que trae a su salud emocional. Este fenomeno esta relacionado con la obsesion de una pareja sentimental o con perderla, lo que puede llevar a desarrollar depresiones severas, debido a haber ‚Äúfracasado‚Äù en la vida sentimental, alternativamente podrian involucrarse en relaciones destructivas derivadas del miedo que provoca estar sola. Estas mujeres sufren un deterioro mental importante, llegando incluso a no saber mantener una relacion y reflejar un conformismo extremo hacia todos los aspectos que rodean a su pareja, e incluso a tener miedo de quejarse por una posible mala reaccion a sus opiniones. Vinculado con esta investigacion se relaciona el miedo a la solteria permanente, conocida tambien como ‚Äúanuptafobia‚Äù, ‚Äúadiccion al amor‚Äù, o coloquialmente ‚Äúsindrome de Susanita‚Äù (el personaje de Mafalda, cuyo unico fin en la vida era casarse y tener hijos). \tEn la actualidad en Mexico el fenomeno de anuptafobia solo se cita en redes sociales, revistas, periodicos, blogs, pero no hay investigaciones academicas que permitan ahondar en el tema. Las investigaciones y documentos academicos encontrados en relacion a soledad, solteria y la interrelacion con la salud emocional citados se encuentran en: Colombia, Estados Unidos y Canada. El proposito de la presente investigacion es presentar los resultados de las experiencias de un grupo de mujeres de mediana edad (30 a 40 anos), solteras, sin pareja estable y la interrelacion con su salud emocional; los mismos son derivados de una intervencion fenomenologica, en sesiones de grupo realizadas bajo el Enfoque Centrado en la Persona de Carl Rogers, y el modelo fenomenologico de Virginia Moreira. El procedimiento para llevar a cabo el analisis de los datos se hizo mediante transcripciones de las sesiones de intervencion, de las cuales se destacaron frases o palabras utiles que se interrelacionaran con la investigacion, posteriormente se crearon familias de codigos, los cuales se agruparon para dar respuesta a la pregunta de investigacion. Los resultados en cuanto al enfoque humanista, permitieron a las participantes un autoconocimiento mas profundo de su historia de vida, necesidades, aceptacion, objetivos personales, asi como una mejor comunicacion inter e intrapersonal al trabajar con otras mujeres y compartir sus experiencias, sensaciones y emociones. Para efectos academicos estos resultados muestran una interrelacion directa con salud emocional, ademas la Anuptafobia se evidencia al no querer las participantes estar sin una pareja sentimental, ademas de un marcado deterioro en su autoestima; lo que deriva en aceptar cualquier relacion amorosa, buscar en redes sociales parejas sentimentales, permitir abusos tanto fisicos como emocionales por parte de sus parejas amorosas, asi como cuando llega un candidato a pareja sentimental estable, salir huyendo porque parece que no es lo que quieren, un tipo de sabotaje. Las experiencias asi como los resultados de la misma, abren el parentesis a seguir investigando la Anuptafobia en Mexico, tambien en hombres seria interesante conocer como se interrelaciona este fenomeno con redes sociales, al buscar candidatos para encontrar pareja sentimental.",

      "abstract": "Jealousy is defined as one of the most common automatic responses to endangering a relationship by a third party, and in evolutionary psychology it has the function of maximizing self-reproduction fitness, ensuring paternity security in men, and maintaining partner's resources in women. These include romantic jealousy, in men assuring certainty of paternity, and in women assuring the maintenance of partner's resources. Thus, according to this logic, a woman‚Äôs sexual infidelity should be more threatening for men and a man‚Äôs emotional infidelity (emotional involvement with other women than a primary partner) should be more threatening for women. Many previous studies confirm the existence of sex differences in jealousy; men reporting a higher level of sexual jealousy and women reporting a higher level of emotional jealousy. On the contrary, studies of romantic jealousy in homosexual individuals show inconsistent results. Some studies suggest that the type of sexual and emotional jealousy does not depend on the sex of the individual who is jealous, but rather on the sex of the partner or the sex of the rival. Therefore, the aim of this review is to introduce romantic jealousy from an evolutionary perspective and to acquaint the reader with current knowledge of the study of cognitive, emotional and behavioral aspects of romantic jealousy in heterosexual and homosexual men and women.",

      "abstract": "The Epidemiology of Adolescent Homosexuality PREVALENCE Sexual orientation refers to an individual's pattern of physical and emotional arousal toward other persons. It is not synonymous with gender identity (the knowledge of being male or female) or gender role (outward expression of maleness or femaleness). Gender identity and gender role generally are defined by anatomic and chromosomal gender in both heterosexual and homosexual individuals. Sexual orientation also is not synonymous with sexual activity; many homosexual individuals, especially during adolescence, participate in heterosexual behavior and relationships,1,2 and many adults who identify themselves as heterosexual report homosexual activity during adolescence.3-5 It is difficult to know with certainty the number of people who identify themselves as exclusively or predominantly homosexual. It is more difficult still to estimate the number who have questions about their sexual orientation during adolescence because of the well-known fluidity and complexity of sexual attractions and activities during this period. The original Kinsey study of sexuality reported that from puberty to age 20, 28% of boys and 17% of girls had one or more homosexual experiences. The same survey reported that 37% of adults have had homosexual experiences and that 10% consider themselves to be predominantly homosexual.3,4 In a somewhat more recent cross-sectional study of 13- to 19-year-olds, 11% of boys and 6% of girls reported at least one homosexual experience, with 17% of boys aged 16 to 19 reporting such activities.6",

Intrapsychically it is manifest by a sensitivity to sexual stimuli, preoccupation with sexual fantasies, and/or a longing to be with the preferred partner. Physiologically there is a lowered threshold for genital engorgement which may only be relieved by orgasm. The relation between physical and psychological changes is complex, which prevents one making any clear assessments of the libido from physical arousal. Certainly the physical and psychological changes react with each other in the manner of a feedback loop, the feeling of genital engorgement leading to psychic arousal and vice versa. There are several difficulties in assessing sexual desire.",

      "abstract": "This is a brief review of the normal changes in adolescent behaviour and the interplay between biology and social factors that occur at and around puberty, in an attempt to explain when this transition may become problematic The onset of puberty is a biological marker for an individual's transition from a non-reproductive to a reproductive state. Adolescence is a normal developmental transition associated with clearly visible physical changes, reorganization and pruning of neuronal circuits in the brain and the occurrence of new behaviours and interests. It is a time when new life tasks (orientation towards peers of the other sex, romantic and sexual involvement and mastering an educational career) need to be mastered. Parent-child conflict increases and becomes more intense as the adolescent struggles for more independence while still requiring support. These normal changes can become problematic if biological and social expectations diverge e.g. entering puberty very early or very late. While early pubertal onset in boys is likely to have beneficial effects, in girls precocious pubertal timing may have a negative impact on body-image, affect (or emotional well-being) and sex-role expectations. Other individual biological predispositions and genetic endowment may interact with social factors (e.g. peers, parenting style, neighbourhood) making adolescence either an adaptive or a challenging transition. There is a lack of sufficiently large longitudinal studies that have been able to study this interaction between genetics, biology and social environment on adolescent development. The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort provides a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of pubertal timing on social behaviour. Planned assessments and concepts are outlined.",

      "abstract": "In Ghana, collectivism holds people together in marital relationships, even if partners are religiously different. Married partners still hurt, betray, or offend each other and might develop avoidance or vengeful (i.e., unforgiving) motives. We investigated whether religious homogamy moderated connections of personality and marriage variables to unforgiving motives. Heterosexual married couples (N = 176 heterosexual married couples; N = 352 individuals; mean marriage duration 10.89 years) participated. Most identified as Christian (83.5% males; 82.3% females) or Muslim (11.9% males; 14.3% females). Couple religious homogamy was related directly to lower unforgiving motives. Religious homogamy did not moderate the connection between some personality variables (i.e., agreeableness and trait forgivingness) and unforgiving motives. Religiously unmatched couples tended to have greater unforgiveness at higher levels of neuroticism and lower forbearing, marital satisfaction, and marital commitment relative to religiously matched couples. One implication is that couple therapists need to assess partner neuroticism, marriage climate (i.e., satisfaction and commitment), and the general tendency to forbear when offended. Those can combine to produce unforgiving relationships, which might make progress in couple therapy improbable.",

Generally, they are peaceful, obsessive, often hypothymic; they express disgust for the body, suffer various somatic dysfunctions due to the sexual stasis; they have difficulties in communicating with things and beings. As compared to erective impotents, it seems that the global impotents have a more rigid father, are among the younger sibblings and have more brothers and sisters.

Men push for career success, and achieve seniority, or they come to terms with having underachieved. Women‚Äôs experience is more complex. Socialisation into femininity is not as clear cut as masculinity and women do not have equivalent expectations of certain success. Women who do succeed in management or the professions are more likely to increase the problems and stress in their lives than if they opt out and the more senior a woman becomes the more she is likely to be stressed at work than a man of equivalent seniority. There are good social reasons why women find the high-flying life difficult, particularly if they are mothers. However, there are additional difficulties for senior women particularly in relation to the management of psychological boundaries between self, social context and in particular their sense of gendered subjectivity. The desire to achieve professionally does not preclude the desire to be feminine, enjoy being a woman and being seen as a woman with a sexual, intellectual and emotional presence that is feminine.",

Likewise, the importance of normal narcissistic functioning for individual mental health and capacity to live an optimal life has mostly been taken for granted. Healthy narcissistic functions, such as a sense of the right to one‚Äôs own life, striving for the best in life, appreciation of health and beauty, and ability to compete as well as to protect and defend oneself, are usually first attended to when they are absent or noticed as extreme. Nevertheless, healthy narcissism plays a crucial role in the human capacity to manage challenges, successes, and changes; to overcome defeats, illnesses, trauma, and losses; to love and be productive and creative; and to experience happiness, satisfaction, and acceptance of the course of one‚Äôs life.",

      "abstract": "Many older adults continue to engage in sexual behavior, most often in the context of long-term marriages. Prior studies have tended to examine older adults‚Äô sexual behavior, desires and motivations separately. Thus, there remain considerable gaps in our understanding of the multifaceted-nature of older couples‚Äô sexual expression. Using dyadic latent class analysis and data on 953 heterosexual couples in long-term marriages from Wave 2 of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), we describe configurations of couples‚Äô sexual expression. Four latent classes were identified. Within each latent class, couples were largely in agreement about their sexual behaviors, but husbands consistently expressed greater desire and motivation than their wives. In the highest engagement class, couples reported more frequent and wide-ranging activities (vaginal sex, oral sex, intimate touching), more frequent thinking about sex, greater satisfaction with their amount of sexual activity, and placed more importance on sex as part of their lives. In the lowest engagement class, both spouses indicated no sexual activity in the past year, but neither spouse was content with this situation even as both agreed sex was not an important part of life. Demographic, relational, and health factors were associated with membership in different classes. Health factors‚Äîespecially sexual difficulties‚Äîwere most predictive, with husbands‚Äô health more associated with latent class membership than wives‚Äô health. Given the complex and multifaceted nature of sexual expression among older married couples, geriatricians and other health practitioners should provide care that recognizes a wider array of activities and the potential for unmet need. Sexual expression is an important component of older adults‚Äô health and well-being.",

In particular, the role of specific environmental and occupational factors is incompletely elucidated. Various occupational (physical and chemical) agents have been shown to affect male reproductive functions in animals, but large differences in reproductive function and/or xenobiotic handling between species limit extrapolation to humans. When available, human data are often conflicting and, except in a few instances, usually refer to broad and heterogenous occupational categories or to groups of agents (e.g., solvents). It is often difficult to elucidate the role of a single agent because occupational exposure conditions are often complex and various confounding factors related to lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, and diet) or socioeconomic state may also affect sperm quality, fertility, or pregnancy outcomes.The objective of this work is to summarize the main epidemiological and, where relevant, experimental findings pertaining to agents (physical and chemical) encountered in the occupational environment that might affect the male reproductive system (sperm count, motility and morphology, libido, and fertility) and/or related pregnancy outcomes (spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, low birth weight, and birth defects and childhood malignancy in offspring).

Moreover, it is a difficult question to tackle in horses as animals are dispersed in a variety of environmental conditions. There are some undirect indications based on comparisons of breeds or families. Behavioural similarities in animals issued from the same sire or belonging to the same breed are oberserved in foals and adult horses both in freely expressed behaviours (play, distance to the dam) as well as in reactions to experimental situations (emotional or learning tests). Stereotypic behaviours seem to appear more frequently in some breeds and / or families. The relative weight of environmental and genetic factors on the determinism of behavioural traits seems to differ according to the trait being considered. Moreover the observed differences between families or breeds can as well be related to epigenetic factors (maternal effect for example). It seems possible and promising to include behaviour in horse selection but it is necessary to have clear objectives in the trait seeked, the way it can be measured and to evaluate the impact of environmental factors.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Research shows that sexual interest declines with age, while sexual satisfaction remains relatively stable in later life. Declines in sexual interest can result from health deficits that pose barriers to sex; however, for older adults who are healthy and able to have sex, socioemotional factors may influence sexual satisfaction. This study examined the associations between socioemotional variables, sexual interest, and sexual satisfaction among older adults. Data were drawn from the subset of adults ages 60+ in UCSD SAGE study (n=359). A series of linear regression models were fitted to examine sexual interest and sexual satisfaction as separate outcomes while accounting for demographics (age, gender, marital status, race/ethnicity), socioemotional variables (morale, self-compassion, satisfaction with life), and health indicators (physical function, general health). Older adults who were younger ages (B=-.172, p=.001), men compared to women (B=.283, p&amp;lt;.001), married/partnered compared to single (B=.213, p&amp;lt;.001), and had better physical functioning (B=.214, p&amp;lt;.001) reported higher sexual interest. In the model for sexual satisfaction among sexually active older adults (n=148), those with greater morale (B=-.027, p=.03) and better physical function (B=.271, p=.003) reported higher sexual satisfaction. Findings reinforce the importance of physical function for sexual interest and satisfaction among older adults. Socioemotional factors, such as morale, are more strongly associated with sexual satisfaction. However, these relationships may be bidirectional or recursive in nature (i.e., those with higher morale are satisfied with sexual encounters, and that sexual satisfaction may lead to higher morale), requiring additional longitudinal studies.",

      "abstract": "Most couples begin marriage intent on maintaining a fulfilling relationship, but some newlyweds soon struggle, and others continue to experience high levels of satisfaction. Do these diverse outcomes result from an incremental process that unfolds over time, as prevailing models suggest, or are they a manifestation of initial differences that are largely evident at the start of the marriage? Using 8 waves of data collected over the first 4 years of marriage (N = 502 spouses, or 251 newlywed marriages), we tested these competing perspectives first by identifying 3 qualitatively distinct relationship satisfaction trajectory groups and then by determining the extent to which spouses in these groups were differentiated on the basis of (a) initial scores and (b) 4-year changes in a set of established predictor variables, including relationship problems, aggression, attributions, stress, and self-esteem. The majority of spouses exhibited high, stable satisfaction over the first 4 years of marriage, whereas declining satisfaction was isolated among couples with relatively low initial satisfaction. Across all predictor variables, initial values afforded stronger discrimination of outcome groups than did rates of change in these variables. Thus, readily measured initial differences are potent antecedents of relationship deterioration, and studies are now needed to clarify the specific ways in which initial indices of risk come to influence changes in spouses' judgments of relationship satisfaction.",

      "title": "Factors Associated With Sexual Dysfunction in Newly Married Women Referred to the Urban Health Centers of Zanjan, Iran: A Cross-Sectional Study",
      "abstract": "Sexual function is a complex interaction of neurovascular and hormonal factors and is influenced by biological characteristics, interpersonal relationships as well as cultural, traditional, and social features (1).Sexual disorders refer to disruptions in psycho-social tendencies and changes in characteristics associated with sexual response cycle.It is considered as a cause for anxiety and problems in interpersonal relationships (2) that affects well-being, quality of life, and lifestyle of women (2-4).According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, sexual dysfunction has been introduced as a side effect in stages which are known as sexual response cycle or intercourse-associated pain (5).This definition emphasizes that human sexual response cycle model is a chronological sequence and consists of several coordinated stages including sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction (6).Epidemiology of sexual dysfunction in women is poorly understood because few population-based studies were carried out on the prevalence, determinants, and consequences of women's sexual dysfunction (7,8).In addition, socio-cultural barriers, taboos and false beliefs make it difficult to estimate sexual dysfunction prevalence which seems actually underestimated (9).However, population-based studies regarding the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women have been increased in the past decade in order to better identify and understand the impact of this problem on women's lives, and these studies have been conducted in different countries, cultures, and age groups (10).It is estimated that 40 to 50% of women in the United States are suffering from sexual dysfunction and the problems associated with sexual dissatisfaction which have been reported in 87% of older women (7,8).Rouzi et al showed that the prevalence of sexual dysfunction among Saudi and non-Saudi female healthcare providers was high (11).In Iran, few studies have been done on the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women (12).Ramezani Tehrani et al showed that the prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women in four provinces of Qazvin, Kermanshah, Golestan, and Hormozgan was 27.3% and dysfunction in the stages of desire, arousal, lubrication, and orgasm was 35.6%, 39.9%, 18.9%, and 27.3%, respectively; and 15.2% of them were dissatisfied with their sex life (13).The prevalence of sexual disorders in other studies was reported to be between 31 and 66% (12,14,15).Dissatisfaction with sexual performance has always been one of the few causes of divorce and marital conflict.Bolhari et al showed that sexual problems are the cause of Abstract Objectives: Sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent nowadays and is a threat to healthy marital life.The aim of the present study was to determine the factors associated with sexual dysfunction in newly married women referred to the urban health comprehensive services centers of Zanjan, Iran in 2015-2016.Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 300 women married in the last 5 years who referred to the health centers in Zanjan.The participants were selected through cluster sampling method.Data were collected using a socio-demographic characteristics questionnaire and the Female Sexual Function Index.Descriptive and analytical statistics including independent t test, one-way ANOVA, and the general linear model were used to analyze the data.Results: Sexual dysfunction was found in 66% of the women.The frequency of sexual dysfunction was 33% for arousal, 31% for pain, 28.7% for desire, 23% for satisfaction, 3% for vaginal lubrication, and 16.3% for orgasm dimensions.According to the general linear model, breastfeeding and contraceptive method had a significant relationship with the mean score of sexual function.Conclusions: About two-thirds of women in their early years of marriage had sexual dysfunction, and given its impact on all aspects of marital life, it seems necessary to include sexual counseling in the pre-marital counseling program.",

Sex in these kinds of nonbiological, not otherwise legally recognized vertical status relations are generally not prohibited by state laws. Some sex in some of these vertical relationships, I propose, ought to be proscribed, whether or not the person subordinated in the relationship consents (although force, coercion, and/or nonvoluntariness might aggravate the crime). If that sounds draconian, let me put it this way: just as consent is not a defense to having sex with an eleven-year-old and as consent is not a defense to eating and murdering someone for sexual gratification, consent should not be a defense for sex between a minor and the intimate partner of the minor‚Äôs parent.",

      "title": "The biological basis of female sexuality",
      "abstract": "Human sexuality has three main roots: biological, motivational-affective-relational, and cognitive. Unfortunately, in women, the biological dimension is usually disregarded. Hormones are necessary, but not sufficient, factors to maintain a satisfying human libido. In women, oestrogens prime the central nervous system, acting as neurotrophic and psychotrophic factors throughout life. They also prime the sensory organs, including the skin with its sebaceous and sweat glands, which are the key receptors for external sexual stimuli. Oestrogens are also the ‚Äòpermitting factors‚Äô for the action of vaso-intestinal peptide, the key neurotransmitter involved in the endothelial and vascular changes leading to vaginal lubrication. Other factors, such as medication, alcohol and other health problems, can modify the biological impact of hormones on libido. Depression may cause a progressive decline in interest in sexual behaviour leading to low libido, difficulty in sexual arousal, secondary anorgasmia and/or frank sexual aversion. Increasing attention of doctors towards the sexual problems of women will dramatically improve female quality of life, especially during difficult periods Of transition.",

      "title": "Idiopathic Sexual Precocity in the Female",
      "abstract": "Summary From among 11 female cases of idiopathic sexual precocity, 3 have been chosen to exemplify advancement, delay, and normality, respectively, of psychological maturity in relation to chronological age. Like the other cases, they also exemplify coincidence between degree of maturity and variety of life experiences encountered and transacted. Sexually, their psychological development was not predetermined as some sort of automatic or instinctive adjunct to maturation of somatic sexuality. The first report was of a girl aged 8 yr., 6 mo., who was postpubertal in physical development and had begun regular menstruation at 7 yr., 6 mo. Her apparent psychological precocity was a mixture of three ingredients: superior intelligence, extraordinary fluency in speaking, and unusual breadth of interest and knowledge. Romantic fantasies were frequent and elaborate, but did not include imagery of physical eroticism. Overt erotic behavior was not manifested but, even had it been, the girl would not have been appraised as adult, psychologically. The gulf between infancy and adulthood, with regard to learning and accomplishment, is too great for somatic sexual precocity to have allowed of a dramatic short-cut, even though this girl's speed of psychological development was considerable. The girl was appraised as psychologically well adjusted. The second report was of a girl who, at 6 yr., 4 mo., was well advanced into puberty, but not yet menstruating. Among the sixteen children studied, male and female, she had encountered and tried to negotiate the most overtly baffling and difficult life experiences. Difficulties were engendered chiefly by her father, who was psychosexually disturbed and pathologically suspicious to a degree that many would evaluate as psychotic. The girl was retarded in all-round social, educational, and psychological development. She had trance-like spells of inattention. She made monotonous rocking movements in public. In private, she spent long periods during the day, and in bed each night, twisting and writhing her thighs and legs in automatic fashion. She was appraised as severely disturbed psychologically. The third report was of a girl aged 9 yr., 3 mo., who was postpubertal in physical development and had begun regular menstruation at the age of 7 yr., 4 mo. Her physical precocity made her seem like a lumbering, overgrown schoolgirl and not like a young lady before her time. She was not in the least disconcerted by the disparity in physical appearance between herself and other schoolgirls of her age. Her achievements, interests, and activities were average and typical for girls of her age with whom she mixed. She was prosaic and literal minded. What few romantic fantasies she had were rather pallid. She manifested no overt erotic behavior. She was appraised as psychologically well adjusted. Recommendations for the rearing and psychological management of girls with idiopathic sexual precocity are substantially the same as those presented with the study of precocity in a boy.",

      "title": "Male infertility, female fertility and extrapair copulations",
      "abstract": "Females that are socially bonded to a single male, either in a social monogamy or in a social polygyny, are often sexually polyandrous. Extrapair copulations (EPC) have often been suggested or rejected, on both empirical and theoretical grounds, as an important mechanism that enables females to avoid fertility risks in case their socially bonded male is infertile. Here, we explore this possibility in two steps. First, we present a mathematical model that assumes that females have no precopulatory information about male fertility, and shows that a female EPC strategy increases female reproductive success only if certain specific conditions are upheld in the nature of male infertility. In particular, these conditions require both (i) that fertile sperm precedence (FSP) is absent or incomplete within ejaculates of the same male (i.e. that an infertile male is, at least partly, truly infertile), and (ii) the existence of FSP among ejaculates of different males (such that infertile spermatozoa of the infertile male are at a disadvantage when competing against spermatozoa of a fertile male). Second, to evaluate their potential role in the evolution of female EPC, we review the abundance and FSP patterns of the different male infertility types. The conclusion is drawn that some common infertility types, such as poor sperm count or motility, contribute to the evolution of female EPC, whereas other common infertility types, such as sperm depletion or allocation in a social monogamy (but not in a social polygyny), and in particular male driven polyspermy, do not. Also, a deeper look at the arms race between sperm fertilization efficiency and female barriers to sperm may answer the non-trivial question: \"why are some types of infertility so common?\"",

      "title": "Pr√©cis of<i>The evolution of human sexuality</i>",
      "abstract": "Abstract Patterns in the data on human sexuality support the hypothesis that the bases of sexual emotions are products of natural selection. Most generally, the universal existence of laws, rules, and gossip about sex, the pervasive interest in other people's sex lives, the widespread seeking of privacy for sexual intercourse, and the secrecy that normally permeates sexual conduct imply a history of reproductive competition. More specifically, the typical differences between men and women in sexual feelings can be explained most parsimoniously as resulting from the extraordinarily different reproductive opportunities and constraints males and females normally encountered during the course of evolutionary history. Men are more likely than women to desire multiple mates; to desire a variety of sexual partners; to experience sexual jealousy of a spouse irrespective of specific circumstances; to be sexually aroused by the sight of a member of the other sex; to experience an autonomous desire for sexual intercourse; and to evaluate sexual desirability primarily on the bases of physical appearance and youth. The evolutionary causes of human sexuality have been obscured by attempts to find harmony in natural creative processes and human social life and to view sex differences as complementary. The human female's capacity for orgasm and the loss of estrus, for example, have been persistently interpreted as marriage-maintaining adaptations. Available evidence is more consistent with the view that few sex differences in sexuality are complementary, that many aspects of sexuality undermine marriage, and that sexuality is less a unifying than a divisive force in human affairs.",

      "abstract": "Pengungkapan rasa cinta antara suami dan istri, antara lain dengan jalan berhubungan seksual untuk memenuhi kebutuhan seksual secara biologis dan psikologis. Dengan terpenuhinya kebutuhan seksual, suami dan istri akan merasa bahagia dan terikat satu sama lain. Jika tidak terpenuhi akan memperburuk hubungan suami dan istri sehingga mengakibatkan perselingkuhan atau perceraian. Seperti yang diungkapkan Distarra.com, Jakarta (2002), salah satu alasan utama perceraian adalah tidak tercapainya kepuasan seksual dan tidak sedikit pria yang melakukan perselingkuhan sebagai solusi akhir dari ketidakpuasan seksual. Faktor yang mempengaruhi kepuasan seksual adalah sikap terhadap seks, komunikasi, cinta, dan situasi (Hart dan Hart, 1988). Dalam bubungan seksual diperlukan komunikasi seksual yang baik antara suami dan istri supaya tidak terjadi kesalahpahaman antar pasangan.\r\nDalam suatu penelitian, variabel sangat penting. Adapun variabel-variabel\r\ndalam penelitian ini adalah : 1. Variabel bebasnya yaitu komunikasi seksual;\r\n2. Variabel tergantungnya yaitu kepuasan seksual; 3. Dan variabel kendalinya yaitu usia perkawinan, usia, dan jenis kelamin. Sampel yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini memiliki karakteristik yang sesuai dengan karakteristik populasi, yaitu individu yang telah menikah, usia perkawinan minimal 1 tahun, bertempat tinggal di Kelurahan Penganjuran Banyuwangi dan berpendidikan minimum SMA Teknik pengambilan sampelnya secara random, dimana individu diambil secara acak dengan mengundinya. Metode pengumpulan datanya digunakan alat ukur yang berbentuk angket yaitu angket kepuasan seksual dan angket komunikasi seksual yang disusun oleh peneliti. Untuk teknik analisis datanya, penulis menggunakan teknik Analisis Regresi yang dilanjutkan dengan Korelasi Parsial.\r\nDari hasil penelitian Analisis Regresi didapat F= 8,266 dengan p= 0,000; yang berarti ada bubungan komunikasi seksual, usia perkawinan, usia, dan jenis kelamin dengan kepuasan seksual. Dan melalui korelasi parsial didapat hasil : a) ada bubungan antara komunikasi seksual dan kepuasan seksual; b) tidak ada hubungan antara usia perkawinan dan kepuasan seksual; c) tidak ada hubungan antara usia dan kepuasan seksual; d) tidak ada hubungan antara jenis kelamin dan kepuasan seksual.\r\nSebagai saran, diharapkan bagi suami dan istri supaya tidak mengabaikan sedikitpun masalah komunikasi seksual dalam mencapai kepuasan seksual.",

Actually, S/M is a catchall term for a wide range of individual passions and practices, with an endless spectrum of possibilities for expression. Among homosexuals, S/M is institutionalized to the extent that particular symbolic acts of dominance and submission are more common than others, most of which involve no pain whatsoever. Also, an elaborate scheme of norms control certain aspects of the scene, especially the action itself. Finally, a common path of entry can be traced. The action of gay S/M is termed leathersex, and its members are leathermen. This study may serve to construct an enlightened view of gay S/M.1",

The social and economic background of the majority of delinquent children is rather poor, and one has the impression that a large number of the children are illegitimate, even when accurate statistics are not at hand.

      "abstract": "According to our literature analysis, there are no data focused on spermatozoa emotional representations in childless men and data on the emotional repercussions of a diagnosis of infertility on men are still scarce. Thus, in this work, we investigated what the presence or absence of spermatozoa in the semen symbolize for men.To answer this question, 441 childless heterosexual men participated in an anonymous, prospective, Internet-based survey.In response to the question \"What would having a high or normal sperm count symbolize for you?\" the most frequent answer was \"ability to father a child\". Men living with a partner were significantly more likely than single men to answer \"ability to father a child\" (p < 0.05) and less likely to answer \"virility\" and/or \"ability to have an erection/ejaculation\" (p = 0.001). In response to the question \"If you found out that you had a low sperm count or no spermatozoa at all, how would you feel?\", most of the men stated that they would be disappointed. Men living with a partner were more likely to state that they would feel ashamed (p < 0.05) or guilty with regard to their partner (p < 0.0001).These preliminary results should help us to improve (i) the way that male infertility is announced (it is easier to find the right words if one understands the possible importance of having a high sperm count) and (ii) the psychological, marital and sexual counselling provided to men with a diagnosis of infertility.Dans la litt√©rature, peu d'articles traitent du ressenti des hommes vis √† vis de leurs spermatozo√Ødes. Que signifie pour un homme ‚Äúavoir ou non des spermatozo√Ødes‚Äù?

      "title": "When Exoneration Seems Hopeless: The Special Vulnerability of Sexual Abuse Suspects to False Confession",
      "abstract": "This chapter considers sources of vulnerability among innocent sexual abuse suspects to police-induced false confession. We suggest that sexual abuse suspects may be particularly vulnerable to false confession, primarily as a result of their enhanced sense of hopelessness that they might be believed or be able to establish their innocence. Moreover, we suggest this sense of hopelessness derives largely from two factors: first, their perception of the evidentiary situation they face; and, second, stereotypes associating fathers, step-fathers, priests, boy scout leaders, day care personnel and others with sexual abuse. That is, we suggest sexual abuse claims are often characterized by (1) seemingly credible claims of one or more victims, (2) against a suspect whose social category is consistent with stereotypes of sexual abusers, (3) lack of concrete physical evidence that could exonerate the suspect, and (4) testimony of professional and nonprofessional witnesses in seeming support of the occurrence of the abuse and/or the suspect‚Äôs guilt that likewise cannot be refuted by concrete evidence. Sexual abuse suspects may therefore be less likely than most other innocent suspects to expect (a) that their claims of innocence will be believed in the absence of concrete proof of innocence, (b) that there will be a way to prove their innocence, or even (c) that there will be a way to effectively cast doubt on the validity of the alleged victim(s)‚Äô claims of guilt or other apparently abuse supportive testimony. A primary goal of interrogation tactics is to instill in suspects such a sense of hopelessness, which then makes it easier for the interrogator to convince the suspect that confession will result in better legal outcomes than denial. For many sexual abuse suspects this goal may have been effectively met before they enter interrogation.",

      "title": "The Erotic Transference in Women and in Men: Differences and Consequences",
      "abstract": "Although the erotic transference is believed to be universal, it is variable in its expression. Drawing on the distinction between transference resistance and resistance to the awareness of the transference, I have proposed that, in general, the erotic transference utilized as resistance is more common among women, while resistance to the awareness of the erotic transference is more common among male patients. Erotic transference as resistance poses different analytic problems from those posed by resistance to its awareness. With women in treatment with men, the erotic transference is more often overt, consciously experienced, intense, long-lived and directed toward the analyst, and focused more on love than sex; with men in treatment with women, the erotic transference is muted, relatively short-lived, appears indirectly in dreams and triangular preoccupations, is seldom consciously experienced as a dominant affective motif, is frequently transposed to a woman outside the analytic situation, and most often appears as sexual rather than as a longing for love. In women, the strength of the erotic transference may obscure other important dynamics and conflicts. In short, the strength of the erotic transference, while it has significant therapeutic potential, often acts as a strong transference resistance to working out underlying conflicts. In contrast, in male patients in treatment with women, there is a resistance to the experience of the transference and, frequently, one witnesses defenses against the erotic transference rather than the transference itself. Yet, the dangers are substantial when the erotic transference fails to develop or is suppressed. This difference in the manifestation of the erotic transference parallels an extratherapeutic difference. In general, women achieve their self-identity as women by virtue of certain defining relationships, whereas men achieve their self-identity as men through achievement and autonomy. The reasons for these differences have been explored in terms of cultural dictates, but more particularly in terms of an asymmetry in psychological development.",

      "title": "Gender and Family Status Across the Life Course: Constraints on Five Types of Leisure",
      "abstract": "Abstract The family context is considered as it impacts involvement in culturally defined categories of leisure: active, passive, entertainment, social leisure and TV-viewing as well as total leisure are considered. How does family context, which varies across the life course, constrain leisure? Does family context have the same impact for men and women and for married and unmarried? These issues are examined for a subset of a national sample of adults (N=782) who provided behavioral data through multi-day time budget diaries. Using comparable samples of time from each individual, analysis of variance is used to test for differences in means. Family structure is examined as it constrains and facilitates various types of leisure. Women, and in particular, single mothers, are expected to be disadvantaged in terms of leisure time and involvement. Results indicate a more complex interplay of family context, gender-and-marital status and types of leisure. Women in general are not disadvantaged in terms of leisure time, although involvement in types of leisure vary for men and women. Family context often leads to higher or lower amounts of leisure. Post hoc explanations are often necessary, since predictions of differences between those not currently parents and parents were too simple. Models that take family development context and gender into account seem necessary to understand the constraints and opportunities for leisure participation. R√©sum√© Comment le contexte familial, qui varie avec les ann√©es, influe-t-il sur la participation aux cat√©gories de loisir d√©finies culturellement comme suit: loisir actif, loisir passif, spectacles, loisir social et √©coute de la t√©l√©vision, et loisir total? Quelles contraintes impose-t-il au loisir? A-t-il le m√™me impact sur les femmes et les hommes, ou sur les personnes mari√©es et c√©libataires? La pr√©sente √©tude analyse ces questions √† partir du sous-ensemble d'un √©chantillon national d'adultes (N=782) dont les donn√©es comportementales proviennent de compte rendus d'emploi du temps effectu√©s quotidiennement √† plusieurs reprises. L'analyse porte sur la structure familiale compte tenu de ses nombreux √©l√©ments contraignant ou facilitant la pratique de divers types de loisir. Les auteures font l'hypoth√®se que les femmes, et plus particuli√®rement les m√®res de familles monoparentales, sont d√©savantag√©es quant √† la participation aux activit√©s de loisir et au temps de pratique de ces activit√©s. Les r√©sultats font ressortir un lien plus complexe que pr√©vu entre le contexte familial, le statut sexuel et conjugal et les types de loisir. Les femmes en g√©n√©ral ne sont pas d√©savantag√©es relativement au temps de loisir, bien que la participation √† diverses activit√©s de loisir varie en fonction du sexe. Le contexte familial modifie souvent √† la hausse ou √† la baisse la quantit√© de loisir. Les auteures ont souvent d√ª recourir √† des explications post√©rieures √† l'analyse, puisque les pr√©dictions relatives aux diff√©rences entre les parents et ceux qui ne le sont pas √©taient trop √©l√©mentaires. Des mod√®les permettant de tenir compte du contexte de d√©veloppement familial et du sexe s'av√®rent n√©cessaires √† la compr√©hension des √©l√©ments contraires ou favorables √† la participation au loisir. Resumen ¬ø C√≥mo el contexto familiar, que var√≠a seg√∫n los a√±os, influencia la participaci√≥n en las categorias de tiempo libre definidas culturalmente como sigue: tiempo libre activo, liempo libre pasivo, espect√°culos, tiempo libre social y escucha de la televisi√≥n como distracci√≥n total? ¬ø Qu√© dificultades impone al tiempo libre? ¬ø Tiene el mismo impacto en las mujeres que en los hombres, o en las personas casadas como en las solteras? El presente estudio analiza estas preguntas desde el punto de vista de conjunto de una muestra nacional en los adultos (N=782) en la que los resultados de comportamiento provienen del tiempo dedicado diariamente en varias ocasiones. El an√°lisis porta sobre la estructura familiar teniendo cuenta de los numerosos elementos que dificultan o facilitan la pr√°ctica de diversos tipos de tiempo libre. Las autoras defienden la hip√≥tesis que las mujeres, y particularmente las madres de familias monoparentales, est√°n desaventajadas cuanto a la participaci√≥n en las actividades de tiempo libre y al tiempo de pr√°ctica de estas actividades. Los resultados resaltan un lazo m√°s complejo que previsto entre el contexto familiar, el estatuto sexual y matrimonial y los tipos de tiempo libre. Las mujeres en general no est√°n desaventajadas en relaci√≥n al tiempo libre, apesar de que la participaci√≥n a diversas actividades de tiempo libre vari√° en funci√≥n del sexo. El contexto familiar modifica con frecuencia a m√°s o a menos la cantidad de tiempo libre. Las autoras han debido recurrir con frecuencia a explicaciones subsecuentes al an√°lisis, puesto que las predicciones relativas a las diferencias entre los que son padres y los que no lo son eran demasiado elementales. Los modelos que permiten tener cuenta del contexto de desarrollo familiar y del sexo son necesarios para la comprensi√≥n de los elementos contrarios o favorables a la participaci√≥n del tiempo libre.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic conflict among feelings of entitlement, defectiveness, and deprivation is discussed from the perspective of superego defense against dangerously aggressive (and sexual) wishes. These negative feelings and negative self-images are exploited so as to appease the superego in the face of one's hostile aggression: that one is justified, that there are extenuating circumstances for one's hatred and destructiveness. The \"oral\" clamor of deprivation and entitlement, together with dependency, submissiveness, and defensive uncertainty, serve a screening function for hostile aggressive wishes, from any developmental level. Typically, attitudes of entitlement are contradictory, unclear, and wavering, because of conflict between differing ego ideal images, and conflict between superego, and ego and id, about the sadistic extractiveness in these attitudes. Attitudes of entitlement are contributed to by past trauma, deprivation, abuse, teasing overstimulation coupled with neglect, or alternating indulgence and deprivation, as well as identification with certain parental attitudes--exploitation and extractiveness--and denial of the need for the superego to assess reality accurately.",

      "abstract": "This article is written to help prosecutors as well as defense counsel gain more knowledge of the science relevant to child sex abuse allegations. Increased knowledge reduces professionals' doubts about handling these enormously complex cases, and the greater confidence moves these professionals just a little way toward certainty. The behavioral sciences can assist legal professionals in their efforts to determine the validity of a given child sex abuse (CSA) allegation. To provide some information from those fields, the author reviewed the pertinent literature. Some findings emerged: 1) clinicians' judgments about the veridicality of unconfirmed CSA allegations may well lack a firm scientific basis; 2) no psychological test or method reliably indicates whether a child has been sexually mistreated, or whether someone has committed an act of abuse; 3) children do sometimes falsely accuse; 4) the concepts of ‚Äúmemory repression‚Äù and ‚Äúrecovered memory‚Äù are not scientifically substantiated; 5) medical evaluations are often inadequate to determine the presence or absence of sex abuse; 6) the most reliable indicator of sexual mistreatment is often not the physical examination, but rather the child's own report; 7) certain features of the child's account suggest that the accusation is valid. It is concluded that conducting such interviews is of paramount importance; suggestions are made to improve these interviews' quality.",

Each couple lived together and did not have children living with them. Relationship quality was dimensionalized as love for partner, liking of partner, and relationship satisfaction. Cohabiting partners had the lowest Love for Partner and Relationship Satisfaction scores. Differences were also found among partner types on: barriers to leaving the relationship, alternatives to the relationship, a belief that mindreading is expected in the relationship, masculinity, femininity, androgyny, dyadic attachment, shared decision making, and perceived social support from family. The four partner groups did not differ in psychological adjustment. For each type of partner, love for partner was related to many barriers to leaving the relationship and high dyadic attachment; liking of partner was related to few alternatives to the relationship, high dyadic attachment, and high shared decision making; and relationship satisfaction was related to many attractions, few alternatives, few beliefs regarding disagreement is destructive to the relationship, high dyadic attachment, and high shared decision making. Stepwise multiple regression procedures were used to identify the best set of predictors for each partner type. Results are discussed in the context of existing models of relationship quality.",

In fact, the prostate may appropriately be called the seat of the sexual brain. It is to this gland that the psychologic lustful impulse, in order to satisfy the animal nature, is indirectly exerted through the sympathetic nervous system. The intimate reciprocal relations of the brain, or cerebral centers, and the prostate gland are marked, both in health and in disease. In health, excessive mental taxation, as by study or business cares, will lessen the sexual appetite; while violent emotions, such as grief, fright or anxiety, will temporarily suspend all desire. Men are by nature much more sensually inclined than women, and when they cultivate libidinous impulses, and the associations of prostitutes, they are liable",

      "abstract": "Abstract This species represents a typical example of protandric consecutive sexuality, the male phase becoming functional at a very early age, when the body has reached a length of only 3 to 7 mm. Those males which become functional earliest usually seek the association of older individuals in the female phase; others, maturing later, are more likely to remain solitary. Mated males have accentuated masculine characteristics and retain the male phase longer than solitary individuals or those that are isolated experimentally. Unfavorable environmental conditions postpone or prevent functional sexuality and terminate the male phase promptly without inaugurating the female phase. The influence of the female in accentuating the sexuality of the male is thought to be due to stimuli received by the latter through sense organs in tentacles and penis and mediated by the nervous system through hormonal secretions. Termination of the male phase and transition to the functional female are comparable to metamorphosis from the immature to the mature condition in other animals and, like metamorphosis, the primary (male) sexual phase can be abbreviated or prolonged experimentally, but the sequence cannot be reversed.",

      "abstract": "Sex is a motive force bringing a man and a woman into intimate contact. Sexuality is a central aspect of being human throughout life and encompasses sex, gender identities and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy, and reproduction. Sexuality is experienced and expressed in thoughts, fantasies, desires, beliefs, attitudes, values, behaviors, practices, roles and relationships. Though generally, women are sexually active during adolescence, they reach their peak orgasmic frequency in their 30 s, and have a constant level of sexual capacity up to the age of 55 with little evidence that aging affects it in later life. Desire, arousal, and orgasm are the three principle stages of the sexual response cycle. Each stage is associated with unique physiological changes. Females are commonly affected by various disorders in relation to this sexual response cycle. The prevalence is generally as high as 35‚Äì40%. There are a wide range of etiological factors like age, relationship with a partner, psychiatric and medical disorders, psychotropic and other medication. Counseling to overcome stigma and enhance awareness on sexuality is an essential step in management. There are several effective psychological and pharmacological therapeutic approaches to treat female sexual disorders. This article is a review of female sexuality.",

The major male and female sexual dysfunctions, concerns, and problems are described, including assessment, diagnostic considerations, and causes of these difficulties. Controversies surrounding how to conceptualize sexual problems are discussed, as are theoretical and practical problems of classification in the DSM. Psychogenic, interpersonal, psychosocial, and organic factors in the development of the sexual dysfunctions are reviewed. Such distinctions are more accurate in theory than in practice, where sexual problems are typically multi-determined. Sexual problems tend to be intertwined, as when difficulties with arousal and lubrication lead to pain on intercourse as well as lack of orgasm. The importance of appreciating the context in which clients/patients, their partners, and clinicians come to define sexual and gender difficulties as pathological is underscored for each of the sexual and gender problems. The sex script defining \"normal\" sexuality and gender provides the social backdrop for viewing and diagnosing other forms of sexual and gender expression as pathological. A variety of other sexual problems, including sexual disappointment, the pain of affairs, infertility, and are not listed in the DSM but may lead to patients presenting in clinicians' offices. Controversies surrounding the paraphilias, the need to distinguish between normophilic and paraphilic interactions, and the implications of such distinctions are discussed. Gender identity disorders are outlined, including the controversies surrounding its inclusion and revision process in the DSM, and the emergence of a transgender community's reaction to diagnostic labeling.",

      "abstract": "Sexual and reproductive function is affected by all aspects of cancer, including cancer‚Äôs biologic processes of growth and metastasis, the effects of undergoing cancer treatment, and the psychological issues that occur as a result of having cancer and receiving treatment for it. These aspects can result in changes in body appearance, infertility and sterility, and the inability to have intercourse. The changes may be made worse by additional alterations in body image, fears of abandonment, loss of self-esteem, changes in sexual identify, and concerns about self (Krebs, 2005). Human sexuality includes three separate but intertwined aspects: body image, reproductive ability, and sexuality or sexual functioning. Body image, or the way individuals see themselves or think others see them, may be altered by changes in body appearance resulting from weight loss or gain, alopecia, mucositis, fatigue, or a variety of other changes that may not be visible to others. Changes in self-esteem may occur as a result of body image alterations, resulting in decreased desire and decreased sexual activity. Reproductive function, or the ability to bear or father children, may become impossible as a result of therapyrelated infertility, and sexual functioning may be altered by changes in self-perception, decreased desire, general side effects of treatment (including cancer therapies and methods to manage side effects of therapy), or numerous other reasons. Some individuals are at higher risk for sexual side effects than others based on age, gender, type of cancer, type of cancer treatment, or concomitant medical or psychological illness (Krebs, 2001, 2005).

      "title": "[Attitude to be taken with the adolescent requesting contraception].",
      "abstract": "A combination of biological factors such as earlier age at puberty and fecundity, and social factors such as the disappearance of the extended family and of rites of passage and the development of a youth culture have encouraged adolescent sexuality at the same time that length of schooling is increasing and adolescents have not yet become socially autonomous. Adolescents employ contraception relatively infrequently and tend to choose less reliable methods. Reasons for this include ignorance of the biology of reproduction and of contraception methods; the fear of secondary effects, encouraged by the mass media; lack of access to family planning facilities or fear that parents will be informed; and the cost of contraceptives. An adolescent requesting contraception should be treated as a adult, taking into account the degree of maturity; the attitude of the medial practitioner will influence motivation and success in using the method. The medical history will indicate cases in which a hormonal contraceptive is contraindicated. The gynecological examination reveals the gynecological age of the patient, which is more important than chronological age. The frequency of sexual realtions should also be considered in the choice. Because motivation of adolescents is less reliable than that of adults, such methods as rhythm and withdrawal are not appropriate. Condoms or diaphragms are disliked because of the necessity of repeated manipulation before each act of intercourse, but may be acceptable to highly motivated individuals. Condoms are indicated when relations are unexpected and infrequent. IUDs are indicated only when hormonal contraceptives cannot be used and when forgetting of pills is likely to occur. Nevertheless, IUD use in adolescents can entail serious problems of expulsion or of infection that may lead to later infertility. Little is known of the effects of oral contraceptive use on sexual maturation and growth of very young adolescents, but because of the growth inhibiting effects of estrogens, they should not be prescribed earlier than 2 years postmenarche. Low dose pills should be chosen. Sequential pills are preferable for patients with irregular cycles. High doses of steroids administered within 48 hours should be available in cases of unprotected intercourse. Alternatively, an IUD may be inserted within 5 days.",

The study was made in order to determine the relationship of alienation to the independent variables of place of residence (an ethnically homogeneous Korean community in Los Angeles vs. ethnically heterogeneous communities in Oklahoma), gender, age, years of education, time in the United States, living with or without children, and living with or without a spouse. Significant relationships (p less than .01) were found between one or more of the subscales of the DAS (powerlessness, normlessness, social isolation, and total alienation) and place of residence, age, time in the United States, and whether living with or without a spouse. Simultaneous regression analyses were performed to determine the relative contribution of the independent variables to each of the subscales.",

      "abstract": "The study of the genesis of alcoholism seeks, as a rule, such landmarks in the personality development as may indicate the problem which the individual attempts to solve by means of intoxication. There may or may not be a further attempt to understand why the alcoholic man or woman chooses this particular solution instead of some other means. Supplementarily there is usually a search for environmental elements which presumptively foster such artificial adjustments as habitual inebriety. Thus etiological research on what is commonly called alcohol addiction but less pretentiously may be designated as habitual inebriety‚Ä† concerns itself primarily with psychodynamics leading up to‚Äîand social factors which may precipitate‚Äîgross inebriety. The weight is nearly all on the prealcoholic phase of alcoholism. The drinking career receives little attention in such studies. Phases of inebriety, forms of drinking, changes in the drinking pattern and even changes other than drinking habits occurring in the course of inebriety, do not appear to be regarded as significant landmarks in the development of alcoholism. Drinking histories of sorts are nearly always obtained but they are limited to such questions as the time heavy drinking began, what and how much the drinker consumed and how frequently, what kind of relief or discontent was brought about by drinking, why‚Äîif ever‚Äîthe drinker went \"on the water wagon\" and whether there had been any hospitalization because of alcoholism. Such data are gathered routinely and seldom form the basis for any theoretical elaborations. There are, nevertheless, some investigators who see significance in the drinking behavior itself. Tiebout's thoughtful paper on the syndrome of alcohol addiction* is one of the exceptional instances.",

The word was never just a medical description; it always held undertones of accusation ‚Äì a word to be hurled across the room during late-night arguments. How preferable that we now use the term ‚Äòerectile dysfunction‚Äô (ED): descriptive, non-judgmental, and with no misunderstandings. Problem is, there‚Äôs still a misunderstanding here, and a serious one at that. We still think that ED is only about the man, his penis and his problem. Wrong. Yes of course the man suffers ‚Äì and deeply. It‚Äôs not just the day-to-day lack of sexual performance, not just the panic that normal service will never be resumed. It‚Äôs also the low self-esteem, the failing confidence when he compares himself with other men. It‚Äôs the guilt at what he sees as failure towards his partner. And it‚Äôs the intimation if not of mortality, certainly of frailty and old age. ED can all too easily turn into a symbol of male helplessness and hopelessness, which is why the original ‚Äòim-potent‚Äô term struck disturbingly to the very heart of the problem. So yes, the man suffers. But what not only my postbag but recent studies 1 suggest is that the man‚Äôs partner suffers too. And that means that his ED can also become her (or conceivably, his) sexual and emotional dysfunction, and then become a relationship dysfunction rippling out through the whole of the couple‚Äôs lives.",

      "title": "The role of conditioning on heterosexual and homosexual partner preferences in rats",
      "abstract": "Partner preferences are expressed by many social species, including humans. They are commonly observed as selective contacts with an individual, more time spent together, and directed courtship behavior that leads to selective copulation. This review discusses the effect of conditioning on the development of heterosexual and homosexual partner preferences in rodents. Learned preferences may develop when a conditioned stimulus (CS) is associated in contingency with an unconditioned stimulus (UCS) that functions as a reinforcer. Consequently, an individual may display preference for a partner that bears a CS. Some UCS may be more or less reinforcing, depending on when they are experienced, and may be different for males and females. For example, it could be that, only during periods of early development, that stimuli associated with nurture and juvenile play become conditioned. In adulthood, other stimuli such as sexual reward, cohabitation, mild stress, or even pharmacological manipulations may function as reinforcers to condition partner preferences. Evolutionary biologists and psychologists must take into consideration the idea that an individual's experience with reward (i.e. sexual and pharmacological) can override presumably 'innate' mate choices (e.g. assortativeness and orientation) or mate strategies (e.g. monogamy or polygamy) by means of Pavlovian and operant contingencies. In fact, it is likely as innate to learn about the environment in ways that maximize reward and minimize aversive outcomes, making so-called 'proximate' causes (e.g. pleasure) ultimately more powerful predictors of social behavior and choice than so-called 'ultimate' causes (e.g. genetic or reproductive fitness).",

      "abstract": "Federal Rule of Evidence 412 prohibits the admission of evidence of the victim‚Äôs prior sexual behavior and sexual predisposition. There are, however, exceptions to the general prohibition. Significantly, evidence of the victim‚Äôs sexual behavior with the defendant may still be admissible if the defendant claims consent. And, in the context of a consent defense, not only is the victim‚Äôs physical conduct with the defendant potentially admissible, but so are her voiced sexual fantasies or dreams involving the defendant. Thus, woman‚Äôs thoughts, imagined or even unconscious, may be appropriated as evidence of consent under current rape shield laws. \r\n\r\nThe same rationale that was the foundation for the chastity requirement under traditional rape law also applies to the admissibility of women‚Äôs sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception‚Äîwomen who express sexual fantasies act outside social norms, have deficient character, and therefore such evidence is relevant to consent. Yet, sexual fantasies and dreams, based on imagined or even unconscious thoughts, do not make the fact of consent more or less likely. And, even though such evidence is not relevant to consent, courts have admitted it. This Article examines the admissibility of women‚Äôs sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception, traces its origins, highlights its application, argues that sexual fantasies and dreams should be excluded, and proposes a practical solution to address this problem.",

In this study, 459 unmarried, heterosexual undergraduate students (female = 328; male = 131), aged 18 to 25 years, from three universities completed an online questionnaire about their behaviors with technology and romantic relationships. In general, low attachment avoidance and high fear of negative evaluation from the dating partner predicted sending a sexually suggestive photo or video, sending a photo or video in one's underwear or lingerie, and sending a sexually suggestive text. High fear of negative evaluation predicted sending a nude photo or video as well as sending a text message propositioning sex. Low attachment avoidance, greater fear of negative evaluation, and greater social distress when dating were associated with sexting behaviors.",

      "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization, sexual health as a state of physical, emotional, mental, and social well-being in the context of sexuality, excludes the mere absence of disease, dysfunction, or infirmity. Thus a woman‚Äôs sexual function encompasses many areas; the construct of a normal function as a quality of life indicator often but not always conforms to the sexual response cycle, which is an endogenous process contributed by hormonal, vascular, neuronal, and psycho-emotional factors. Clinical and scientific evidence abounds about the physiological role of sex steroids viz. oestrogen, testosterone, and also progesterone in facilitating and maintaining the woman‚Äôs sexual parameters. The neurophysiology extends from the central and peripheral nervous systems to the targeted genital structures resulting in coordinated vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle relaxation, to be accompanied by pelvic vasocongestion, vaginal lubrication, and labial and clitoral engorgement. Any detrimental impact on this normal cycle of concerted responses can result in a functional impairment or ‚Äòfemale sexual dysfunction‚Äô (FSD). Sexual changes, psychogenic or organic, are common in women at any age; such complaints are frequently accompanied by quality-of-life concerns, varying levels of personal distress, anxiety, depression, and also fertility concerns in younger women. With FSD as a medically diagnosable entity, fewer drugs have met the safety and efficacy criteria for global approval and clinical utility. In order to appreciate the diverse range of FSD and the extent of its physical, physiological, and psychological implications, it is important to understand the fundamentals as well as the changing paradigms in a woman‚Äôs sexual functioning.",

      "abstract": "Consensual non-monogamy (CNM) is an overarching term for relationship orientations that differ based on the degree to which consensual sexual and emotional needs are fulfilled outside of a dyad. Despite the diversity of CNM relationship orientations and growing research examining CNM, it is unclear whether the sexual attitudes, inclination to approach/avoid sexual stimuli (i.e., erotophobia-erotophilia), and sociosexuality differ among individuals who identify with distinct CNM relationships. Further, as the agreements made in CNM relationships permit for extradyadic relationships, important differences might emerge for CNM and monogamous individuals. A convenience sample (N = 641) of individuals who self-identified as monogamous (n = 447), open (n = 80), polyamorous (n = 62), or swinger (n = 52) provided ratings of their sexual attitudes, erotophobia-erotophilia, and sociosexuality. Results indicated that swingers had the most permissive and instrumental attitudes, were the most erotophilic, and were the most unrestricted sexually. Conversely, monogamists scored the lowest on these traits. No differences emerged between relationship orientations for attitudes towards communion and birth control. These findings have important implications for sexuality research because they reinforce the view that some underlying differences and similarities exist between monogamous and CNM individuals.",

The subject was identified as a male at birth, and reared as such in a society in which the differentiation between male and female social roles is more incisive than is generally the case in modern Western society. The appearance at adolescence of gender-incongruent physical secondary sex characteristics, and the comprehensive physical and psychological examinations that were subsequently performed, showed ‚Äòhim‚Äô to be essentially feminine, however. Hence, after minor genital surgery, the subject was re-registered as a female and retested 16 months after her reassignment of sex. The subject showed marked improvement in the pattern of serious intrapsychic maladjustment evinced on initial testing, but a deterioration in social behaviour. These findings indicate that differences in psychosexual orientation and behaviour have a biological basis, and are not wholly learned and/or imprinted.",

      "abstract": "Considerable evidence demonstrates that perceiving oneself as an object of discrimination has negative consequences for mental health. However, little is known about whether this experience is more or less harmful in distinct phases of the life course, consistent with the life course principle of timing; or whether, in accord with the principle of lifespan development, it has long-term implications. We draw on longitudinal data addressing perceived workplace discrimination based on race/ethnicity and gender from the prospective Youth Development Study, covering early adulthood to midlife. Hierarchical linear modelling of the effects of discrimination on depressed mood indicates that both forms of discrimination have short-term (within life stages) and long-term (across stages) adverse effects on adult mental health. The impacts of perceived discrimination within stages on depressed mood appear to be greatest in the mid-30s and to weaken by midlife. Lingering effects of discrimination are more pronounced early on. These patterns are observed with controls for key time-varying negative experiences at work and personal socio-economic status, as well as invariant background characteristics (gender, race and parental socio-economic status). We consider these findings in relation to the dynamics of personal change in the context of occupational careers.",

The level of sexual functioning in younger years, the age and sex of the subject, as well as subjective and objective health ratings, each were found to make independent contributions to the total variance in sexual behavior. A much larger number of variables influenced sexual behavior in men than in women. In women relatively fewer variables ‚Äî past sexual enjoyment, marital status, and age ‚Äî were the most significant determinants. These data confirm previous observations that for women the presence of a sexually capable, socially sanctioned partner is a crucial determining influence.

Special attention is given to socioeconomic determinants. It is concluded that leisure satisfaction is higher for people who are older and have an optimistic outlook. They do not perceive a discrepancy between their actual and desired number of hours spent on leisure activities. Persons with a low leisure satisfaction are younger and have a pessimistic outlook. They perceive internal barriers (personal interest, capacity) that block them from spending more time on some leisure activities. Persons with medium leisure satisfaction perceive external barriers (time, money, circumstances) that block them from spending more time on some leisure activities. A tentative conclusion is that people from lower social classes more often belong to this latter group (medium leisure satisfaction), while people from middle social classes more often are characterized by a low leisure satisfaction. People from high social classes report most leisure satisfaction.",

      "abstract": "The development of a gay or lesbian identity (often referred to as the coming out process) has been widely studied in adults; however, few studies have examined the process in gay adolescents. Even among these studies, little research has investigated the effects of race or family values on the coming out process. A small sample of African-American, Hispanic/Latino, Asian/Eurasian, and Caucasian gay male adolescents participated in this survey study. Coming out was operationalized in three stages: sensitization; awareness with confusion, denial, guilt, and shame; and acceptance. The majority of respondents reported feeling different from other boys as children. The average age of first crush on another boy was 12.7 years; average age for realizing they were gay was 12.5 years. Most respondents reported feeling confused during their first awareness that they were gay. Denial of identity was a coping strategy for about half the sample. Traditional family values played a greater role in predicting coming out experiences than did race. Families were categorized as having high or low traditional values based upon (1) the importance of religion, (2) emphasis on marriage, (3) emphasis on having children, and (4) whether a non-English language was spoken in the home. Families with a strong emphasis on traditional values were perceived as less accepting of homosexuality than were the low traditional families. Those who work with adolescents need to be aware that some will recognize their sexual orientation as gay, lesbian, or bisexual during this time of their lives. These youth need support in the coming out process because they may encounter stigmatization and disapproval not only from the larger society, but also from their families, peers, and sometimes the gay community itself.",

We find support for the affect intensity rationale showing that women are relatively more affected in their satisfaction about life by the good or bad events or achievements occurring during their existence and less resilient (less likely to revert to their standard levels of happiness after a shock).

Sexual functioning requires an integration of neurological, vascular and endocrine systems and interpretation in the brain. As a complex biopsychosocial process, in addition to the biological factors, including health and psychological status of the person/couple (mood, personality traits), and psychosocial factors like religious beliefs, personal experience, ethnicity and socio-demographic conditions play an important role in sexual functioning and satisfaction. It is important to keep in mind that sexual satisfaction does not always correlate with sexual function. Furthermore, partnered sexual activity involves interpersonal relationships and the unique attitudes, needs and responses of each of the partners. A problem in any of these areas may lead to sexual complaints or dysfunctions [1].",

      "abstract": "Aging has a powerful impact on the quality of relationships and sexual functioning. The psychological impact of aging after midlife is a particularly timely topic given improved medical and psychological understanding of sexuality in both women and men, as well as more effective treatment for age-related sexual dysfunctions. It is time to dispel the stereotype of the midlife relationship as the continuation of a traditional heterosexual marriage with grown or almost grown children in order to more effectively address emotional and sexual issues arising in relationships. Regardless of the length or nature of the relationship, however, its quality is enhanced by emotional intimacy, autonomy without too much distance, an ability to manage stress and distractions by external factors, and achieving a satisfying sexual equilibrium. Perception of the quality of the primary relationship and sexuality is influenced by the other factors in a person's life. Thus, the relationship must be examined and issues must be addressed taking these external factors into consideration. Among the most powerful external factors is one's occupation or avocation, as it tends to strongly influence one's sense of identity, self-esteem, and self-worth in all areas of life. To understand and treat effects of aging on sexuality, it is important to address the three components of sexual desire: drive, beliefs/values, and motivation, as well as the sexual equilibrium within the primary relationship. It is also essential to understand how the physiological changes in male and female sexual functioning affect desire and equilibrium. Other health-related changes that occur with aging must be recognized and addressed, including the fact that the oldest of old women will outlive their corresponding male cohort. Treatment implications for these issues are discussed.",

      "abstract": "A questionnaire designed to measure subtle discrimination experi enced by professional women in the work place generated some unanticipated and unsolicited data which revealed a variety of forms of false consciousness among this group. Ninety-five (95) of the one hundred and forty (140) women who responded to a set of general, open-ended questions on the survey offered one or more comments that were either implicitly or explicitly critical of the relevance of feminist principles to their own employment experience and/or to the position of working women as a whole. For example, some respondents denied that women constituted a minority group. Of this group, a few argued that women had already achieved equality while others either suggested that innate differences between men and women accounted for differential treatment or that individual women solicited such treatment by their actions. A second group denied individual membership in the minority group. Professionalism (read de-feminization) was the personal factor most often identified as allowing these individuals to transcend group affiliation. Third, among those who did acknowledge discriminatory treatment, many failed to recognize the institutional basis of sexism, the pervasiveness of this form of prejudice, and/or the dangers of an apolitical response to this problem. Blaming individual males for the inequality experienced by women, claims that sexism is merely a minor and diminishing problem, and a propensity to inaction based, among other things, on a fear of being labeled a women's libber, are illustrative of this type of false consciousness.",

      "title": "Risk factors for suicidal behavior in adolescents.",
      "abstract": "Adolescent suicide is today a public health problem among the leading cause of mortality among adolescents and young adults. There seems to be many reasons for this increase (which has different trends in different populations), but associations have been found with increased substance abuse, television and video violence, socio-economic status and easy access to firearms. Gender differences have also been observed with crime, suicide and substance abuse higher among males, while eating disorder, depression and suicidal behavior more prevalent among females. This paper will review prevalence and incidence of adolescent suicidal behavior, socio-demographic and psychological risk factors, associated cognitive factors and socio-economic factors. Risk factors include previous suicide attempts, a history of others in the family who have been suicidal, mental illness, alcohol and drug use, and other self-destructive behaviors as well as consideration being given to hopelessness, hostility, negative self-concept and isolation. At the individual difference level, factors such as trait depression, anger and hostility, perfectionism and social sensitivity would seem critical variables, as would age, gender and intellectual functioning. Sociological and family-related factors may also be implicated including dysfunctional family organizations, a history of physical or psychological abuse (sexual abuse) and limited extent of social support networks. A frequently reported precipitating event of suicidal behavior is family adversity including rejection, separation and interpersonal conflict. At a socio-economic level it would seem essential to provide comprehensive document about the social and economic conditions from which the adolescent comes.",

      "abstract": "Bisexual people may appear to have more potential romantic partners than people only attracted to one gender (e.g., heterosexual, gay, lesbian people). However, bisexual people's dating choices are limited by non-bisexual people's reluctance to date bisexual people. Studies have indicated that some heterosexual, gay, and lesbian people are reluctant to date bisexual people, particularly bisexual men. We extend current understandings of gendered anti-bisexual bias through investigating heterosexual, bisexual, gay, and lesbian people's reported willingness to date within and outside of their sexual orientation groups. Participants (n = 1823) varying in sexual orientation completed measures regarding their willingness to engage in a romantic relationship with heterosexual, bisexual, gay, and lesbian individuals. Heterosexual and gay/lesbian people were less willing to date bisexual people than bisexual people were to date them, consistent with anti-bisexual bias rather than mere in-group preference. Preferences against dating bisexual men appeared particularly strong, even among bisexual women.",

Sexual disorders can also be consequences of other illnesses and/or their treatment and can manifest as the result of sexual trauma. In any case, a basic understanding of human sexuality is beneficial for clinical work, distinguished into three different dimensions (desire, reproduction, and attachment), all closely intertwined. This basic understanding also permeates the principles of sexual medical diagnostics and therapy, the couple dimension being of essential importance. As a result, an integrative approach in sexual medicine, taking somatic and psychosocial factors into account, makes it possible to deal with couple-related problems in the same way as somatic therapy options.",

However, many of these studies have not accounted for the sexual identification of the participants sampled and have been limited in their conceptualization of religiosity. The religious context may be a source of conflict for some sexual minority individuals. As such, additional research is needed to examine the relationship between sexual minority religiosity and mental health. One-hundred and six sexual minority young adults (ages 18‚Äì24) were surveyed to examine the relationship between a multidimensional understanding of religiosity and sexual orientation conflict, self-esteem, and depressive symptoms. While behavioral religiosity was generally not related to mental health outcomes, affective and cognitive measures of religiosity indicate both risk and protective benefit.

      "title": "Assessing Sexually Abused Children",
      "abstract": "Child sexual abuse is an event in which an adult is involved and the child is left confused, frightened and ashamed (Kempe, C.H. & Kempe, R., 1984). The child may have been hurt, or be excited, or both. If abuse has occurred over a prolonged period, the child may be flat, withdrawn and apathetic or angry, defiant and difficult. Some children and young people may also express their distress through self harm, or become anorexic, or run away to live on the streets. The emotional impact is what needs to be understood, what has happened in the individual's mind, if we are to intervene most effectively. Sexual abuse is of a different order from other forms of abuse, because of the linking up of sexuality and aggression. Such violence results in a very primitive destruction of the child's mind. Irving Kaufman (1989) used the evocative term 'soul murder' to describe emotional abuse. In sexual abuse, there is nearly always an element of physical abuse, but there is also serious emotional abuse. At one and the same time, the child's mind and body are being 'raped'. The child's body may recover fairly quickly once the abuse has ceased, but the mind is left profoundly traumatized. While we do not yet fully understand all that happens to the developing mind, the more we struggle to do so, the more damaging sexual abuse is revealed to be (Renvoize, J., 1983; Morris, M., 1982; Baker Miller, 1976).",

El objetivo de este estudio fue comprobar si esta tendencia se observa tambien en reclusos. Los resultados son similares a los observados en sujetos ‚Äúnormales‚Äù si bien el grado de hedonismo es mas alto en los reclusos. No se encontraron diferencias de edad ni sexo. Concluimos que cuanto mas agresiva es la conducta mas placentera es para el agresor, con la excepcion de los niveles mas elevados de agresividad.

In addiction, it has also documented that pleasure is a major factor in decision-making in social situations related to interpersonal aggression, and that people tend to make aggressive behavioural decisions as a function of the resulting pleasure. The present study tried to verify whether this trend was also found in inmates. The results were similar to the ones previously observed in ‚Äònormal‚Äô subjects, even though the degree of hedonicity was higher in the prisoners. No sex nor age differences were found.

      "title": "P-537 Psychological, Marital, and Sexual Well-being in South Asian Couples With a Subfertility Diagnosis: A Systematic Review",
      "abstract": "Abstract Study question How does the diagnosis of subfertility affect the psychological distress, marital satisfaction, and sexual well-being of couples in South Asia? Summary answer Subfertility significantly impacts couples‚Äô mental health and marital dynamics, with women experiencing greater distress due to societal stigma, emotional abuse, and lack of support. What is known already Subfertility affects millions globally, with South Asian societies placing high cultural value on fertility. Women often face severe stigma, leading to increased psychological distress, depression, and social isolation. Research suggests that female partners experience greater emotional burdens, reduced self-acceptance, and lower psychological flexibility than their male counterparts. Marital and sexual satisfaction are strongly linked to quality of life (QoL) in subfertile couples, yet only a minority of women report sexual satisfaction. Patriarchal traditions and misconceptions further exacerbate emotional distress. While coping strategies can improve well-being, there is limited data on the effect of infertility treatment on South Asian couples. Study design, size, duration A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed (Medline) and Google Scholar for studies published between January 2008 and October 2023. A total of 643 articles were retrieved, screened, and assessed for eligibility. The quality of included studies was evaluated using the GRADE tool, considering factors such as inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and risk of bias across selection, performance, attrition, and detection domains. Participants/materials, setting, methods Studies included in review focused on couples diagnosed with subfertility in South Asia. Articles were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The Boolean search strategy was applied in PubMed, while Google Scholar results were limited to the first five pages. Titles and abstracts were screened by a single reviewer, followed by full-text assessments. Data extraction focused on psychological distress, marital satisfaction, and sexual well-being. Eligible studies underwent quality assessment using the GRADE tool. Main results and the role of chance Out of 643 retrieved articles, 25 met the inclusion criteria. Nine studies reported that women experienced significantly higher psychological distress than men, often due to societal stigma, emotional abuse, and lack of support. Many faced symptoms of anxiety, depression, guilt, and social isolation. Fourteen studies examined factors influencing marital satisfaction, revealing that only 33% of women were satisfied with their sexual relationships. Poor education, deeply rooted misconceptions, and patriarchal cultural norms further exacerbated distress in women diagnosed with subfertility. Positive coping mechanisms, including emotional support, social networks, and spiritual coping, improved psychological resilience and overall well-being. Women who received counseling and partner support exhibited better marital satisfaction and emotional stability. Additionally, interventions targeting infertility-related stigma were associated with improved mental health outcomes and QoL. The risk of bias across studies varied, with some demonstrating methodological limitations. Statistical significance and effect sizes varied, with several studies emphasizing the role of psychosocial interventions in mitigating distress. Further research is needed to determine standardized interventions that can be implemented across diverse South Asian populations. Limitations, reasons for caution This review is limited by the heterogeneity of study methodologies and the lack of standardized assessments for psychological distress and marital satisfaction. Cultural differences across South Asian nations may also influence findings. Additionally, the review only includes published studies, potentially excluding relevant unpublished or non-English research. Wider implications of the findings Findings highlight urgent need for culturally tailored psychological support and counseling for subfertile couples in South Asia. Addressing social stigma and promoting positive coping strategies can improve mental health and marital well-being. Fertility education and awareness programs are crucial to mitigating misconceptions and reducing the emotional burden on affected couples. Trial registration number No",

      "abstract": "Abstract Previous evidence shows that heterosexual people perceive heterosexual status to be more fragile than homosexual status. However, research has not yet investigated whether sexual minorities have similar, or diverging, perceptions of the fragility of sexual orientation. With a sample that included 89 heterosexual and 80 sexual minority participants, we investigated the fragility of heterosexuality using a between-participants design in which participants indicated their agreement with gender neutral statements about the fragility of either heterosexual or homosexual status. Contrary to our expectations we found evidence of Fragile Heterosexuality perceptions regardless of participants‚Äô sexual orientation. Additionally, we explored the potential moderating effects of social-dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism and prejudice against gay/lesbian people on this Fragile Heterosexuality effect. For sexual minority participants, high levels of social dominance orientation moderated (i.e., increased) the perceived fragility of heterosexual identity relative to homosexual identity. No other inter-group ideology was a significant moderator. These findings highlight that heterosexuality is perceived as more fragile by both heterosexual and sexual minority individuals. Implications and possible avenues for future research are discussed.",

      "title": "The Effect of Feedback on Penile Tumescence in Sexually Functional Men",
      "abstract": "Abstract : Male erectile disorder (ED) impacts the sexual functioning of ten to twenty million men in the United States. Erectile disorder, as withother sexual dysfunctions, may be caused by, or associated with a number of diseases that impact the cardiovascular and nervous systems. However, men who have few physical problems may also experience the disorder due to psychological factors. Men who suffer from ED due to psychogenic factors are believed to differ from functional men in five key cognitive and behavioral domains. Barlow and Sbrocco (1996) used these differences to formulate a model of male sexual dysfunction that explicitly addresses the cognitive mechanisms involved in ED. The model proposes that a key point in the development of ED is whether or not a man feels challenged or threatened when experiencing a discrepancy between expected and actual performance. Men who are challenged by the experience typically have the skills necessary to identify and alleviate the discrepancy in performance. They are believed to use positive outcome expectancy and confidence to overcome suboptimal sexual performance and maintain function. In contrast, men who are threatened by discrepancies between expected and actual performance may expect a negative outcome and have little faith in their ability to sexually perform.",

      "abstract": "Lemah dalam berkomunikasi dan gagal dalam mengungkapkan pendapat atau apa yang ada dalam pikiran seseorang akan membuat individu tersebut merasa tertekan dan menimbulkan masalah dalam berhubungan sosial dengan orang lain. Kemampuan berkomunikasi dan penyesuaian diri yang baik dan efektif terutama sangat diperlukan oleh para remaja. Hal ini sesuai dengan salah satu tugas perkembangan masa remaja yang tersulit yaitu berhubungan dengan penyesuaian sosial. Masa remaja dikenal sebagai usia bermasalah, remaja dituntut berperilaku sesuai aturan kelompok, dimana aturan tersebut seringkali berbeda dengan cara, kebiasaan dan norma yang diterapkan oleh keluarga. Remaja harus cermat dalam membedakan yang benar dan salah. Aturan kelompok kadangkala memaksa sehingga remaja perlu berperilaku asertif untuk melindungi diri dari pergaulan yang tidak baik. Lebih dari 200 remaja perempuan meninggal setiap hari disebabkan komplikasi pengguguran, perilaku seks pranikah itu cenderung dilakukan karena pengaruh teman sebaya. Dari berbagai dampak yang ada dapat dilihat bahwa kerugian terbesar dialami remaja perempuan. Remaja perempuan kurang dapat berpikir logis disaat mendapat bujukan atau rayuan dari pacarnya, remaja perempuan juga perlu bersikap tegas terhadap bujukan atau pengaruh laki-laki untuk melakukan hubungan seks sebelum menikah. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui perbedaan asertifitas remaja ditinjau dari jenis kelamin.\r\nPenelitian ini merupakan penelitian kuantitatif. Sampel penelitian adalah remaja yang berusia antara 14-15 tahun, sedang menempuh pendidikan di tingkat SMP kelas III berjumlah 120 orang yang di ambil dengan menggunakan teknik quota sampling. Sedangkan metode pengumpulan data yang digunakan adalah skala likert yaitu skala perilaku asertif. Pengambilan data dilakukan pada tanggal 22 - 25 Februari 2011. Adapun metode analisis yang digunakan dalam penelitian ini adalah Independent sample t-test dengan program SPSS 13.00 for windows.\r\nBerdasarkan hasil penelitian yang dilakukan, diperoleh kesimpulan bahwa ada perbedaan asertifitas remaja yang sangat signifikan ditinjau dari jenis kelamin, laki-laki (157.78) sedangkan perempuan (147.63). Hasil uji hipotesis menunjukkan t = 2.925; p = 0.004. Dengan demikian hipotesis di terima, hasil ini menunjukkan bahwa terdapat perbedaan yang sangat signifikan asertifitas remaja laki-laki dan remaja perempuan. Dimana remaja laki-laki lebih asertif daripada remaja perempuan. Sedangkan pada tiap aspeknya, berdasarkan uji t-test diperoleh bahwa pada aspek mengungkapkan perasaan positif (t = 2.296; p = 0.023) menunjukkan adanya perbedaan yang signifikan antara laki-laki dan perempuan dalam mengungkapkan perasaan positif. Perbedaan yang sangat signifikan antara laki-laki dan perempuan terdapat pada aspek afirmasi diri (t = 2.810; p = 0.006) dan aspek mengungkapkan perasaan negatif (t = 3.178; p = 0.002).",

The sexual activities ranged from low (e.g., cuddling), moderate (e.g., kissing), to high (e.g., sexual intercourse) intensity. We found that most adolescents having sexual activities of low-to-moderate intensity with same-sex individuals also had them with other-sex individuals, and adolescents having other-sex contacts of low intensity often reported them nonexclusively. Furthermore, other-sex and same-sex sexual activities did not reliably distinguish between sexual orientation identities. Sex differences in these phenomena were absent or small. These findings suggest that many adolescents have low-intensity nonexclusive sexual behaviors.",

      "abstract": "For adult male survivors, a major obstacle to recovery is the popular image of masculinity. The widespread belief that the sexual abuse of boys is relatively uncommon means that male survivors will often minimise the effect the sexual abuse which they have suffered has had on them. The cultural and social dynamics that are at work in our society ensure that men develop a rigid and potentially unstable masculine identity that is buttressed at the expense of dehumanizing women, particularly denying and repressing their relationship to their mothers, their most important first attachment relationship. Fantasy can become a focus for the survivor's rage at being helpless and powerless when the abuse took place. Some of the men may not have concerns either around fantasies and/or about acting them out. They may simply internalize their experience and repress or split it off.",

      "abstract": "Abstract People with disabilities are ten times more likely to suffer from abuse than their typical peers. When lacking knowledge about abuse indicators, these persons are, evidently, unable to report it, which can lead to repeated abuse. Moreover, in many cases, these people do not know that they have the right to decide, refuse, be asked permission (every time), rethink a decision or change their minds. On the other hand, sexuality is often mistaken for sex. Actually, the concept of sexuality is much wider and includes identities, roles, intimacy, pleasure and spirituality. Sexual education and counseling must not be a one-time ‚Äútalk‚Äù (that usually takes place during puberty), but a process of communication, counseling and support which starts at early ages, continues during the school years and goes further, during adulthood. The emotional, psycho-sexual, social, ethical and spiritual aspects also continue their development in the adult life and it is only natural to be properly approached at these ages as well.",

Si bien el abuso sexual es una cuestion de salud fisica y mental para un individuo con muchas y variadas consecuencias, tambien se enfrenta a los aspectos de los primeros vinculos, los vinculos de apego, ya que suele tener lugar dentro del circulo familiar. A la luz de tres vinetas clinicas, el articulo discute el concepto de destructividad, tanto de forma general como especifica, en situaciones de abuso sexual, para proponer, finalmente, algunos puntos de atencion en torno al habla del nino durante el cuidado. Cabe senalar que el nino, independientemente de que hable o no, a menudo sigue estando psicotraumatizado. La destructividad se refiere a la naturaleza destructiva de un elemento vivo o no vivo y, mas generalmente, a la capacidad de destruir. En relacion con este concepto, podemos observar, en general, los llamados factores de gravedad y otros llamados factores de proteccion que pueden coexistir. Si los primeros son mas graves, hay una alta probabilidad de que los sintomas sean incapacitantes y duraderos, observando que pueden empeorar con el tiempo o aparecer de forma retardada. Si los factores de proteccion son significativos, entonces es mas probable que el nino experimente un trauma leve y una curacion mas o menos rapida.",

The child victim of sexual abuse, may be initially seen with specific or nonspecific signs and symptoms of the abuse. Moreover, these manifestations may be physical ailments directly referable to the injury, or, more commonly, they may represent symbolic behavioral manifestations of the injury.

      "abstract": "Development does not take place in isolation; close others form an important dyad for exploring interrelationships. To examine spousal interrelations in level and change of cognitive functioning in old age, the authors applied dynamic models to 11-year longitudinal data of, initially, 304 married couples from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing (aged 64-98 years at Time 1; M = 76 years). Findings revealed that perceptual speed for husbands predicted subsequent perceptual speed decline for wives (time lags of 1 year). There was little evidence for the opposite unidirectional effect or a bidirectional association between husbands and wives. Potential covariates (age, education, medical conditions, functional limitations, and depressive symptoms) did not account for differential lead-lag associations. A similar, though less pronounced, pattern was found for memory, which held except when functional limitations were controlled. Findings suggest that late-life cognitive development is not solely a product of intraindividual resources and are consistent with conceptual notions that development actively influences, and is influenced by, contextual factors such as close relationships. The authors discuss possible underlying mechanisms and further steps to substantiate the findings.",

Across 10 world regions ( N = 17,837), using multiple indicators of permissive sexuality, we attempted to replicate and extend recent work on these questions. Unrestricted sociosexuality was consistently linked to positive Models of Self in men but much less so among women. Self-reports of having an unfaithful sexual personality were linked to dismissing attachment in both men and women, though additional associations were observed with fearful attachment suggesting infidelity as a form of sexual permissiveness may be more closely associated with negative Models of Other. A measure of short-term mating interests was more strongly linked to dismissing attachment in men than in women. Engaging in short-term mate poaching (i.e., stealing another person‚Äôs partner for a brief affair) was linked with low overall attachment security in women but not in men. Many of the revealed associations between attachment and sexuality were relatively small in size, and some appeared to be localized to Westernized cultures.",

      "abstract": "Commonly debated in the public sector as well as in academic circles and scientific research, the basic concepts of the phenomenon of sexual orientation are being confused or simply recognized inadequately. This especially affects the conceptual understanding of sexual behaviour, sexual orientation, but also sexual identification and sexual identity. Homosexual behaviour does not have to correspond to or be the cause of homosexual orientation. Homosexual behaviour may not necessarily be an indication of homosexual orientation. Homosexual orientation has deeper biological roots than homosexual behaviour, which, in humans, is strongly influenced by culture. The phenomenon of sexual orientation does not have to be perceived as a positively dichotomous occurrence anymore. Quite the opposite, it seems it is a continuum of various sexual orientations that can have their own specific biological and socio-cultural roots. The psychological concept of the sexual identi¬≠fication process suggests there can be a discrepancy between the psychological and the biological aspect of a single phenomenon, a discrepancy between sexual orientation [with no regard to behaviour] and sexual identification. The second part of the article seeks to outline the complex issue of gender conformity and nonconformity, which is closely related to the topic of homosexual orientation and, furthermore, is significantly overshadowed hy numerous 'popular myths', common among laymen. ln gender nonconformity we distinguish between Childhood Gender Nonconformity [CGN] appearing before puberty and Continuous Gender Identity [CGI]. Childhood gender nonconformity is one of the most common [although not completely accurate] predictors of future homosexual orientation. As far as the 'popular myths' connected withthis issue are concerned, the most widespread yet overly simplified idea is that every homosexually oriented male is positioned nearer to the feminine end of the masculinity-femininity scale. The article aims to illustrate that the problem is in reality more complex: actually, it is possible to distinguish more types of male homosexual orientation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual dimorphisms in weaponry and aggression are common in species in which one sex (usually males) competes for access to mates or resources necessary for reproduction ‚Äì sexually dimorphic weaponry and aggression, in other words, are frequently the result of intrasexual selection. In snapping shrimp, the major chela (snapping claw) can be a deadly weapon, and males of many species have larger chelae than females, a pattern readily interpreted as resulting from intrasexual selection. Thus, males might be expected to show more sex‚Äêspecific aggression than females, and be more aggressive overall. We tested these predictions in two species of snapping shrimp in a territorial defense context. Neither of these predictions was supported: in both species, females, but not males, engaged in sex‚Äêspecific aggression and females were more aggressive than males overall. These contrasting sexual dimorphisms ‚Äì larger weaponry in males but higher aggression in females ‚Äì highlight the importance of considering the function of weaponry and aggression in contexts other than direct competitions over mates. In addition, species differences in the degree of sexual dimorphism in chela size were due to differences in female, not male, chela size, and the species with greater sexual dimorphism in weaponry was significantly less aggressive overall; also, while paired and solitary males did not differ in residual chela size, for the species with greater sexual dimorphism, females carrying embryos had smaller residual chela sizes. These results suggest that understanding the sexual dimorphisms in weaponry and aggression in snapping shrimp requires understanding the relative costs and benefits of both in females as well as males.",

      "abstract": "Young women (N = 64) and men (N = 52) were asked to imagine discovering that their romantic partner had been sexually unfaithful. Fewer men than women gave positive endorsements to sets of aggressive actions against the unfaithful partner and against the rival. Gender differences did not appear in the motive for taking action against the rival, but more men than women endorsed releasing frustration as the motive for aggressive action against the partner. The genders appeared equally interested in maintaining the relationship with the unfaithful partner, preventing future infidelity, and attracting another partner. More men than women said they were uncertain about their partner's sexual fidelity. The results were interpreted as evidence that women are devalued more than men by an act of sexual infidelity, resulting in men's greater frustration with the partner's transgression but relative behavioral indifference to both the transgressing partner and rival. Men's greater uncertainty about a partner's infidelity may provide the basis for, as suggested by other data, men's greater tendency to ensure that a partner's infidelity and consequent devaluation never occur. ¬© 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

Although beneÔ¨Åcial in the short run it is not surprising that long term stress can disturb the natural equilibrium state of an animal, given it‚Äô s effects on the extended range of pararameters (systemic, endocrinological, cellular, molecular. The most interesting observation however was that females consistently showed an opposite or different effect than males. With regard to the question of which sex is more or less susceptible to stress, it appears this answer is thus less clear-cut than we would hope. While stress seems to affect transcriptional activity and cellular signal transduction in males, females appear more vulnerable to the negative stress effects on cell birth and/or survival. The manner in which HPA axis activity is affected in males and females is a testimony to this gender-differential regulation, since both sexes seem to indicate prolonged HPA axis overactivity, albeit in a sex-speciÔ¨Åc manner. The question we should therefore focus on is not which sex is more vulnerable, but how do the sexes differ in their vulnerabilities. It is more insight into this matter that may ultimately lead to way to new and improved drug development that considers sex speciÔ¨Åc neural circuits implicated in stress response regulation. Perhaps one day we can even speak of customized drug design, targeted to meet gender speciÔ¨Åc disturbances.",

      "title": "SOCIAL HEALTH IN STUDIES ON SOCIAL TIES AS A CONDITION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH (FOREIGN STUDIES REVIEW)",
      "abstract": "The issue of studying social health in the context of the older generation involvement in social relations is relevant. We analyze numerous foreign studies on the correlation of social relations involvement, physical and mental health. Foreign studies on mortality in many industrialized countries consistently show that people with the least involvement in social ties are more likely to die than those who are more involved. Social connections affect health through behavioral, psychosocial and physiological mechanisms. Behavioral mechanisms are revealed through involvement in formal (for example, religious organizations) and informal (for example, friends and relatives) social ties. A link has been established with more positive health behaviors over a ten-year period. Psychosocial mechanisms are manifested through social support that promotes mental and physical health. Physiological mechanisms act through psychosomatic manifestations. Studies show that conflicted relationships or lack of social support can exacerbate the symptoms of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The concept of ‚Äúsocial health‚Äù as one of the possible dimensions of social support is practically not represented in academic publications. The foreign concept of social health has not acquired the status of an academic scientific theory to date. This requires further research, including a systematic analysis of the literature, the development of clear definitions and the operationalization of key constructs.",

Since sexual attraction to both genders was considered normal, the main divisions concerned age, social status, and role: females and smooth males (boys 12‚Äì18) were desirable objects, hairy males (men) undesirable; the active partner was penetrative and thus masculine, the passive partner penetrated and thus female or effeminate, so that it was shameful and improper, slavish, and arguably unnatural for free males of any age to play the passive role whether for a price or voluntarily except in certain initiatory or military contexts institutionalized in some communities. No comparable sanctions applied to the active partner.",

      "title": "Recognition of Sexual Abuse in Children",
      "abstract": "Although sexual abuse of children has likely been present for ages, its recognition in the United States and other countries has dramatically increased in the past 5 years. Reported cases, which represent an unknown fraction of actual cases, now account for approximately 25% of all abuse and neglect reports. Local, county, and state agencies are staggering under the load, and many are relying heavily on pediatricians to assist them in their work. DEFINITION Sexual abuse can be defined as the engaging of a child in sexual activites that the child does not understand, to which the child cannot give informed consent, or which violate the social taboos of society. This definition is broad and includes intrafamilial and extrafamilial forms and all types of sexual activities (eg, exhibitionism, fondling, child pornography, oral, anal, and genital sexual contact). The interface between \"normal sexual exploratory behavior\" and \"sexual abuse\" is not clearly defined. Pediatricians should, however, use common sense. If two 4-year-old children are found to be playing without clothes, touching each others' genitals and giggling, there is probably little to worry about. The same is true if two 15-year-old adolescents are discovered together. A probably exists if the 15-year-old child (some states set statutory 2- to 4-year limits within which sexual activities are not to be considered abuse) or if one 4-year-old child is engaging in fellatio or attempting intercourse with another preschool-aged child.",

      "abstract": "Elevated social anxiety (SA) is linked to issues with emotional distress, substance use, and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Notwithstanding concerns of how sexuality has been defined in the extant literature, emerging evidence suggests that the prevalence of SA and related challenges may be disproportionately present among sexual minorities, including lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals (LGBs). This trend may be especially relevant within the developmental context of emerging adulthood, an important period for development of sexual identity, and a time when individuals are already predisposed to heightened feelings of SA. The present study examined the relationship between sexual orientation (measured using sexual identity, sexual attraction, and past romantic and sexual behavior) and social anxiety (related to social interaction and social performance) among emerging adults. minority sexual identities [Welch's F(5,48.08) = 5.56, p = .002, Œ∑p2 = .02.], same-sex attraction [Welch's F(4,108.06) = 11.27, p &lt; .001, Œ∑p2 = .04], and same-sex romantic [Welch's F(5,85.91) = 6.88, p &lt; .001, Œ∑p2 = .03] and sexual experiences[F(5,61.95) = 8.88, p &lt; .001, Œ∑p2 = .04], particularly among those who indicated attraction to multiple sexes. Findings support research that indicates that sexual minority adults experience higher levels of SA than majority (i.e., heterosexual, opposite-sex oriented) adults, and that assessment of sexuality may reflect number of sexual minorities identified. Future directions including intersections of race/ethnicity and gender are discussed.",

The habitual self‚Äìmutilators I have seen have been predominantly females between the ages of 15 and 40. In the majority, constitutional and environmental factors have interacted in such a way as not to lend support to an either/or interpretation regarding etiology. Where only one causative factor seems to be operative, it has more often been the environmental. In the latter instance, the family environment has generally been far worse than \"unfavorable\": abuse, physical or sexual (or both), has been the order of the day‚Äìoften in ways that merit characterization as \"grotesque\" or \"inhuman\" (Grunebaum & Klerman. 1967). The timing of the self‚Äìmutilative acts coincides with the paramenstrual (i.e. just before or just during) part of the cycle in many instances, but there appear to be equally many instances where the immediate precipitating factor occurred randomly in relation to the menses and took the form of an abrupt loss (rejection in a love relationship; therapists' vacation, etc.).",

There is no discussing the issue of homosexuality in psychoanalysis without being aware of ideological influences on psychoanalytic thought, political correctness, bias, and prejudice‚Äîthe latter sometimes denied and acted out. Psychoanalysts made many assertions about homosexuality and bisexuality in men and women and usually disregarded the problem of selection bias. The behavioural genetic literature is quite relevant for psychoanalysis, however, and genetic influences on homosexual orientation‚Äîat least in men‚Äîseems to be important in subgroups.

      "abstract": "Background: The prevalence of vaginismus ranges from 1-6%, and the ratio becomes 5%-17% in clinical setting, although it varies widely worldwide. The main cause of vaginismus is not known, but is often considered multifactorial. This paper aims to describe the factors that contribute to vaginismus. Case: A 26 years old, married woman, health practitioner presented with the complaint of not being able to have sexual intercourse. About 1 month ago, since marriage, the patient was unable to have sexual intercourse with her husband. The patient feels guilty and anxious because of the inability to please her husband. The patient's father was very dominant and was a \"religious\" type of parent who always gave advice with religious aspects regarding all matters. The patient's mother was a nervous person and always said that what the father said was a law that had to be obeyed. Likewise, talk about sex is a taboo topic of discussion and is considered embarrassing. Discussion: Many factors need to be explored related vaginismus. In the case, the biological aspect can be ruled out because the patient has consulted with the ob-gyn doctor. from the psychological aspect; perceptions, attitudes and attitudes towards sex and the values ‚Äã‚Äãheld by parents contribute to vaginismus in this patient. Conclusion: a therapeutic approach which focuses on all aspects promises quite good therapeutic outcomes.",

The low-achieving female and the housewife were rated as equally ‚Äúfeminine.‚Äù When the couple were in the same field, the husband was rated as more ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù than when they were in different fields. Male raters tended to see the husband as less ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù when his wife was successful; female raters saw him as less ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù when his wife was unsuccessful. When the husband was rated second, he was rated as more ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù than when he was rated first.

      "abstract": "Abstract The importance of assessing individuals in a marital conflict is seen as vital. The theoretical position that there are big ‚ÄòT‚Äô and little ‚Äòt‚Äô individuals indicated that some members of the relationship are more eager for thrill seeking and being outgoing while little ‚Äòt‚Äô individuals are more eager for harmony and conservative personality traits. This has long been established. There are extremes of this but also these traits are on a continuum. While opposites attract in a relationship, the more individuals have in common, the more likely the marital relationship will work except in one area, that of seeking control or dominance. Here, opposites are likely to be more successful. Areas where there are likely to be difficulties between big ‚ÄòT‚Äô and little ‚Äòt‚Äô individuals are in the rates of infidelity where big T's may predominate, also in sexual dissatisfaction and problems, attitudes to love, marital abuse and spouse abuse, child rearing issues, drug and alcohol abuse, the handling of money, household chores and division of labour, recreation interests, and religious differences. While not all of these may come into conflict or may be part of a big ‚ÄòT‚Äô or little ‚Äòt‚Äô personality, there is a weighing in one direction rather than in the other. In order for rehabilitation between marital partners, it is important for each to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the other's personality, be they big ‚ÄòT‚Äô or little ‚Äòt‚Äô individuals. Approaches by counsellors, psychologists to these individual differences are discussed.",

Whilst considerable attention has been paid to the neurocognitive processes contributing to anomalous perceptions amongst older adults, less is known about the social factors (e.g. social isolation, loneliness). Furthermore, it is unknown whether loneliness and social isolation are associated with different types of anomalous perceptions, including anomalous body-centred self-experiences and anomalous external experiences.This study examined the cross-sectional relationships between loneliness, objective social isolation, and anomalous perceptions in a sample of community-dwelling older adults (N = 242, Mage = 71.87 ¬± 7.73, range = 52-91, 67.8% female) using structural equation modelling.Higher levels of loneliness were associated with more anomalous body-centred self-experiences and anomalous external experiences. Those reporting more loneliness also reported higher levels of anxiety and depression; however, the relationship between loneliness and anomalous perceptions was not mediated by these factors. Social disconnection from a religious group was associated with more anomalous external experiences and being married/living with a partner was associated with more anomalous body-centred self-experiences.These findings suggest that loneliness and social isolation have differential associations with anomalous perceptions in older adults and provide additional evidence that attending to loneliness in older adults is important.",

      "abstract": "Should intimates respond to their interpersonal mistakes with self-criticism or with self-compassion? Although it is reasonable to expect self-compassion to benefit relationships by promoting self-esteem, it is also reasonable to expect self-compassion to hurt relationships by removing intimates' motivation to correct their interpersonal mistakes. Two correlational studies, 1 experiment, and 1 longitudinal study demonstrated that whether self-compassion helps or hurts relationships depends on the presence versus absence of dispositional sources of the motivation to correct interpersonal mistakes. Among men, the implications of self-compassion were moderated by conscientiousness. Among men high in conscientiousness, self-compassion was associated with greater motivation to correct interpersonal mistakes (Studies 1 and 3), observations of more constructive problem-solving behaviors (Study 2), reports of more accommodation (Study 3), and fewer declines in marital satisfaction that were mediated by decreases in interpersonal problem severity (Study 4); among men low in conscientiousness, self-compassion was associated with these outcomes in the opposite direction. Among women, in contrast, likely because women are inherently more motivated than men to preserve their relationships for cultural and/or biological reasons, self-compassion was never harmful to the relationship. Instead, women's self-compassion was positively associated with the motivation to correct their interpersonal mistakes (Study 1) and changes in relationship satisfaction (Study 4), regardless of conscientiousness. Accordingly, theoretical descriptions of the implications of self-promoting thoughts for relationships may be most complete to the extent that they consider the presence versus absence of other sources of the motivation to correct interpersonal mistakes.",

      "title": "Why Do Men Prefer Nice Women? Gender Typicality Mediates the Effect of Responsiveness on Perceived Attractiveness in Initial Acquaintanceships",
      "abstract": "Responsiveness may signal to a potential partner that one is concerned with her or his welfare, and may therefore increase sexual interest in this person. Research shows, however, that this proposition holds true for men, but not for women. In three studies, one observational and two experimental, we explored a potential mechanism that explains why men and women diverge in their sexual reactions to a responsive opposite-sex stranger. Studies 1 and 2 showed that men, but not women, perceived a responsive stranger as more gender typical (masculine/feminine) and, in turn, as more attractive. Study 3 revealed that responsiveness increased men‚Äôs perception of partner‚Äôs femininity. This, in turn, was associated with higher sexual arousal, which was, in turn, linked to greater partner attractiveness and greater desire for a long-term relationship. These findings suggest that whether responsiveness affects perceptions of partner attractiveness varies in individuals, depending on the contextually based meaning of responsiveness.",

      "abstract": "En el numero anterior tematizamos la moral, el derecho e incluso algunas normas deontologicas respecto del aborto no punible (ANP). La violacion, la conducta respecto del embarazo resultante, el trato otorgado a quienes proponen y a quienes niegan el aborto por esta causa y la autocensura sobre el tema comparten el denominador comun de la violencia. Es violento todo comportamiento voluntario que quebranta lo razonable, se impone mediante maltratos, presion fisica, psicologica o moral y ofende, amenaza o dana la integridad de individuos, seres o personas. Asume variedades que se vinculan y potencian. Se ejerce violencia directa fisica y/o verbal cuando un emisor agrede fisica o mentalmente a alguien o a algo. Tal el caso del abuso de autoridad. Se acepta que existe una violencia indirecta, de contenido simbolico, que admite representaciones culturales y estructurales. Las comunidades comparten argumentos compuestos por mandatos emocionales que se sintetizan en ‚Äúmanifiestos‚Äú culturales. Los elementos violentos que pudieran contener originan la violencia cultural, que ofrecen premisas para justificar presiones, criticas o aun amenazas que los ‚Äúguardianes o custodios del ideario grupal‚Äù aplican a quienes desacuerdan con los preceptos. Las imposiciones son capaces de silenciar opiniones de quienes temen ser sancionados y asi, se autocensuran. El establecimiento de normas basadas en los conceptos antecitados genera la violencia estructural. Esta legitima agresiones de todo tenor como actos de ‚Äújusticia‚Äù. Las posturas extremas en pos de ‚Äúintereses superiores‚Äù (alguna fe religiosa o creencia politica) que no admiten disenso ni desacuerdo aceptan como ‚Äúexcusa‚Äù de la violencia la existencia de ‚Äúpasiones desbordadas‚Äù. Estos paradigmas de violencia son capaces de impulsar guerras santas o atentados terroristas y provocar hambre, miseria, enfermedad o incluso la muerte de semejantes. La violencia directa no es innata. Emerge en un pot pourri socio-cultural como producto personalizado, aprendido y aplicado en escenarios donde el hecho se defiende y justifica, contenido en circulos viciosos de dificil solucion1 . ‚ÄúEl hombre...es lo que la educacion le hace ser‚Äù, aseguro Kant. Carente de sostenes cultural y estructural solo cabe a la violencia rechazo y condena. Hoy, la condicion esencial del ser es la autonomia, la individualidad del sujeto se considera sustantiva y se insiste en fundar la responsabilidad personal en la pretendida, meneada, exigida y manoseada libertad. Los argumentos racionales para la toma de decisiones, son necesarios en este contexto. Aunque sobran disensos, cabe preguntarse si alguna violencia responde a deseos ‚Äúsecretos‚Äù de alguna comunidad2. El dictum resulta aun indiscutible.",

      "abstract": "A number of surveys have by now provided information about the relative risk of persons from various backgrounds to experience sexual abuse during childhood. Interestingly, they are fairly uniform in failing to find differences in rates according to social class or race. However, several other factors have emerged from community studies as being consistently associated with higher risk for abuse: (a) when a child lives without one of the biological parents; (b) when the mother is unavailable to the child either as a result of employment outside the home or disability and illness; (c) when the child reports that the parents' marriage is unhappy or conflictual; (d) when the child reports having a poor relationship with the parents or being subject to extremely punitive discipline or child abuse; (e) when the child reports having a stepfather. The article draws some implications from these findings and makes recommendations for ways to improve subsequent studies of risk factors.",

      "title": "Child Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "The sexual abuse of children is not a new phenomenon, but the traumatic short- and long-term mental health consequences make it essential to study and, ultimately, prevent. The labels for child sexual abuse (CSA) vary and have changed over time, examples being ‚Äúchild sexual abuse,‚Äù ‚Äúchild sexual assault,‚Äù ‚Äúchild sexual exploitation‚Äù and ‚Äúunwanted sexual experiences.‚Äù Each has slightly different meanings and implications. Researchers, practitioners, criminal justice personnel, and policymakers also differ on how to define other aspects of CSA (e.g., age of the child, age differential between child and offender, what acts constitute CSA [touch or penetration only, or non-touch such as exposure to pornography], and risk factors that may become targets of prevention strategies). Such definitional debates impact all aspects of studying the concept, such as examining prevalence, assessment, and clinical interventions. Whether the perpetrators are known to the child (true in the majority of cases) or are strangers affects the length of time that the child is victimized sexually and whether and how they disclose the abuse. The sexual abuse of boys, while a relatively small proportion of sexual victimizations, was not given the attention it warranted until relatively recently. Perpetrators are both males and females (an estimated 20 percent), but the type of CSA differs based on the sex of the offender. Special circumstances in which CSA occurs include the abuse of children in institutions and the CSA of children with disabilities. Disclosing CSA is difficult for many children and, rather than directly disclosing, many mention the abuse indirectly or much later on. Once disclosed, intervention typically consists of child protection services assessment and trauma-focused counseling. Child advocacy centers (CACs) have become the standard agencies to investigate and support CSA victims and non-offending family members. There are a number of ways to provide CSA prevention programs, such as media education, but the most common approach is educating children about the risks and teaching them strategies that may assist them in avoiding abusers or seeking assistance early on. The launch of the Internet has introduced new ways to sexually abuse children, with easier access to child pornography, abuse in real time, and trafficking children for commercial sexual exploitation.",

      "abstract": "Although family should be the basis for the development and formation of a child's personality, violence is mostly done in the family, and remains undiscovered for a long time. The real number of abused children is much more than that displayed in the registered cases. The secrecy of the problem is an important feature of this phenomenon. Families in which abuse takes place are mostly isolated. Social isolation does not come about by chance; secrecy is usually encouraged by an abuser to control over famoly members. In most cases, social reaction to violence is late, inadequate and focused on the consequences, but not on the causes. \"Abuse implies an act of execution that directly inflicts damage, while neglect implies an act of non-fulfillment of something that is necessary for the well-being of a child\". The most common forms of domestic violence are physical, emotional abuse in the presence of violence against the mother, and in a lesser extent sexual abuse. In addition, there is physical, emotional, educational and medical neglect. The presence of violence against the mother and the feeling of impotence leave the same consequences as the endured violence. It is considered that children living in violent families are likely to live under cumulative stress. Traumatic responses include a wide range of conditions from acute stress reactions through post-traumatic stress disorder to complex long-lasting, repeated trauma syndrome. All children will not react to this kind of experience in the same way, with the protective and risk factors in developmental psychopathology having a significant role to play. Because of their developmental vulnerability and dependency, children are at greater risk of violence than adults. Researches point to the need for a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and prevention of child abuse, with greater interaction between health institutions, relevant centers for social work, police, court, government and non-governmental sector, and the existence of adequate family and criminal laws.",

Several themes emerged from the data. First, males‚Äô and females‚Äô judgments of what members of the opposite-sex seek were generally accurate. Second, males and females both feel that they fall short of perceived opposite-sex expectations in a few areas.

      "title": "Pornographic Films and Unconscious Homosexual Desires: An Hypothesis",
      "abstract": "The possibility that heterosexual behavior may serve to gratify unconscious homosexual desires has been noted. Blanchard (1959) , for example, discussed group rape and noted that the sharing of a female for sexual purposes in one another's presence might well gratify unconscious homosexual desires of the males cornmicting the sexual assault. Men who have certain heterosexual preferences (such as anal intercourse or female partners who have masculine characteristics) may also be gratifying unconscious homosexual desires. The purpose of this paper is to suggest that a similar inference could be made about males who habitually attend heterosexual pornographic films. In a typical cinema in which pornographic films are shown, the audience is usually completely male, alchough no studies of the composiuon af audiences have been p u b lished. Most likely, a man watches these films in the presence of other men. If there is a period of live entertainment (dancing or sexual intercourse), the men typically move closer to the front for this, thereby sitting in close proximity. The content of pornographic films emphasizes close-up views of penises. Fellatio is prominent. All ejaculations are shown and the semen visible. There are also close-up views of the genital areas during intercourse. Aside from a few views of the female face and breast, the content is very similar to that of homosexual films, in which views of fellatio and intercourse also comprise most of the film. Heterosexual films also contain episodes in which one female services several males at one time, with a combination of fellatio, vaginal intercourse, and anal inrercourse. In these scenes, several men are sharing the same female, much as occurs in group rape, but of course without the use of force on an unwilling female. The audience, though not active participants, may be seen as passive participants. The theme of heterosexual pornographic films is that the males get pleasure. The females, though supposed to be enjoying the sexual activity, are used for male gratification. The films may be conceptualized as gloriFying the male penis and the male orgasm If it is correct to suspect that heterosexual pornographic films do gratify unconscious homosexual desires, then it might be hypothesized that males who habitually watch such films would give evidence of unconscious concerns as manifest, for example, in sexual impotency or on objective tests of unconscious homosexual desires that have been devised (Lester, 1974). Such studies have not yet been conducted.",

These issues can include diminished or lack of desire for sex, difficulty with arousal and sexual pleasure, inability to orgasm, and pain with sex. Causes of sexual health issues can be complex and multifaceted; therefore, a holistic perspective, in which all potential factors are considered, is warranted. Despite the prevalence of women's sexual health issues, discussion by providers is often absent or limited to avoidance of sexually transmitted infections or unwanted pregnancies. Health care providers may feel they do not have the time or resources to address sexual health problems. This article provides a sexual health assessment approach using a model of sexual health whereby sociocultural factors are given priority, followed by factors related to partner and relationships, psychological factors, and finally medical factors.",

      "abstract": "With increasing awareness of potential differences of autism presentation in nonmale versus male individuals, this review summarizes the rapidly evolving literature on sex and gender impacts on autism across nosology, behavioural presentation, developmental change and contextual recognition biases.Most studies have not differentiated sex versus gender impacts. Regarding behavioural presentation, measurement invariance across sex/gender was found in several standard measures. On this basis, diagnosed females overall showed lower restricted/repetitive behaviour/interests/activities (RRBI) than males, with small and variable effects depending on age, developmental level and kinds of RRBI. Differences insufficiently captured by standard measures may include autistic females displaying female-gender-typical narrow interests, higher social attention, linguistic abilities, motivation for friendship and more camouflaging than autistic males. Regarding developmental change, diagnosed young girls were more likely to have better cognitive development, less intense autistic symptoms and reduction of symptoms over time. Difficulties in adaptive functioning and social challenges, however, may emerge more for females in adolescence. Regarding diagnosis, general expectancy biases and gender-stereotypes may impede timely recognition of autism in females.Appreciating the multilevel sex and gender impacts on presentation, development, and diagnosis is key to sex-equitable and gender-equitable care for autistic individuals. A holistic approach to understanding the person in the contexts of sex and gender is essential for timely and accurate diagnosis and support.",

      "title": "Body Image in a Sexual Context : The Relationship between Body Image and Sexual Experiences",
      "abstract": "Given the large sociocultural emphasis on appearance and the widespread incidence of a negative body image in current society, scientific understanding of its potential psychological and physical health consequences, including sexual problems, is now of particular importance. The value of understanding the way body image and sexual experiences are linked lies eventually in using that knowledge to improve mental health care in the context of sexual problems. The aim of this thesis was to answer the following questions: Which aspects of body image are most relevant in the context of sexual experiences? And what are important mechanisms or mediating variables by which body image affects sexual experiences? To answer these questions, a literature review was conducted first. The resultsindicated that women‚Äôs body concerns are related to decreased sexual functioning and may interfere with sexual pleasure, sexual satisfaction, and sexual behavior.Negative cognitions about one‚Äôs physical appearance and self-consciousness during sexual activity seem to be key factors in understanding the relationships between body image and sexual experiences. The existing research, however, turned out to be limited in terms of attention to positive aspects of body image and sexual experiences, distinguishing general body image (i.e., one‚Äôs general feelings and evaluations about one‚Äôs body without specifying a particular situational context)from body image in a sexual context, research in males, and incorporating partner-related cognitions and evaluations. These gaps in the existing literature were addressed in five online survey studies in samples of Dutch college students. The results indicated that a positive general body image may prevent exaggerated self-consciousness of one‚Äôs body in a sexual context, which in turn facilitates positive sexual experiences. Furthermore, (positive) body image was found to be equally strongly associated with sexual experiences in men as in women. Lastly, romantic attachment and perceived relationship quality were found to be meaningfully related to positive body image and sexual experiences. With respect to the main questions of this thesis, it can be concluded that body-related cognitions and evaluations are the most relevant body features in the context of sexual experiences. Whereas negative body cognitions and evaluations are related to sexual problems and dissatisfying sexual experiences, positive body cognitions and evaluations are uniquely related to positive and satisfying sexual experiences. Cognitions and self-consciousness of one‚Äôs body during sexual activity serve as an important mechanism by which body image affects sexual experiences. Negative body evaluations may result in exaggerated self-consciousness of one‚Äôs body in a sexual context which may be distracting, thereby interfering with pleasure of the experience and sexual satisfaction. On the other hand, positive body evaluations may prevent distraction by negative appearance-related thoughts during sexual activity, which in turn facilitates focusing on sexual pleasure and positive sexual experiences. Besides, partner-related cognitions and evaluations, such as romantic attachment and perceived relationship quality, are meaningfully related to positive body image and sexual experiences. The findings of this thesis show the importance of specific attention for positive body image with potentially fruitful practical implications in the context of clinical treatment of sexual problems.",

      "abstract": "Although bisexual men report lower levels of mental health relative to gay men, few studies have examined the factors that contribute to bisexual men's mental health. Bisexual men are less likely to disclose, and more likely to conceal (i.e., a desire to hide), their sexual orientation than gay men. Theory suggests that this may adversely impact their mental health. This report examined the factors associated with disclosure and with concealment of sexual orientation, the association of disclosure and concealment with mental health, and the potential mediators (i.e., internalized homophobia, social support) of this association with mental health.An ethnically diverse sample of 203 non-gay-identified, behaviorally bisexual men who do not disclose their same-sex behavior to their female partners were recruited in New York City to complete a single set of self-report measures.Concealment was associated with higher income, a heterosexual identification, living with a wife or girlfriend, more frequent sex with women, and less frequent sex with men. Greater concealment, but not disclosure to friends and family, was significantly associated with lower levels of mental health. Multiple mediation analyses revealed that both internalized homophobia and general emotional support significantly mediated the association between concealment and mental health.The findings demonstrate that concealment and disclosure are independent constructs among bisexual men. Further, they suggest that interventions addressing concerns about concealment, emotional support, and internalized homophobia may be more beneficial for increasing the mental health of bisexual men than those focused on promoting disclosure.",

      "abstract": "Review of the relevant literature indicates that girls, relative to boys, have less confidence in their ability to succeed in challenging and difficult intellectual tasks. Moreover, the results of many studies show that girls are more likely than boys to show the helpless pattern of achievement-related beliefs and behaviors. It is indicated that girls are more likely than boys to use insufficient ability as an explanation for failure, but are less likely than boys to use ability as an explanation for their success. Girls show a stronger tendency than boys to view their successes as due to the external and uncontrollable factors such as luck, which implies some uncertainty about their ability to succeed in the future. Furthermore, it is argued that since girls attribute their failures to factors that are stable and beyond their control (particularly insufficient ability), in the face of difficulty, they tend to lower their expectations for future successes. Girls' lowering of their expectations results in avoidance of difficult and complex task situations that hold the threat of failure. Culturally defined sex-role stereotypes, gender-based parental expectations and orientation along with the early childhood experiences are indicated to be the basic environmental social factors contributing to the girls‚Äô lower level of self confidence. Such social and cultural factors, as associated with the teachers by given negative feedback and treatment in the classroom, will in turn contribute to the girls‚Äô failure to develop the achievement orientations necessary to succeed later on in really challenging intellectual areas. Mathematics constitutes the best example of such challenging intellectual areas. Beginning in the late elementary school years, mathematics appears to be an area, where, regardless of one‚Äôs aptitudes, one is likely to confront novel and confusing material. To enjoy and perform in mathematics well one must be able to maintain one‚Äôs confidence and concentration in the face of novelty and in the face of failure. This is precisely the kind ofsituation which is not suitable for the confidence level and achievement orientations of girls, but rather for those of boys. In this case, girls tend to orientate towards the verbal areas, where once the basic skills, such as reading, writing, spelling and vocabulary have been acquired, increments in difficulty tend to be gradual. Furthermore, the clarity of the correctness criterion in mathematics is indicated to make that area attractive andfacilitative to boys but not to girls. All these factors act together to make mathematics more compatible with the achievement orientations of boys, and verbal areas more compatible with the achievement orientations of girls. As a result of this early intellectual ability differentiation between boys and girls, it is seen that during the subsequent years of education most of the mathematics-based science and technical options of the academic world are being occupied by the men. In a cultural context, wherever the parents and teachers themselves are probably unaware of their own expectations, orientations and behaviors that sustain and reinforce conformity to sex-role stereotypes, it is quite difficult to eliminate the differences between the self-confidence, achievement orientation, intellectual ability and academic achievement levels of boys and girls, since these differences are encouraged and developed by such sex-role stereotypes.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter I try to show how the emotional experiences a girl goes through in her adolescence can be related to her mental health or ill-health in adulthood. Thus, I do not want to focus especially on the actual problems or disturbances of adolescence that we encounter in the course of our work with them, but on the implications these may have for the sort of adulthood that person is likely to experience. Because, when we are faced with having to make decisions about whether or not we should intervene in a young person's life, or whether we should at least be concerned about an adolescent, one of our criteria must be the sort of adulthood, normal or abnormal, that we think this person is moving towards. (We also thought it would help us to be more specific in our thinking if we talked separately about the male and female adolescent; in the literature, it always seems as if, when adolescents in general are talked about, the comments are more applicable to the male.) I will limit myself therefore to those emotional problems that appear to be specific to women in their adulthood and then try to relate these back to their adolescence. 28This also means that I will have to omit referring to many aspects of adolescent development, not because I do not think that they are important, but because they do not seem specifically related to those problems of adulthood that I am considering here.",

      "title": "Domestic violence: alcoholism as a cause and a contributing factor",
      "abstract": "The article examines the influence of alcoholism as one of the main factors contributing to domestic violence. It was established that alcoholism is a problem that significantly increases the psychological causes of violence, is a significant factor that affects the spread of domestic violence, as it significantly changes a person‚Äôs behavior and psycho-emotional state. Under the influence of alcohol, people can lose self-control, become more aggressive and prone to violent actions, which is especially dangerous in the home environment, where interaction takes place against the background of close relationships and emotional dependence. It is motivated that people under the influence of alcohol can exaggerate the importance of minor misunderstandings or react to them with disproportionate aggression, which leads to the escalation of conflicts that could be resolved without violence under normal circumstances. It is indicated that an important aspect is that alcoholism affects the psychological state of all family members. Victims of violence, especially domestic violence, often feel isolated and vulnerable, which can lead to social tension and conflict in communities. Victims of domestic violence may experience constant fear and stress due to the unpredictability of their partner‚Äôs behavior, which creates a state of chronic tension that can lead to mental disorders. It is highlighted how the use of alcohol changes a person‚Äôs behavior, reducing his ability to self-control and increasing the risk of aggressive actions. Particular attention is paid to how alcoholism creates economic instability and psychological stress for victims, making it difficult to get out of violent relationships. The social aspect of the problem was also investigated, in particular the influence of the cultural legitimization of alcohol on the perception of violence. In some societies, alcohol is part of a cultural practice that can contribute to the normalization of aggressive behavior and reduce the perceived seriousness of violence. To effectively combat domestic violence, it is necessary to change social norms and raise awareness of the negative consequences of alcoholism, while providing adequate support to victims.",

      "title": "Jealousy in Close Relationships From an Evolutionary and Cultural Perspective",
      "abstract": "Abstract Jealousy occurs when one feels an actual or potential intimate relationship is threatened by a real or imagined rival. This chapter shows that the psychological experience of jealousy is associated with physical and hormonal characteristics. Particularly, the focus is on the distinction between possessive jealousy and reactive jealousy in humans and other species. Possessive jealousy is a preventive reaction that often results in mate guarding. Among human males, possessive jealousy aims to prevent investment in offspring sired by another male, whereas among human females, it seems to have evolved to obtain and preserve the investment of males in offspring and for disease avoidance. Possessive jealousy is related to cultural factors, such as parental control of mate choice, life history (in particular attachment style and father absence), and domestic violence. Regarding reactive jealousy (i.e., the responses to actual sexual and emotional intimacy with a third person), we discuss sex differences in emotional versus sexual jealousy, how reactive jealousy is experienced, and the variables to which it is related. Jealousy implies by definition a rival, and assessing the threat of a rival is a basic, adaptive mechanism rooted in intrasexual competition. This aspect of jealousy may also occur when one has not yet established a relationship but is trying to obtain a mate. In the context of the evaluation of rivals, we focus in particular on sex differences and similarities in the rival characteristics that evoke jealousy among heterosexual, homosexual, and transgender men and women.",

      "title": "Shyness in School",
      "abstract": "People with shy temperaments or personalities tend to be anxious in social situations, especially those that are novel or in which they perceive social evaluation. The experience of shyness may include behavioural (e.g., inhibition, wariness, withdrawal), affective (e.g., anxiety, nervousness), somatic (e.g., racing heart), and/or affective-cognitive components (e.g., self-consciousness, worries about social-evaluation). Shyness is related to, but different from, solitude, social withdrawal, unsociability, social avoidance, and introversion. Although all these psychological constructs may manifest similarly in that they involve less social interaction, they differ in the motivations underlying the behaviour. Uniquely, shyness is thought to result from conflicting approach and avoidance motivations in social situations. Shyness is also related to, but different from social anxiety disorder (SAD), in part because SAD is more intense, pervasive across situations, and impairing. Shyness can be heritable. Researchers may have identified certain genetic polymorphisms associated with shyness. However, even if someone is born with a tendency to be shy, they might not actually become shy because shyness is also influenced by children's environments. Shyness has been associated with certain aspects of parenting, such as overly controlling and protective behaviours. Shyness also has been associated with aspects of peer relationships, such as rejection. However, researchers cannot determine whether these aspects of parenting and peer relationships are causes or consequences of shyness. Shy children may face difficulties in the school context. It has been related to numerous social and academic problems. Specifically, shy children may have problems in relationships with their peer group (e.g., poor acceptance), one-on-one friendships (e.g., poor friendship quality), and some aspects of their relationships with teachers (e.g., lower teacher‚Äìchild closeness). In addition, shyness has been related to low school liking, and sometimes has been associated with aspects of poor school engagement and low academic achievement. Researchers and clinicians have investigated strategies to help shy or socially anxious children and adolescents avoid maladaptive socio-emotional or academic outcomes. For instance, children's social skills training in combination with parent education and training components is a promising way to improve social behaviours and reduce anxiety. School-based preventions and interventions that include parent and/or teacher components, such as FRIENDS for Life and INSIGHTS into Children's Temperament, also have been found to mitigate anxiety or improve shy children's engagement at school. Some treatments for social anxiety disorder, such as cognitive behavioural therapy may also help shy children.",

      "abstract": "The rate of early marriage from year to year continues to increase due to economic factors, family internal factors, and social factors. Most early marriages are still middle school / high school students who do not have good emotional stability and tend to do everything they want without thinking about the impact that will occur. Many of the early marriages have children, where in educating children they unconsciously apply permissive education patterns. The personal circumstances and attitudes of each child are different, making the task of educating hard to implement, and inÔ¨Çuencing the emotional state of parents. The results showed that the emotional stability of early marriages in educating children is not good, this is because early marriages are still easily inÔ¨Çuenced by negative emotions that can be seen from the emotional response shown. Excessive emotional response is not in accordance with the notion of emotional stability, namely a permanent emotional state, not easily changed, and the response shown is not excessive. In relieving negative emotions and resolving problems that occur, early marriages more often submit to the situation assuming that emotions will be lost if left unchecked, without any effort to fnd a way out or a method of solving the problem accordingly. Although early marriages do not have good emotional stability, some early marriages have been able to maintain their emotional stability by calming themselves down and solving problems that are sources of emotion.",

      "abstract": "A nascent body of research is growing on the issue of disclosing one‚Äôs sexuality, also termed ‚Äúcoming out,‚Äù and the implications for attitudes, behavior, and health. This research engages (a) the political attitudes of those reporting their sexual identity, and (b) the social conditions that lead people to express different forms of sexual identity. Four main findings help to characterize the relationship between coming out and political attitudes among sexual minorities. First, people who come out tend to be socially liberal, but the reasons behind this pattern remain unclear. Second, tolerant social conditions correlate with coming out; expressions of tolerant attitudes; and political engagement on behalf of lesbian, gay, and bisexual rights. Third, the reverse holds as well: Intolerant, homophobic social conditions correlate with the concealment of one‚Äôs homosexuality and the expression of homophobic attitudes. Fourth, homophobic social conditions also may lead to worse mental health outcomes, which in turn reduce political efficacy and participation. However, the causal relationships between social conditions, coming out, political outcomes, and health outcomes elude existing research. Future research can unpack these relationships and include more cases outside Western Europe and North America, where most research on this topic is conducted.",

Envy motivates ever greater efforts in the pursuit of private wealth, and, coupled with greed and covetousness, stimulates acquisitive competition, thus benefiting the economy. Envy is often linked to Schadenfreude. Jealousy characteristically involves hostility if not hatred towards the person who is taking away the love one feels is due to one, and engenders bitterness, hostility, or hatred towards the person one loved. Like many emotions, envy and jealousy provide motives for action. For in both cases there are characteristic patterns of backward- and forward-looking reasons for action. There are numerous biblical tales to illustrate the evils of envy, and others that demonstrate the vice of jealousy. For the most part, qin'ah is condemned as a serious and self-destructive vice.",

They also provided justifications and judgments about whether the character would be teased. Approaching peers with a gender-norm-inconsistent activity was judged as unacceptable, and participants also anticipated the protagonist would be teased. Justifications indicated that all ages tended to consider gender norms when activities were gendered, but personal preference when activities were gender neutral. Participants anticipated that friends would be less likely to tease than strangers. Girls/women and the youngest age groups (6‚Äì7) were most likely to indicate that being teased would prevent the character from engaging in the activity in the future.",

Compared with control targets, male leave requesters were viewed as higher on weak, feminine traits (e.g., weak and uncertain), and lower on agentic masculine traits (e.g., competitive and ambitious). Perceptions of weakness uniquely predicted greater risk for penalties (e.g., being demoted or downsized) and fully accounted for the effect of poor worker stigma on male leave requesters‚Äô penalties. By contrast, the poor worker stigma and both agency and weakness perceptions contributed to their reward recommendations. Results were comparable regardless of the reason given for requesting a family leave, target race (White or Black), and participant gender.

      "title": "Mixed and conflicted: The role of ambivalence in romantic relationships in light of attractive alternatives.",
      "abstract": "People in romantic relationships tend to have positive feelings toward their partner and want their relationship to last. However, maintaining a romantic relationship over time is challenging, and people can often experience mixed and conflicting feelings (i.e., ambivalence) toward their significant other. While research has identified the serious consequences that ambivalence can have for personal and relational well-being, very little is known about the factors that can lead people to experience ambivalence in relationships. The present work examines how extradyadic desire (i.e., desire for someone other than the partner), a common difficulty people face in the context of monogamy, is a situation in which people feel more ambivalent toward their partner. In three studies (N = 1,178) using experimental, daily diary, and longitudinal approaches, we find that feelings of desire for an attractive alternative increase ambivalence toward the current partner, above and beyond how much people actually value their partner, and that this has short- and long-term negative consequences for personal and relational well-being. Furthermore, while most people could identify an attractive alternative in their life, desire for the alternative-rather than just their presence-seems to play a stronger role in increasing ambivalence. This work highlights the emotional processes through which attractive alternatives pose a threat to romantic relationships and the role that ambivalence plays in daily life and over time.

The purpose of the present paper is to understand happiness, especially in terms of generation, degree, and level. Methods: We propose a model of happiness based on a control theory of human emotions (Chon, 2000). Results: According to the present model, there appears to be one necessary condition and two sufficient conditions for the understanding of happiness: (1) Happiness is generated when there is a match between DS (i.e., desired state) and AS (i.e., actual state) in terms of direction (Necessary Condition); (2) Happiness is experienced either satisfaction or delight / joy depending on the degree: If AS is larger than DS, and yet within a permissible range, then satisfaction ensues. In contrast, if AS is larger than DS, and is exceeding a permissible range, then joy ensues (Sufficient Condition I); (3) Happiness consists of a pleasure at the physical level, a joy at the psychological level, a mutual joy at the social level, and a bliss at the spiritual level (Sufficient Condition II). The present model is briefly discussed in the context of Confucianism.",

      "abstract": "Una de las principales motivaciones para consumir cibersexo es conocer a otras personas con fines rom√°nticas y/o sexuales. Parece que el g√©nero podr√≠a ser importante a la hora de modular la realizaci√≥n de este tipo de Actividad Sexual Online (ASO); sin embargo, los datos son escasos y no siempre apuntan a la misma direcci√≥n. As√≠ mismo, tampoco se ha estudiado ampliamente el impacto que puede tener el hecho de tener una relaci√≥n estable sobre el consumo de este tipo de ASO. Por ello, el objetivo de este trabajo es analizar la influencia del g√©nero y tener o no pareja estable sobre el uso y la selecci√≥n de ASOs que impliquen la interacci√≥n sexual y/o rom√°ntica con otros usuarios online. Para ello, 120 personas de entre 18-48 a√±os (59.17% mujeres, 40.83% hombres; 56.65% sin pareja estable, 43.35% con pareja estable) cumplimentaron un cuestionario sobre conductas y pr√°cticas sexuales online. El flirteo e insinuaciones a terceros es la ASO interactiva m√°s com√∫n en hombres (55.1%) y mujeres (45.1%). Los hombres tienden a preferir aquellas ASO interactivas que buscan establecer contacto sexual offline, mientras que las mujeres presentan preferencia por el cibersexo online. Sin embargo, las diferencias de g√©nero solo son estad√≠sticamente significativas para la b√∫squeda de pareja sexual online (œá2= 3.870; p=.049). El consumo de cibersexo interactivo es muy com√∫n en personas con una relaci√≥n estable (89.5%-92.9%), de forma que no se aprecian diferencias estad√≠sticamente significativas respecto a los solteros para ninguna ASO. Este trabajo nos ha permitido demostrar que el g√©nero se constituye como un claro factor modulador en el uso y la selecci√≥n de ASOs para conocer a gente con fines sexuales y/o rom√°nticos. No obstante, parece que el hecho de tener o no pareja estable no es un factor explicativo de este uso.",

      "title": "Lessons in romance from middle-aged men who have had affairs",
      "abstract": "Popular talk of romance often involves what men do to court women, and elaborates on women's needs and fantasies. Our culture doesn't appear to worry itself much with the emotional needs of men in relationships, too often dismissing a male's sexual needs as being purely physical. But does that reflect a man's internal reality? Does it even represent the external reality of heterosexual relationships? Do women romance men? If so, how? Recently I witnessed middle-aged men in my practice examining their sexuality with unusual candor. Our discussions led to some surprises. They were re-evaluating their lives in light of changing circumstances, and sexual issues were of concern, especially as waning libido and declining physical abilities made them aware that their sexual lives might not last forever. Several of them were relieved to talk about extramarital affairs. Their descriptions clarified for me how psychoanalytic discussions were currently not inclusive of their ideas. Integral to their experience was the notion of sexual \"generosity\", the antithesis to the \"body narcissism\" of spouses who regularly refused sexual engagement. These men searched for an antidote in the nurturance and other-centered behavior of mistresses, where they discovered a sense of invitation, respect, and even merger, establishing a foundation of acceptance and love of their physical selves. These men recalled how their mistresses romanced them in and out of the bedroom by centering on their needs. Whether through the suggestion of a sexual treat, engagement in a man's favorite outdoor activity, or offering a massage, such responsiveness was unexpected and deeply moving. Erotic acts and dirty talk were often known to be a gift for which these men were grateful. The case material demonstrates complex dynamics where these patients were plagued with ambivalent feelings, guilt, rage, and relief. Some were delightfully confused, being romanced for the first time in their lives. Others used affairs to assuage anger caused by marital rejection and deprivation. The resulting guilt was felt to preserve the marriage. After all, how can you be enraged at someone you've betrayed? A therapist's tendency to be repelled by tales of cheating on an unsuspecting spouse can interfere with the ability to assess the root causes and emotional impact of an affair. I hope this material will contribute to a needed new perspective, and suggest a sexual theory that acknowledges two forms of sexuality: the first, short-term and novel; the second, long-term and comforting, affirming a connection between stable longstanding relationships and sexual arousal. This theory would avoid the dismissal of sexual behavior as being solely predicated on drive discharge and acknowledge that sexuality can originate in the physical excitement that comes with establishing abiding trust and connectedness within a secure relationship.",

Special emphasis is given to information with relevance to public policy and judicial decisions. Compared to the U.S. adult population, respondents were younger, more highly educated, and less likely to be non-Hispanic White, but differences were observed between gender and sexual orientation groups on all of these variables. Overall, respondents tended to be politically liberal, not highly religious, and supportive of marriage equality for same-sex couples. Women were more likely than men to be in a committed relationship. Virtually all coupled gay men and lesbians had a same-sex partner, whereas the vast majority of coupled bisexuals were in a heterosexual relationship. Compared to bisexuals, gay men and lesbians reported stronger commitment to a sexual minority identity, greater community identification and involvement, and more extensive disclosure of their sexual orientation to others. Most respondents reported experiencing little or no choice about their sexual orientation. The importance of distinguishing among lesbians, gay men, bisexual women, and bisexual men in behavioral and social research is discussed.",

The tenn codependency has so dose correlation with a family that it could not be considered separately each other It is reported that the family of the alcoholic is not only irregular in its environment and showing more deficits and a large family, also the members of the family experience more emotional problems, especially the children do not well at school and have low social accomplisrunents as well as having more physical and psychological symptoms related to antisocial actions and alcoholic compared With a normal family. In other words, the alcoholic family not only has lower cohesive power of the family, lower life satisfaction and family functioning than a normal family, showing a dysfunctional type of communication prominently, but also having strict rules and rolls. As drinking is getting more chrome, the higher family raise the rate of getting in such codependency symptoms as derual, low self respect, feel of guilty, depression, uneasiness, and chaos etc. A dependent of the codependency makes features of a dishonesty, an anger, a hostile feeling, an adjuslment, a perfectionism, and a dependency.

In addition, he Jays emphasis on meeting requirement of the alcoholic prior to the acknowledgement and fulfillment of self aspiration. So he feels an uneasiness at the threat of breaking a symbiotic interdependency relation. as well as having a fear of wrong self loss made in symbiotic relationship. For this reason, the codependent among members of the family have a deep feeling of rejection, uneasiness, or fear. The children of the alcoholic with a symptom of excessive responsibility tend to be good at their study, while those making slow and showing a symptom of fitnessism have features of bad at the study, frequent late for school, and late submitting the homework Some of them also have features showing a symptom of creating a good atmosphere and solving all the problems properly.

The analyzation of the phenomenon of subjective distress is presented and the factors of its formation are isolated. Based on a review of domestic and foreign researches, there are highlighted sociodemographic and psychological factors of subjective distress that are in complex interaction together. The article reveals statistically justified dependencies of subjective distress on various factors. There are established facts of a higher level of subjective distress in men, people with low levels of education, as well as with the increase in the age of the respondents, and more difficult experience of it in women. The interconnection of age and subjective well-being does not always have a unique connection. The obtained data allow concretizing understanding of subjective distress in individual social groups and justifying the need for targeted therapeutic and corrective work with persons characterized by a sense of distress.",

      "abstract": "The relationship with a former spouse and its impact on marital satisfaction were examined in a sample of 290 remarried individuals. There was little continued attachment and friendship with the former spouse; although infrequent, feelings of hostility were still more common than either friendship or continued attachment. The relationship with the former spouse was more positive among the more highly educated and among those who did not have children from the former marriage. Continued attachment to the former spouse was especially negatively related to current marital satisfaction. Wives' marital satisfaction was negatively related to their husbands' attachment, and wives had more objections to this type of attachment. Particularly among women, friendship with a former spouse was dependent on their husband's positive attitude toward this type of friendship. Women were likewise more dissatisfied with marriage the more problems their husbands had with the way they related to the former spouses.",

      "title": "The Seduction Script: Psychological and Cultural Norms of Interpersonal Approaches As Markers for Sexual Aggression and Abuse",
      "abstract": "Hardly any subjects enjoy greater ‚Äì public or private ‚Äì interest than the art of flirtation and seduction. However, interpersonal approach behavior not only paves the way for sexual interaction and reproduction, but it simultaneously integrates non-sexual psychobiological and cultural standards regarding consensus and social norms. In the present paper, we use script theory as a concept that extends across psychological and cultural science to assess behavioral options during interpersonal approaches. Specifically, we argue that approaches follow scripted event sequences that entail ambivalence as an essential communicative element. On the one hand, ambivalence may facilitate interpersonal approaches by maintaining and provoking situational uncertainty, so that the outcome of an action ‚Äì even after several approaches and dates ‚Äì remains ambiguous. On the other hand, ambivalence may increase the risk for sexual aggression or abuse, depending on the individual's abilities, the circumstances, and the intentions of the interacting partners. Recognizing latent sequences of sexually aggressive behavior, in terms of their rigid structure and behavioral options, may thus enable individuals to use resources efficiently, avoid danger, and extricate themselves from assault situations. We conclude that interdisciplinary script knowledge about ambivalence as a core component of the seduction script may be helpful for counteracting subtly aggressive intentions and preventing sexual abuse. We discuss this with regard to the nature-nurture debate as well as phylogenetic and ontogenetic aspects of interpersonal approach behavior and its medial implementation.",

As a consequence all results must be taken as preliminary: most elderly reduce their sexual activities and change from genital to tenderness behavior. Men and women experience sexuality differently. Those who live in institutions report of few sexual interest and complain of lacking privacy. Several theories are applied to sexual behavior of the aged: disuse, exchange, role, communication theories and the concept of developmental tasks. Some consequences for research, for the elderly, for the social environment, for sex education and for institutions are discussed.",

The purpose of this investigation is to describe the meaning and experience of homosexuality from the adolescent's perspective. Twenty-nine male teenagers, self-described as gay (79%) or bisexual (21%), volunteered to participate in a structured interview, the purpose of which was to examine the definition of homosexuality, the acquisition of a gay identity, and the impact of sexuality on family, peers, and community. The youths demonstrated well-established sexual identities by the consistency of their sexual fantasies, interests, and behaviors over time. Homosexuality was more frequently described as a general attraction to men (48%) and an indicator of positive personal attributes (33%) than as an isolated sexual behavior. The subjects reported strong negative attitudes from parents (43%) and friends (41%) toward their sexualities. Discrimination (37%), verbal abuse from peers (55%), and physical assaults (30%) were frequently cited problems. These stressors may place the boys at high risk for physical and psychosocial dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Sexual addiction, which is also known as hypersexual disorder, has largely been ignored by psychiatrists, even though the condition causes serious psychosocial problems for many people. A lack of empirical evidence on sexual addiction is the result of the disease's complete absence from versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. However, people who were categorized as having a compulsive, impulsive, addictive sexual disorder or a hypersexual disorder reported having obsessive thoughts and behaviors as well as sexual fantasies. Existing prevalence rates of sexual addiction-related disorders range from 3% to 6%. Sexual addiction/ hypersexual disorder is used as an umbrella construct to encompass various types of problematic behaviors, including excessive masturbation, cybersex, pornography use, sexual behavior with consenting adults, telephone sex, strip club visitation, and other behaviors. The adverse consequences of sexual addiction are similar to the consequences of other addictive disorders. Addictive, somatic and psychiatric disorders coexist with sexual addiction. In recent years, research on sexual addiction has proliferated, and screening instruments have increasingly been developed to diagnose or quantify sexual addiction disorders. In our systematic review of the existing measures, 22 questionnaires were identified. As with other behavioral addictions, the appropriate treatment of sexual addiction should combine pharmacological and psychological approaches. Psychiatric and somatic comorbidities that frequently occur with sexual addiction should be integrated into the therapeutic process. Group-based treatments should also be attempted.

      "abstract": "Speech carries a wealth of information about the speaker aside from any verbal message ranging from emotional state (sad, happy, bored, etc.) to illness (e.g., cold). Central features are a speaker‚Äôs gender and their sexual orientation. In part this is an inevitable product of differences in speakers‚Äô anatomical dimensions, for example on average males have lower pitched voices than females due to longer, thicker vocal cords that vibrate more slowly. Arguably much more information has been learned by a speaker as they construct their gender or identify with a particular sexual orientation. Differences in speech already begin in young children, before any marked gender-related anatomical differences develop, emphasizing the importance of behavioral patterns. Gender, gender identity, and sexual orientation are encoded in speech in a range of different phonetic parameters relating to both phonation (activity of the vocal folds) and articulation (dimensions and configuration of the supraglottal cavities), as well as the use of pitch patterns and differences in voice quality (the way in which the vocal folds vibrate). Differences in the size and configuration of the supraglottal cavities give rise to differences in the size of the acoustic vowel space as well as subtle differences in the production of individual sounds, such as the sibilant [s]. Furthermore, significant and systematic gender-specific differences have been found in the average duration of utterances and individual sounds, which in turn have been found to have a complex relationship to the perception of tempo.",

      "abstract": "A theory of pseudomaturity or precocious development has been suggested to explain how mis-timing of adult transition events (occurring too early) can generate difficulties later in life. In a community sample, the age at which 30 adult activities (including various types of drug involvement) were begun were examined for an underlying factor structure, sex differences, and general and specific correlates with various aspects of adult functioning. Five factors were identified, confirmed, and moderately correlated including age of; drug initiation, financial autonomy, independent living, intimacy involvement, and deviant activities. Age at puberty did not load on any factor and was only significantly related to age of intimacy Involvement. Men were involved in drug use, financial autonomy, and deviant activities earlier than women, whereas women began puberty and intimacy at younger ages than the men. Pseudomaturity as reflected in a general construct and specific scales was significantly associated with numerous aspects of later adult role functioning, including drug abuse, socioeconomic status, intimacy involvement, emotional distress, divorces, criminal activities, and job instability. Although certain pseudomature behaviors consistently had adverse later consequences (early drug initiation to later drug abuse), others had differential impact on adult role functioning based on whether the transition event occurred in isolation (financial autonomy alone had beneficial long-term effects) or whether it was associated with a general lifestyle of pseudomaturity (with overall negative consequences).",

The ability to give and to receive physical love is very important for many individuals, even through the trajectory of an incurable illness. The ability to maintain close sexual relations can be viewed as maintaining an essential part of one‚Äôs ‚Äúself.‚Äù Sexuality can affirm love, relieve stress and anxiety, and distract one from the emotional and physical sequelae of an eventually terminal chronic illness. Sexual expression can foster hope and accentuate spirituality. Health care providers in all clinical settings where palliative care is provided can be pivotal in facilitating the expression of sexuality in the terminal stages of life. Holistic palliative care throughout the trajectory of an incurable illness should include the promotion of sexual expression and assistance in preventing or minimizing the negative effects of an illness‚Äôs progression on a couple‚Äôs intimacy. Sexual partners‚Äô caring can comfortably include sexual expression if both parties are interested and able.",

Orang yang telah melakukan perkawinan akan terhindar\r\ndari godaan setan, baik godaan melalui penglihatan mata maupun melalui alat\r\nkelamin atau syahwat, nafsu dan sebagainya. Untuk dapat melaksanakan\r\nperkawinan harus dipenuhi syarat-syarat sahnya perkawinan bagi calon mempelai\r\npria maupun calon mempelai wanita, karena hal ini akan memberikan pengaruh\r\npsikologis bagi suami isteri dalam membina rumah tangganya. Ada kalanya\r\nperkawinan telah disepakati atau disetujui, baik oleh calon suami maupun calon\r\nisteri, tetapi ternyata ada pihak lain yang keberatan, pihak lain yang dimaksudkan\r\ndi sini adalah wali nikah atau disebut wali‚Äòa·∏ç al atau enggan atau membangkang. \r\nTujuan dari penelitian ini adalah, untuk memahami gambaran kasus-kasus\r\npernikahan wali ‚Äòa·∏ç al di KUA Kecamatan Pandak Kabupaten Bantul DIY dan\r\nmenggambarkan upaya-upaya yang dilakukan oleh Pegawai Pencatat Nikah\r\n(PPN) dalam penyelesaian sengketa pernikahan wali ‚Äòa·∏ç al di KUA Kecamatan\r\nPandak Kabupaten Bantul DIY. Metode penelitian yang digunakan dalam\r\npenyusunan skripsi ini adalah field research (penelitian lapangan) dengan lokasi\r\npenelitian yaitu di KUA Kecamatan Pandak Bantul DIY. Sumber data yang\r\ndigunakan adalah data primer dan data sekunder. Teknik pengumpulan data\r\nmelalui Wawancara (interview) kepada PPN sekaligus Kepala KUA Kec. Pandak\r\ndan melalui studi dokumen. Metode pendekatan yang dipergunakan yaitu\r\npendekatan normatif dan yuridis. Analisis data menggunakan metode kualitatif,\r\ndilakukan pada saat proses pengumpulan data berlangsung dan setelah selesai\r\npengumpulan data tersebut dalam periode tertentu dengan menggunakan metode\r\npenulisan induktif diambillah sebuah kesimpulan. \r\nKasus pernikahan wali ‚Äòa·∏ç al yang ditangani PPN KUA Kecamatan\r\nPandak selama tahun 2009 silam, diketahui bahwa alasan keengganan wali\r\nnikahnya tersebut tidak syar‚Äôi (wali nikah ‚Äòa·∏ç al karena terbujuk dari pihak lain,\r\ncalon suaminya bukan dari suku yang sama, orang miskin, dan masih kentalnya\r\npengaruh adat Jawa dalam perhitungan tanggal keberuntungan). Upaya PPN\r\ndalam penyelesaian sengketa pernikahan wali ‚Äòa·∏ç al adalah PPN bertindak\r\nsebagai mediator dan mencari kejelasan/ klarifikasi (tabayun) atas sengketa dari\r\nkedua belah pihak, sehingga dengan upaya dari PPN tersebut, sengketa\r\npernikahan wali ‚Äòa·∏ç al dapat diselesaikan ditingkat KUA Kecamatan Pandak. Hal\r\nini sangat sesuai dengan hukum normatif dan yuridis.",

Family should be a place of happiness, security and mutual respect for every child. The problem of negligence of children has exsisted in every civilization and culture, and over the years there has been a great improvement in that area that today every negative and adverse consequences which affect the child and its development is being recognized. The most common types of family violence over children are: physical abuse, emotional (psychological) abuse, sexual abuse and neglection. Physical violence against children usually leaves visible physical marks, and it is therefore easier to identify than other forms. It is characterized by a bad intention to harm the\r\nchild and to cause physical injury. Consequences of pyhsical abuse can be short-term as well as long-term. They are usualy manifested in neurological and intelectual area, shool success, life expectations, socioemootional development and social realations, but also mental health in general. Emotional violence occurs primarily as parents long-term failure to show love and attention to the child. The consequences can be expressed trough many different areas: learning problems, difficulties in establishing interpersonal relationships, inappropriate behavior in ordinary situations, general depressed mood and dissatisfaction, frequent psychosomatic ailments etc. Sexual violence, on the other hand, includes every unwanted sexual contact and relationship in which a child is forced against their will. It leaves devastating consequences on children. Apart from pysical integrity, sexual abuse affects childs mental health, trust toward adults trusting adults and their selfrespect. Fear,depression, bad image of their body, sexual problems, poor achivements and other, are being expressed. The least attention is given to negligence because, unlike other forms of violence it leaves no\r\nvisible physical consequences. Negligence of children in their early age, during childhood, has severe and destructive consequences on their further development to be and is also a great cause of short-term and long-term emotional, cognitive, social and educational problems. Resarch proves that ignoring children during their childhood affects their development of personality disorder in adolescent and adult age. Many authors and associations have studied\r\nthe impact of violence on child development. In every case, violence negatively and adversely affects the cognitive, emotional and social development of the child and at the same time limits it, sometimes even leaving lifelong consequences.",

From the developmental perspective of emerging adulthood exploration, such relationship ‚Äúchurning‚Äù is expected; however, minor conflicts are more common in churning relationships. Using data from the Toledo Adolescent Relationships Study ( N = 792), the authors tested whether relationship churning is associated with more serious conflict, such as physical violence and verbal abuse. Couples who were stably broken up (breakup only‚Äîno reconciliation) were similar to those who were stably together in their conflict experiences. In contrast, churners (i.e., those involved in on/off relationships) were twice as likely as those who were stably together or stably broken up to report physical violence and half again as likely to report the presence of verbal abuse in their relationships; this association between churning and conflict held net of a host of demographic, personal, and relationship characteristics. These findings have implications for our better understanding of unhealthy relationship behaviors.",

With more research being published, it is clear that many women value their sexuality well past menopause, and when circumstances curtail their enjoyment they are prepared to seek help.\r\n\r\nThe causes of less than optimal sexual function can be physiologic, due to aging, or psychologic, due to situations such as work, family, or medical problems affecting the woman or her partner. Medications such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, Œ≤-blockers, or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may affect libido, but, to date, most recommendations are toward psychosocial or couples therapy rather than pharmacologic agents.\r\n\r\nDr. Heiman, from the Kinsey Institute, believes that insufficient research funding has been allocated, and welcomes the work by Davis and colleagues as ‚Äúall good news.‚Äù A large cohort of postmenopausal women in 5 countries participated in a randomized trial of placebo versus 2 doses of transdermal testosterone to establish whether libido, arousal, and number of satisfying sexual episodes improved over 6 months. The active treatments were either 300 ¬µg or 150 ¬µg per day of testosterone. Patches were applied twice weekly to the abdomen (Intrinsa¬Æ; Proctor & Gamble Pharmaceuticals, Cincinnati, OH). No women were on HRT.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the trial, those using the 300-¬µg patches had significant improvement from baseline in the areas of desire, arousal, orgasm, and the number of pleasurable sexual episodes per month. There was a clear placebo effect, but the efficacy of the higher dose of the active medication was still significant. Whether this ‚Äúnear doubling to 2‚Äù of episodes indicates a successful intervention must be up to women with depressed desire to decide.\r\n\r\nSide effects were similar in the 3 groups, but there was a 20% increase in hair growth in the 300-¬µg group compared with 10% in the placebo group. A concern was that 4 of the 800 participants developed breast cancer over the year‚Äôs surveillance‚Äî2 after 4 months of treatment and 1 whose disease probably predated the trial‚Äîand all received active treatment. Although possibly due to chance, a causal association must be considered.\r\n\r\nThe authors suggest these improvements are clinically valuable, offering relief for women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder and low serum estrogen levels.",

      "title": "Removal of older males increases extra-pair siring success of yearling males",
      "abstract": "In animals, reproductive performance typically improves over time early in life. Several ultimate and proximate mechanisms may contribute to such an age-related improvement and these mechanisms can act in a relative or in an absolute sense. Low performance of young individuals may be the consequence of a comparison or competition with older individuals (relative), or it may be due to specific traits of young individuals and be unrelated to the presence of older competitors (absolute). Here, we perform a test to disentangle whether the effect of age class (yearling or older) on male extra-pair siring success is relative or absolute. Male age is the most consistent predictor of male extra-pair siring success across bird species, yet the mechanisms underlying this pattern are not well understood. Low extra-pair siring success of yearling males may be a consequence of the presence of older (‚Äúadult‚Äù) males (hypothesis 1), because adult males are more successful in intra- and intersexual interactions or because females prefer to copulate with adult males when available (relative preference). Alternatively, low extra-pair siring success of yearlings may be independent of the presence of adult males (hypothesis 2), for example, if yearling males on average invest less in extra-pair behavior or if females avoid them as extra-pair mates, independent of the availability of older males (absolute preference). To distinguish between these 2 hypotheses, we experimentally manipulated the age structure of a nest-box-breeding population of blue tits ( Cyanistes caeruleus ) by removing almost all adult males, and compared patterns of extra-pair paternity in the experimental year with those from the preceding 15 ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù years. Removal of adult males resulted in a substantial increase in the extra-pair siring success of yearling males compared to the ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù years, but did not affect the population-level frequency of extra-pair paternity or its spatial patterns. Our results provide clear evidence that extra-pair siring success of yearlings can increase and that it depends on the presence of older males in the population, indicating a relative effect of age on reproductive performance. These results suggest that older males outcompete yearling males in direct or indirect interactions, in sperm competition or as a result of differences in attractiveness to females.",

      "abstract": "Sex differences in jealousy have been reported widely in the social psychological, clinical psychological, psychiatric, and anthropological literature. Many of the studies conducted on jealousy have focused on the sex differences in the level of reported jealousy. Most research has reported that there is no difference between men and women regarding the level of reported jealousy, but there are some sex differences between sexual and emotional jealousy. Evolutionary psychologists divide jealousy into 2 dimensions based on their observations and empirical research findings: Sexual jealousy and emotional jealousy. Sexual jealousy is knowing or suspecting that one's partners has had sexual relationship with a third person, whereas emotional jealousy is triggered by partner's emotional involvement with and/or love for another person. The parental investment model, which extended Darwin's explanations of sexual selection, provides a useful theoretical framework for studying sexual and emotional jealousy. According to this model sexual selection is driven by differential parental investment by men and women; men should experience more sexual jealousy than women and women should experience more emotional jealousy than men. Considerable research has focused on testing this hypothesis and, with a few exceptions, the results are generally consistent with the evolutionary account. In this study, firstly, a brief definition of the sexual and emotional jealousy will be given. Then, sex differences in sexual and emotional jealousy will be explained according to the evolutionary theory. Finally, the results of empirical studies and critiques of the evolutionary model will be given.",

      "abstract": "Infidelity has destructive effects on romantic relationships. Several idiographic characteristics or experiences in an intimate relationship have been linked to unfaithfulness. Yet, relatively little research has been paid to investigate how sexist beliefs might sabotage relationships by incurring infidelity. The present research examined the association between men's ambivalent sexism ‚Äì hostile sexism and benevolent sexism ‚Äì and men's infidelity as well as women's perception of the likelihood of men's infidelity. The results showed that men's hostile sexism and benevolent sexism predicted their increased infidelity (Studies 1 and 2). In addition, the indirect association between ambivalent sexism (both hostile sexism and benevolent sexism) and infidelity was through the importance placed on power in one's intimate relationship in general (Study 2). Importantly, women were unaware of benevolently sexist men's increased infidelity, such that women rated benevolently sexist men as having a lower likelihood of engaging in infidelity than hostilely sexist men and believed benevolently sexist men's infidelity level was similar to nonsexist men (Study 3). Therefore, these findings contribute to the psychology of infidelity by revealing that ambivalent sexism, both hostile sexism and benevolent sexism, are significant predictors. Implications of the findings are discussed.",

Public health education is still not sufficiently penetrating African American neighborhoods. Efforts have not been systematic or continous.

Thirty-fi ve Aka and twenty-one Ngandu adults who were or had been married were interviewed.

Aka averaged two days and Ngandu averaged three days between days with sexual activity. Aka and Ngandu cultural models or reasons for having frequent sex emphasized their desire for children rather than pleasure. Homosexuality and masturbation were rare or nonexistent in both groups. Aka men either did not believe in the post-partum taboo or if they had this belief they did not seek out other women during this period; almost all Ngandu men said they believed in the taboo but did not adhere to it and sought out other women.

      "abstract": "Keharmonisan dan kelangsungan dalam kehidupan rumah tangga bisa ditunjang oleh beberapa hal penting, yang salah satunya adalah keharmonisan dalam hubungan seksual suami isteri. Hubungan seksual bukan sekedar untuk mendapatkan keturunan (prokreasi) atau mungkin justru untuk mendapatkan kepuasan syahwat saja (rekresi), melainkan lebih daripada itu, ia merupakan aktivitas yang sangat membantu dalam menguatkan ikatan emosional di antara suami isteri. Ketika hal yang satu ini kurang mendapat perhatian atau mungkin tidak diperhatikan sama sekali dalam kehidupan suami isteri, maka kehidupan rumah tangga akan terasa sangat hambar, gelisah dan tidak tentram walaupun hubungan seksual ini bukan satu-satunya faktor yang dapat membangun atau menghancurkan harmoni rumah tangga. Keberhasilan faktor seksual yang mampu memberikan kepuasan kepada kedua belah pihak merupakan salah satu unsur yang mengokohkan hubungan rumah tangga. Fenomana yang muncul di jaman sekarang adalah keberadaan kaum homosek atau kaum gay yang suka pada sesama jenis. Ketika seorang homoseks ingin hidup normal dengan cara ia menikahi seorang wanita, tetapi dalam perjalanan rumah tangganya ia tidak bisa memberikan kepuasan seksual kepada isterinya dikarenakan ia merasa lebih tertarik kepada sesama jenis. \r\nDalam skripsi ini penyusun meneliti sejauh mana suami homoseks yang menikah dengan seorang isteri yang normal, yang dalam kehidupan rumah tangganya ternyata suami tidak dapat memberikan kepuasan seks yang sesuai dengan kemauan isteri. Sehingga hak isteri untuk mendapatkan nafkah batin dari suaminya itu terabaikan, karena suami merasa tidak tertarik untuk berhubungan intim dengan isterinya, dan ia lebih tertarik pada sesama jenis. Yang menjadi pertanyaan apakah ada bentuk perceraian yang merupakan hak isteri dengan alasan suaminya seorang homoseks. \r\nPenyusun meneliti permasalahan ini dengan menggunakan metode pendekatan yuridis-normatif. Pendekatan yuridis digunakan menurut ketentuan hukum yang ada atau tidak adanya hukum (peraturan) yang mengaturnya. Sedangkan pendakatan normatif penyusun gunakan untuk menuju pada permasalahan boleh atau tidaknya sesuatu dipergunakan berdasarkan syari'at Islam. Berdasarkan metode yang digunakan maka terungkap bahwa secara hukum Islam bahwa seorang isteri mempunyai hak untuk meminta cerai kepada suaminya baik dengan alasan yang prinsipil maupun hanya dengan alasan yang sederhana. Namun secara undang-undang bahwa untuk mengadakan suatu perceraian diperlukan alasan yang sangat kuat sehingga dengan alasan suami itu seorang homoseks tidak bisa dijadikan alasan perceraian secara mutlak, kecuali suami sudah tidak bisa disembuhkan lagi dan hal ini bisa mengakibatkan ketidakharmonisan yang berkepanjangan dalam kehidupan rumah tangga. Hasil dari penelitian ini merupakan sebagai bahan pertimbangan dalam menemukan pemecahan dan menemukan hukum atas permasalahan yang diangkat oleh penyusun.",

      "abstract": "The sexual values of absolutism (abstinence until marriage), relativism (sexual decisions made in reference to the nature of the relationship), and hedonism (if it feels good, do it) were assessed in a convenience sample of 783 undergraduate students at a large southeastern university. Results revealed that relativism (62.1%) was the predominate sexual value followed by hedonism (24.6%) and absolutism (13.4%). Significant differences included: men were more hedonistic than women; Blacks were more absolutist than whites, older students (those 19 years of age and above) were more hedonistic than those who were younger, persons who had up were more hedonistic than those who had not hooked up, persons who had experienced a friends with benefits relationship were more hedonistic than persons who had not, persons not involved in a relationship were more hedonistic than those who were involved, persons who had not cohabited were more absolutist than those who had cohabited. Theoretical explanations for gender differences and implications/limitations of the data are suggested. ********** Limited research has been conducted on sexual values--the moral guidelines individuals use to make decisions regarding their sexual behavior. Recent exceptions include research demonstrating the nature of parental transmission of sexual values (implicit, nonverbal, negative) (Kim and Ward, 2007) and the perceived inadequacy of parental discussions of sexuality (Rouse-Arnett and Mario Long Dilworth, 2006). The current research examined the sexual values of a convenience sample of university undergraduates (primarily first year students and sophomores). What moral principles guide undergraduates today and how do their values differ by gender, race, age, relationship status, and cohabitation experience were among the questions of this study. Sample and Methodology The data for this study were taken from a larger nonrandom sample of 783 undergraduates at a large southeastern university who answered a 100 item questionnaire (approved by the Institutional Review Board of the university) on Sexual Attitudes and Behaviors of College Students. Respondents completed the questionnaire anonymously (the researcher was not in the room when the questionnaire was completed and no identifying information or codes allowed the researcher to know the identity of the respondents). Of the respondents 74.6% were females; 25.4% were males. Racial background included 82% whites, 18% Blacks (respondent self-identified as African-American Black, African Black, and Caribbean Black or biracial) and 1.8% Hispanic. The median age of the sample was 19 with 71.7% younger and 28.3% older. Items specific to sexual values and their correlates served as the focus of this paper. Three sexual values were identified and defined with students asked to select the sexual value they currently adhered to: Absolutism was defined as before marriage is wrong; relativism-if you are in a loving relationship, intercourse is ok even if not married; and hedonism-if it feels good, do it--being in love or being married don't matter. Responses to these three sexual values were cross-classified to determine the statistical significance of hypothesized differences (Chi Square). Findings and Discussion Relativism was the predominate sexual value reported by over sixty percent of respondents (62.1%), followed by hedonism (24.6%), and absolutism (13.4%). Analysis of the data revealed several statistically significant differences in those who selected various sexual values: 1. Men were more hedonistic; women more relativistic.

      "abstract": "Infertility is the inability to achieve a clinical pregnancy even after engaging in regular and unprotected sexual intercourse for 12 months[1] [2] during the fertile days; roughly 8% to 12% of couples of reproductive age worldwide are believed to be affected by infertility. While males are solely responsible for around 20% to 30% of infertility cases, overall, they contribute to half of the cases.[2] It is well known that infertility may induce stress on couples who fail to conceive, but it is unclear whether psychological stress causes infertility.[3] Determining the emotional and psychological impact of male infertility and knowing whether it can improve outcomes if addressed is one of the priorities of male infertility research.[4] Infertile men generally suffer silently, and consequently report lower levels of psychological distress in questionnaires;[5] considering that the concepts of male fertility and virility are part of the perception of masculinity, it is not illogical to assume that there is a social concern that could influence male sexual and reproductive health.[6] A study[7] has found that the pessimism and psychological distress reported by male partners in couples undergoing in vitro fertilization had a negative linear correlation with clinical pregnancy. This might be due to the fact that psychological stress reduces sperm count, progressive motility, and increases abnormal morphology.[8] Another study[9] found an inverse relationship between erectile dysfunction and quality of life measured through the fertility quality of life tool (FertiQoL) and a significant relationship between depression and erectile dysfunction. Additionally, a prospective study[10] suggested infertile men are generally less healthy than their fertile counterparts when considering overall health.",

      "abstract": "Federal Rule of Evidence 412 prohibits the admission of evidence of the victim‚Äôs prior sexual behavior and sexual predisposition. There are, however, exceptions to the general prohibition. Significantly, evidence of the victim‚Äôs sexual behavior with the defendant may still be admissible if the defendant claims consent. And, in the context of a consent defense, not only is the victim‚Äôs physical conduct with the defendant potentially admissible, but so are her voiced sexual fantasies or dreams involving the defendant. Thus, woman‚Äôs thoughts, imagined or even unconscious, may be appropriated as evidence of consent under current rape shield laws. The same rationale that was the foundation for the chastity requirement under traditional rape law also applies to the admissibility of women‚Äôs sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception‚Äîwomen who express sexual fantasies act outside social norms, have deficient character, and therefore such evidence is relevant to consent. Yet, sexual fantasies and dreams, based on imagined or even unconscious thoughts, do not make the fact of consent more or less likely. And, even though such evidence is not relevant to consent, courts have admitted it. This Article examines the admissibility of women‚Äôs sexual fantasies and dreams under the consent exception, traces its origins, highlights its application, argues that sexual fantasies and dreams should be excluded, and proposes a practical solution to address this problem.",

Oleh karena itu, menjadi tanggung jawab setiap komponen masyarakat untuk berpartisipasi dalam mengatasi kenakalan remaja melalui setiap cara dan langkah masing-masing demi tercapainya ketentraman dalam kehidupan bermasyarakat. Kekerasan Dalam Pacaran adalah suatu tindakan berdasarkan perbedaan jenis kelamin yang berakibat atau mungkin berakibat kesengsaraan atau penderitaan secara fisik, seksual atau psikologis, termasuk ancaman tindakan tertentu, pemaksaan atau perampasan kemerdekaan secara sewenang-wenang, baik yang terjadi di depan umum atau dalam kehidupan pribadi. Pada umumnya, sangat sedikit masyarakat yang tahu adanya kekerasan yang terjadi dalam pacaran, karena sebagian besar menganggap bahwa masa pacaran adalah masa yang penuh dengan hal-hal yang indah, ketidaktahuan masyarakat akibat kurangnya informasi dan data dari laporan korban mengenai kekerasan dalam pacaran tersebut. Sehingga peran serta masyarakat sebagai pendamping serta pengawas remaja menjadi sangat penting guna menanggulangi serta menekan efek yang ditimbulkan oleh kekerasan dalam berpacatan.

Yet, as of the period of preschool education, research points to a greater occurrence of difficulties in the social and emotional area. The longitudinal studies that have made it possible to determine the psychosocial adjustment of teenagers suggest a greater risk of presenting experiences involving victimisation and bullying or of developing anxiety and depression in the long term, although some studies offer a more promising scenario.Disorders involving comprehension and the pragmatic component of language are an important predictor in the manifestation of socio-emotional alterations. In mixed comprehension-expression disorders, general difficulty in processing could at least partially account for this association. In turn, these limitations in the development of social cognition are likely to help explain, at least up to a point, the difficulties experienced by persons with pragmatic disorders, although the research conducted to date is not consistent in this sense.Relaciones entre trastornos del lenguaje y competencia socioemocional.Introduccion. Existe una comorbilidad elevada entre los trastornos del lenguaje y los problemas conductuales, emocionales y sociales. Objetivo. Revisar la bibliografia existente sobre las dificultades sociales y emocionales de los ni√±os con trastorno especifico del lenguaje desde una perspectiva evolutiva. Desarrollo. En la infancia temprana, los resultados acerca de este tipo de dificultades en ni√±os con un retraso del lenguaje no son concluyentes. Sin embargo, desde el periodo de educacion infantil, la investigacion advierte de una mayor ocurrencia de alteraciones en el area social y emocional. Los estudios longitudinales que han permitido determinar el ajuste psicosocial en la adolescencia indican un mayor riesgo de presentar experiencias de victimizacion y bullying o de desarrollar ansiedad y depresion a largo plazo, aunque algunos trabajos ofrecen una panoramica mas alentadora. Conclusiones. La afectacion de la comprension y del componente pragmatico del lenguaje es un predictor importante en la manifestacion de alteraciones socioemocionales. En los trastornos mixtos comprensivos-expresivos, una dificultad de procesamiento general podria justificar, al menos parcialmente, esta asociacion. A su vez, es probable que limitaciones en el desarrollo de la cognicion social contribuyan a explicar, en cierta medida, las dificultades de las personas con trastornos pragmaticos, si bien no existe una consistencia en la investigacion en este sentido.",

He probably makes large sacrifices to defray the cost of a ‚Äògood education,‚Äô and is liable finally to sacrifice his boy‚Äôs chances of happiness and success by an injudicious decision about his future. His difficulties may be increased, curiously enough, by his failure to realise that conditions of entry into a career are radically different from what they were thirty or forty years ago. He perhaps is still sufficiently romantic to talk about, and even to believe in, the ‚Äòself-made man‚Äô ideal, although the impracticability of it in these days of combines and over-population is surely manifest. Or he is likely to adopt one of two favourite attitudes; either, that his personal experience of the exigencies of his own calling determines him not to allow his son to follow it, or that the only reasonable thing for a son to do is to step into his father‚Äôs shoes and continue the work built up for him. If he is neither romantic nor obstinate, he will consult his son‚Äôs inclinations and, in all probability, he will find them either fantastic or completely unformed. A normal boy rarely shows a marked aptitude for one particular business or profession in his early or middle school-days, and if he forms an opinion about his future it is usually much influenced by a limited knowledge of his father‚Äôs occupation.",

      "abstract": "Cross-cultural and individual variation in erotic taste indicate that what we find sexually attractive depends on experience. Partner and other environmental cues can acquire sexually arousing (or inhibiting) properties through a variety of different types of learning processes, including imprinting, mere exposure, social learning, verbal relational learning, and operant conditioning. Most laboratory research on sexual learning, however, has employed classical conditioning procedures. Numerous studies demonstrate the impact of such conditioning on a wide range of sexual behaviors in non-humans, yet relatively few studies have shown such effects in humans. The chapter reviews the experimental research on classical conditioning of sexual arousal in humans, highlighting newer studies that use women participants and more diverse paradigms. Individual differences in conditionability and a distinction between signal versus evaluative learning are also considered. Such research has the potential to contribute to the literature on (human) learning theory as well as to enhance learning-based therapies used to alter problematic sexual responding, for example, in the case of sexual risk taking and/or sexual compulsivity.",

We report on qualitative interviews with 20 gay men who attended private sex clubs in New York City, asking how participants navigated sometimes conflicting desires for collective sex and committed relationships. Participants felt that collective sex was either a) incompatible with relationships, which should be monogamous; b) complementary to a primary non-monogamous relationship; or c) at least as important as relationships. Gay men attending sex clubs attribute different value to collective sex and to committed relationships, and experience different challenges in satisfying their desires for intimacy. Resources could help gay men navigating these apparently conflicting desires and making suitable choices regarding their relationships and/or sexual agreements.",

      "title": "Sex differences in positive well-being: A consideration of emotional style and marital status.",
      "abstract": "This article reviews all published studies reporting tests for sex differences in well-being. Women were found to report greater happiness and life satisfaction than men. This sex difference was explained in terms of men's and women's social roles: The female (vs. male) gender role specifies greater emotional responsiveness. Furthermore, past role-related experiences provide women with appropriate skills and attitudes. Women's (vs. men's) greater well-being was also found to hold for married but not unmarried Ss: For both sexes the married state (vs. unmarried) was associated with favorable well-being, but the favorable outcomes proved stronger for women than men. Given that most Ss were married, the overall sex difference in well-being can be attributed to Ss' marital status. These findings were discussed in the context of prior research on sex differences in negative well-being. Research on subjective social indicators has demonstrated that one's objective life circumstances do not necessarily correspond to one's personal experience of well-being. The fact, then, that men and women in our society differ in terms of a variety of biological, personality, and situational factors may or may not result in sex differences in subjective quality of life. This article examines whether men and women do differ in evaluations of their life as a whole. The inquiry is limited to consideration of data on positive welbbeing and excludes findings on negative affect and psychological symptomatology. This is because positive and negative affect appem; under some circumstances, to be uncorrelated (Diener, Larson, Levine, & Emmons, 1985; Wart, Barter, & Brownbridge, 1983). I Reports of positive wen-being are best interpreted as indicators of positive domains of experience, separate from negative aspects of one's life circumstances. Prior research on sex differences in subjective life quality has focused almost exclusively on negative affect and psychological symptomatology. Consequently, most theories in this area are tailored to explain the occurrence of men's and women's poor well-being. This work, and the data on which it is based, is presented as a frame of reference for interpreting sex differences in positive well-being. First, we consider what is represented by judgments of wellbeing. Philosophers and psychologists have debated this question at length (see, e.g., Diener's, 1984, impressive review of the",

Essentially, a psychosexual neutrality-at-birth theory holds that male and female patterns of sexual orientation and behavior are attributable exclusively to learning or imprinting phenomena. This theory is derived from clinical observations of individuals manifesting morphological sexual incongruities (hermaphrodites, pseudohermaphrodites, etc.). This article defends the view of inherent somatic sexuality organizing man's psychosexual development by: (a) reviewing man's place on the evolutionary continuum, and the broad base of sexual behavior within this discussion must be considered; (b) presenting normative, clinical and anthropological evidence inferring a particular sexual predilection birth; (c) showing genetic, hormonal, and neural indications for sexual predisposition; (d) refuting the extend of imprinting involved in humans; and (e) showing the futility of separating \"nurture\" from \"nature\" in reference to the role of learning and acquisition of a gender role.",

Although peer and environmental factors play an important role in all drug use, family factors, psychological difficulties and emotional distress play a crucial role in the transition from controlled to excessive drug use. Essentially, dysfunctional parent ‚Äì child relationships and severe family disruption contribute to emotional distress and to a sense of alienation from conventional sources of reward (family, school, work, and intimate relationships). For people who are distressed or alienated, heavy drug involvement can be a way to manage negative affect, bond with others, and/or experience alternative source of reward. Even people who use drugs to manage negative affect, however, are also likely to use them in some circumstances such as to have fun and be social.

When a relationship ends, the fate of sexual content that was previously shared can be a source of discomfort, anxiety, or fear for individuals who may no longer trust their former partners. In extreme cases, intimate content may be leaked or misused by its recipient. To investigate opportunities for building safer sexting tools with breakups in mind, we conducted a survey with 310 U.S. adults who have sexted in the last year. We asked about their sexting practices, communication practices within their relationship about sexting, and preferences for their own sexting content after a breakup. We find that most people save sexts in some form, either actively (e.g., via screenshots) or passively (e.g., in chat history). There is no consensus around what one should do with an ex's content: although most (55%) want their content to be deleted at the end of a relationship, many others don't care (25%) or even hope their ex keeps the material (11%). However, most have never spoken to their partner about this preference. We end with design recommendations that support sexting while keeping the entire relationship lifecycle in mind.",

      "title": "Psychology Degree Beliefs and Stereotypes: Differences in the Perceptions of Majors and Non-Majors",
      "abstract": "Very little research examines the beliefs and stereotypes students have about the discipline and major of psychology. Previous research has found that psychology majors report hearing a variety of such beliefs and stereotypes more often from their fellow students than from their family members. In the current study, psychology majors/minors and non-majors/-minors ( N = 376) reported their frequency of hearing beliefs and stereotypes from friends/fellow students or family members and the extent that they agreed with those items. Majors/minors and non-majors/-minors differed significantly on their agreement with several items, such as psychology being ‚Äúa dead end field,‚Äù ‚Äúpsychology is mostly an easy major,‚Äù and that ‚Äúworking with crazy people will make you go crazy.‚Äù Compared to majors/minors, non-majors/-minors were more likely to agree with the items. There was no evidence that upper-division majors/minors were less likely to believe or less likely to hear the beliefs and stereotypes than lower-division majors/minors. Students reported hearing many of the items more often from friends/fellow students than family members. We discuss the implications of these results for addressing beliefs about the psychology field and degree in introductory and careers courses.",

      "abstract": "THE climacteric or involutional period is that phase of life during which the reproductive funcetionis diminish and become finally extinct.The most obvious manifestationis of it in women are the disappearance of menstruation and power of connceptioii; but associated with it, anid, in formlling ani essential part of it, are a series of bodily and Iiieimtal chaiiges, the appearance of which frequently pie- ce(les the onset of menstrual irregularity, and which often continue for a time after menstruation has stopped.Those of thiem which will form the basis of this discussion are more or less transient, butt others are permanent, and are the hall-marks of middle age.Such are wrinkles, grey hair, and a calmer, if more conservative and less romanitic, outlook on life.The majority of womeni pass through the climacteric with its psycho-physiological adj ustments without great dis- comiforts, and in somie, who are specially favoured perhaps with a balaiiced natural equipment and a happy env-iron- nment, it hardly causes a ripple in theirliv-es.O(thers, how- ever, (are less fortunate, and to the ilervous and ineital disorders which beset them special attentioii will be given.Men, as we11 as women, are compelled by iiature to experience this period of involution, but in them it begins about ten years later, and on the whlole the reactions are less initense.It is an easier transition, unaccompanied by fluslhes a.n(l otlher' discomforts of vasomotor origin, and althlough thlei waist line increases, ajid they lose their youtlhful vigour, nlii(dle age is apt to bSe accepted mnore philosophically, perhaps because their interests are more diffuse and absorbing, and the loss of the power of repro- dutction means less to them thani to womeni.But, general, the mental and physical changes at the climatteric are of the same order innen as in women, although, because of time later age at wh-lich it occurs, and the greater liability to arterial degemleration, complicatinig psychoses more often merge into the pre-senile degenerative mental -states.I propose, therefore, to confine my contribution to the dis- cuission to thenervous and mental phenomena in women at the natural climacteric, and to do niomore than indicate, when occasion arises, features that distinguish the artificial menop.usefromii o-ariectomiiy in younIg womnieii.",

      "abstract": "AbstractMen and women in Swaziland who are engaged in multiple or concurrent sexual partnerships, or who have sexual partners with concurrent partners, face a very high risk of HIV infection. Ninety-four in-depth interviews were conducted with 28 Swazi men and women (14 of each sex) between the ages of 20 and 39 to explore participants' sexual partnership histories, including motivations for sexual relationships which carried high HIV risk. Concurrency was normative, with most men and women having had at least one concurrent sexual partnership, and all women reporting having had at least one partner who had a concurrent partner. Men distinguished sexual partnerships that were just for sex from those that were considered to be 'real relationships', while women represented most of their relationships, even those which included significant financial support, as being based on love. Besides being motivated by love, concurrent sexual partnerships were described as motivated by a lack of sexual satisfaction, a desire for emotional support and/or as a means to exact revenge against a cheating partner. Social and structural factors were also found to play a role in creating an enabling environment for high-risk sexual partnerships. These factors included social pressure and norms; a lack of social trust; poverty and a desire for material goods; and geographical separation of partners.Keywords: couple relationshipsHIV/AIDSHIV preventionmultiple and concurrent sexual partnershipstransactional sex",

      "title": "Grievances, Individual and Mobilizing",
      "abstract": "When individuals collectively challenge authorities via social movements, they typically do so over matters about which they are deeply troubled, have considerable concern, and feel passionately. These troublesome matters or conditions, and the feelings associated with them ‚Äì such as dissatisfaction, fear, indignation, resentment, and moral shock ‚Äì can be thought of as grievances. They provide the primary motivational impetus for organizing social movement campaigns and for engaging in social movement activities. Although there are various sets of conditions that contribute to the emergence and operation of social movements ‚Äì such as some degree of perceived political opportunity, organization, and resource acquisition, none of these factors is more important than the generation of mobilizing grievances. After all, it is difficult to imagine most individuals engaging in social movement activity without feeling deeply aggrieved about some condition that is regarded as contrary to the interests, rights, moral principles, or wellbeing of themselves or others. Consider the adherents of the pro‚Äêchoice and pro‚Äêlife movements, and of those advocating for and against same‚Äêsex marriages in the United States or immigration and tighter border control throughout much of the developed world. Not only are the adherents of one movement deeply aggrieved by the prospect of the other movement achieving its goals, but their passions about their movement are often palpable and thus worn, metaphorically, on their sleeves. Certainly, other motivational factors ‚Äì such as curiosity, the desire for approval, and peer pressure ‚Äì may come into play when considering why people align themselves with a particular movement, but these usually are secondary and largely irrelevant in the absence of deeply felt grievances.",

It covers gender-identity disorders, paraphiliac disorders (perversions), and ego-dystonic homosexualities. Gender-identity disorders and paraphilias are usually described as occurring less frequently in women than in men because of differing vicissitudes in separation-individuation. Recent hypotheses about etiologies for both gender-identity disorders and paraphilias in women stem from analysis of specific female developmental vicissitudes. Paraphilias have classically been viewed as related to oedipal castration anxiety, but recent writers have emphasized distortions of both gender and sexuality. The literature on female homosexualities encompasses many etiological explanations, among them oedipal issues; castration anxiety; excessive aggression; triumph over traumatic experiences or gender prejudices; disturbances in gender identity, feminine identification, or separate identity; ego adaptations to disturbed preoedipal maternal object relations; an adaptive search for greater intimacy; and normal biological variance.",

      "title": "Psychological Assessment and Therapy for the Spinal-Cord-Injured Patient",
      "abstract": "Disorders of sexual function occur frequently in patients with spinal cord injury, but have not until very recently been studied in a systematic fashion. The frequent occurrence of this disorder is clearly related to the fact that the sexual organs are directly controlled by components at all levels of the nervous system, ranging from the peripheral nerves to the cerebral hemispheres. In addition, it must be emphasized that sexuality is not just a biologic function, but also has complex psychological and social aspects. The work of ethnologists, such as Lorenz (25), has shown this to be true for most animal species. In humans, this aspect of sexuality appears to be particularly important. Small children, when asked to identify themselves, often respond by saying, \"I'm a boy\" or \"I'm a girl,\" their gender providing a source of personal identification. Frequently, how well individuals perform sexually determines how much of a \"man\" or a \"woman\" they see themselves to be. Given this system of beliefs with respect to the emphasis on sexuality and sexual performance, a great deal of anxiety becomes attached to situations in which sexual behavior is expected. These added meanings and expectations impart considerable importance to sexual behavior and have contributed to the fact that human sexuality consists of much more than reproductive function. These factors may help explain why sexual functions are highly vulnerable to all types of severe and chronic diseases, particularly diseases of the nervous system, which so frequently disrupt motor behavior.",

Of these 206‚Äî48 males and 158 females‚Äîhad at that time been operated on. 3. These operations‚Äîa vasectomy or salpingectomy‚Äîhave been followed by no serious sequel√¶. 4. No complaints have been received as to any change in libido or sex satisfaction, and none are expected. 5. Of the 288 cases 156, or 54.2 per cent, were diagnosed as mentally defective; 36, or 12.5 per cent, as mental deficiency with psychosis and 87, or 30.2 per cent, as otherwise psychotic and 9, or 3.1 per cent, as borderline cases including one with an exceedingly bad family history though otherwise normal. 6. Social problems, such as immorality, illegitimacy, delinquency, dependence, partial or complete, were prominent features in many of the histories. 7. Contrary to frequently expressed fears there is at present no evidence that sterilization will lead to promiscuity or a lowering of moral standards. 8. On the other hand, the treatment and training of patients and the maintenance of an adequate follow up system are still essential. 9. Facts indicating an hereditary taint or predisposition, in many cases to a startling extent, were found in 60.8 per cent of cases. 10. Sexual sterilization is undoubtedly a logical and acceptable method of coping with the great problems of mental disease and defect and their associated problems and should in properly selected and safeguarded cases be as readily resorted to as similar operations for physical disease.",

      "title": "Sex‚Äêobsessed or just sociable? Non‚Äêcopulatory displays in the hamerkop",
      "abstract": "Non-copulatory sexual behavior is surprisingly common among animals ranging from insects to vertebrates. Although sometimes considered unusual or aberrant within a species, in some taxa non-copulatory sexual behavior is widespread, and may even represent the majority of sexual behavior. Such behavior can also happen in many other contexts, including accidental contact, courtship, social bonding, and social structuring (Bagemihl 1999). Some non-copulatory sexual behavior is relatively easy to classify. For example, male‚Äìmale mating in damselflies (Ischnura elegans) is thought to be maladaptive, likely a case of mistaking males for females (van Gossum et al. 2005); similar cases of mistaken identity are also found in vertebrates (eg garter snakes [Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis]; Shine et al. 2003). In other taxa, like shortfin mollies (Poecilia mexicana), non-copulatory sexual behavior may increase the likelihood of successful copulation (Bierbach et al. 2012), while, in some species, it may lead to same-sex social pairings or otherwise have an obvious influence on social structure (eg female‚Äìfemale pairs of Laysan albatrosses [Phoebastria immutabilis]; Young et al. 2008). The hamerkop (Scopus umbretta) is an unmistakable heron-like bird found in sub-Saharan Africa and in the southeastern Arabian Peninsula. Named for their distinctive \"hammerhead\", hamerkops are renowned for their massive enclosed nest structures, which may weigh over 90 kg (Wilson and Wilson 1986). Hamerkops build their nests in pairs but may aggregate in large numbers (>250 individuals in 4 km2) and associate in small social groups of up to 10 individuals (Kaweesa et al. 2012). In December 2012, in Lake Manyara National Park, Tanzania, I observed a trio of hamerkops flying toward a flooded portion of road to drink. One individual picked up a stick from the water and walked to where a second individual stood after drinking (Figure 1); a third hamerkop stood some distance away and eventually flew off. The first individual appeared to present the stick to the second bird before laying the offering on the ground and jumping onto the second hamerkop's shoulders. The bottom individual stood in a flattened horizontal position (Figure 2). Several times, the bottom individual raised its tail to push against the lowered tail of the top individual, but no cloacal contact was attempted. The duo stood like this for several minutes, with the top hamerkop fanning its wings, perhaps to maintain its balance. Afterwards, the top individual jumped down, and the duo walked off the road into the woods, abandoning the stick. Interestingly, stick displays have not been documented in hamerkops, though two distinct forms of stick displays are common in other Ciconiiformes (Kahl 1967). The \"Twig Shake\" is a courtship display in herons and egrets, in which one bird grasps a small twig with its bill and vigorously shakes it (Hancock and Kushlan 2010). More similar to the behavior that I observed, however, is the \"Stick Presentation\", which is part of the greeting ceremony between mated pairs in related species during the beginning of the breeding season (Hancock and Kushlan 2010). This ritualized behavior occurs when one individual retrieves a stick suitable for nest building, approaches its partner, and presents it, often with a bow or a call. These behaviors are thought to help develop the pair bond, and may precede both nest building and copulation (Hancock and Kushlan 2010). The stick handling I observed closely parallels the Stick Presentation ritual described above, and could therefore potentially be a rare social behavior in hamerkops, perhaps serving as a prelude to the non-copulatory mounting that followed. Given that these hamerkops were seen near a nest, however, it is also possible that the hamerkop that picked up and carried the stick may simply have been distracted from bringing this nest-building material to the nest by mounting its companion, as hamerkops generally collect such material individually (Kahl 1967). In pairs and in groups, hamerkops have been documented performing so-called \"ceremonial\" behaviors, including non-copulatory mounting between both mates and unmated individuals (Kahl 1967). Non-copulatory mounting in hamerkops occurs in all combinations of sexes, including reverse mounting (female mounting male) and same-sex mounting by both males and females (MacFarlane et al. 2007). Hamerkops have even been observed conducting round-robin reciprocal mounting in trios and quartets, and even \"stacking\", where three or four individuals stand on each other's backs, forming a tower (Bagemihl 1999; MacFarlane et al. 2007). These behaviors suggest that non-copulatory mounting in hamerkops likely plays a broader social role than simple courtship, and the widespread nature of this behavior suggests that it is unlikely to simply be an aberrant behavior for this species. Non-copulatory mounting is common in birds, and is documented in more than 120 species from 37 families (Balcombe 2006). While many cases of non-copulatory mounting are clearly associated with courtship or pair bonding (Nuechterlein and Storer 1989), some avian mounting appears to be related to social interaction outside of the pair bond. Blue-bellied rollers (Coracias cyanogaster), for instance, breed and maintain territories in pairs, and use non-copulatory mounting in agonistic situations, potentially as a dominance contest (Moynihan 1990). Social avian species may use non-copulatory mounting to maintain group dynamics (Cockburn 2004). Harris' hawks (Parabuteo unicinctus), for example, exhibit a behavior similar to that of hamerkops, termed \"back-standing\" or \"stacking\", where subordinates perch on the backs of dominants, sometimes for extended periods of time (Dawson and Mannan 1991). Similarly, acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus) mount each other prior to roosting (\"pre-roost mounting\"), when emerging from roost holes, and during fights for breeding vacancies; these behaviors do not appear to serve as a prelude to copulation and are not associated with gender (Koenig and Walters 2014). The observation of an apparent Stick Presentation ritual suggests that the two hamerkops I observed were a mated pair, as this behavior occurs only between mated pairs in similar species. Nevertheless, non-copulatory mounting seems to be a social behavior rather than a sexual one. The inference that it plays primarily a pair-bonding or courtship role does not explain the prevalence of multi-individual mounting (both stacking and reciprocal series of mounts), and non-copulatory mounting between mated pairs of hamerkops has been described when a third individual approaches the nest structure, potentially to indicate non-aggression to the approaching bird (Smith 1977). Non-copulatory mounting in hamerkops is therefore probably a mechanism for structuring social interactions, and may serve to reinforce non-aggressive relationships. The potential for other undocumented pair-bonding rituals (eg Stick Presentation), and our lack of information on the purpose of known rituals, suggests that there is still much to learn about this species' social behavior. Although hamerkops are usually described as solitary, cooperative nest building, aggregate nesting, and large, non-breeding social groups have been documented (Steyn 1996). Hamerkops may use ritualized interactions to maintain social bonds with unrelated neighbors, allowing for aggregations when food is plentiful; conversely, hamerkop social groupings may be dynastic in nature, with nepotistic family groups that sometimes behave cooperatively (eg western bluebird [Sialia mexicana]; Dickinson et al. 2016). Further examination of social interactions, particularly using colored leg bands to mark hamerkops, and analysis of the parentage of those individuals, could provide insight into the complex social behavior of this unusual species.

      "abstract": "Few studies have considered how mate preferences may differ for individuals at different ages of emerging adulthood and beyond or considered at the same time other individual difference variables beyond sex and age of participant. This survey study of mate preferences ( N = 738) found that participants‚Äô age (from 18 to 40) was associated with lower mate selectivity. This negative association between age and mate selectivity was greater for men than for women. Age continued to be associated with mate selectivity controlling for shyness and perception of available partners‚Äîand both of these variables were uniquely associated with mate selectivity (negatively and positively, respectively). This study also examined participants‚Äô beliefs about how the importance of various traits in a partner had changed over time. Overall, the participants perceived no change or a slight increase in their preferences over time, although the perceived change depended on the particular trait domain, sex of the participant, and the other individual difference variables.",

      "abstract": "Data on hypoactive sexual desire, which occurs in patients with hypogonadism, its classification, anatomical features, and the author‚Äôs clinical example of castration-induced hypogonadism are presented. It is reported that if castration is carried out before puberty, then sexual desire does not develop, and if after its completion, only a decrease in its intensity is noted. This is due to the fact that hormonal changes that occur during puberty increase the ‚Äúsensitivity‚Äù of the brain, and therefore the ‚Äúmental component‚Äù of sexual desire develops, which does not disappear after castration. It is noted that the dependence of libido and sexual activity of men on androgens is much less than in animals. Moreover, it is reported that this dependence is much less in people with a higher level of intellectual development. However, castration carried out after puberty and even in mature men with extensive experience in sexual life still leads to a weakening of sexual desire and a deterioration in other sexual functions. If we are talking about the assessment of libido, then during the examination it is necessary to analyze the severity of its various components and, in particular, the safety of its sexual component. It also provides data on the weakening of sexual desire caused by diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, diseases of internal organs, tumors, other diseases and conditions, exposure to ionizing radiation. The author‚Äôs clinical observations are given, where the weakening of sexual desire in persons exposed to radiation at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was preceded by its strengthening. Possible mechanisms for the development of sexual dysfunctions associated with exposure to radiation are reported.

      "abstract": "Ethical controversies in patients with intellectual disability who are sex offenders. Patients with an intellectual disability (ID) have a disorder with onset during the developmental period that includes both intellectual and adaptive functioning deficits in conceptual, social, and practical domains (according to the DSM-5). These deficits in adaptive functioning result in failure to meet developmental and sociocultural standards for personal independence and social responsibility. Without ongoing support, the adaptive deficits limit functioning in one or more activities of daily life. Therefore, it is not surprising that these patients cross physical/sexual boundaries quite often. Above that, a proportion of all sex offenders have an intellectual disability. The treatment of these sex offenders with an ID has to focus on protective factors, next to risk factors in order to decrease the risk of recidivism. Due to the chronicity of their disorder, quality of life is an important issue in these patients. In this paper, we want to address some ethical controversies: ‚Äì hormonal treatment in patients with ID who are sex offenders; ‚Äì the right to have a ‚Äònormal‚Äô sexual life in these ID offenders, and the Dutch experience of the Stichting Alternatieve Relatiebemiddeling (SAR, that can be translated as foundation of alternative relationship mediation). The SAR is an alternative dating service, giving information about the sexuality of physically or mentally disabled people and organizing sexual encounters for them.

According to the results of the factor analysis, the determining features of the axio-psychological design of the life achievements of the individual in the period of early adulthood of the female gender were determined, represented by the following integral psychological characteristics - 10 factors: disposition of self-efficacy, disposition of perfectionism, attribution of responsibility, overcoming obstacles, use of unproductive coping, \"futile efforts\", combination of androgyny with femininity, benevolence, desire for success, lack of adequate mental age assessment. Instead, representatives of the male gender of early adulthood are distinguished by the following integral psychological characteristics - 10 factors: traits of the male gender in achieving success, overcoming obstacles, helplessness, lack of externally regulated perfectionism, failure, lack of independence as a lack of result, understanding of the situation, reward for what has been achieved, duality of externally regulated perfectionism , affective-conative complex. Gender-based differences between the factors of axio-psychological projection in early adulthood have been revealed: in women, this process is motivated by the disposition of self-efficacy and perfectionist guidelines, and in men by masculinity traits and the desire to overcome obstacles.",

However, no experimental research has examined the effects of physical exclusion and how it might combine and interact with social exclusion.

      "title": "Introduction",
      "abstract": "This Special Issue of Health Services Research on discrimination in America was conducted in the midst of a national debate on the extent of discrimination in the lives of Americans,1-7 from the perspectives of six under-represented groups in public opinion research on discrimination: nationally representative samples of blacks, Latinos, Native Americans, Asian Americans, women, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) adults. Despite strong evidence outlined in Williams et al in this issue and prior literature widely showing that discrimination has significant, harmful effects on health and well-being,8-11 public opinion is currently divided over whether discrimination facing minority and marginalized groups in America today exists or is a serious problem.2-7 These questions, and the divide over the answers, are critical to both policy action to end discrimination in the United States and the health outcomes of marginalized populations. Are the numerous examples of real discriminatory behavior against members of minority and marginalized communities that appear in the media just tragic, isolated acts, or are they part of a much larger pattern of institutional discrimination and culturally biased behavior? If there are broad patterns of discrimination, are they focused just on one minority or marginalized community, or do they impact a broad range of Americans today? The answers to these questions, as portrayed in each of the articles in this Special Issue, are fundamental to the experiences of millions of Americans and American residents, as well as to the US's future as an increasingly multiracial, multiethnic, and gender-diverse nation. The results shown in this Special Issue also involve questions of fairness, equity, and safety. This study was conducted in the midst of growing racial divides in civil and political discourse in the United States,2, 4, 5, 7 alongside documented rises in reported hate crimes in America primarily motivated by race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation.12 While civil and human rights groups have recently shown some federal policy progress on eliminating discrimination against minorities in key areas that affect their lives and health, they have also documented major gaps in policies and opportunities for the future across the sectors of health care, criminal justice, education, employment, housing, and voting.1 In addition, as shown by Williams et al in this issue,8 major patterns of discrimination can significantly harm the health and broader well-being of minority and marginalized populations, even adding more importance to these questions. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation funded this project in partnership with NPR and Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health to bring a public health perspective to the complexity and pervasiveness of discrimination in the United States today. This polling effort extends the Foundation's work to build a culture of health in America by examining adults' experiences of discrimination, given the large body of research showing it is an important determinant of health.8-11 In particular, this polling effort extends prior work in this area by (a) focusing on people's reports of their own direct life experiences with discrimination, rather than general perceptions of discrimination in the country broadly; (b) examining experiences of discrimination across a wide range of areas of life, including both institutional discrimination and more interpersonal or individual-level discriminatory behaviors; and (c) simultaneously capturing the reported life experiences across six groups whose experiences are often overlooked because they are difficult to sample in telephone polling. The health services research field is now part of a growing movement to broaden the vision of what constitutes ‚Äúhealth services‚Äù beyond health care, to include the impact of social, physical, and economic forces on population health.13-18 We believe new research on discrimination is essential for health services researchers' body of knowledge, as social determinants of health both within and outside of the health care system can have important long-term impacts on patients' overall health and well-being.8-11 We wanted to alert health professionals and health services researchers to these problems among their patients, which extend beyond health care. We chose to examine discrimination in both health and nonhealth arenas, to highlight the extent of discrimination for health services researchers in a variety of areas that affect not only Americans' health care, but also their well-being, safety, housing, and opportunities in education and the workplace. Future research should recognize that although there is a strong body of evidence establishing the need to narrow racial and ethnic disparities in health care,19 addressing how to narrow these disparities and end discrimination are extremely complex. New solutions need to go beyond frequently mentioned options, such as diversity training or quality improvement, which have limited evidence supporting their impact on discrimination reduction. The issues covered by this polling effort involve over a dozen aspects of American life. Each of these issues carries its own ongoing debate about policies and programs that might improve life for minorities and marginalized adults by narrowing disparities and ending discrimination. However, achieving equity in areas as diverse as the workforce, policing, and voting is extremely complex, and there is no national consensus on how these problems should be solved. However, experts have recommended a myriad of different solutions worthy of serious consideration and study, including policies to improve socioeconomic opportunities for minority and marginalized populations, civil and human rights protections that do not exist or are not enforced in current US law, and the inclusion of ending discrimination as an explicit goal in research, policies, and programs.1, 19, 20 Our data suggest that more action is needed to reduce and eventually end discrimination in America, as most interventions aimed to discrimination reduction have not been rigorously evaluated for their effects on improving health outcomes or reducing health disparities. While it is beyond the scope of these results to make specific recommendations for how to end discrimination in each area of American life studied in this polling effort, this Special Issue provides important evidence that more research and practice on discrimination are sorely needed in health services research. In presenting the results in each paper, we deliberately chose not to compare the experiences of various minority or marginalized groups to each other, nor did we compare the experiences of LGBTQ adults to non-LGBTQ adults or women to men. We included whites as a comparison group to racial/ethnic minorities to ground self-reported experiences in today's context and for consistency with prior research, but importantly papers focus primarily on each group of inquiry rather than on disparities against each other. We did this because the overall purpose of this polling effort was not to construct a hierarchy or rank ordering of discriminatory experiences, but rather to report directly from members of many minority or marginalized groups about their personal experiences with discrimination in the United States today. Wherever sample sizes allowed, we examined subgroups of some minority and marginalized populations, including Asian adults by East, Southeast, and South-Asian heritage, racial/ethnic minority and white women, racial/ethnic minority and white LGBTQ adults, and transgender adults. By examining racial/ethnic minority groups, women, and LGBTQ adults separately in different papers, we focus on the unique experiences of each group and the ways in which discrimination, racism, and sexism have shaped their experiences in our contemporary moment. Taken together, this series of papers provides a powerful picture of discrimination in America today and raises deep concerns about these issues in the future if they cannot be addressed. This polling effort extends prior research in building a base of recent evidence on reported experiences of discrimination, using national telephone polling data on groups who are often overlooked, to inform future policy debates over this issue. We believe the value of these polls is to provide reports of life experiences on hard-to-reach populations to complement ongoing national work on these issues.1, 12 It is often not realized that sampling minorities and other marginalized populations in polling and other probability-based research can be extremely difficult, due to financial resources, technical, and cultural expertise needed. For example, even in sampling the Latino and Asian populations, we recognized from prior work these populations are quite heterogeneous, representing different geographic, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds.21, 22 LGBTQ adults are another important example of heterogeneity, as they have diverse racial/ethnic identities, sexual orientations, and gender identities that uniquely impact their lived experiences. It remains a major research challenge to examine adults' unique experiences within the larger LGBTQ population, particularly in probability samples.23 While we were able to make some distinctions in these papers, we were limited in some cases by sample sizes. In the future, researchers should recognize the difficulty in both sampling and generalizing findings within smaller, hard-to-reach, or diverse populations. Within health care and beyond it, systemic change is needed to reduce and eliminate discrimination, because it carries such severe economic, social, and health consequences. The findings in these articles highlight that greater policy action is needed to create, implement, and evaluate major interventions and policies that address institutional patterns of discrimination in the United States today. Further change and research are needed to protect the civil and human rights of minority and marginalized populations, as well as to reduce health disparities and improve their health.

The celebrities who commit suicide may have various reasons like, family problems, failed relationships, pressure of career, disturbed married life etc. As they are unable to cope up or face the pressure of their personal lives being telecasted openly they try to hide and suppress their relationship out of public glare. It has been noticed that, the celebrities who had failed in their love relations are more likely to commit suicide and the most common method of suicide has been by hanging. It is also seen that in all the celebrities suicide cases their male partners were accused of abetting them for committing suicide, but when investigated they were found innocent and released. The police reports also have declared all these deaths as suicide.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Historical events change the socio‚Äêcultural and political contexts that Latinx gay men live in, shaping generational differences in external support, comfort being out, experiences of stigma, and the impacts of and response to minority stress over time. The stigma Latinx gay fathers face is informed by racial and xenophobic prejudice they encounter as Latinx individuals and negative attitudes towards their parenting abilities as gay men. To better understand the lives of Latinx gay fathers, we employed a life course perspective to explore their pathways to parenthood, experiences and avoidance of stigma, helpfulness of social relationships, and their comfort being out. Eighty‚Äêsix Latinx gay fathers ( M age = 46.03 years, SD = 10.50, range = 21‚Äì74) from 47 US states participated. Most identified as white, Hispanic (88.4%), while others identified as Black/African American and Hispanic (8.1%), Multiracial (2.3%), or Hispanic, non‚Äêwhite (1.2%). The average income level was approximately US $75,000‚Äì$80,000. Over half of participants' first and second children were genetically related to them. Participants reported low frequencies of sexuality‚Äêbased stigma and even lower levels of stigma avoidance, as well as relatively high levels of comfort being publicly out and helpfulness of social relationships. Generational differences between Latinx gay fathers in the AIDS‚Äê1 (born 1950‚Äì1969) and AIDS‚Äê2 generations (born 1970‚Äì1980s) were salient, signifying the importance of historical context in understanding this population.",

      "abstract": "Physiological stains in sexual assault cases have the potential to provide useful information. A comparison of genetic marker types in evidence semen stains and/or saliva stains to the corresponding genetic markers in the blood of a suspect may exclude the man as the perpetrator of the crime. If the genetic markers match, identification is inconclusive but may tend to support other circumstantial or eyewitness evidence of guilt. Potential for error is particularly high with physiological stain evidence because of its susceptibility to physical and chemical degradation. Furthermore, secretions (vaginal fluids, saliva, perspiration) from the victim are commonly mixed with the evidence specimens (semen, saliva) of the assailant. Certain genetic markers from the victim may mask those of the assailant. In many US crime laboratories there are no professional qualifications or requirements for the analysts assigned to this type of work. There is little administrative enforcement of quality control. Triers-of-fact are unaware that the data presented by the analyst are unverified and that the analyst's conclusions may be based on incorrect results.",

      "title": "Psychosocial background of female and male convicted of Intimate Partner Homicide",
      "abstract": "Background Homicide is an important cause of premature mortality globally, but evidence for the magnitude of homicides by intimate partners is scarce and hampered by the large amount of missing information about the victim‚Äìoffender relationship. Intimate partner violence is a serious, preventable public health problem that affects millions of Americans. Violence between intimate partners ranges from verbal abuse to physical violence, with lethal outcome at the far end of the spectrum. The term ‚Äòintimate partner violence‚Äô describes physical, sexual, or psychological harm by a current or former partner or spouse. Partner homicide differs from other form of mass murder in that the murder kills a family member who is a loved one rather than an anonymous person. Aim To identify sociodemographic and criminological characteristics in perpetrators of intimate partner homicide (IPH); to identify personality traits of those who commit IPH; to identify to what extent IPH experienced mental illness and mental disorder, before or in connection to the offense; and to investigate the associated risk factors to commit homicide of an intimate partner, such as substance use. Patient recruitment After taking a written approval from Al-Azhar University Faculty of Medicine Ethical Committee and from Ministry of Health General Secretariat of Mental Health Training Department and an oral consent from the offenders, a sample was taken of all male (35) and female (two) individuals, aged 18 years or older, who were convicted of homicide of their intimate partner. These were new admitted cases who were evaluated after being referred from public prosecutor to check for the mental state of the offenders. Methods Each offender was subjected to the following: (a) clinical psychiatric assessment, (b) Homicide Questionnaire, (c) standardized psychiatric assessment by Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview PLUS, and (d) standardized psychological assessment by Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, Wechsler adult intelligence scale, and the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test. Results The result revealed that sex is a risk factor for partner homicide, as of 37 offenders, only two were females compared with 35 males. Abusive parent and violence within the family were the most common risk factors inside the families. Overall, 51.4% of IPH offenders were highly educated, with significant relation between educational level and the crime, and most of them were employed at the time of crime. Of the sample, 32.4% were diagnosed as having antisocial personality disorder, 67.6% schizophrenia, and 32.4% mood disorders. Moreover, 29.7% had a past history of previous admission in a psychiatric hospital, and 40.5% were taking psychiatric medication. All offenders are tobacco smokers, and the most common substances used were cannabis, then opioid and sedative, and the least was alcohol beverages. Sharp instruments were the most common weapon used by the offenders, and the crime usually was done at night.",

Many ED men feel discouraged, disappointed or depressed. An oriental concept that the man has a leading role and full responsibility for sex may cause the impact of ED to be more serious for men than for women A womans response to ED will vary depending on whether or not she desires to have intercourse with her male partner. If the woman desires intercourse, then she will fine herself frustrated, interpreting he no longer loves her and she will usually be quite hostile and become depressed. However, in case she is no longer interested in having intercourse with him, she may be secretly pleased at his sexual dysfunction and do nothing to alter the situation. Men with ED are reluctant to talk about their sexual problems to their partners mainly because of their pride and their reluctant to go to hospital due to the belief that ED is a natural process of aging or it is an occasional symptom with the hope that the problem will get better on its own, and it is not serious enough to go to the hospital. However, the number of patients seeking medical treatment of ED has increased since the launch of Viagra. ED treatment improves confidence, it brings a sense of emotional stability and vitality of life and marital life, and it improves the family and personal relations both for ED patients and their female partners.",

There are too many pressures, new and old, for it to be otherwise. These include: the place of marriage in society; the parties' high emotions, which are possibly unique to intra-family litigation; popular misunderstanding of the policy; gender imbalances; the ease (if only perceived) with which a party can 'cheat'; the ongoing needs of children, which cannot normally be segregated from those of the resident parent; the needs of second or more families; a subsequent wish to re-open matters; and the pressure on the public purse. (It is therefore ironic that some people would now make AFR available to unmarried couples, and/or make marriage available to more sorts of pairs and even more remarkable that, under existing domestic partnership law, Mrs White might have got at least as much had she never married Mr White).",

      "title": "VIOLENCIA: UNA REVISI√ìN DEL TEMA DENTRO DEL MARCO DE TRABAJO DE INVESTIGACI√ìN EN EL INSTITUTO NACIONAL DE PSIQUIATR√çA*",
      "abstract": "Hasta hace relativamente poco no se le daba importancia plena a las diversas manifestaciones de la violencia, pero en la actualidad cada vez son mas los trabajos de investigacion que se realizan para conocer este problema en sus diversas areas. La violencia es un fenomeno extenso que se manifiesta tanto en el ambito interpersonal e individual como social. En consecuencia, como concepto es igualmente amplio, multisemantico, ya que senala distintos atributos que hacen enfasis segun el campo especifico del que se habla. El fenomeno esta imbricado lo mismo en la guerra que en el crimen organizado y la delincuencia comun. En ocasiones se da en las instituciones del Estado, pero tambien se manifiesta en la familia, ya sea entre los conyuges o la pareja, hacia los hijos o cualquier otro integrante de esta. Existe violencia con implicaciones particulares como la violencia sexual hacia los ninos, el incesto y la violacion, asi como violencia autoinfligida, como el suicidio. Para los profesionales de la salud mental, cada forma en que se manifiesta la violencia tiene implicaciones particulares en terminos de los efectos, ya sean en la salud fisica, la salud mental o en los aspectos psicosociales. En este sentido es importante obtener conocimiento sobre el tema, ya que muchas de estas areas no han recibido la atencion que merecen. Dado lo anterior, el interes del presente trabajo ha sido organizar y sintetizar la informacion de las diversas investigaciones llevadas a cabo en el Instituto Nacional de Psiquiatria sobre el tema de violencia, con el fin de ofrecer una panoramica que nos permita ubicar las principales areas y como se han trabajado, asi como discutir hacia donde seria conveniente continuar los esfuerzos. Durante la vida academica de nuestra institucion de salud se han llevado a cabo diversos proyectos de investigacion vinculados con la problematica de la violencia. Por un lado, estan los trabajos que asocian el consumo de alcohol y violencias como los accidentes de transito, los delitos, los ingresos a salas de urgencia y la violencia en la familia, entre otros. Por otro, se encuentran los trabajos que asocian el consumo de drogas con alguna forma de violencia, particularmente las muertes violentas como los accidentes, la violencia delictiva y la familiar. El mayor numero de trabajos se concentra en el area de la salud mental, ya que esta incluye una amplia variedad de temas como la conducta suicida -que incluye ideacion, intento y suicidio consumado-, ademas de trastornos asociados, intimamente ligados con hechos de violencia, como el estres postraumatico. Asimismo se han abordado gran variedad de aspectos psicologicos y psicosociales, como la violencia de genero. A pesar de lo anterior, aun hace falta mayor investigacion en areas especificas como los efectos del secuestro, la tortura y el abuso sexual, asi como investigacion centrada en los perpetradores. El resultado de la investigacion es fundamental ya que, previo a la intervencion, es necesario conocer las diversas implicaciones en la salud mental; por ejemplo, que trastornos se asocian y por que a las distintas violencias, y que otras consecuencias pueden surgir. Precisamente, todo el conocimiento generado es de gran ayuda para una intervencion oportuna en las victimas. Pero tambien se puede incidir en un ambito mas amplio; por ejemplo, utilizando la informacion obtenida para influir en las instituciones, tanto legales como educativas, asi como considerar la posible influencia de los medios masivos de comunicacion. Esto podria tener una repercusion positiva en el nivel social, ya que el fenomeno de la violencia comprende por igual a las victimas y a los perpetradores. Ambos grupos han recibido una influencia cultural y social que hay que conocer para hacer lo posible por contrarrestarla.",

Analyses are based on the Changing Lives of Older Couples study ( N = 210). Men's interest in dating and remarriage is conditional upon the amount of social support received from friends. Six months after spousal loss, only those men with low or average levels of social support from friends are more likely than women to report interest in remarrying someday. Similar patterns emerge for interest in dating 18 months after loss. Persons who both want and have a romantic relationship report significantly fewer depressive symptoms 18 months after loss, yet this relationship is attributable to their greater socioeconomic resources.",

      "abstract": "Kemerosotan nilai- nilai moral bangsa semakin nyata terasa. Salah satu wujud\r\nnyata dari kemerosotan nilai- nilai moral tersebut adalah terjadinya inses. Inses\r\nmerupakan masalah serius dan menjadi ancaman terhadap (terutama) anak dalam\r\nsebuah relasi atau hubungan keluarga yang mengakibatkan anak menjadi korban\r\ndari pelampiasan seks keluarganya sendiri. Inses dapat terjadi dengan ataupun\r\ntanpa paksaan, kekerasan atau ancaman kekerasan. Penegakan hukum terhadap\r\ninses juga tidah mudah dilakukan mengingat inses tersebut merupakan delik\r\naduan. Besar kemungkinan terdapat lebih banyak kasus yang belum teungkap.\r\nDalam kasus inses baik pelaku ataupun korbannya akan cenderung lebih memilih\r\nuntuk menutup- nutupinya, mengingat hal tersebut menyangkut nama baik dari\r\nkeluarga. Selain itu alasan lain mengapa kasus inses ini banyak tidak tersentuh\r\nhukum adalah karena ketakutan dari korban atas ancaman- ancaman yang\r\nbiasanya diberikan oleh pelakunya untuk tidak melaporkan hal tersebut kepada\r\npihak yang berwajib. Sehingga besar kemungkinan akan terjadi trauma yang\r\nmendalam bagi korban inses, apalagi bila inses yang terjadi pada korban\r\nmenyebabkan kehamilan yang tidak diinginkan. Dengan berbagai pertimbangan,\r\nbesar kemungkinan korban akan lebih memilih untuk melakukan aborsi terhadap\r\nkehamilan yang tidak diinginkanya tersebut. Di Indonesia, aborsi pada dasarnya\r\nmerupakan suatu perbuatan yang dilarang. Namun dalam Undang- undang\r\nKesehatan, baik Undang- undang Nomor 23 Tahun 1992 tentang Kesehatan,\r\nmaupun dalam Undang- undang Nomor 36 Tahun 2009 tentang Kesehatan\r\nterdapat perkecualian atas hal tersebut. Dalam ketentuan Undang- undang Nomor\r\n36 Tahun 2009 tentang Kesehatan, aborsi hanya dapat dilakukan terhadap\r\nkehamilan yang memiliki indikasi kedaruratan medis, atau kehamilan akibat\r\nperkosaan yang dapat menyebabkan trauma psikologis bagi korbannya. Meskipun\r\ndalam Undang- undang Nomor 36 Tahun 2009 tentang Kesehatan tersebut tidak\r\nsecara tegas menyebutkan inses sebagai salah satu pengecualian terhadap aborsi\r\nseperti dalam Pedoman Etik Dalam Obstetri Dan Ginekologi, namun demikian\r\nInses dapat masuk pada kualifikasi perkosaan apabila hal tersebut dilakukan\r\ndengan pola disertai kekerasan ataupun ancaman kekerasan. Sehingga dengan\r\ndemikian kehamilan akibat inses yang dilakukan dengan kekerasan atau ancaman\r\nkekerasan dan mengakibatkan trauma psikologis bagi korbannya, ataupun\r\nkehamilan akibat inses yang terdapat suatu indikasi kedaruratan medis\r\nterhadapnya yang mengharuskan dilakukannya aborsi dapat dijadikan sebagai\r\nsuatu legal standing terhadap pelaksanaan aborsi tersebut.",

      "abstract": "Prenatal alcohol exposure produces a broad range of primary disabilities that lead to adverse life course outcomes in children raised in adverse environments. Inappropriate sexual behaviors are a commonly occurring secondary disability, with a large minority of individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) displaying sexual aggression. Adults with FASD who commit repeated criminal sexual acts may be subject to legal proceedings for indefinite involuntary civil confinement as sexually violent predators/persons (SVP) in certain jurisdictions in the United States. Studies about the diagnostic practices among psychologists and psychiatrists retained by states to evaluate individuals as SVP do not recognize FASD as a mental disorder, despite the likelihood that hundreds of individuals petitioned for involuntary commitment suffer from FASD. Establishing an FASD diagnosis may provide exculpatory evidence to refute a government petition that an individual suffers from a mental condition that affects emotional or volitional capacity by predisposing the person to committing criminal sexual behavior. This article provides a framework for identifying, assessing, and deciding whether individuals with the FASD diagnosis suffer from the legally defined mental disorder that is necessary to indefinitely confine individuals as SVP.",

Sexual dysfunction is often associated with anxiety, and physical illness can impair sexual response. Traumatic experiences of a sexual nature can have important adverse effects, although this is not always the case. Rape and incest provide pertinent examples. Sexual activity has been implicated in both physical and psychiatric morbidity but there are a number of methodological difficulties in interpreting these associations, as illustrated by the ‚Äòcoital coronary‚Äô. Stress does not invariably exert negative effects on sexual response and anxiety arousal can sometimes facilitate sexual arousal in both men and women.",

      "abstract": "Sexual violence myth has a substantial influence on the occurrence/overcoming/signifying of, and response to sexual assault. This study starts from a critical view on how victims of sexual violence experience misconception in different relationships and under different conditions. We surveyed 235 victims and conducted 14 in-depth interviews to look into how they experience sexual violence myth depending on their relationship with perpetrators, their age when the incident took place, and whether the incident was rape or not. The results show that victims are more vulnerable to sexual violence myth during investigation or court trial, by people around them and media, especially when the victims are adult women, and they knew/were close with/went on dates with/had drinks with the perpetrators on their own will. Victims of sexual aggression by stranger or rape are relatively less prone to experience rape myth in which their sufferings are questioned, denied, downplayed, and even attributed to them. Damages of sexual violence cannot be measured objectively by its types. It varies depending on the relationships and circumstances surrounding the incident. Therefore, no one but the victim can define the damage and its significance for each case. Nonetheless, rape myth instigated by family members, acquaintances, and media, often during investigation/trial procedures, assumes that feelings suffered by victims/women such as discomfort, anger, false accusation, and betrayal, can be easily edited and altered. Impacts of sexual assault are not a matter to be accepted based on biased social misconceptions. It should be about how much the society can empathize with the challenges that victims/women face.",

      "abstract": "The Sexuality Study Group (chairperson: Chineko Araki) has researched the sexuality of middle-aged to elderly men and women who were having problems with their spouse, and suggestions for an improved sexual life. According to the result of the survey, the problem seemed to lie in the gap between men and women; men want sexual intercourse with women, while many women are satisfied with emotional affection. Discontinuance of intercourse is mainly caused by the loss of women's interest in sex. The responses to 'What kind of sexual relationship do you want to have with your spouse?' and other questions showed that whether women want to have sexual intercourse or not is not simply caused by a physical problem such as decrease of sexual desire or pain during intercourse, but is affected by various factors such as the affection to the spouse, physical and mental satisfaction by intercourse and a different way of thinking about sex. Also the survey showed even though both men and women wanted to have a 'casual conversation' or 'showing affection daily', in actual life they lacked having conversations and had little physical contact except for sex. For aging couples to keep matured sexual relations, it is more desirable to build the couples' relationship with casual conversation and physical contact, and also enjoy slow sex, such as pillow talk or caressing one another and not focusing on sex only.",

      "title": "Personality and sexual relations.",
      "abstract": "This investigation examined the links between self-monitoring propensities and orientations toward sexual relations. A factor analysis of behavioral and attitudinal survey data revealed that high selfmonitoring individuals tend to establish an unrestricted orientation toward sexual relations (such that they may engage in sex with others to whom they are not necessarily psychologically close), whereas low self-monitoring individuals tend to establish a restricted orientation (such that they will engage in sex only with partners to whom they are psychologically close). At the behavioral level, high relative to low self-monitoring individuals indicated that they had a larger number of different sexual partners within the preceding year, could foresee themselves having sex with a larger number of different partners within the next 5 years, and were more likely to have engaged in sex with someone on only one occasion. At an attitudinal level, low relative to high self-monitoring individuals indicated that they would be more reluctant to have sex with someone to whom they were not committed, and that they would be more uncomfortable with, and less likely to enjoy engaging in, casual sex with different partners. Possible origins and implications of these contrasting orientations are discussed. Throughout the ages, it has been a matter for contemplation, debate, and personal statement: Given human nature, what is the role of love, closeness, and commitment in sexual relations between consenting partners? Are and commitment necessary prerequisites for sexual relations? Is the sexual experience empty and meaningless without psychological closeness between the partners? Or can sex be a comfortable, enjoyable, and even enriching experience for partners who, although attracted to each other, are not psychologically close? If one samples literary, academic, or personal statements made on this issue, one is likely to find pronounced disagreement. Compare and contrast, for instance, the views of Bertrand Russell, Civilized people cannot fully satisfy their sexual instinct without love (1929), and Adrienne Rich, I'd call it if love/ didn't take so many years/ but lust too is a jewel (1966). Indeed, at least within Western cultures, there may be reliable and substantive differences in orientations toward sexual relations. Some people believe that‚Äîat least for themselves‚Äîsexual relations need not be restricted to relationships in which they and their partners are psychologically close. They may claim, for instance, that if they were attracted to someone, they would feel comfortable and at ease engaging in sex with that person, even if they did not know him or her well. Such people may be said to",

      "abstract": "In biology, sexuality (sexualite) refers to the nature of what is sexuated. The word took on the current meaning of \"sex life\" at the end of the nineteenth century. But it was in the first quarter of the twentieth century, with the diffusion of psychoanalytic theories in the human sciences and hence in general culture, that the concept of sexuality acquired its present range, designating a series of excitations and activities, and found as united or isolated components in the erotic behavior, conscious or unconscious, said to be normal, of adult human beings. Erotism is human sexuality freed of any project of reproduction, any compulsory genitality. It enables enjoyment to be independent of any biological function and makes it autonomous in such a way that all pleasure in eating, drinking, or working will arouse the suspicion of a hidden erotism.",

      "title": "Perceived discrimination experiences and social well-being among midlife and older adult men who have sex with men from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study",
      "abstract": "Many men who have sex with men (MSM) in midlife (40-64 years) and older adulthood (65+ years) have survived a lifetime fighting and advocating for equality given exposures to social discrimination attributed to stigmatized social identities (e.g., sexual orientation, racial/ethnic minority, and HIV-positive status). Few public health research efforts have given attention to how MSM‚Äôs exposure and salience of social discrimination across the life course have shaped social well-being in midlife and older age. Three studies were conducted using a cross-sectional healthy aging sub-study of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS). Study 1 explored whether older adulthood, racial/ethnic minorities, and HIV+ serostatus were associated with higher prevalence of any lifetime, any sexuality-related, and multifactorial (number of discrimination types) discrimination. Non-Hispanic Blacks were associated with greater any lifetime discrimination (aOR=1.42, p<0.001) and associated with less sexuality-related discrimination (aOR=0.56, p=0.001) compared to Non-Hispanic Whites. There was a statistically significant interaction associated to multifactorial discrimination between Non-Hispanic Black identity and HIV serostatus (aOR=0.46, p=0.019). Interestingly, no statistically significant differences in discrimination were observed by age cohort. Study 2 examined current internalized homophobia by discrimination exposure and salience. We observed no statistically significant differences in internalized homophobia by any discrimination or salience variables. Study 3 assessed differences in six indicators of social well-being (attachment, social integration, guidance, reassurance of worth, reliable alliance, and opportunity for nurturance) by discrimination exposure and salience. Though the mean scores for social well-being indicators were high overall, both any lifetime discrimination and multifactorial discrimination were negatively associated with indicator scores except opportunity for nurturance. Sexuality-related discrimination was negatively associated with social integration only. Across all discrimination salience variables, participants who reported discrimination and no/low salience exhibited lower scores on social well-being indicators than participants who reported no discrimination. Study 3 extended the public health literature on aging MSM, elucidating the role of salience on discrimination‚Äôs relationship to social well-being and that despite social adversity, these men have been able to maintain or achieve high social well-being. Future research should continue exploring midlife and older adult MSM‚Äôs resiliencies to identify factors that interrupt the deleterious impact of discrimination on health.",

      "title": "Health-related behaviours in context",
      "abstract": "Health behaviours, sometimes referred to as (health) risk behaviours, theoretically refer to any practices, habits or actions which, either in the short or long term, have an effect on health, either positively or negatively. In medicine generally, and life-course epidemiology specifically, they are often conceptualized as components of an individual's lifestyle, or even as lifestyles themselves. By virtue of human agency, or at least the potential for agency, they are distinguished from social structure (e.g. social class) which is typically understood as an external (material and/or cultural) constraint. In most studies, they are usually represented by four behaviours; diet, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption, and (increasingly) in the case of young people illicit drug use. Sexual behaviour is also referred to, but as the subject of another chapter, is not included here. From a sociological perspective, these behaviours are not so easily reducible to lifestylevariables, nor are they necessarily dis-embedded from social structure. Each is imbued with social meaning, both in the way they are socially constructed through, for example, advertising and the media and in the way they are consumed, and displayed by individuals. For young people, they are especially strong signifiers of identity since they are so closely connected with the youth-adult transition, minimum ages for the legal purchase of tobacco and alcohol marking stages in the achievement of adult status in most developed countries. They are also remarkably precise signifiers of youth identities, group membership and subcultures, as indicated by the way particular young people engage in physical activity (and which activities), whether they smoke or drink (and which brands they consume) or use illicit drugs (and which drugs). The extent to which such health behaviours continue to be shaped by social structures such as social class, and the extent to which they are lifestyle choices, is an important indicator of where any society is positioned in late modernity. This chapter begins with a brief overview of the social epidemiology of diet, physicalactivity, smoking, drinking and drug use among youth in developed societies, focusing on health consequences, prevalence issues, and age, gender and cross-national variations. A review of ethnic group and religious differences is beyond the scope of the chapterthough they are clearly important (e.g. for diet and alcohol). Developing from this, against the background of the structure/agency debate (Furlong and Cartmel 2007), and representing the former by young people's social class of origin, the latter by various lifestyles, an assessment is made of the relative importance of each for health behaviours in contemporary society. The chapter concludes with a closer look at the social contexts within which young people's health behaviours are developed, and the social processes involved. It is within these particular contexts, notably the school and the peer group, that the meaning of health behaviours for identity, group membership and lifestyles can best be understood. Because most research has been undertaken on young people of school-age, the focus is primarily on 'early youth' though the implications extend beyond school.",

      "title": "Importance of intercultural paradigm in affirmative clinical practice with LGBTIQ+ people",
      "abstract": "Abstract Professionals‚Äô attitudes, cultural background, and previous experiences are relatively stable and organized features of their backgrounds. They can affect the therapeutic process and provision of health care to LGBTIQ+ clients in both directions- affirmative and oppressive. Healthy development of sexual orientation and gender identity and their integration is one obvious prerequisite for healthy psycho-sexual and psychological development. Mental health care professionals should be aware of their attitudes, and cultural background, and how they can influence the therapeutic process with and provision of health care to LGBTIQ+ clients to provide culturally sensitive and LGBTIQ+ affirmative practice. LGBTIQ+ affirmative health care can include any single or combination of several social, psychological, behavioral, or medical interventions designed to support and affirm an individual‚Äôs sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Stigma-related stressors experienced by LGBTIQ+ people across these levels can take the form of relational trauma, and thus compound general life stressors that represent an additional risk for different stress-related outcomes including poor mental health and health-risk behaviors. Expectations of rejection might be particularly frequent experiences among transgender and gender-diverse people. Existing data depict LGBTIQ+ populations to be at a greater risk for poor health outcomes and a plethora of risk behaviors. Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people most often perceive available healthcare to be of inadequate quality and potentially unsafe. However, up to now healthcare systems across Europe fail to provide equal access for TGD compared to cisgender people It has been estimated that at least 27% of TGD people in Europe fail to access TGD care. Compared to cisgender people and compared to lesbian, gay, bisexual, or intersex people, TGD people are most affected by not having access to appropriate care, and they are among those reporting the highest rates of experiencing bad health. Access to the highest standard of LGBTIQ+ affirmative health care, including LGBTIQ+ affirmative approach within psychotherapeutic practice, that respects dignity and right of self-determination, personal, physical, and psychological integrity, autonomy, and wellbeing of LGBTIQ+ people, and that relies on evidence-based practice, clinical guidelines and standards of care should be a priority across European health care systems and psychotherapeutic modalities. Education and sensitization of medical, and mental health professionals, psychotherapists, and other health care professionals on sexuality, sexual orientations, gender identities, and diversities should be implemented as core intercultural competencies through the obligatory curriculum courses of health and mental health professionals.

Using data from 168 single emerging (18-29 years-old) and established (30-35 years-old) adults from the United States, we explored how they appraised being single (i.e., viewing singlehood as empowering, allowing for personal goals, and/or being disappointing) and explored how demographic, romantic, and well-being indicators were associated with singlehood appraisals. Emerging and established adults did not differ in how they appraised singlehood. Overall, 42.9% felt it was true/very true that being single was empowering, 75.0% felt it was true/very true that being single facilitated personal goals and interests, and 37.5% felt it was true/very true that were disappointed to be single. Flourishing, intentional singlehood, length of singlehood, relationship interest, education, employment, and race/ethnicity were associated with singlehood appraisals.",

      "abstract": "At the core of sexual attraction lies the experience of ‚Äúallure‚Äù, namely, a sense of being helplessly drawn to the attractive person that involves a sexual fantasy of intimate contact. The sense of being helplessly drawn is much like a magnetic force that has its source in the other person. It is thus a distinct experience form that of sexual desire. Sexual desire is felt to have it's source in the desiring person. This also helps to explain the difference between physical attraction and sexual attraction. Many scholars use these two terms as if the refer to the same thing. But the idea of physical attraction refers simply to the experience of finding another person‚Äôs physical appearance to be aesthetically pleasing. We are are not necessarily attracted sexually to someone whose appearance we find just aesthetically pleasing. The allure we feel for a sexually attractive person is fundamentally entangled in the relationship we have to him or her. Consequently, the experience of allure differs according to whether it is allure felt for a stranger, a close cross-sex friend, a sexual friend (‚Äúfriend with benefits‚Äù), or a romantic partner. To demonstrate the differences in these different sorts of allure, descriptions and examples of sexual attraction are garnered from many sources, including interviews, informal discussions, film, internet videos, song lyrics, erotic literature, and social psychological research.",

      "title": "Concealed Fertility",
      "abstract": "Abstract According to most authors, some female primates, often thought to be only women, possess concealed, cycle-related fertility, whereas most mammalian females do not (e.g., Alexander &amp; Noonan, 1979; Andelman, 1987; Baker &amp; Bellis, 1995; Beach, 1976; Burley, 1979; Campbell, 2002; Cartwright, 2000; Dixson, 1998; Marlowe, 2004; Strassmann, 1981; Symons, 1979; Turke, 1984). In its fullest form, female concealment of cycle-phase fertility has typically been thought to require three features. First, a concealing female does not ‚Äúknow,‚Äù that is, perceive, discriminate, or respond to, her own peak fertility in the estrous/menstrual cycle. Hence, she exhibits no variation in sexual motivation across the cycle. Second, and relatedly, female sexual behavior has become independent of variations in female reproductive-cycle hormonal inKuences. That is, endocrine changes across the cycle do not signi0cantly produce variation in female sexual motivation. Third, female morphological, behavioral, or olfactory signals of peak fertility in the estrous/menstrual cycle are greatly reduced or altogether absent. Hence, males cannot discriminate female peak fertility in the cycle.",

      "title": "Psychological Factors in Alcoholic Women",
      "abstract": "We have presented data on 69 female alcoholics who have had three or more interviews. Almost all are of high socioeconomic status. The majority are Protestant and college-educated. They drink at home and do not come to the attention of public agencies. Their childhoods were invariably disturbed, with a dependent relationship toward a cold, dominant parent, usually the mother. Half the fathers were alcoholic. Many patients felt an identification with the father rather than the mother. All patients grew up feeling inadequate and worthless and unable to express their hostility directly. Marital disharmony appeared to be the most frequent factor perpetuating our patient's alcoholism, though many had drunk heavily before marriage. The marriages were troubled by inadequate emotional communication and poor sexual adjustment. Nevertheless, they were remarkably long-lasting and free of infidelity. The husbands were usually overtly domineering but invariably controlling and unable to express feelings. Patients who remained single had retained the ambivalent dependent relationship toward one or both parents. Alcohol, initially the \"enabling drug\" which provided the missing feelings of adequacy and acceptability, became later the releaser of hostility, tool of revenge, and means of self-punishment. All patients exploded their anger when drunk. The following modal pattern appeared in 27 of our cases: cold domineering mother, warmer but alcoholic father, \"miserable self-image,\" cold domineering husband, resort to alcohol patterned after father's drinking. We have speculated on what basic factors may be crucial to the development of alcoholism in an individual woman.",

Often, messages about sexual consent have been reduced to simple catchphrases (e.g., \"no means no\"), which fail to consider the nuances and contextual factors of sexual consent. This chapter recommends incorporating consent education into broader comprehensive sex education programming. We begin by summarizing a recent research paper from the American Journal of Sexuality Education that suggests promoting general sexual knowledge might also promote better consent attitudes and communication. Next, we provide three suggestions for how sex educators can promote positive sexual consent attitudes and behaviors within comprehensive sex education. Specifically, we suggest that educators (1) move beyond a sexual assault prevention (SAP) framework, (2) promote intrapersonal reflection on sexual interests and values, and (3) frame consent as only one piece of sexual communication.",

The focus was on determining what, if any, important etiological factors emerged, as well as differences in behavior, attitudes, and preferences among women with various sexual orientations. It was concluded that a nonconventionality factor could be interacting with certain experiential and situational variables to produce a bisexual or homosexual lifestyle. Consequently, the ideosyncratic variable nature of such a paradigm could partially explain inconsistencies in past research. Results of this study were comparable to previous ones indicating that the women were similar (across sexual orientations) in their emphasis on emotional aspects of a relationship, history of heterosexual dating and coitus, few (relative to males) sex partners, and a less (than males) actively assertive sexual pattern of behavior. Future research might include males in the investigation of the role of a nonconventionality factor in sexual orientation. Also, relationship between cognitive/perceptual styles and sexual orientation could be explored.",

Diante disso, o objetivo do presente foi\ncompreender a experiencia de mulheres que vivenciaram a infidelidade de seus conjuges e\nidentificar as perdas envolvidas nesse processo. Foram realizados estudos de caso com quatro\nmulheres heterossexuais que tenham descoberto ou tenha sido revelada a infidelidade do conjuge.\nAs informacoes foram coletadas por meio de entrevistas semiestruturadas e analisadas\nqualitativamente com base nas teorias que se referem a relacionamento conjugal e luto. Com a\nanalise dos casos, foi possivel perceber que a infidelidade conjugal realmente acarreta perdas\nmultiplas. Todavia, pode apresentar aspectos positivos, como criatividade e amadurecimento,\nsendo propulsora de mudancas. Foi perceptivel que todas as participantes, de alguma forma,\nvalorizam o amor rom√¢ntico. Por outro lado, influencias historicas no que se refere a\nnaturalizacao do comportamento sexual masculino estao presentes em seus discursos. Foram\nconfirmados os riscos inerentes ao nao reconhecimento social ou intrapsiquico das perdas, o que\npode dificultar o processo integrativo de elaboracao. A compreensao da infidelidade conjugal\ncomo perda ambigua e luto nao reconhecido pode auxiliar na validacao social e intrapsiquica\ndessa vivencia, contribuindo para a construcao de uma sociedade que reconhece o luto em suas\ndiferentes manifestacoes. Os resultados reafirmam as perdas envolvidas na vivencia de mulheres\ndiante da infidelidade conjugal e sugerem a necessidade de novos estudos empiricos referentes a\nesta tematica",

      "abstract": "Every human being in general will always be side by side with differences such as differences between background or SARA, physicality, gender and many other things. However, this can also be a problem for each human being, such as between individuals and individuals, between individuals and groups, and also between groups and groups. These differences can cause conflict and trigger acts of violence or crime within society. According to WHO, acts of violence are the use of violence or physical force that is carried out intentionally or contains an element of intent in the form of threats or actions against a person or group of people or society which causes injury, death, psychological harm, and developmental abnormalities or deprivation of rights. This act of violence is also an act that violates human rights because this act does not reflect the norms and values ‚Äã‚Äãthat reflect human rights. One example of an act of violence that does not reflect human rights is domestic violence. Domestic violence or what is commonly known as domestic violence is any act against someone, especially women, which results in physical, sexual, psychological misery or suffering, as well as domestic neglect, including threats to commit acts, coercion or unlawful deprivation of liberty. in the household sphere.",

Of note, the endorsement of romantic beliefs was not linked to unmet expectations. Thus, romantic beliefs do not appear to foster false or unobtainable expectations for romantic relationships, and the concerns regarding the endorsement of these beliefs may be misplaced. Individual differences (age, gender, and relationship experience) did not predict romantic beliefs or expectations.

The decision to forego or delay a relationship in favor of advancement at work can have a detrimental impact on satisfaction. A national sample (N = 3504) was examined for sex differences in delaying relationships and the resulting impact on life and job satisfaction. An interaction was found between sex and delaying relationship commitments in relation to pay satisfaction. Men who had not delayed committing to a relationship were significantly more satisfied with pay than those who delayed. However, women did not show this difference. Men and women who delayed a relationship displayed significantly lower levels of life satisfaction. Women also reported lower earnings and more family stress, but also reported higher levels of job satisfaction. Overall, delay of marriage and family can lead a decrease in pay satisfaction, life and family satisfaction and an increase in stress.",

      "abstract": "Implicit in what has come to be called the loss of control concept is the notion that the environment, or the context within which drinking occurs, exerts little influence on the quantity of alcohol consumed by an alcoholic. In contrast, recent formulations of the alcohol dependence syndrome have argued that dependence arises from an interaction among personality, pharmacological and contextual variables. The present study investigated the relationship between contextual factors and alcohol consumption in 231 men and 90 women alcoholics. Self-report questionnaire data were obtained describing social pressures to drink more or less than usual, and the usual quantity of drinking in a variety of situations (e.g., at home alone, in bars or in family settings). The findings indicate clear differences in the quantities that alcoholics drink when alone, with friends or with family. Even the dependent drinker is apparently able to discriminate the relative quantity of drinking that will be socially sanctioned in a given situation and modify consumption accordingly. In situations in which constraints are absent or minimal (e.g., alone), drinking tends to be greater than in situations in which social controls are more pronounced (e.g., with friends and family).",

      "abstract": "There is an increasing concern on early initiation of sexual activity among adolescents, increasing sexually transmitted infections, and teenage pregnancy in Uganda. Adolescents perceptions of these sexual behaviors might be the result of discussing sexual and reproductive health issues with key influencing audiences. This study qualitatively explored the effect of sexuality discussions with key influencing audiences by means of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with adolescents (N=83). Findings indicate that adolescence stage comes with changes of intense sexual desires, often presumed difficult to control thus leading adolescents to engage in sexual activities. Adolescents indicated that they were aware of the sexual behaviors such as condom use, contraception use, and multiple concurrent partnerships, but intertwined with persistent myths and misconceptions. Although discussing sexuality issues with someone was found to be instrumental, adolescent highlighted challenges that hinder discussion with key influencers. Challenges include, parents lack of time to talk to their children; some religious affiliations perceived to discourage use of contraception; limited skills of community health workers to address adolescent information needs; meetings held in groups not followed up with age-focused or one-on-one discussions; negative health workers‚Äô attitudes and use of technical language; and peer pressure. These findings suggest the need to provide adequate and updated information to clear any misconceptions and strengthening of key influencers‚Äô communication skills to gain confidence in addressing adolescent sexual and reproductive health needs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual well-being plays an important role in the quality of life. Against this background, we provide an economics-based approach to the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and various dimensions of sexuality. From a theoretical viewpoint, personality influences sexual well-being not only by how a person feels about sex, but also by how the person behaves in a sexual relationship. Personality shapes information sharing about sexual preferences, the way dissonant sexual preferences of the partners are handled, and the extent to which a person is committed to promises made to a partner. Using a large representative dataset from Germany, we find that personality traits play a role in a person‚Äôs own sexual satisfaction, in (the self-assessment of) fulfilling their partner‚Äôs sexual needs and desires, in sexual communication, in actual and desired frequency of sex, and in extradyadic affairs. Conscientiousness contributes to a mutually beneficial sex life and increases a person‚Äôs commitment to their partner. The opposite holds true for neuroticism. While extraversion and openness to experience help realize a mutually beneficial sex life, we find no evidence that they have a commitment value. On the contrary, extraversion is associated with lower commitment to the partner. Agreeableness contributes to higher commitment. However, agreeableness appears to make people more reluctant to express their sexual needs and desires.",

      "title": "Containing Attachment Concerns: Does Trait Mindfulness Buffer the Links between Attachment Insecurity and Maladaptive Sexual Motivations?",
      "abstract": "Individuals reporting greater insecure attachment are more likely to report maladaptive sexual motivations, such as sex to avoid negative relational and personal outcomes (e.g., conflict). Despite the costs of such sexual motivations, research is less clear regarding what might buffer the extent to which attachment insecurities manifest in such motives. The current study examined whether trait mindfulness moderates the links between attachment insecurity and maladaptive sexual motives. Participants (N = 194) completed measures of trait mindfulness, general sexual motivations, and attachment. As predicted, the links between attachment anxiety and having sex to cope and affirm the self were eliminated among individuals reporting higher levels of the acting with awareness facet of trait mindfulness. No such buffering effects were seen for attachment avoidance. Instead, acting with awareness mindfulness appeared to increase the extent to which more avoidantly attached individuals reported coping and self-affirmation-based sexual motives. These findings contribute to knowledge regarding the potential utility and limits of mindfulness in relational and sexual contexts, perhaps suggesting that mindfulness may help anxiously attached individuals manage the extent to which attachment concerns manifest in maladaptive sexual motivations. Findings of the study may inform both theory regarding mindfulness in interpersonal functioning and how mindfulness interventions might be deployed in sex therapy contexts.",

      "title": "The impact of maternal depression on familial relationships",
      "abstract": "Depression is one of the most prevalent psychiatric illnesses. It is particularly common in women of childbearing age. It is recurrent and tends to have a chronic course and is often comorbid in nature. It is important to view depression within its social context, as it is a disease, which impacts not only the individual but also the wider community. Evidence abounds as to the negative impact of maternal depression on children, husbands/partners, and family. Children of depressed women show deficits in social, psychological, and cognitive domains and are at increased risk for depression themselves and other psychiatric illness such as conduct disorder. They are also at an increased risk for child abuse. The mechanisms by which maternal depression may lead to child psychopathology including genetics, poor parenting, modelling, and environment are explored. Many children with depressed mothers cope well and escape negative effects; consequently the concept of resilience is elucidated. Research shows that a significant percentage of men become depressed when their wives/partners are depressed particularly if they have postnatal depression. There is an increase in marital discord and conflict within families of depressed women, all of which can have a deleterious effect on children. Children with two depressed parents are at an elevated risk of a negative outcome as compared to those with only one depressed parent. Finally the various interventions, management, and recommendations are examined.",

The data indicate that negative reactions to unfamiliar persons become common during the second half of the first year. Positive reactions also occur, and there is evidence that certain infant attributes, stranger characteristics, and contextual features affect whether or not the infant becomes distressed. This complex phenomenon can be best understood as a developmental organizer. The negative reactions noted in the literature have most often been construed as expressions of interpersonal wariness reflecting recognition of the stranger's unfamiliarity or novelty. The possibilities that such responses also mirror the infant's emerging sensitivity to atypical social behavior and intrapsychic anxiety about his developing sense of separateness are discussed. Examination of research methodology points to several common shortcomings in the studies.",

      "abstract": "Shop-keepers some there wereAnd men of good repute,Each vow'd a Bachelor,Unnat'ral Lust pursu'dThe Women Hater's Lamentation (1707)1Much of what was written about sodomy during the eighteenth century remains amazingly vague. With a few crucial exceptions, broadsides and fictional accounts describe sodomy in very general terms, not as a transgressive sexual practice that involves certain unspeakable activities, but rather as a set of specific habits of dress or personal hygiene, often a foreign accent or questionable religious leanings, and occasionally a taste for opera.2 Even the socalled trial accounts themselves most often talk around sodomy, explaining for instance that men in the molly house were making love or that one man was caught in the act of seducing another-with a hand in his breeches, for instance-without any corroborating evidence or actual physical description of sodomitical relations.3At signal, rare moments, however, descriptions of sodomy include a visual account putatively based on observation that offers readers a titillating insight into the dynamics of unnatural activity. In the trial of Thomas Rodin (October 1722), for instance, Henry clay ton tells the court:I and the Prisoner lodg'd in one Room, at Peter Wright's, a Shoemaker, at the Three Shoes next Door to the Harrow in Long-Alley in Moorfields. My Landlady keeps a Baudy-house, and lets out Lodgings. Some Time in March last,-I forget the Day,-there accidentally comes in a Stranger to lodge, the Prisoner drank with him, and at half an Hour past ten they went up to Bed together; and saw the Prisoner lying with him in the Nature of carnal Copulation, as a Man lies with a Woman.Court. How you be sure of that.Clayton. not put my Hand between them; but it was a Moon-light Night, and was abed in the same room, and see what they plain enough.4Henry Clayton's account depends on direct visual testimony: clayton sees two men in the act of copulation. As unimaginative as his description is, it does suggest some of the ways in which sodomy is already coded. The visual account is enhanced by the moonlight and the intimacy of the observer, and even these simple details work to create a scene. Moreover, clayton's tantalizing claim that he did not put my Hand between (misprinted as I put my hand between in a recent edition of these trials) serves to emphasize his physical proximity and to give credence to his observation, which concludes with the claim that he could see what they plain enough (my emphasis). But clayton's account also demonstrates the perils of such close observation:5Court. How long was it before you spoke of this?Clayton. spoke on't the next Day.Court. And why you not prosecute sooner?Clayton is very quickly on the defensive here, and before very long his testimony has been thoroughly discredited. This is in part because his own character has been rendered questionable, not because of any activity of his own but because of his intimacy with the scene of sodomy itself. Sodomy is dangerously seductive, as this moonlit scene suggests.6 Clayton can hardly keep his hands away from the copulating couple.For the obvious reason that proximity implies guilty association, then, such accounts are often framed as keyhole testimony, in which an observer watches certain sexual activities from a distance and then reports them to a listener or an audience, either in a court of law or another social situation, such as an antisodomy tract or a novel. Rather than get so close that the observer touch the participants, in other words, a doorway or a partition usually separates the observer from the scene of sodomy. This gives precedence to a visual account of the scene and offers a new set of erotic dynamics, as the following account suggests.In the trial record for John Dicks (April 1722), for instance, the following testimony is recorded:William Rogers. ‚Ä¶",

      "title": "Sexuality: its not just sex",
      "abstract": "Sexuality is much more than just having sexual intercourse. General wellbeing, psychological wellbeing, relationship satisfaction and prevention of deterioration of diseases are all important considerations to have in mind when discussing matters of a sexual nature with patients. The magnitude of the degree of sexual problems remains hotly disputed, although the numbers appear to be age related. Over 50% of men over 40 years of age are affected with erectile dysfunction, with incidence approaching 70% by 70 years of age.1 Up to 53.8% of women may have a minimum of one sexual problem lasting at least one month over a two-year period in the UK.2\r\n\r\nIt is widely accepted that erectile dysfunction is a sentinel marker and predictor of coronary heart disease and metabolic syndrome, especially in aging men.3 Erectile dysfunction and heart disease have both common and shared risk factors; these have been described as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and smoking cigarettes.4-6 Conditions which affect women in a similar way may also present as sexual problems, although the problems themselves may present through different portals and with differing degrees of bothersomeness or distress.7 There are already numerous good reviews in the literature for men with sexual problems but increasing attention is now being given to women's sexual problems.8 As the profession is increasingly aware of the need to screen for endocrinological disorders, diabetes mellitus and other treatable medical conditions in men, we must now ensure we apply a similar process and ensure equity for women.\r\n\r\nThis series of articles brings together a number of themes which may affect sexual wellbeing. For many individuals, sexual activity is not always a positive or gainful experience, and a key area where increasing clinical involvement is sought is dealt with by Cybulska in her article on sexual assault (JRSM 2007;100:321-324). The series will continue with five further articles, covering user perceptions of what sexual health may be; better education, access to contraception and (where necessary) termination of pregnancy services; a review of sexually transmitted infections, complemented by the review of 25 years of HIV management of HIV; and a review article on the assessment and management of sexual problems focusing on women.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Gott et al.9 undertook in-depth, semi-structured interviews of 22 GPs and 35 practice nurses. The barriers to frank communication described by the interviewees included ‚Äòopening up a can of worms‚Äô that would have to have been followed through; fear of patients believing that the clinicians may be sexualizing the consultation; middle age and older patients who may be more easily offended and sensitive to such issues; patients from ethnic minorities who may not openly discuss such issues; religious beliefs; fear of possible prejudice towards non-heterosexual patients; and a general uncertainty regarding which terms to use.\r\n\r\nSimilar issues of poor training and fear of raising the subject have been described by Rele and Wylie10 and Humphrey and Nazareth.11 The latter noted personal embarrassment, inadequate skills and knowledge and a fear that ‚Äòa flood gate‚Äô might be opened as key issues.\r\n\r\nClearly, more than just addressing lack of awareness and knowledge is necessary to secure the confidence of the physician to broach and manage the topics within the specialty. For many clinicians and patients, the scope contained within this series can act only as a taster for future collaborative thinking and working. I hope it serves to initiate new ways of thinking and interest in sexuality and sexual health.",

The present study examined social anxiety as a predictor of dating aggression within a late adolescent sample. Two forms of dating aggression were assessed: physical aggression, such as slapping, use of a weapon, or forced sexual activity, and psychological aggression, such as slamming doors, insulting, or refusing to talk to one's partner. One aspect of social anxiety, Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE), emerged as a significant predictor of male dating aggression, even after controlling for relationship quality. Notably, FNE was most predictive of increased aggression of both types when men also perceived their romantic relationship to be more antagonistic. Despite its demonstrated importance as a contextual variable, however, relationship quality did not mediate the association between FNE and psychological or physical aggression. Implications for prevailing conceptualizations of social anxiety and dating aggression are discussed.",

      "abstract": "This research employs a longitudinal design to re-examine the linkage between psychological well-being and marital status. Results indicate that positing a causal relationship between psychological measures and marital status may be an oversimplification. When male respondents were followed through the separation/divorce process, it was found that their attitudes did not change substantially. Their well-being scores before, during, and after separation/divorce were, however, consistently lower than those of the stably married control group. This relationship was independent of whether the respondents were experiencing afirst, second, or subsequent marriage or separation/divorce. These results suggest that there needs to be further investigation into the possibility that separation/divorce is more likely to occur to men with low psychological well-being attitudes. Researchers cannot simply assume that the lower well-being scores of the separated/divorced are totally due to the separation/divorce process or the separated/divorced marital status.",

It is rev ealed that dissociated structure of psychological well-being that is characteristic of the second half of the middle adulthood (ages 50 to 59) is getting more integrate during la te adulthood, reaching integration peak at the age of 66‚Äì69 years. Such structure is suppor ted by expressed orientation of an individual to the communication motive and is regul ated by self-confidence and self- respect of a person under conditions of absence of inner conflicts and self-accusations. For women it is more important to have a positive s elf-attitude, while for men ‚Äì not to have negative one. During pre-peak period (ages 5 0 to 59) experience of psychological well-being rolls out at the background of the weakl y expressed tendency to decrease the motive of general activity; in post-peak period ( ages 70 to 79) motivational profile of a personality becomes little differentiated. In both cases individual‚Äôs self-confidence is growing, however, the position of inner independenc e and autonomy is lost. The conclusion is made that the age of 66‚Äì69 years is t he most favorable period of late adulthood from the viewpoint of integrity of psycho logical well-being of a person. Psychological accompaniment of positive functioning of women lies in the correction of negative self-attitude (ages 50 to 59), protection of inner world from excessive external interference (ages 60 to 65), stimulation of positi ve self-attitude (ages 66 to 69), combination of positive self-attitude stimulation a nd negative self-attitude correction (ages 70 to 79). There is a different strategy of w orking with men: support of positive self- attitude (ages 50 to 59), negative self-attitude co rrection (ages 60 to 69), protection of inner world from external interference (ages 70 to 79).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Male suicide rates represent a public health crisis. In almost every country, more men die by suicide than women and suicide is a leading cause of death for men in the United States and the United Kingdom. Evidence suggests that men are less likely than women to access professional support for suicidal distress. Ensuring more men access support is a critical component of suicide prevention. This study explores responses from 725 men, worldwide, who have attempted suicide or have had thoughts of suicide in the last year, to an open-text question about the barriers they experience to accessing professional support. Using a thematic analysis, results reveal the multifaceted barriers some men experience regarding a lack of motivation, a lack of psychological capability, and/or a lack of physical/social opportunity to access support. Findings suggest that many men have sought support but had negative experiences and that many others want help but cannot access it. Barriers include prohibitive costs and waiting times; potential costs to identity, autonomy, relationships and future life opportunities; a lack of perceived psychological capability; a lack of belief in the utility of services and a mistrust of mental health professionals. Findings suggest the importance of examining the role of male gender in male help-seeking behaviours. We suggest 23 recommendations for services and public health messaging to increase men's help-seeking behaviours.",

This chapter highlights older men's diverse experiences and attitudes toward sexuality in later life and how these can be understood and translated into improved understanding of their sexual rights. Three ways in which men relate to sexuality in later life are elaborated on in the following: aspirations to continued sexual assertion, potency and performance; renouncing sexuality; and redefining and broadening concepts of sex and sexuality. There are also differences between men with respect to whether the renunciations of sexuality are voluntary and experienced as a freedom or if they were felt as involuntary. Both heterosexual and non-heterosexual men report that sexual interest and desire may decline as one ages. For some heterosexual men, experiences of ageing embodiment, including but not limited to a decline in erectile function, meant an increasing focus on wider pleasures.",

Greater levels of depressive symptoms were found for unmarried compared to married. A significant three-way interaction between marital status, gender, and resource variable was found only for religious social support. When religious social support was high, married men reported fewer depressive symptoms compared to nonmarried men ( p = .02). In contrast, when religious social support was high, nonmarried women reported fewer depressive symptoms than married women, but these differences only approached statistical significance ( p = .06). The role of religious resources on marital status and depression differed by sex in our sample of African American adults. Understanding these influences may help to address mental health needs of married and unmarried African Americans and suggest a potentially influential role for religious resources.",

Child-related barriers are those which arise from developmental characteristics of the child and/or emotional turmoil experienced by the child as a result of the abuse. Relational barriers are those which arise from the nature or characteristics of a relationship or set of relationships which can be actual or perceived. Social barriers are those which arise from broader societal responses to or messages about sexual abuse that may prevent disclosure.",

There seems to be a built-in tension between the two: this is evident, for example, in negative emotions such as envy and hate, where one person has a significant negative attitude toward another. This tension is also obvious in positive emotions, such as schadenfreude, where an individual is pleased about the other‚Äôs misfortune. Such tension may even be greater in romantic love, where the lover should give special attention and status to the beloved. The tension gains further momentum when we assume that self-fulfillment is an essential feature of romantic relationships. Indeed, it seems that in many low-quality romantic relations, the tension between self-fulfillment and the needs of the beloved is real and toxic. However, in enduring profound love, which involves the personal growth of each partner, self-fulfillment is not egoistic, and the tension drives mutual thriving.",

Multi-partner behaviour among men, which is frequent, often simultaneous and ongoing, appears to be closely linked to conflict and violence in couples, but the probability of being a victim to such violence is partly rooted in childhood difficulties and violence suffered in a family context. The latter is characterised by significant residential proximity, complex family configurations, and the composite sibling configurations that result therefrom. Female single-parent households show particular characteristics depending on whether the mother has visitingpartner relationships, is separated from the father or fathers of her children, or has never had sustained love or sexual relationships.",

The questionnaire was subsequently administered to 212 married undergraduate and graduate female volunteers at a midwestern commuter university.

No statistically significant relationships were found between ever having experienced a sexual fantasy and satisfaction with current sex life nor between frequency of sexual fantasizing and satisfaction with current sex life.

Secondary vaginismus occurs often after vulvovaginal trauma such as infection, childbirth, malignancy or its treatment, or sexual trauma such as rape or abuse.

The main problem is that there are no criminal provisions governing incest that are committed consensual in adulthood, so studies are needed to provide solutions in resolving cases that occur in the future. The results of this study are that the Criminal Code only regulates acts of sexual immorality against biological children, stepchildren, adopted children or children who are in their care with an element of coercion but does not regulate consensual sexual relations (incest) that is committed consensual at an adult age which has implications for law enforcement difficulties if this case happened. The regulation in the future is to stipulate incest which is done voluntarily at the age of adulthood as a crime.

      "title": "Triggers and Fuses in Late Divorce",
      "abstract": "Abstract The narratives of six Israeli men and nine Israeli women who divorced at ages above 45 were analyzed by qualitative methods to explore the process of marital deterioration in this age group, in marriages of fifteen years and more. Narrators' ratings of their marriages ranged from \"excellent\" to \"disastrous.\" The major causes of marital failure described were lack of emotional mutuality and communication, physical and emotional abuse, and alternative adulterous relationships. Health and other crises were significant for some couples. Half the couples had been in marital therapy and half in individual therapy. Severe problems went on for many years, as did the contemplation of divorce. Some reported great suffering yet did not find the strength to initiate a divorce. Often a personal growth experience or development of inner strength helped one side to take the initiative to divorce after years of mutual suffering. The narrators emphasized suffering within the marriage more heavily than outside attractions; but half of the initiators had alternative relationships at the time of the initiation. Divorce in this group was a process that developed over a long time, not a spontaneous or impulsive response to any immediate acute trigger.",

      "title": "Relationship Quality Between Partners Following Infidelity in the Absence of Renewed Love",
      "abstract": "Abstract Infidelity means having any secret emotional, sexual, virtual relationship, or a combination of them outside the marital relationship. Infidelity has a significant prevalence as one of the major reasons of divorce, which causes psychological traumas in victims. Various studies in different cultures have revealed that extramarital affairs in each culture can have different meanings and, consequently, different effects, but what is obvious is that extramarital affairs in any form (emotional, sexual, online, or a combination) as a stressful event have detrimental effects on the family unit and various dimensions of victim‚Äôs and his/her spouse‚Äôs mental health. Research has shown that infidelity has many psychological effects on its victims. Affective experiences and reactions, cognitive experiences and reactions, psychosomatic and physical experiences and reactions, communication experiences and reactions, as well as spiritual experiences and reactions are among the psychological reactions and complex problems encountered by the victims. If the victims of infidelity are not treated, harmful consequences can last for a long time. Moreover, experts have acknowledged that couples involved in infidelity can be helped out. In this report, in addition to presenting the effects and psychological consequences of infidelity, effective factors for the treatment of these clients are discussed.",

      "title": "Individual Differences in Reactions to Rejection",
      "abstract": "Abstract Demonstrated here are the distinctive personality traits that matter in the discussion of rejection responses. On one hand, such reactions can be classified as emotionally rooted, cognition grounded, and behaviorally linked; while on the other, feedbacks can be based upon the level of self-confidence, conceit, anxiety, depression, attachment style, perceived social support, and sexual orientation. The extent of sensitivity to rejection is accounted for by the quality of personal relationships, which eventually establish the physical and the psychological well being of an individual. Although people are expected to experience negative emotions when faced with denunciation, refusal, or elimination (due to several factors), they react differently. Integrated and socially involved people are more likely to constructively surpass misfortunes, sudden unemployment, the unexpected death of loved ones, and other possible shocks. Similarly, people who lack healthy and affirmative social ties are more inclined to take maladaptive actions when they encounter difficult situations.",

      "title": "CONCEPTO, FACTORES DE RIESGO Y EFECTOS PSICOPATOL√ìGICOS DEL ABUSO SEXUAL INFANTIL",
      "abstract": "El abuso sexual se refiere a cualquier conducta sexual mantenida entre dos personas (al menos, una de ellas, menor), entre las que existe una situacion de desigualdad -ya sea por razones de edad o de podery en la que el menor es utilizado para la estimulacion sexual de la otra persona. Mas que la diferencia de edad -factor, sin duda, fundamental que distorsiona toda posibilidad de relacion libremente consentida-, lo que define el abuso es la asimetria entre los implicados en la relacion y la presencia de coaccion -explicita o implicita(Lopez, 1997; Sosa y Capafons, 1996). No deja por ello de ser significativo que el 20 por ciento del abuso sexual infantil este provocado por otros menores. Las conductas abusivas incluyen un contacto fisico (genital, anal o bucal), o suponen una utilizacion del menor como objeto de estimulacion sexual del agresor (exhibicionismo o voyeurismo), o incluso de terceras personas, como cuando se utiliza a un nino para la produccion de pornografia (Madansky, 1996). . No es facil determinar la incidencia real de este problema en la poblacion porque ocurre habitualmente en un entorno privado -la familiay los menores pueden sentirse impotentes para revelar el abuso (Nogueral, 1997). Segun el informe de Finkelhor, Hotaling, Lewis y Smith (1990) -primera encuesta nacional de Estados Unidos, llevada a cabo en adultos, sobre la historia de abuso sexual-, un 27 por ciento de las mujeres y un 16 por ciento de los hombres reconocian, retrospectivamente, haber sido victimas de abusos sexuales en la infancia. En Espana, la frecuencia de los abusos, al menos en un sentido muy amplio del termino, puede afectar al 20 por ciento de la poblacion (23 por ciento de chicas y 15 por ciento de chicos). Al margen de esta tasa de prevalencia-ya de por si muy alta-, en el 44 por ciento de los casos el abuso no se ha limitado a un acto aislado (Lopez, 1995, 1997).",

      "title": "Coming Out as Lesbian or Gay",
      "abstract": "Abstract The homosexual adolescent's decision to come out as gay or lesbian for the first time is a task which requires a certain level of inner and outer resources. Despite the fact that coming out is viewed by the literature as one of many necessary developmental steps in sexual identity formation and self-acceptance, coming out can be viewed as a unique stage in this developmental continuum. Coming out is an acknowledgment of one's orientation to another person. Thus, coming out is more than an intrapsychic process; it influences interpersonal relationships as well. A whole host of factors, including identity confusion, low self-esteem, depression, alienation, withdrawal, substance abuse, and indulgence in self-destructive behavior, may result if the adolescent has little or no support in this critical developmental stage process. Involvement in the gay community or other types of homosexual peer groups offers a unique sense of support that is especially needed during the coming out period.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders can be a burden for the patient and his family. They affect the family everyday functioning, require greater demands on adaptation and re-evaluation of the existing habits of family members and consequently may result in family dysfunction due to anxiety disorders, especially in marital relationship or partnership. However, the knowledge about the impact of anxiety disorders on one or both partners in marital or partner life is still limited.The relevant studies were identified through the Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases, within the period 1990-2017. Additional references were found using reviews of relevant articles. The search terms included \"anxiety disorders,\"\"marital problems,\" \"marital conflicts,\" \"partnership,\" \"family functioning,\" and \"communication.\"Dissatisfaction in a relationship can act as a trigger for the development of anxiety disorders and could also be responsible for the modulation and maintenance of these disorders. However, this dissatisfaction may also be the consequence of manifestation of the anxiety disorders. The individuals with the anxiety may feel guilty about their partners because of the tolerance and help (does not matter what kind and quality of the help he/she provides), sometimes they are submissively grateful because of the support, they may feel inferior, tend to serve him /her. On the other hand, he/she begins to rebuke partner's supposed negative attitudes; the patient may start to use his psychological problems as an excuse and expects others to help him and solve the situation. Consequently, he /she starts to check and criticize the partner and this tense situation may lead to problems in marriage and disturbs family functioning.Distress elements that contribute to the development of anxiety disorders can be diverse and sometimes it is not easy to identify so-called precipitating factors. The link between anxiety disorders and family relationships is bi-directional: psychological problems adversely affect patient relationships and attitudes of the partner towards the patient significantly affect his/her anxiety.",

These concepts are in fact related to the known phenomena of reactance and self-determination. Research on health resistance has contributed two central reasons for the deliberate disregard or dismissal of health messages by reasonable people: one, a different definition or interpretation of health and health maintenance (largely encompassing free-will ideas) and two, a suspicion of authority-driven science, medicine, and government-funded communication. These findings ask questions about a strict adherence to a particular idea of human health and life, and a particular format of communicating these ideas.",

Sexual disgust can also be conceptualized from a relational perspective that draws on oedipal psychodynamics as well as recent research on disgust as a form of embodied moral cognition. From a subjective viewpoint, sexual disgust is self-affirming, as it preserves the purity, sanctity, and desirability of the self in the face of polluting sexual contact. Yet from an other-centered viewpoint, sexual disgust precludes empathic recognition when it shames the object of sexual disgust and rationalizes its mistreatment. This dialectic of assertion (i.e., refusal to submit to something sexually disgusting) and recognition (i.e., affirmation as an object of sexual desire) plays out in adult romantic relationships when one partner‚Äôs sexual delight is the other partner‚Äôs sexual disgust.",

      "abstract": "Violence is not uncommon in the contemporary world. The consequences of harmful experiences in childhood are often educational problems, difficult behavior, failure to cope in adulthood, duplication of learned, negative behavior patterns and disorders in various spheres/areas of life. The experience of childhood violence is associated with the occurrence of about half of mental disorders with onset in childhood and one third of disorders that appear later in life. Various emotional and behavioral disorders are mentioned among the psychological effects of violence against a child, including depressive disorders. Regarding experiences of violence, there is strong evidence that exposure to sexual or physical violence is a predictor of depressive episodes and depressive symptoms in adolescents. Among adolescents, the impact of violence on depression has been shown to be sustained. Accordingly, evidence suggests that elevated depressive symptoms and episodes of depression may even persist for up to two years after experiencing cases of violence. Due to the destructive consequences of such behavior, international and national law devote much attention to the protection of children's rights. Under Polish law, there are regulations describing measures of reaction within the family, as well as provisions sanctioning violent behavior. Therefore, the study discusses the family and criminal law aspects of violence against minors. The whole study is imbued with considerations of the so-called the obligation to denounce, i.e., to notify about the disclosure of a prohibited act committed to the detriment of minors. This issue was presented in the context of medical secrets and its type-psychiatric discretion.",

In these situations, lower desire partners may engage in sex for avoidance goals (e.g., to avoid disappointing their partner), which are associated with negative relational outcomes. An alternative strategy to sustain relationship quality may be to decline a partner‚Äôs sexual advances in positive ways. In two experimental studies and a dyadic daily experience study with a longitudinal follow-up, we examined the relationship outcomes of positive rejection compared to avoidance-motivated sex. Across studies, when people engaged in positive rejection, both they and their partner did not experience lower levels of relationship satisfaction compared to when they had sex for avoidance goals, although this was not true for sexual satisfaction. Chronic pursuit of sex for avoidance goals did, however, have detrimental consequences over time, whereas positive rejection helped sustain relationship satisfaction. Results suggest positive rejection behaviors may be a viable alternative to avoidance-motivated sex.",

In most animal species, this process is dangerous; vigilance is reduced and vulnerability to predators increased. In mammals, the pattern of hormonal control of the female's sexual behaviour varies across species. Males are more consistent, with testosterone being necessary for both adequate sexual behaviour and male fertility in virtually all species. The variety of socio-sexual structure is also reflected in the level of sexual activity of the male and/or female that characterizes a species. The \"power\" of sexuality tends to be regarded as an aspect of masculinity, with the male, for both social and physical reasons, typically being in a position of dominance. Offering oneself as a sexual partner for payment or other material benefits is a well-established aspect of human sexuality, as well as being evident among primates.",

Men may be regarded as having greater authority than women, and the old as having unfair advantages over the young. Scarcity and inequality are also affective phenomena. A powerful chief may be oppressed by his sexual impotence. A husband will be seen to favor one wife over another. A young man will resent the privileged position of his first-born brother. And though the young are enjoined to respect the old, the old are not always deserving of respect. In other words, speaking one's mind or expressing one's true feelings is often incompatible with the demands of etiquette, and this puts people in double-binds.",

In addressing these issues with bisexual clients, the therapist is well advised to recognize the diversity that exists within this population regarding the pathways that individuals take in the course of acknowledging and coming to terms with their sexual orientation. It is important for the therapist to recognize that for most bisexual clients, the presenting issues are those that are common to most psychotherapy clients, such as anxiety, depression, stress, and relationship issues. For others, however, there are questions about sexual identity, coming out bisexual, and the implications of their sexual attractions to both women and men. An individual may have concerns regarding whether or not to disclose his sexual orientation at the start of a new relationship, or regarding realizing for the first time that he has bisexual feelings within an already established same-sex or other-sex relationship or marriage. There may also be questions and concerns regarding HIV/AIDS. In these situations, the personal impact of living in a social context in which sexuality is thought of in dichotomous either/or terms will be a realistic concern. Current trends in the research and clinical literature regarding bisexual men will also be discussed. The variety of manifestations of bisexuality across racial, ethnic, and cultural groups will be examined, including the challenges that this may pose for clients and therapists who identify with dominant definitions of sexuality within their respective social communities. Finally, the practical value and shortcomings of the main therapeutic schools will be examined in terms of providing bisexual men with effective and affirmative psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Individuals do not always accurately report the forces driving their policy preferences. Such inaccuracy may result from the fact that true justifications are socially undesirable or less persuasive than competing justifications or are unavailable in conscious awareness. Because of the delicate nature of these issues, people may be particularly likely to misstate the reasons for preferences on gay marriage, abortion, abstinence-only education, and premarital sex. Advocates on both sides typically justify their preferences in terms of preserving social order, maintaining moral values, or protecting civil liberties, not in terms of their own sexual preferences. Though these are the stated reasons, in empirical tests we find that psychophysiological response to sexual images also may be a significant driver of policy attitudes.",

      "abstract": "Sexual narcissism, an egocentric pattern of sexual behavior, has recently been described in the literature and has been discovered to be associated with cluster B type personality disorders. Although the research seems to have validated sexual narcissism as a characteristic of borderline and histrionic personality disorders, it is yet to be tested with narcissistic personalities. In an effort to further explore this relationship as well as the validity of sexual narcissism, this study systematically compared a sample (ages 24-33 years) of males with narcissistic personality disorder with an adequately matched sample of males without personality disorders. As compared to the control group, narcissistic men were found to have significantly lower self-esteem, more negative attitudes toward sex, greater egocentric patterns of sexual behavior, more conservative or traditional gender-role orientation, and greater sexual preoccupation. Despite these findings, there were no significant differences between the groups on sexual depression and the narcissistic men evidenced significantly higher sexual esteem. Implications for these findings are discussed.",

Results indicated that (a) both women and men are more selective when selecting a long-term rather than a short-term relationship partner, and (b) women and men differ in their desired characteristics for short-term relationship partners and long-term relationship partners. The preferred characteristics of each sex support a qualified differential parental investment perspective: men see `reproductive value' (e.g., physical attractiveness) as important for potential female partners, and women look at `resource acquisition ability' (e.g., earning capacity) as important for potential male partners. While there were significant differences between men and women in their desired characteristics in short- and long-term relationship partners, there were many similarities in what they seek, such as the desire for children in long-term partners and an exciting personality in short-term and long-term partners.",

      "title": "Resilience",
      "abstract": "Resilience is the capacity to maintain stable levels of functioning, as well as positive emotions and generative experiences, following or under conditions of significant adversity. Resilience researchers have largely focused on two broad types of adversity: (1) acute and time-limited events that are outside the range of ordinary experience, such as physical or sexual assault, traumatic injury, disease, natural disaster, mass casualty events, war, and interpersonal loss; and (2) chronic enduring stressors, usually experienced in childhood, such as neglect, socioeconomic disadvantage, oppressive political conditions, and physical or mental abuse. Although these two types of adversity necessarily entail different methods and theoretical frameworks, research findings from both literatures have converged on a common conclusion: resilience is common, even under the most extreme adversity. The empirical study of psychological resilience as such is a relatively recent phenomenon‚Äîuntil about thirty-five years ago it drew almost no serious scientific attention. Recently, however, the resilience literature has burgeoned at an exceptional rate. Unfortunately, the study of resilience has been plagued by definitional controversies and methodologically uninformative research. One important cleavage concerns the way resilience is defined and measured. A substantial body of research defines resilience as a personality construct; another literature insists that resilience is defined as an outcome (or process) in response to the experience of significant adversity. Although both approaches have produced relevant and informative research, it is worth noting that, in sheer volume, most resilience research is now devoted to the personality-as-resilience approach. Because these studies often do not study reactions to a marker event, rely exclusively on self-report scales, and employ cross-sectional designs, they are usually (but not always) of inferior methodological quality. Consistent with the suggestions of a number of scholars, this latter approach is described here as ‚Äúresiliency,‚Äù not resilience. Although this bibliography includes high-quality studies that define resilience as a personality construct, most of the research and scholarship listed here operationally defines resilience as an outcome or process that unfolds following acute adversity or during chronic forms of adversity.",

Research in sexual medicine has prompted clarity in terminology and definitions in order to conduct systematic studies of general value. Revised definitions of women's sexual dysfunctions have been proposed that do not generally separate organic- from psychogenic-caused dysfunctions and recognize many incentives for women's sexual activity. Sexual dysfunctions in women are relatively common with prevalence rates of 45‚Äì60%. More than one sexual dysfunction often occurs in one person. Sexual dysfunctions in women are closely associated with their partner's dysfunction. Mostly health-related risk factors for sexual dysfunctions can be identified.",

      "title": "The Role of Brain Opioid Transmission in the Conditioned Ejaculatory Preference of the Male Rat",
      "abstract": "The experiments presented in this thesis examined the role of opioids in sexual pleasure, particularly during early formative sexual experiences, on the ability of male rats to associate an olfactory or somatosensory cue with their ejaculation-induced sexual reward state. The results show that opioids are an important substrate of the sexual reward state, and that this state feeds forward to form a conditioned ejaculatory preference (CEP), in which male rats ejaculate preferentially with females bearing or wearing the cue associated with sexual reward. This suggests that sexual reward (a presumably ‚Äúproximate‚Äù cause of behavior) lies at the root of monogamous mate choice in the rat. These data also contribute to a growing body of evidence that the species‚Äô specific sexual strategies of the male rat, often described as promiscuous, evidence a degree of plasticity that can move toward a monogamous mate choice when features of a familiar female (odor or jacket) are associated with sexual pleasure. This conditioned ejaculatory preference for familiar cues suggests that proximate pleasure-related states act as a Pavlovian US that can reinforce cue-related CSs to create partner and mate preferences. Such preferences bring proximate reward states into synch with reproductive choice, potentially enhancing reproductive success. Findings are discussed, as well as further directions.",

      "abstract": "Logic would suggest that women with low sexual desire do not acquire sexually transmitted infections. However, this may not be the case. Until recently, it has been considered that sexual activity in women is initiated by desire, which produces arousal. This leads to orgasm and resolution.1, 2 In practice, sexual desire and arousal are not isolated psychological and physiological states but interdigitate and feed back on each other. In a new relationship a woman's sexual desire is often spontaneous.3 In effect this means that thoughts of her partner or seeing him are sufficient to produce an urge to want sexual relations to take place. This produces both mental excitement and bodily arousal (for example, vaginal lubrication, uterine ‚Äútenting,‚Äù breast enlargement). These sensations (arousal) feed back to produce a greater desire for intercourse. However, it is also well recognised that women are less attentive to genital sensations than men, and indeed may lubricate and vasocongest in the vulva and vagina in the absence of mental sexual excitement.\n\nThe DSM IV definition of low sexual desire, or to be more precise, hypoactive sexual desire disorder is ‚Äúpersistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. ‚Ä¶",

Because of the incongruence between their assigned gender and experienced gender, these children may experience clinically significant distress and are consequently often in need of clinical attention (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).",

      "abstract": "Allegations of sexual assault, both true and false, are common and cause considerable harm. False allegations may be deliberate or inadvertent or partially true with elements distorted or embellished. Deliberate fabrications are usually motived by personal gains such as material profit, revenge, provide an alibi, or to win sympathy. Sometimes, those making false allegations may have underlying mental health issues. Other cases of wrongful allegations arise when accusers sincerely but falsely believe they have been sexually assaulted, either naming the wrong person or recounting an event that did not occur. Memories may not be accurate, and new post-event information can become incorporated to create false memories. When investigators believe that abuse has occurred, confirmatory bias may mean that only evidence supporting the allegation is sought, and evidence contradicting the claim is ignored or misinterpreted. Examples include custody disputes and widespread allegations of ritual abuse in day-care centres in the 1990s. The premise that false allegations rarely happen, and that all sexual offence complainants must be believed, has led to prosecution policy assuming presumptive guilt of the defendant. Convictions based solely on believing the complainant not the defendant in the absence of any corroborative evidence could be considered counter to the premise of guilty beyond reasonable doubt. This chapter explores some of the factors that may influence outcome.",

      "abstract": "The stable marriage problem is a well-known problem of matching men to women so that no man and woman, who are not married to each other, both prefer each other. Such a problem has a wide variety of practical applications, ranging from matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching students to schools or more generally to any two-sided market. In the classical stable marriage problem, both men and women express a strict preference order over the members of the other sex, in a qualitative way. Here we consider stable marriage problems with quantitative preferences: each man (resp., woman) provides a score for each woman (resp., man). Such problems are more expressive than the classical stable marriage problems. Moreover, in some real-life situations it is more natural to express scores (to model, for example, profits or costs) rather than a qualitative preference ordering. In this context, we define new notions of stability and optimality, and we provide algorithms to find marriages which are stable and/or optimal according to these notions. While expressivity greatly increases by adopting quantitative preferences, we show that in most cases the desired solutions can be found by adapting existing algorithms for the classical stable marriage problem.",

      "abstract": "Emerging literature on dating goals suggests that young people have different reasons to date and that their dating goals orient both their behaviors and are important to attainment of life satisfaction. Four dating goals have received previous empirical support among late adolescents and emerging adults: intimacy, identity, social status and sexuality, with identity being the most salient domain and having important implications for satisfaction. However, up to now, no research has examined how dating goals may differ according to sexual attractions and gender. In this study, differences in dating goals, goal-consistent behaviors and domain-relevant satisfaction were investigated among a diverse sample of same-sex and other-sex attracted youth (N = 208 Australian; 91% Caucasian; 66% females; 43% same-sex attracted; Mage= 23.5 years, SD=4.1). Contrary to predictions, males did not report higher levels of sex dating goals, behaviors or satisfaction than females. In fact, females in the current study reported greater satisfaction with their sex-life than males. As predicted, females also reported higher levels of identity dating goals, preference for affiliation behaviors and satisfaction with their independence as compared to males. When same- and other-sex attracted young people were compared on goals, behavior and satisfaction in each domain, few differences emerged. However, contrary to expectations, same-sex attracted youth reported less satisfaction with their sex-life than their other-sex attracted peers. Furthermore, although none of the interaction effects between gender and attractions were significant for dating goals or domain-relevant satisfaction, an interesting interaction effect of gender and attraction was found for affiliative behavior. This interaction showed that same-sex attracted males and other-sex attracted females were significantly higher on preference for affiliation than other-sex attracted males and same-sex attracted females, respectively. Implications and future directions for research are discussed.",

They become cynical, malicious, and mean; that is to say, their libido regresses to the 'pre-genital stages of development', and sometimes expresses itself in undisguised anal and urethral eroticism, voyeurism, exhibitionism, and a tendency to masturbation. The process is apparently the same as that which Sigmund Freud describes as underlying paraphrenia; in both cases there is the same abandonment of object-cathexis and the same regression to narcissism. The exaggerated dissipation of sexual interests of many people at the climacteric is a symptom of over-compensation, of the healing tendency, while the real state of the distribution of the libido is represented by the ideas of impoverishment and guilt which accompany the patient's depression.",

      "abstract": "Recommendation for abortion on psychiatric grounds is becoming comparatively more frequent; however, except for severe mental retardation, there are no unequivocal psychiatric grounds. In countries with liberal abortion laws, abortions are recommended for sociomedical reasons much more often than for purely psychiatric reasons, and yet there is little data to enable the psychiatrist to assess these cases objectively and scientifically. He has to rely on his own personal opinion. It seems that psychiatric illness occurring as a result of therapeutic abortion is uncommon, but it does sometimes occur in women who are less psychologically healthy than normal. However no studies have been carried out on unselected cases. Studies on women who have been refused abortion show that the risk of suicide is almost nil, but in some circumstances the risk of criminal abortion is high, but again no studies have been done on unselected cases. The situation in countries with liberal abortion laws is described. The recent amendment to the Criminal Code of Canada does not change the legal position regarding abortion except for setting up a procedure to examine applications. The Canadian law still does not permit abortion for socio-medical, humanitarian or eugenic reasons. The role of Canadian psychiatrists in therapeutic abortion is discussed and a brief survey has been carried out on their interpretation of the law.",

      "title": "Reproductive Tactics of Male Savanna Baboons",
      "abstract": "Abstract The strongly related parameters rank, age and period-of-residence determine which reproductive tactics a savanna baboon male will use primarily. Baboon males go through the following phases with respect to the use of mating tactics, as they are longer in the group and thus grow older and, as a rule, drop in rank: Phase 1. Peripheral, relatively little social contact, low mating success, building up of a social bond with a few females. Phase 2. High mating success, based on individual fighting ability, social bonds mainly with females that are, or will soon be, sexually attractive. Phase 3, variant a. (Males that were very successful in Phase 2). Considerable time devoted to guarding infants conceived in phase 2 and to the mothers of those infants. Mating activity drops sharply compared to Phase 2. Phase 3, variant b. (Males that did not go through a very successful Phase 2). Low mating success through whatever tactic, relatively peripheral. Phase 4. Relatively high mating success, partly through collaboration with other males. Considerable time is invested in the care for potential offspring and their mothers. Phase 5. Diminishing share in the total mating activity in the group. The support for infants is spread over a relatively large class of infants conceived after immigration. Social contact with a large number of females. The data did not show the relation between agonistic rank and mating success predicted by ALTMANN'S priority-of-access model. A modification of the model is presented, which allows for coalition formation among males that are too low in rank to be successful on their own. This model could not fully explain, however, the exceptional success of some middle ranking males. The theory of Coalition games can give insight in the processes that lead to distributions of mating success that depart from the modified priority-of-acces model. The lack of agreement between the data and the original priority-of-access model cannot be explained by higher selectivity of the high ranking males. The only qualitative parameter of consorts obtained, according to which high ranking males had an advantage, is the time of the day on which mating activity takes place. This is a direct result of the way in which males obtain their consorts. Consorts are often formed in the sleeping trees during the night or in the early morning. In that situation single, strong males have an advantage in conflicts against coalitions of lower ranking males. Lower ranking males have a relative advantage later in the day, when conflicts are fought out on the ground.",

      "title": "Management of sexual health during old age",
      "abstract": "Discussion on sexual health revolves around an individual‚Äôs ability to (a) be intimate with a partner, (b) communicate about sexual needs and desires, (c) be sexually functional, (d) act intentionally and responsibly, and (e) set appropriate sexual boundaries. Sexually functional indicates to have desire, become aroused, and obtain sexual fulfilment. The author of this work argues that in the context of old age or elderly people, there exists misconception that older adults are neither sexually active nor interested in sex, it no so. They have sexual desires, however, the extent (and nature) may vary. The fact is that older adults are still sexually active, although the frequency of sexual activity tends to decline with age. In terms of need for research-led discussion, it is important to note that sexual health is of lifelong importance; it is vital for overall health and wellbeing. More specifically, older people have specific needs relating to their sexual health. Sexual health throughout the life course is increasingly recognised as important to maintaining one's overall ‚Äòhealth‚Äô, and ‚Äòwell-being‚Äô (including ‚Äòrelationships‚Äô). However, evidence on effective interventions to support later-life sexual health is limited. It is pertinent to note that at advanced (old) age, older adults encounter several challenges in matters pertaining to fulfilment of sexual desire due to complex and multiple factors. Understanding sexual activity of older adults requires deeper insight into physical, mental and emotional aspects of health, in its totality. This paper aims to research into how people during old age can better manage their sexual health. Secondary data (‚Äòqualitative‚Äô in nature) have been used, and method of data analysis is ‚Äòdescriptive‚Äô. The paper briefly concludes that (a) people of both sexes during their old age are (still) sexually active, and (b) prioritizing self-care (keeping physical and emotional well-being) is crucial for sexual health among older adults. Communication is key to maintain healthy sexual life at later stages of life; elderly people need to learn to be open to mutually finding new ways, that ‚Äúbest suits them‚Äù, for the dual purposes of enjoying (a) sexual intercourse, and (b) intimacy.",

      "title": "Couple Relationships and Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "The importance of close relationships as a system of support for individuals with eating disorders cannot be overstated. As well as the family of origin, romantic relationships can provide a close connection and a source of comfort and support to deter from eating-related distress and promote recovery. On the other hand, such relationships can add another layer of complexity to the ED picture, and the intimate nature of the couple relationship is unique; thus, it cannot be assumed that support and interventions developed for the family of origin are directly relevant to couple relationships also. For such relationships to facilitate recovery, and to provide appropriate support, the nature of these relationships and partner experiences must be explored and better understood. Existing research is somewhat limited with regard to romantic relationships and EDs, but suggests that people with EDs experience low level of satisfaction in romantic relationships, and this is associated with ED symptomatology, perhaps bidirectionally. People with EDs also report high levels of insecurity in their relationships. Furthermore, the ED impacts upon sexual relationships, including libido, and the anticipation of a partner's physical expectations can drive ED behaviors. Studies examining experiences of the partner who does not have an ED highlight distress, and a sense of helplessness and powerlessness. There is a reported desire to help their loved one, but a need for more external support. Positive emotions such as responsibility and gratitude for being able to help are also noted. The importance of supporting recovery via the couple relationship as well as supporting those within the couple relationship is clear, including consideration of unique factors inherent in romantic and couple relationships, and necessitating a different approach from those provided with other family members. Research into couples-based treatments for specific EDs, such as UCAN for AN and UNITE-BED for binge eating, has emerged over the last decade and shown early signs of efficacy. Further work is required to demonstrate the impact of such approaches and refine these therapeutic programs. This should include consideration of greater diversity in relationships, including sexuality, gender, ethnicity, and culture.",

It was found that both health status and perceived partner's responsiveness are prominent moderators of the age effect.In the absence of social isolation and health issues, many older men show persistently active sexual lifestyles as evidenced in their interest and participation in sexual activities.

      "title": "Forgiveness or breakup: Sex differences in responses to a partner's infidelity",
      "abstract": "Abstract Infidelities--sexual, emotional, or both--afflict many long-term romantic relationships. When a person discovers a partner's betrayal, a major decision faced is to forgive the partner and remain together or to terminate the relationship. Because men and women have confronted different adaptive problems over evolutionary history associated with different forms of infidelity, we hypothesised the existence of sex differences in which aspects of infidelity would affect the likelihood of forgiveness or breakup. We tested this hypothesis using forced-choice dilemmas in which participants (N = 256) indicated how difficult it would be to forgive the partner and how likely they would be to break up with the partner, depending on the nature of the infidelity. Results support the hypothesis that men, relative to women: (a) find it more difficult to forgive a sexual infidelity than an emotional infidelity; and (b) are more likely to terminate a current relationship following a partner's sexual infidelity than an emotional infidelity. The Discussion provides directions for future work on the determinants of breakup and the psychology of forgiveness.",

      "abstract": "These reflections about late adolescence are inspired by a novel by Peter Handke, entitled \"Der kurze Brief zum langen Abschied\" (original; translated: A short letter about the long good-bye). The protagonist's troublesome and painful separation from his wife taking place during a trip through the United States is interpreted as an attachment-conflict towards the mother that has not been dissolved during late adolescence. The essential characteristic of late adolescence is taking one's final leave from the infantile and adolescent parental imagines and the reapproachment to the real parents. In case of a failure late adolescence may easily lead to a syndrome of rejection or of overadjustment or of drop-out-identity. Especially in the rejection or in the drop-out-identity one can find object-relationships resembling those found in narcicistic or borderline-disorders. In many cases these adolescents lack the transitional scope they would have needed to find their way to autonomy or to the ability of containing (BION).",

However, growing evidence suggests there are relationships that do not fit cleanly into either of those categories. One of these relationships is a \"booty-call relationship.\" The purpose of this study was to describe the sexual and emotional nature of booty-call relationships by (a) examining the types of emotional and sexual acts involved in booty-call relationships and (b) comparing the frequency of those acts in booty-call relationships to one-night stands and serious long-term relationships. In addition, the manner in which sociosexuality is associated with the commission of these acts was also examined. Demonstrative of booty-call relationships' sexual nature was individuals' tendency to leave after sex and infrequent handholding. In contrast, the romantic nature of booty-call relationships was demonstrated through the frequency of acts like kissing. The results suggest the booty-call relationship is a distinct type of relationship situated between one-night stands and serious romantic relationships.",

Results showed that, among gay men with high (but not low) internalized stigma, self-ascribed masculinity was positively related to preferences for an ideal partner with stereotypically feminine traits. Preferences for partners with gender complementary traits did not emerge among women, or among men high in self-ascribed femininity. Contrary to predictions, internalized stigma was not associated with preferences for a gender-complementary division of household chores. Instead, internalized stigma was associated with the avoidance of tasks that are stereotypically gender incongruent‚Äîwomen high (vs. low) in stigma preferred for the partner (vs. self) to do so-called masculine (but not feminine) chores, whereas men high (vs. low) in stigma preferred for the partner (vs. self) to do stereotypically feminine (but not masculine) chores.

      "abstract": "Abstract During adolescence, girls become preoccupied with the physical and emotional changes which occur over a number of years, and which translate the girl into a fully sexually and reproductively competent adult female. These changes are also associated with changes in emotional and intellectual status, which identify the adult female as different from the adult male. The outward changes of breast growth, pubic hair and axillary hair growth, and the attainment of full adult height usually precede the outward manifestation of maturity, i.e. the menarche. For many girls their first menstrual period is truly the sign of adulthood and psychologically extremely important to achieve. However, it is also associated with times of stress and the absolute wish to be normal. Thus, changes that occur which are abnormal may have a very serious impact on psychological well-being. Being normal as an adolescent and accepted as a normal member of that peer group is extremely important. In differentiating the range of normality from true abnormality, an understanding of the onset and control of puberty is essential, as in many cases, misinformation leads these adolescent teenagers to states of anxiety which can be well avoided, and a deep knowledge and understanding of the adolescent will make management effective and help her to achieve normal adulthood. In fact, in some cases, poor management of menstrual problems at the time of adolescence may leave her with a life-long menstrual phobia which may be used in later life as a prop against adversity.",

      "title": "Physical performance in high school students: effect of chronotype",
      "abstract": "Morningness-Eveningness (M-E) is an individual characteristic, defined as chronotype. People are typically categorized in 3 different chronotypes: Morning, Evening and Neither types (M, E and N-types), which differ in the circadian rhythm of many physiological variables. M-types use to wake up and go to bed early and to have their best performances in the first part of the day, otherwise E-types go to bed and wake up late and they have the peak performances in the evening. The chronotype is influenced by both individual and environmental factors and gradually changes during human development. Many studies have demonstrated a trend beginning with a tendency toward morningness in children that gradually evolves into a shift toward eveningness. Approximately at the age of 20 years, this shift reaches its maximum and starts to decline, leading to a growing tendency toward morningness from midadulthood on. This more pronounced eveningness has been found to negatively affect adolescents‚Äô sleep and daytime functioning; even physical performance of adolescents can vary throughout the day because sleep pressure increases, the input from the circadian timing system is optimal or non-optimal to perform the task or both of them. In this study participated 216 students, 124 males and 92 females, attending the first two high school classes (mean age 14-15 years). For the assessment of chronotype, all students compiled the Morningness-Eveningness Questionaire (MEQ), validated by Horne and Ostberg in 1976. For all subjects we collected anthropometric data (weight, height, BMI). All the subjects were categorized as M (n=22), N (n=165), and E-types (n=29). To assess the relationship between chronotype and physical performance, from the sample we recruited 51 subjects, 22 M-type (14 males and 8 females) and 29 E-types (18 males and 11 females), who carried out three Eurofit tests (SHR, Shuttle Run; SBJ, Standing Broad Jump; Cooper endurance test). Preliminary results, although showing some differences in physical performance between E and M chronotype, have not detected statistically significant differences between the two groups.",

A three-cluster solution was revealed for both men and women. Based on our findings, we put forward a profile for the sexually bored individual, who is more likely to be married or cohabiting with a partner, to have a boredom prone personality, to lack sexual sensation seeking, experience low sexual pleasure and satisfaction, and to present with sexual arousal and/or desire problems. Women dealing with sexual boredom might present low sexual desire for their partner but experience high sex desire for attractive others.

      "abstract": "Context: Effect of sexual relations on mental and physical health has been the concern of the Iranian physicians, over a thousand years ago. Sexual ethics is one of the specific health topics of Iranian medicine archives. From the Iranian medicine point of view, because of different mental and physical differences in human, their sexual power and need for sex is different. It is necessary to observe the normal range, since the sexual indulgence causes different illnesses. Evidence Acquisitions: In Iranian medicine, different variables such as time, location, mental and physical situation, and also various forms of sex are discussed in sexual health. Safe sex not just reduces many mental disorders, but also prevents many neurological, digestive, urinary and genital disorders. Also, sexual indulgence is most harmful for health and causes stiffness, weakness and different diseases; therefore observing moderation in sex, according to the therapeutic characteristics and power, has been emphasized. Results: To have safe sex, it is necessary to consider time, mental, and physical status. Having sex when the stomach is full impairs digestion. Sexual relationship after heavy sports and severe emotional reactions such as anger or sadness, and after diarrhea or blood sampling is harmful. It has been recommended that having sex in temperate weather, and after evacuation of urine and feces, considering necessary arrangements, make the couple reach orgasm. Also, in the Iranian traditional medicine references, specific nutritional and health recommendations have been proposed for the sexually active people. Conclusions: Health care recommendations of Iranian physicians involve precious and new points for the updated scientific communities. Scientific revision of these recommendations can be promising for public health improvement.",

Results indicated that most couples across type of relationship reported a high degree of relationship satisfaction and moderately low amounts of conflict. Overall, heterosexual, gay, and lesbian couples were fundamentally similar, and common stereotypes of each couple were not verified. Women in lesbian relationships reported significantly greater relationship satisfaction, greater hope for conflict resolution, and several more constructive conflict‚Äêresolution styles than either gay male couples or heterosexual couples. Differences appeared to be correlated with social gender role factors and common differences in relationship lifestyle features, such as the presence of children in the home.",

Early onset predicts a long antisocial career. Since antisocial behaviour and risk taking is more prevalent in men, explanations may be biological as well as social. Antisocial individuals tend to be versatile in their behaviours, although early adulthood is characterised by a switch from group offending to lone offending. Overall, diversification in antisocial behaviours is seen up to the age of about 20, followed by gradual specialisation in particular types of antisocial behaviours, such as illicit use of drugs.2\n\nIndependent precursors of an antisocial lifestyle include antisocial child behaviour, impulsivity, school failure, an antisocial family, poor parenting, and economic deprivation.2 Turning points away from an antisocial lifestyle include getting a job, getting married, moving to a better area, ‚Ä¶",

The failure to appreciate or accommodate complex emotion and willingness to recognize simplistic emotion has gendered effects. The criminal law has presumed that a woman's decision to leave an abusive situation should be easy. An affirmative assent requirement could punish people for acting in the face of ambiguity even though their partners silently consent. The emotional injuries from rape can manifest themselves in withdrawal, fear, and personal devaluation. The emotional harm inflicted when men try to coerce sex from women is routinely ignored by the criminal law.",

Also distressing were findings about ancestors who behaved badly, were treated cruelly/unfairly, or who experienced tragedy. Family historians who reported strong negative emotions were more likely than those who did not to be younger, female, spend more time on their hobby, have half-siblings, driven by the motive for greater self-understanding, and score higher on the personality trait of openness to experience but lower on emotional stability.

      "title": "A Tribute to Adaptability: Mental Illness and Dementia in Intimate Late-Life Relationships",
      "abstract": "In pondering how to conceptualize the challenges that mental illness and dementia pose to intimate relationships, an overwhelming number of permutations and combinations have occurred to me. These are very complex issues, encompassing marital and nonmarital couple relationships, family relationships, samesex relationships, and multigenerational relationships. Some are extremely stable, long relationships, such as fifty- and sixty-year marriages or partnerships. Others are much briefer, such as a second marriage after the death of a spouse in old age. Some relationships have been what I call stable incompatible relationships of long-standing duration, in contrast to the kind of comfortable and rewarding relationship that we prefer to imagine predominantly occurs in our parents' generation. Furthermore, mental illness and dementia affect relationships in rather different ways. Often, mental illness has persisted throughout adulthood (for example, in the case of schizophrenia, manic depression, major depressive disorders), and the relationship has adapted and accommodated through the years. Or not. Aging will present special challenges to those relationships, and to the intimacy that has existed. In contrast, the dementing illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease, may occur where there has been no previous serious psychopathology, so the emergence of the illness may cause a departure from the intimacy that had developed over the life of the relationship. Consequently, this paper is a discussion of variability and individual differences. Ultimately, it is also a tribute to the adaptability of the human spirit. In clinical practice, it is important to feel hopeful about a positive outcome, and over the twenty-plus years that I have been in practice, I have found that there is always a way to conceptualize a problem that allows for hope. In order to focus the discussion, I will limit this paper to dyadic relationships: couples, primarily in the context of caregiving. Several principles should be kept in mind when working with older adults. Variability among people increases with age, so it is best to avoid preconceived notions about individuals and their relationships. We like to say that human beings are most like each other at birth and become progressively more varied with each passing year. Second, regardless of whether a relationship looks desirable from some ideal point of view, some part of it has been working for this couple, and whatever that is should be the starting point for any intervention. Third, people vary tremendously in their ability to face the realities of aging, whether it is their own physical aging, health threats, or other threats to continued independence. Where one couple will retire to a life-care community as a way to accept and plan for their future needs, another will be unable to fully accept the possibility that they may well need significant assistance at some time in the future. WHAT IS INTIMACY? A dictionary definition of intimacy is, marked by very close association, contact or familiarity, of a very personal or private nature (Webster's Dictionary, r975). This definition can characterize a wide variety of relationships, from marital to family and friends and includes therapists. Intimacy has been described as having five aspects: commitment, affective intimacy, cognitive intimacy, physical intimacy, and mutuality (Moss and Schwebel, 1993). An element of closeness and self-disclosure in communication is often associated with healthy intimacy (Moss and Schwebel, 1993). In clinical practice, we see a range of abilities to communicate and, particularly, a wide range of self-disclosure in relationships. Further, cultural values are in play, particularly in the population that is now elderly, and many long-term relationships have navigated through troubled waters despite maintaining fairly superficial levels of communication. It is most useful to accept our client's or subject's perception of the success or failure of intimacy as an expression of the relationship that the person has been able to fashion over time. ‚Ä¶",

      "abstract": "Samenvatting Mannen die seks hebben met mannen (MSM) vormen een zeer diverse groep; op een aantal punten verschilt het seksuele gedrag van het seksuele gedrag van de normatieve heteroseksuele man. Het is voor de uroloog belangrijk kennis te hebben van seksualiteit en de gevolgen daarvan bij urologische ziekten, die op een aantal fronten anders zijn. Dit artikel beschrijft accentverschillen in seksuele beleving van MSM. Het geeft een overzicht van verschillende urologische diagnosen en problemen, waaronder erectie- en ejaculatiestoornissen, prostaatproblemen, hypogonadisme en urologische behandelingen, met hun relatie tot die seksuele beleving. Urogenitale maligniteiten zoals blaas-, prostaat-, penis- en testiscarcinomen komen vaker voor bij hiv. Chemseks (seks onder invloed van drugs) verhoogt het risico op urologische problemen en op soa, door vaker onveilige (ruwere) seks en meerdere sekspartners waarmee chemseks gepaard gaat. Meer kennis en een open gesprek over MSM zal leiden tot meer kennis en acceptatie van de seksuele gevolgen van urologische problemen en behandelingen bij MSM.",

      "abstract": "Although passionate or erotic love continues to receive the most attention from relationship scholars, there is a growing interest in a variety of love variously referred to as altruistic, compassionate, self-giving, or agapic love. Because this type of unconditional, other-oriented love appears to have important implications for the interpersonal dynamics and overall quality of close romantic relationships, there has been increased interest in delineating its correlates and possible causal antecedents. The goal of the present empirical investigation was to explore three potential demographic correlates of unconditional or agapic love ‚Äì age, gender, and ethnicity. A large, multi-ethnic community sample of adult men and women (N = 697) individually completed the 7-item Agapic subscale of the Love Attitudes Scale (Hendrick &amp; Hendrick, 1990). Although age was not associated with agapic love scores, a significant overall gender difference was obtained such that men scored higher than women. Ethnic differences also were found. Specifically, African American participants reported lower levels of agapic love than did Latino/a, Asian/Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic White participants.",

      "abstract": "Human beings are inherently sexual in nature. An individual's sexual behaviour can have a profound impact on the person's sexuality regardless of how this behaviour occurs, be it masturbation in isolation or penetrative intercourse with a partner. Sex per say is not always done with an aim for procreation [1]. The individual's propensity for sex can be both procreative and non-procreative. The degree of inclination and the extent of engagement in the act though will depend on the individual's society, his/her culture, upbringing, religious beliefs/taboos, other people's expectation and opportunities [2]. What constitutes a normal sexual behaviour? There is no straightforward answer. What may be normal in one culture/society may be abnormal in another. The definition of 'normalcy' is driven by society and/or cultural values, and the extent of 'deviance' is also influenced by the same. Furthermore the 'degree of deviance' in some sexual behaviours can be quantified by comparing with already established norms, but this is not possible for all sex-related behaviours and conditions [3].",

People with gender identity disorder may act and present themselves as members of the opposite sex and may express a desire to alter their bodies. The disorder affects an individual's self-image, and can impact the person's mannerisms and behavior.\r\nAs gender identity develops in children, with sex-role assignment. Sex role-stereotypes are the beliefs, characteristics and behaviors of individual cultures that are considered normal and appropriate for boys and girls to possess. These norms are influenced by ones family and friends, the mass-media, and their community. Since many cultures strongly disapprove of cross-gender behavior, it often results in significant problems for affected persons and those in close relationships with them. In many cases, discomfort is also reported as stemming from the feeling that one's body is wrong or meant to be different.\r\nThe need for treatment is emphasized by the high rate of mental health problems, including Depression with higher suicide rate among untreated transsexual people than in the general population.\r\nThese problems are not usually related to the gender identity issues themselves, but the social and cultural responses to gender-deviated individuals.\r\nAn example which classically illustrates GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER is the case of a young man from Brunei Darussalam, who was seen and treated.

      "abstract": "Rational thinking and decision making are impacted when in a state of sexual arousal. The inability to self-regulate arousal can be linked to numerous problems, like sexual risk taking, infidelity, and sexual coercion. Studies have shown that most men are able to exert voluntary control over their sexual excitation with various levels of success. Both situational and dispositional factors can influence self-regulation achievement. The goal of this research was to investigate how ego depletion, a state of low self-control capacity, interacts with personality traits-propensities for sexual excitation and inhibition-and cognitive absorption, to cause sexual self-regulation failure. The sexual responses of 36 heterosexual males were assessed using penile plethysmography. They were asked to control their sexual arousal in two conditions, with and without ego depletion. Results suggest that ego depletion has opposite effects based on the trait sexual inhibition, as individuals moderately inhibited showed an increase in performance while highly inhibited ones showed a decrease. These results challenge the limited resource model of self-regulation and point to the importance of considering how people adapt to acute and high challenging conditions.",

      "abstract": "Factors of loneliness experienced by women from different social groups, identified with factor analysis, are considered. Six structural factors were identified: neuroticism, an individual‚Äôs position in relation to herself and others, sociability, interpersonal relationships, personal potential, behavioural types. Each of these factors has a direction, so determines a woman‚Äôs sociality or, vice versa, deepness of her loneliness. We have determined that personal qualities developed due to experienced negative emotions, including low self-esteem, too high demands toward themselves and others, depression, fear and anxiety, insecurity, or emotional instability, contribute to antisocial behaviour (social indifference) and loneliness. A woman‚Äôs aggressive-negative position is one of the factors influencing her maladaptation to society and making her feels lonely. We can also argue that destructive communications also contribute to the feeling of loneliness. We have found that harmony and comfort at interpersonal relationships and loneliness depends on a woman‚Äôs position in interpersonal relationships, their distance and valence. Women with a high personal potential are less likely to experience feelings of loneliness than women with low personal potential. Moreover, fear and aggression directly affect the development of women‚Äôs depressed-aggressive behaviour, which leads to social maladaptation; this fact allowed us to understand the causes for the fear of being alone and the mechanism forming women‚Äôs feeling of loneliness.",

      "title": "Desire ‚Äì the pursuit of physical, psychological and interpersonal (and sexual) pleasure",
      "abstract": "Desire is a ubiquitous human psychological state that can influence many aspects of people's lives. Desires reflect what people crave and long for and can be based on physiological needs (e.g., hunger, thirst, rest, sex) as well as psychosocial needs (e.g., power, social connection). Desire is a profoundly emotional experience that has the power to shape our thoughts and drive our behaviour. In this chapter, we first provide a general overview of the meaning of desire, drawing upon classic perspectives. Most of the chapter, however, is focused on a commonly researched desire, namely, sexual desire. We review conceptualizations and measurement of sexual desire. Then, because sexual desire is experienced subjectively by the individual, and can vary both within and across individuals, we discuss how sexual desire can be impacted by personal characteristics (e.g., age, gender, health) and the social-environmental contexts (e.g., gender norms, cultural sexual permissiveness/restrictedness) in which individuals are embedded. Because individuals often experience sexual desire within a relational context, we then synthesize the growing and emergent study of sexual desire experienced for the romantic partner. More specifically, we describe the association between sexual desire and significant relationship experiences and properties (e.g., love, satisfaction, responsiveness). Additionally, we summarize recent studies that have used novel methodologies to explore desire, including the inevitable desire discrepancies in ongoing relationships (e.g., daily diaries), as well as identify effective strategies for couples to promote sexual desire.",

      "title": "Why Men Masturbate: Reasons and Correlates in Men with and without Sexual Dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Men purportedly masturbate for a variety of reasons, but systematic investigation of men's reasons has been lacking. We analyzed reasons why men masturbate (n = 2967, mean age = 37.7, SD = 12.9), whether men with and without sexual problems differ in their reasons, and whether those reasons vary with the frequency of masturbation and partnered sex. Results indicated that deriving pleasure, decreasing sexual tension, and reducing anxiety/stress were among the top motives, whereas partner issues were cited less frequently. Men with sexual dysfunctions showed only minor differences from men without sexual dysfunctions, the former more often citing anxiety/stress reduction as a motive. In addition, samples tapping participants from two world regions showed only minor differences in their patterns of responding. Motives for masturbation were also related to both the frequency of masturbation and the frequency of partnered sex. Overall, these findings indicate that men, like women, masturbate primarily for the positive reinforcing effects of pleasure, but in contrast with women, men are also more likely to use masturbation for the negatively reinforcing effects of reducing anxiety/distress. Unsatisfying sex with the partner and/or relationship issues were cited as a reason for masturbation in only a minority of men.",

      "title": "Developmental trajectory of substance use disorders: what role do the parents play (or are perceived to play)?",
      "abstract": "The aetiology of substance use disorders is considered to be multi-factorial as the individual, developmental and contextual dimensions interact together. From the developmental perspective, research has identified several aspects of family environment that are consistently associated with substance use disorders. Parent child interaction and parenting style are the primary focus of research. A conflict ridden and highly authoritarian parent child interaction predicts substance use in the future1. On the other hand, parenting style can both be a risk or a protective factor depending on its characteristics. Parental warmth as well as limit setting could be protective for future substance use2.\r\n\r\nParenting style is not a unitary concept. It is largely dependent on direct factors like parental personality, psychopathology, and substance use and on the indirect effects of other contextual factors like low socio-economic status (LSES), minority status, immediate environmental adversities and children's maladaptive behaviour3. Parental substance use has been consistently linked to substance use in the offspring4,5. Addicted mother's parenting has been characterized by a wide range of deficits starting from neglect, physical or emotional abuse, punishments to excessive control, lack of emotional involvement and inconsistent discipline2. In addition, parental psychopathology like depression, anxiety or antisocial personality and poor coping with stress has been demonstrated to be related with substance use disorders in their children4,6. But this indictment of the parents needs to be seen in the light of the various contextual factors2. This proposition could be more appealing in the traditional societies where there is interdependence and family is the most important institution that has survived through the ages. These traditional societies are collectivist (with a sense of harmony, interdependence and concern for others, and where collective values of the family take precedence over individual values in case of a conflict) that emphasizes family integrity, family loyalty, and family unity7.\r\n\r\nIn the article by Pettenon & colleagues published in this issue8, the perception of parental bonding has been compared between crack cocaine users and non-illicit drug users. The authors examined hospitalized cocaine dependent subjects and non-illicit drug users as control subjects, both from the same geographical area with matched demographic characteristics. Parental bonding instrument (PBI)9 was used to assess various parenting style in both the parents. PBI measures two constructs: care and control. With various permutation and combinations of these constructs, four different styles of parenting are possible: optimal parenting (high care, low control), affectionate control (high care, high control), affectionless control (low care, high control) and neglectful parenting (low care, low control)9. Results of this study demonstrated that crack cocaine users were more likely to perceive their mothers as neglectful and their fathers as carelessly controlling. On the other hand, non-illicit drug users were perceived to have optimal parenting. This study has highlighted the importance of parenting style in the developmental trajectory both as risk factors (for cocaine users) and perhaps as protective factors (for the control subjects) for development of later substance dependence.\r\n\r\nThe study was cross-sectional and conducted on an exclusively male clinical sample selected by non-random purposive method. As already acknowledged by the authors, these factors have curbed the generalizability of the study and its strength to establish causality8. But, by choosing clinical population the authors perhaps were able to tap the most severe end of the spectrum of substance use disorder which could be assumed to be homogeneous. They had a reasonably large sample size seemingly adequate for the purpose of the study. To eliminate the effects of the contextual factors like LSES, ethnic minority or adverse residential environment, the study subjects and the controls were matched as per their socio-demography. Hence, the result of ‚Äòdisordered‚Äô parental bonding in the cocaine dependent subjects was unlikely to be due to other contextual variables. Additionally, exclusion of these contextual factors has made the association of impaired parental bonding with substance dependence more specific. Nevertheless, there are a few caveats in the study. As the authors have only studied subjects with substance use disorder, there is always a possibility of subjective bias coloured by subjects‚Äô personality and personal experience. Concurrent interview of the parents could have eliminated this possibility. The subjects with cocaine dependence had significantly higher psychiatric co-morbidity than the controls. As it has been amply researched that psychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety are linked to childhood adversities and impaired parenting, presence of these co-morbidities perhaps confounded the association of parenting style and cocaine dependence10,11. However, epidemiological studies have shown that almost half of those having substance use disorders have a mental illness in their lifetime. The risk of developing a mental illness is 2-4 times more common in subjects with substance dependence than the controls12,13. Hence, it would practically be impossible to find out a substance use disorder group which does not differ significantly from controls with regard to the presence of psychiatric co-morbidity.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, there is a philosophical controversy in any research directed to the area of parenting style and future psychopathology. The controversy pivots around causality. One is reminded of Freida Fromm-Reichmann's theory of ‚Äòschizophrenogenic mother‚Äô, which stated that schizophrenia is ‚Äòcaused‚Äô due to unconscious rejection by the mother of the child (who later grows up to develop schizophrenia)14. A commentator has recently observed on its current status: ‚ÄúToday, in light of what we now understand about schizophrenia, the theory of the schizophrenogenic mother seems hopelessly mistaken, and more than a little embarrassing‚Äù15. Likewise, one has to be careful in the interpretation of this study findings, lest ‚Äòaffectionless‚Äô, ‚Äòcontrolling‚Äô and ‚Äòneglecting‚Äô parents are easily labelled as ‚Äòaddictogenic‚Äô. This could have the appalling potential to inflict pain and burden to the parents who were and would be the primary caregiver for their kids. ‚ÄòBlaming‚Äô the parenting style and family interaction for addiction in other family members could, therefore, be a double edged sword and might well be detrimental.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, important to remember that the parenting styles reported in this study8 are ‚Äòperceived‚Äô parenting styles rather than actually observed parenting styles. Such perceptions can be distorted through the looking glass of chronic addiction. It is extremely difficult to conduct prospective longitudinal cohort studies to settle this issue. In an exceptional 30-year prospective study published very recently, unsupportive maternal behaviour, actually observed and rated by a developmental psychologist at eight months of age of the infant, predicted mental health problems in the grown up adults 30 years later16. Such studies are rare to come by. ‚ÄòPerceived‚Äô parenting styles in a retrospective recall design cannot, and should not, implicate causality of addiction as ‚Äòaddictogenic‚Äô parents. The value of the current study8, therefore, does not lie in inference of causality of any sort, but in the very fact that these ‚Äòperceived‚Äô parenting styles can have important bearing on the course and outcome of the subjects‚Äô substance use trajectory. These need to be considered in the therapy of these subjects.\r\n\r\nThe present study by Pettenon & colleagues8 is from Brazil, which is one of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries which are developing or newly industrialised countries, distinguished by their large, fast-growing economies. All these countries have their commonalities in the primacy of family or collectivistic society over the individualistic society. Hence, the results of this study could be equally relevant and meaningful for Indian context.",

      "title": "Biological sex differences relevant to mental health",
      "abstract": "Scientific interest in the effects of the female sex steroids on modulating mood and behaviour stems largely in the modern era from the well-recognized sex differences found in certain psychiatric disorders.The finding across many cultures and ethnic backgrounds from large epidemiological studies that women have twice the prevalence rate for depression as men, that this only becomes apparent after the onset of puberty, and that after the menopause rates return to near parity between the sexes, is a strong finding implicating a role for female gonadal hormones in playing an active part in such discrepancy. Further epidemiological evidence for sex steroids' capability to impact on mood and behaviour comes from the high rate of mood disturbance and psychosis seen in the postpartum period, a time of dramatic and rapid change in gonadal steroid secretion, in addition to the occurrence of a discrete menstrual cycle-related mood disorder (the premenstrual or late luteal phase dysphoric disorder), for which removal of the ovaries has been noted to be curative. Some conditions which may not be associated with a sex difference in lifetime prevalence rates are nevertheless associated with marked differences in course or outcome between the sexes, such as the later age of onset of schizophrenia in females, who generally manifest a less severe disorder which is more responsive to treatment, and who display a second peak onset around the time of the menopause, all suggestive of a somewhat protective role for gonadal steroids in this disorder.How do gonadal steroids have such widespread effects on the brain so as to explain these sex differences? While current knowledge is far from complete on this issue, this chapter will outline some key structural and functional differences between a female and male brain which arise due to the differential actions of the gonadal steroids. In particular, those central structures and systems which are believed to play an integral role in the psychiatric disorders for which a marked sex difference exists will be focused upon, including the limbic system, the various neurotransmitter systems such as serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine, and finally the neuroendocrine system involved in the stress response, the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìadrenal axis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It has been argued that creativity evolved, at least in part, through sexual selection to attract mates. Recent research lends support to this view and has also demonstrated a link between certain dimensions of schizotypy, creativity, and short‚Äêterm mating. The current study delves deeper into these relationships by focusing on engagement in creative activity and employing an expansive set of personality and mental health measures (Five Factor Model, schizotypy, anxiety, and depression). A general tendency to engage in everyday forms of creative activity was related to number of sexual partners within the past year in males only. Furthermore, schizotypy, anxiety, and Neuroticism were all indirectly related to short‚Äêterm mating success, again for males only. The study provides additional support for predictions made by sexual selection theory that men have a higher drive for creative display, and that creativity is linked with higher short‚Äêterm mating success. The study also provides support for the contention that certain forms of mental illness may still exist in the gene pool because particular personality traits associated with milder forms of mental illness (i.e., Neuroticism &amp; schizotypy) are also associated directly with creativity and indirectly with short‚Äêterm mating success.",

      "title": "Male infertility: an obstacle to sexuality?",
      "abstract": "Summary Interactions between infertility and sexuality are numerous and complex. Infertile men may suffer from sexual dysfunction (SD) when undergoing an assisted reproductive technology programme. We undertook a review both in French and English of the available data on male SD when being diagnosed with a fertility problem with a specific focus on azoospermic men. The review was performed over a 30‚Äêyear time period using PubMed/Medline. The sexual concerns and needs of infertile/sterile men for whom potential parenting can be compromised were evaluated. When diagnosed with infertility, men usually go through a crisis that can have a deleterious effect on their sexuality with sometimes a feeling of sexual inadequacy. Infertile men will feel stigmatized because they are perceived as being deficient in a specific component of their masculinity. Hence, subsequent SD may occur that can impact the couple sexuality and the infertility management. However, little is known on how the announcement of azoospermia may affect male on a sexual and psychological point of view. The present review suggests that a global management through a healthcare network (biologist, andrologist, sexologist and psychologist) is required which will allow to consider infertility and its subsequent sexual disorders as a whole and not as dichotomized issues.",

      "abstract": "There are some people who simply thrive on being the centre of attention. Such people often have a whole range of accompanying personality problems which may include egocentricity, exhibitionism, suggestibility, superficiality and a tendency to overdramatise things. Consequently the person usually has poor interpersonal relationships, little consideration for other people and an inability to tolerate frustration. There may be angry outbursts particularly if the person does not get his own way. Mood fluctuations can mean that the person is crying one moment and laughing the next. While such behaviour is of course possible in either sex, the literature points to a higher incidence among females. Such females frequently dress and act seductively in relation to males. Heavy makeup is often worn and manipulation is quite common. Such people have generally suffered from some kind of emotional deprivation during formative years. Present behaviour is unconsciously motivated by anxiety and a desire to be loved and cared for. The individual may have been denied the opportunity to experience feelings of security and consistency during the process of growing up. Unfortunately for the person concerned, attention-seeking behaviour often arouses negative feelings in others.",

Present study aimed to know socio demographic variables, which are responsible for criminal behavior because criminals are not born they are made, and if we as a society can make them then we as a society also have the power to cure them. AJuvenile Delinquent, a person who is under age (below 18), who is found to have committed a crime in states which have declared by law that a minor lacks responsibility and thus may not be sentenced as an adult. The sample of the present study form 50 male delinquents children from ‚ÄúBal-Sampreshan Grah‚Äù, Manacamp, Raipur (C.G.) were purposively selected for the study. These juvenile delinquents sometimes have mental disorders/behavioural issues such as post traumatic stress disorder or bipolar disorder, and are sometimes diagnosed with conduct disorder partially as a result of their delinquent behaviours. Many factors like schools, neighbourhood, Family, Society, Situations are equally responsible for the degradation or fall of a child. Hence, instead of labelling them as one we must try and find ways, rectify the errors in their lives which led them to behave in this manner. Children can be easily rehabilitated and psychological rehabilitation can be helpful to take them back in society.",

Four patterns of friendship dissolution were identified: physical separation, new friends replace old, growing to dislike the friend, and interference from dating or marriage. The transition to college resulted in a higher rate of deteriorated friendships than was evident during the high school years, particularly for women. Significant gender differences in patterns of termination were also found: physical separation was more likely to precipitate dissolution in men's friendships, and dating or marriage was more likely to interfere with women's. The results are discussed in terms of how the experiences of the young adult life stage might result in the termination patterns observed.",

      "abstract": "I would end with some summarizing points and questions. 1. A majority of women identify gender-related issues influencing their career choices and pathways. 2. Women are diverse in their choices and priorities, with varying balances of personal and professional life. 3. Eighty-three percent of the women responding to the survey have married, and 82% of those married have children. They thus are likely to have two sets of seriously competing responsibilities. 4. It is possible to identify especially promising women during residency or fellowship. Exploring their priorities and values with good mentors will be important to avoid short-changing academic medicine of competent women. 5. Men and women need to be SUPERCHOOSERS in making the choices right for that individual, rather than superwomen or supermen. 6. We can question whether the development and potential of women (and some men) in academic medicine could be enhanced by: a. Consideration of guidance or support for child care resources? b. Flexibility in the system (tenure clock, etc.)? c. Identification of limited full-time clinical or research opportunities for faculty with young children or unusual family demands? d. Facilitation of bridging after a period of part-time activity or re-entry after limited participation? e. Consideration of part-time work at home and flexible on-site work hours for periods of special family demands? Finally, a supportive work environment is important for both men and women in medicine and is an essential priority in academic medicine. Medicine is a wonderful field. Academic medicine on my terms, to include family, has been very rewarding. Sometimes there also have been disappointments, in that I have fallen short of some of my aspirations. However, I must accept the responsibility for my choices. I owe a great debt to many of the men and women of the American Clinical and Climatological Association and of Johns Hopkins who are both friends and colleagues and especially to my husband, Dick Johns. After 42 years of marriage, I am still learning about the balance of personal and professional life. May we all be Superchoosers!",

This alteration in the testosterone-estrogen ratio can lead to feminization and sexual dysfunction. Research on the effects of alcoholism in women is less definitive; but nonetheless, points to alterations in sexual functioning as well. For the non-alcoholic, acute intoxication leads to a complex interplay of physiological, psychological and social expectations which make it difficult to predict the effect of alcohol on sexual behavior. The general concensus of the experimental evidence on alcohol's impact on sexual behavior is that is is a depressant even at low concentrations. Although sexual responsiveness is often attributed to the influence of alcohol (disinhibition theory), it appears the circumstances under which it is consumed, and the psychological state of the consumer, is as important a determinant of sexual behavior.",

      "title": "Undergraduates‚Äô awareness of White and male privilege in STEM",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background It is well-documented that experiences in STEM courses for women and students of color are different from the experiences of White men. As part of a larger interview study, 183 college seniors from diverse gender and race backgrounds were asked their thoughts on whether the experience of being a STEM major was different for people of different races and genders. We use a framework of ‚Äúscience as White property‚Äù, derived from critical race theory, to frame this study and results. Results White men were largely unaware of any impact of race or gender. In contrast, women of color overwhelmingly report, consistent with results from a large body of prior research, that both race and gender impact their experiences as STEM majors. Students who acknowledged race and gender impacts did not always attribute these impacts to cultural or systemic factors (i.e., some reported women are underrepresented because they are less interested in STEM rather than a structural reason). Impacts identified that were attributable to systemic factors included impacts related to being a demographic minority (i.e., intimidation, feeling out of place, feeling pressure to work harder) and/or discrimination (i.e., job discrimination, bias against women or people of color and cultural assumptions implying the superiority of White people and men). A small number of students (mostly White women) stated that women or people of color benefit from their underrepresented status, often attributing this benefit to a perception of extra encouragement and opportunities. A common theme across categorizations was that women and students of color work harder than men and White people either because they are perceived to be harder workers or as a response to the sexism and racism they encounter. Conclusions We found that White men are largely unaware of the impacts of race or gender on the pursuit of a STEM degree. Additionally, with the exception of women of color, students are less likely to perceive race as having an impact on the experiences of students than gender. We conclude with a discussion of implications for future work related to gender and race representation in STEM.",

Ethnographic research has documented the social acceptance of nonbinary gender roles and non‚Äêhetero sexualities in numerous societies, challenging the idea that homosexuality and transgender identities are deviant or pathological and contributing to political movements for LGBTQ rights in many countries. While in Euro‚ÄêAmerican societies, sexuality is commonly assumed to be an essential part of identity derived from the gender of one's desired partner, ethnographic evidence shows that people do not universally regard sexual behavior or desire as related to identity or believe that the gender of one's desired sexual partner(s) determines one's sexuality.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There is little empirical research on the sport experiences of gay and lesbian recreational athletes in Germany and their existence and needs within organized, non-professional sports have largely been ignored. Based on twelve in-depth interviews with self-identified male gay and female lesbian adults, this paper explores how queer recreational athletes experience sport in German sports clubs and which particular challenges or discriminatory situations they are confronted with. Findings show that study participants do not experience much discrimination on an explicit level in the sports clubs. Nevertheless, many respondents try to hide their sexuality in the sports context to prevent possible discrimination and questions about their sexuality. After all, it is mainly the discussion about and reduction of their sexuality that is being experienced as problematic. Five main stressors have been identified: (1) the necessity of an outing, (2) the sports club typical mode of communication, (3) the heteronormative pre-structuring of the sports, (4) the feeling of otherness and the assigned special role, (5) the implicit fear of discrimination. The findings point to the need for increased reflection on and reduction of heteronormative structures in German sports clubs.",

For centuries to millennia, sexual violence has been used as a means to subjugate, control, or demean women and other vulnerable populations. Sexual violence can have substantial physical and mental health effects on survivors. Health consequences of sexual violence vary from mild to severe medical, gynecological, obstetric, surgical, psychological, and psychiatric trauma. The most common sequelae of sexual violence are mental health consequences, and the effects of violence manifest in different ways throughout the life span. Adults commonly experience depression, anxiety, or posttraumatic disorders. Mental health sequelae of violence manifest somewhat differently in children, though they are also susceptible to mood, anxiety, and posttraumatic disorders. Young children who have survived sexual violence commonly display abnormal behaviors such as eating disturbances, developmental regression, language delays, or attachment disorders.

Unfortunately, some people's experience of jealousy involves intense psychological turmoil that can lead to aggressive or maladaptive responses. A majority of violent crime involving intimate partners‚Äîincluding murder, stalking or domestic abuse‚Äîcan be attributed to feelings of jealousy.",

      "abstract": "Emerging adulthood is a period of development characterized by the maturation of more complex sexual and religious/spiritual (r/s) identities. In some cases, r/s may enhance positive sexual experiences; however, r/s may also exacerbate problems that result from sexual difficulties. In the current study, a cross-sectional survey was administered to university students (N = 295) to test whether the associations of hypersexual behavior with spiritual struggle and with sexual self-concept would differ based on sexual congruence. We found that the associations of hypersexual behavior with sexual anxiety and with some facets of spiritual struggle were more strongly positive among participants who perceived their sexual values and behaviors as incongruent. Also, the association between hypersexual behavior and sexual esteem was more strongly negative among those who perceived their sexual values and behaviors as incongruent. We discuss implications for future examinations of the intersectionality of sexuality, religiousness, and spirituality.",

      "abstract": "Symptoms of domestic violence that occurs in marriage is due to the absence of equality or what is often called kafa&gt;‚Äôah in the fiqh al-muna&gt;kah}ah between the prospective husband and wife. In this case the position of husband to wife is not equal, either in economic, social, education, culture, race/ethnicity, ancestry or religious level. Husband‚Äôs position which is not equivalent (as kufu&gt;‚Äô) with his wife or vice versa, often triggers dispute between the two. Ongoing dispute, then followed by hurting words, beatings or physical abuse, irresponsible behavior, don‚Äôt meet the economic or biological needs, marry again, and even can also lead to a sadistic action or killing. In this perspective the author considers that if the value embodied in the kafa&gt;‚Äòah concept is understood correctly and properly, it‚Äôll actually give a positive chance to prevent domestic violence crime especially in the context of the relationship between husband and wife.[Gejala Kekerasan Dalam Rumah Tangga (KDRT) yang terjadi dalam perkawinan, salah satunya disebabkan tidak adanya kesetaraan atau yang sering disebut dalam fiqh al-mun√¢kahah dengan istilah kafa&gt;‚Äôah antara calon suami dengan calon istri. Dalam hal ini posisi suami dengan istri yang tidak setara, baik setara secara ekonomi, sosial, pendidikan, kultur, ras/suku, keturunan maupun tingkat keberagamaan. Posisi suami yang tidak setara (se-kufu‚Äô) dengan istrinya ataupun sebaliknya, sering kali memicu perselisihan di antara keduanya. Perselisihan yang terus-menerus, kemudian diiringi dengan kata-kata yang menyakitkan, tindak pemukulan atau penganiayaan fisik, perilaku yang tidak bertanggung jawab, tidak memenuhi kebutuhan ekonomis atau biologis, kawin lagi, bahkan dapat pula menjurus pada tindakan sadisme dengan menyengsarakan atau menghilangkan nyawa. Dalam perspektif inilah penulis memandang bahwa nilai yang terkandung dalam konsep kafa&gt;‚Äôah jika dipahami dengan tepat dan benar sebenarnya berpeluang positif untuk menangkal tindak kejahatan KDRT terlebih dalam konteks relasi antara suami dan istri.]",

      "abstract": "Objective: Why do we care whether the menopausal woman engages in ‚Äì let alone enjoys ‚Äì sexual pleasure or not? It is surely a very individual area and should be addressed on an individual basis. Today, the majority of menopausal women are busy with work, looking after children and grandchildren and lead fulfilling, busy lives. Why not a great sexual life too? Design and Method: Retrospective analysis of peri and post-menopausal women, experiencing problems related to sexual dysfunction. Detailed sexual health history was obtained, detailing specifics around gynaecological and sexual health screenings and interventions. This gave rise to key factors that displayed sexual dysfunction elements, but once addressed, diminished or resolved the dysfunction. Results: It was found that the majority of women were guarded in discussing sexual problems from a psychosexual framework, however, it remained less challenging to subscribe to the perceived problem being a medical/gynaecological problem. Awareness of age-related health issues and discussion around this influenced appropriate management. Conclusions: Adequate baseline screening is a key concept to address practical impediments and discuss these from a normal aging process. A direct approach, practical information, engagement with the partner and awareness of options around sexual positions and exploration drive these consultations positively. Support and education via linking with a Clinical Psychologist during this process was found to be a key aspect to outcome.",

      "abstract": "Improving quality of life can be achieved by rehabilitating one socially and restoring their sexual life. Holistic care for persons with disabilities means the rehabilitation nurse intervenes when problems of sexual function are discovered, observed, or expressed. However, most people with chronic illnesses and disabilities must confront prevalent myths about their sexual nature and abilities. These myths often have their basis in the notion, common in our society, that the only people who are sexual are those who are young and beautiful. People who are obese, old, or do not conform to current standards of sexual attractiveness are usually deemed as asexual or undesirable. These narrow sterotypes have been particularly damaging to physically or mentally disabled people. People with chronic illnesses and disabilities often have special needs regarding their sexual behavior. Most of us will confront chronic illness or disability in our own lives to some degree. In addition, illnss or disability can occur at any age. In this study, I discuss some of the special needs of people with chronic illnesses and disabilities and the methods of coping with those needs. I also discuss some of the sexual concerns that people with chronic illnesses and disabilities have in common, and the assessment of sexual function and nursing strategies through literature review.",

      "abstract": "Several ambiguities in the social exclusion literature ‚Äì in both the fields of social policy and development studies ‚Äì fuel the common criticism that the concept is redundant with respect to already existing poverty approaches, particularly more multidimensional and processual approaches, such as relative or capability poverty. In order to resolve these ambiguities and to derive value-added from the concept, social exclusion needs to be reconceptualised in a way that decisively opts for a processual definition, without reference to norms and/or poverty. Accordingly, a working definition of social exclusion is proposed as structural, institutional or agentive processes of repulsion or obstruction. This definition gives attention to processes occurring vertically throughout social hierarchies and opens up applications of the social exclusion approach to analyses of stratification, segregation and subordination in development studies, especially within contexts of high or rising inequality. Three strengths and applications include situations where exclusions lead to stratifying or impoverishing trajectories without any short-term poverty outcomes; where upward mobility of poor people is hindered by exclusions occurring among the nonpoor; and situations of inequality-induced conflict.",

When partners' goals correspond and their preferences are compatible, partners can readily achieve desirable outcomes such as security, companionship, and sexual fulfillment. When circumstances of interdependence are congenial, it is relatively easy for partners to gratify one another's most important needs. The real test of a relationship arises when circumstances are not so congenial-when partners encounter dilemmas involving conflicted interaction, incompatible preferences, extrarelationship temptation, or experience of betrayal. In dilemmas of this sort, the well-being of each person is incompatible with the well-being of the relationship and something must give. Thus, sometimes it is not so easy to maintain a healthy and vital ongoing relationship.",

These changes, if they occur at all, may be considered negative if they appear to challenge the animals' ability to cope and could thus compromise welfare, or positive if they appear to enhance the animals' welfare state. Visitor effects may be influenced by housing and husbandry, the behavior of people, individual characteristics of the animals, and their species. Negative visitor effects can often be reduced by providing animals with more opportunities to avoid public view. Previous research suggests that visitor effects are negative for many captive primates, indicating that human proximity is stressful, but in most cases the effect does not seriously compromise animal welfare.",

      "abstract": "Abstract For many people, the very first kiss represents a significant life event, a developmental milestone that serves to usher them into the realm of sexual maturity and adulthood. Surprisingly, this important sexual event has received little systematic scientific attention. The goal of the present descriptive study was to examine the affective reactions that commonly accompany the very first kiss. Using a free response format, participants (N = 338) described the affective responses (i.e., emotions, feelings, sentiments) they experienced before, during, and after their very first kiss. Contrary to our hypothesis, the most common responses experienced immediately prior to the kiss were subjectively unpleasant (e.g., anxiety, fear, uncertainty). Our other hypotheses were confirmed. As predicted, more men than women recalled experiencing positive affect both during and after their first kiss, and more women than men reported negative affect during and after the kiss. These gender differences are in accord with earlier research on affective reactions to other first sexual events (i.e., intercourse), and may reflect the operation of sociocultural forces that encourage men to adopt more positive attitudes than women toward sexual experience and expression. In sum, a person's very first kiss appears to evoke a shifting array of positive and negative emotions, sentiments, and feelings.",

      "abstract": "Males and females differ‚Äîbut only moderately‚Äîin moral judgment and morally relevant social behavior such as caring for others and aggression. Females more frequently use care-related concerns in their moral judgment. Research has to some extent supported traditional stereotypes of males as more assertive or independent (agency) and females as more relational or affiliative (communion). Males are on average more aggressive than females even after relational aggression is taken into account. In the expression of empathy and prosocial behavior, situational context plays a larger role for males than females. Males‚Äô gender tendencies have been characterized as instrumental (‚Äúreport talk,‚Äù object oriented, etc.) and females‚Äô as socially and emotionally expressive (‚Äúrapport talk,‚Äù people oriented, etc.). In social relationships, adolescent girls generally engage in more intimate self-disclosure and active listening, provide more emotional support to one another, and emphasize affiliation and collaboration. Both biological and social experiential or cultural factors are involved in the formation of these morally relevant gender differences. Although average gender-linked differences in emphasis remain evident, a blend of instrumental and expressive characteristics may contribute to optimal morality for both genders. Sandra Bem termed the mixture of expressive (traditionally feminine) and instrumental (traditionally masculine) attributes in gender style ‚Äúandrogyny.‚Äù Highly androgynous adolescents and adults of both genders evidence more mature moral judgment and more adequate mental health.",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis, treatment, and referral of married women with sexual dysfunctions require information about the current physiologic deficit, previous sexual capacity, level of sexual desire, masturbatory experience, means of orgasmic attainment, preferred sexual partner, quality of marriage, husband's sexual capacities, and method of contraception. For classification purposes, the three basic physiologic deficits‚Äîexcitement phase dysfunction, orgasmic phase dysfunction, and vaginismus‚Äîare subdivided into primary and secondary types. Primary dysfunctions represent longstanding developmental problems and are usually purely psychological in origin. Secondary dysfunctions occur after a period of normal sexual functioning and may be organic or psychological in origin. The actual determinants of dysfunctions are not well understood, but those factors commonly associated are discussed. The lack of knowledge about the nature of sexual desire, prevalence of dysfunctions, and significance of the inability to attain orgasm with coitus is emphasized. The physician's role in giving advice and treatment is defined.",

They and their families are more likely to be socially isolated and to suffer material and emotional poverty. The range of emotional reactions in carers can vary at different times from extreme overprotection, through relative equanimity, to sometimes outright hatred and rejection of the child. Society largely reflects this, only rarely viewing the individual with learning disability in a positive way, choosing often to pity, patronise, ignore, ridicule or openly despise. These attitudes are internalised by children with the disability, who invariably suffer from low self-esteem. All of these factors combine to facilitate abuse.",

      "abstract": "Un gran numero de victimas de abuso sexual infantil nunca revela su victimizacion y en otros muchos casos, la latencia de revelacion es de anos e incluso decadas. Aunque existen numerosos estudios sobre los factores que influyen en la revelacion, ninguna publicacion reciente en Espana recoge y sintetiza las evidencias cientificas disponibles sobre los factores relativos a las figuras de la victima, el abusador y la relacion entre ambos. En este trabajo se revisan diversos estudios y metaestudios sobre las razones que llevan a las victimas a mantener en secreto los abusos. A las dificultades que los ninos presentan en general para revelar un secreto, especialmente cuando implican a algun adulto o estan relacionados con aspectos sexuales, se anaden otros como la etapa evolutiva del desarrollo y el sexo del menor durante los abusos, la percepcion de responsabilidad y culpa y el miedo a las consecuencias, reales o imaginadas. La situacion de superioridad del abusador, las estrategias empleadas para acercarse o coaccionar a la victima y la relacion o el vinculo entre ellos son factores que dificultan la revelacion del abuso. Para explicar el fenomeno de la revelacion se acude a dos modelos basicos: el de la revelacion segun el Intercambio Social y el Cognitivo-Social, a partir de los cuales se propone un modelo interaccional y multidimensional. Los factores que inhiben la revelacion del abuso en las victimas constituyen un importante ambito de investigacion que puede contribuir a la prevencion, la deteccion y la intervencion en estos casos.",

      "title": "Sexualisierte Gewalt gegen Kinder und Jugendliche ‚Äì Definitionen",
      "abstract": "Im deutschsprachigen Raum existieren mehrere Begriffe und Definitionen, die versuchen, das Ph√§nomen sexualisierter Gewalt zu beschreiben. Zwei weit verbreitete Definitionen stammen von Bange/ Deegener und Hageman-White und werden in diesem Kapitel vorgestellt. Alle Definitionen verbindet der Machtaspekt, der bei der Ver√ºbung sexualisierter Gewalt eine zentrale Rolle spielt. Der Begriff sexualisierte Gewalt betont zum einen den Gewaltaspekt und zum anderen, dass es sich nicht immer und nicht ausschlie√ülich um einen Akt aus sexueller Lust handeln muss sondern, dass die Gewalt mit sexuellen Mitteln ausge√ºbt wird. Im Gegensatz zum Begriff des sexuellen Missbrauchs l√§sst er sprachlogisch nicht die Assoziation eines Gebrauchs der Sexualit√§t von Kindern und Jugendlichen zu. Sexuelle Grenzverletzungen k√∂nnen unangemessene Verhaltensweisen oder p√§dagogisches Fehlverhalten sein, die einmalig oder gelegentlich auftreten. Ob Handlungen sexuell grenzverletzend sind, entscheidet neben objektiven Kriterien, wie professionellen Arbeitsstandards, das subjektive Erleben von einer*m Betroffenen dieser Handlungen. Sexuelle Grenzverletzungen im Rahmen einer T√§ter*innenstrategie unterscheiden sich damit von unbeabsichtigtem Verhalten durch den Vorsatz, in die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung einer*s Kindes oder Jugendliche*n einzugreifen. Dies stellt ein gravierendes Fehlverhalten dar, das die Schwelle zur Strafbarkeit √ºberschreiten kann. Strafrechtlich relevante Formen sexualisierter Gewalt an Kindern und Jugendlichen werden im 13. Abschnitt des Strafgesetzbuches: \"Straftaten gegen die sexuelle Selbstbestimmung\" definiert. F√ºr den Kontext sexualisierter Gewalt von Lehrer*innen gegen√ºber Sch√ºler*innen ist insbesondere ¬ß174 \"Sexueller Missbrauch von Schutzbefohlenen\" relevant. Unabh√§ngig davon, ob Gerichte eine sexuelle Handlung f√ºr strafrechtlich relevant halten, k√∂nnen Handlungen als grundlegende Differenzierung in zwei Kategorien eingeteilt werden: Handlungen mit direktem K√∂rperkontakt (\"hands-on\") und Handlungen ohne direkten K√∂rperkontakt (\"hands-off\"). Alle genannten Akte werden als sexualisierte Gewalt bezeichnet, wenn der*die T√§ter*in diese Handlungen ausf√ºhrt oder er oder sie das Kind oder die*den Jugendliche*n dazu verleitet, entsprechend manipuliert oder zwingt, diese Akte selbst zu vollf√ºhren (z. B. orale Befriedigung des T√§ters bzw. der T√§terin).",

It is predicted that, under conditions implying physical threat, defense of body territory will be greatest in the condition of male-to-male movement, that the male object-person will be a greater source of threat than the female object-person, and that anxiety will be associated with greater intervening distances for both sexes. Each S (male or female) approached and was approached by his respective object-person (male or female), providing measures of invading and being invaded behaviors. The major findings were: Ss tended to stay farther from the male than the female object-person; males showed the strongest sex-of-object effect, with approach toward the female object being more influential than avoidance of the male object; female Ss were more influenced by anxiety; and male Ss were most influenced by degree of heterosexuality. It was concluded that partial support was evidenced for what could be called a body territorial factor in human space behavior.",

We observe separation not only in between husband and wife but also in between any two persons of the world, whenever self-interest which causes attraction is no more. Where there is no interest, there is no attraction. In such a case life becomes mechanical if there remains no avenue to get separation from each other.",

Savoring is undoubtedly a broad concept. It can be directed inwardly toward one's inner states of calm, of pride, of love, and more. Savoring is closely linked to many desirable outcomes, including higher rates of subjective well-being or happiness. Savoring has been also proposed as a mechanism through which positive affect broadens awareness, encourages exploration, and expands behavioral skills. A number of studies have identified some interesting individual differences in the ability to savor. Females report a greater tendency to savor, a difference that emerges around age ten and persists throughout the lifespan. Higher levels of trait mindfulness, extraversion, optimism, and affect intensity, and lower levels of neuroticism, guilt, and hopelessness, are associated with a greater perceived capacity to savor the moment.",

      "abstract": "The content and valence of women's body image attitudes, general and enduring positive or negative feelings about the body, are studied with psychometric analyses of measures and contrasted groups. Data from two frequently used measures (Body Image Scale, Derogatis & Melisaratos, 1979; Body Satisfaction Scale, Berscheid, Walster & Bohrnstedt, 1973) provided an evaluation of the construct and the assessment of body image. Two studies are provided. The construct analyses suggest two contents for body attitude measures: a general factor of body, facial, and sexual (genital and breast) items, and a second factor assessing weight and/or its body correlates‚Äîthe hips, thighs, and buttocks. Also, a method factor, a response style of negativity, may be important. Body image attitudes are correlated with some conceptually relevant criteria, such as interest in engaging in sexual activity; however, these relationships do not appear sufficiently strong to predict behavior, such as the occurrence or resolution of sexual dysfunction. Generalized body image disturbance as currently conceptualized and assessed may be difficult to document, particularly when item content and response styles are considered.",

      "title": "[Psychosociology of the demand for abortion].",
      "abstract": "3 preliminary observations are relevant to an analysis of the psychosociology of abortion. All pregnancies, regardless of the outcome, are meaningful for the woman and/or the couple. On the other hand, the debate for or against abortion is meaningless to the extent that most women seeking abortions are to some degree \"against\" abortion. Finally, beyond a certain point the use of contraception and the demand for abortion are not related, as shown by the stability of abortion rates in France over the past 20 years during which rates of contraceptive usage changed greatly and by the high level of contraceptive information among women seeking repeat abortions. In the psychic realm, being pregnant is positive if only as a indication of the power to become pregnant. It is known that women suffering a recent loss are more likely to become pregnant. PRegnancy under circumstances of loss or mourning signifies that something other than death or loss is possible. The idea of pregnancy as a compensation for loss can refer to a range of situations such as death of a close relative, end of a union, divorce, unemployment, or educational or professional failure, to name a few. The unconscious utilization of pregnancy as a proof of power can be repeated each time doubt arises as to the reality of this power. Not pregnancy, but bringing a child into the world is what is impossible in voluntary pregnancy termination. Abortion is chosen because it allows the mother or the couple to avoid an investment for which they are unprepared. Becoming a mother means to stop being a child and also forces an encounter with the images of one's own parents internalized during childhood. Such images are not always good, which caused problems in the psychic work of identification with the parent that accompanies childbirth. Choosing to have a child and joining the chain of generations is impossible for some persons, because the filiation is too difficult or the parental images are too negative. Abortions, like the occurrence of the pregnancies that lead to them, are always meaningful, although their significance may not be consciously grasped by the woman. On the societal level, abortion may signal resistance to the medicalization and perhaps politicization of sexuality. The perceived high economic cost of children and desire to provide them with abundance may be other factors in the demand for abortion. To some degree children are now valued by society primarily as a potential market. Study of the origins of abortion is not specific, but fundamental to an understanding of human reproduction in general.",

Yet, little is known about which behaviors people might experience as compulsive. Using YouGov America, a non-probability sample was collected, matched to U.S. representative norms, stratified, and weighted based on sample characteristics to ensure representativeness (N = 2,806; Mean Age = 48.9, SD = 17.3). Participants reported if they had experienced any concerns about their sexual behaviors being either \"out of control\" or \"an addiction.\" Participants who endorsed such concerns were then asked to indicate which behaviors had led to such concerns, using a checklist of 11 potentially overlapping sexual behaviors (e.g. frequent casual sexual encounters, using apps to find sexual partners). Men‚Äîboth heterosexual and gay/bi/other‚Äìwere more likely to report concerns that their sexual behaviors were an addiction, relative to heterosexual women. Relative to heterosexual women, men of any sexual orientation were more likely to report pornography use as a specific behavior of concern, and less likely to report partnered sexual behaviors. More religious participants were more likely to endorse masturbation as a behavior of concern and less likely to endorse frequent casual sexual encounters.",

Infantile sexuality, the pleasure of the total body, is equivalent to love and dependent upon sameness and continuity, tending toward fusion. Adult sexuality depends for its emotional impetus upon separateness and difference between lovers. Once established, adult sexual relationships drift inexorably toward the symbiotic unity implicit in loving. Genital sexuality may be sacrificed in the preference for more global satisfations reminiscent of the infantile sexual experience. Essential to the adult sexual relationship then is the capacity to bear and express conflict and anger as a means of breaking the symbiotic tie; a continuous restructuring of ego boundaries is necessary for the maintenance of a functioning sexual relationship of long duration.",

      "title": "Social trauma: The pathogenic effects of untoward social conditions",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychoanalysis has traditionally overlooked the fact that unsuitable and damaging life conditions, originating in the social milieu, play a part in the pathogenesis of emotional suffering and mental disorders. Nonetheless, the self establishes an object relation with the social system, as well as with the non-human environment. This is expected to act as a container‚Äìcontained relationship. Whenever the community and its institutions fail to act as a container for individuals and groups, this generates a trauma, which can be compared with the baby's experience of a failure in mothering. Such failures can be classified in several categories. The first is when the social system fails to contain, nurture, care for, and protect individuals, as in the case of the lack of assistance and compassion towards the victims of poverty, disease, natural catastrophe, social turmoil, economic crisis, violence, or war. The second category occurs when there is a blatant attack, on the part of the authorities or privileged social groups, on minorities, or even on the bulk of the population, as in the case of social repression, war‚Äîboth internal and external‚Äîracism, genocide, or persecution. The third is when there is a perversion of the social system, which feigns to uphold current social values and laws while actually breaking them, as in the case of corruption, chicanery, and mendacity on the part of the authorities. One recent example of this is the impeachment process against the Chief of Government of Mexico City. The author approaches this problem by exploring the consequences of such experiences for the development and functioning of personality structure and personal relations, as well as their repercussions for individuals living together in the community and for the necessary relation between them and the authorities.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT For evidence about the extent and experience of old age in classical antiquity, one must rely excessively on literature and mythology, with their heavy bias towards the leisured classes and their lack of quantitative data. Nevertheless, there are bases for some plausible inferences: both life expectancy and for most people the standard of living were low, with a consequence of an early commencement of ‚Äòadult‚Äô employment and the absence of any notion (or possibility) of retirement; those hardy and lucky enough to survive of ten appear to have retained a vigorous creativity into very old age; emotional relations (e.g. between parents and children) were coloured by such factors as high infant mortality and the relative early death of parents and grandparents. The absence of really large cities, other than Rome and one or two others, and of rural isolation (the homestead farm, for example) reduced the dangers of the kind of loneliness associated with the modern bed-sitter, though problems of old age fell solely on the family (rather than the community). Medical literature showed a surprising lack of interest in mental illness associated with old age or even in medical problems other than the obvious ones of debility, and there is no way for us to penetrate the silence.",

      "abstract": "First sexual intercourse is considered to be a major life transition, but it is not always a pleasurable experience, especially for females. The major purposes of this research were to examine gender differences in emotional reactions (pleasure, anxiety, and guilt) to first intercourse and to test possible explanations for these gender differences. Based on data collected from 1,659 college students who had had sexual intercourse, we found that men reported experiencing more pleasure and anxiety than did women, whereas men reported experiencing less guilt than did women. Men's greater subjective pleasure in response to first intercourse was explained, in part, by their greater likelihood of having an orgasm. Similar gender differences in emotional reactions were found regardless of the stage and length of the relationship in which first intercourse occurred; both genders reported more pleasure, more anxiety, and less guilt when sex occurred in a close relationship than in a casual one. However, continuing involvement in the relationship was associated with a pleasurable reaction for women. Other ways in which gender was related to the first intercourse experience are also presented.",

      "abstract": "The use of antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) as a qualifying mental disorder for a sexually violent predator (SVP) or a sexually dangerous person (SDP) commitment continues to arouse controversy. Two common questions arise. Is ASPD considered a qualifying mental disorder in statutory or case law definitions? Can ASPD be the sole qualifying mental disorder? We review case law for guidance as to when ASPD may serve as a sole qualifying diagnosis in SVP/SDP evaluations. Other than the federal government and New York, all other jurisdictions with SVP/SDP commitments permit the use of ASPD as a stand-alone diagnosis when it can be linked to sexually violent behavior. ASPD is a viable qualifying disorder when the pattern of offending is atypical, severe, and can be linked to the risk for further sexual offending. ASPD is less viable as a qualifying diagnosis when it is manifested primarily by criminal behavior, the sex crimes are situational in context (e.g., substance abuse, negative peer affiliation), or the disorder cannot be linked to future sexual offending. Case law can provide guidelines, but the forensic clinician as the diagnostic expert bears the responsibility of providing a cogent and sound rationale as to why ASPD drives the risk for sexual reoffense.",

Special emphasis is given to information with relevance to public policy and law. Compared with the US adult population, respondents were younger, more highly educated, and less likely to be non-Hispanic White, but differences were observed between gender and sexual orientation groups on all of these variables. Overall, respondents tended to be politically liberal, not highly religious, and supportive of marriage equality for same-sex couples. Women were more likely than men to be in a committed relationship. Virtually all coupled gay men and lesbians had a same-sex partner, whereas the vast majority of coupled bisexuals were in a heterosexual relationship. Compared with bisexuals, gay men and lesbians reported stronger commitment to a sexual-minority identity, greater community identification and involvement, and more extensive disclosure of their sexual orientation to others. Most respondents reported experiencing little or no choice about their sexual orientation. The importance of distinguishing among lesbians, gay men, bisexual women, and bisexual men in behavioral and social research is discussed.",

      "title": "Diagnosis and Management of Fecal Incontinence",
      "abstract": "DEFINITION Fecal incontinence is defined as either the involuntary passage or the inability to control the discharge of fecal matter through the anus. Clinically there are three subtypes (a) passive incontinence‚Äîthe involuntary discharge of stool or gas without awareness; (b) urge incontinence‚Äîthe discharge of fecal matter in spite of active attempts to retain bowel contents, and (c) fecal seepage‚Äîthe leakage of stool following otherwise normal evacuation. The severity of incontinence can range from the unintentional elimination of flatus to the seepage of liquid fecal matter or sometimes the complete evacuation of bowel contents. Not surprisingly, these events cause considerable embarrassment, which in turn can lead to a loss of self-esteem, social isolation, and a diminished quality of life (1). EPIDEMIOLOGY Although fecal incontinence affects people of all ages, its prevalence is disproportionally higher in women, in the elderly, and in nursing home residents. Estimates of its prevalence vary greatly and depend on the clinical setting, the influence of social stigma, the definition of incontinence, and the frequency of occurrence. In the U.S. householder survey, frequent leakage of stool or fecal staining for more than 1 month was reported by 7.1% and 0.7% of the population, respectively (2). In contrast, two or more episodes of fecal incontinence per month were reported by 0.8% of patients presenting to primary care clinics in the UK (3). In an elderly (>65 yr) self-caring population, fecal incontinence occurred at least once a week in 3.7% of subjects and in more men than women (men:women = 1.5:1) (4). In contrast, 25‚Äì35% of institutionalized patients (5) and 10‚Äì25% of hospitalized geriatric patients (6) suffer from fecal incontinence. In the United States, fecal incontinence is the second leading cause for placement in nursing homes (6). In a survey of 2,570 households, comprising 6,959 individuals, the prevalence of at least one episode of incontinence during the previous year was 2.2%; among these 63% were women, 30% were >65 yr of age, 36% were incontinent of solid stool, 54% of liquid stool, and 60% of flatus (7). Furthermore, in another prospective survey of patients attending either a gastroenterology or a primary care clinic, over 18% reported fecal incontinence at least once a week (8). Only one third had ever discussed the problem with a physician (8). When stratified for the frequency of episodes, 2.7% of patients reported daily incontinence, 4.5% weekly, and 7.1% once per month (8). In another survey, fecal incontinence was associated with urinary incontinence in 26% of women attending a Uro/Gyn Clinic (9). A higher incidence of mixed fecal and urinary incontinence was also reported in nursing home residents (10, 11). The cost of health care related to fecal incontinence includes items that can be measured such as the evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of incontinence, medications, the use of disposable pads and other ancillary devices, skin care, and nursing care. Approximately $400 million/year were spent for adult diapers (8, 12) and between $1.5 and $7 billion/year were spent on care for incontinence among institutionalized elderly patients (6, 13). In a long-term facility, the annual cost for a patient with both mixed fecal and urinary incontinence was $9,711 (14). In the outpatient setting, the average cost per patient (including evaluation) was estimated at $17,166 (15). Additionally, there are other costs that cannot be measured such as the impaired quality of life and social dysfunction (1). SUMMARY. The prevalence of fecal incontinence ranges between 1% and 7.4% in otherwise healthy people and up to 25% in those who are institutionalized. Both the embarrassment and the social stigma attached to this disorder, often delay presentation as well as treatment for several years. Fecal incontinence not only causes significant morbidity in the community but it also consumes substantial health care resources. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY Functional Anatomy and Physiology of the Anorectum The neuromuscular integrity of the rectum, anus, and the adjoining pelvic floor musculature helps to maintain normal fecal continence. The rectum is a muscular tube composed of a continuous layer of longitudinal muscle that interlaces with the underlying circular muscle. This unique muscle arrangement enables the rectum to serve both as a reservoir for stool and as a pump for emptying stool. The anus is a muscular tube 2‚Äì4 cm. long, which at rest forms an angle with the axis of the rectum. At rest, the anorectal angle is approximately 90 degrees, with voluntary squeeze it becomes more acute, approximately 70 degrees, and during defecation it becomes more obtuse, about 110‚Äì130 degrees. The anal sphincter consists of the internal anal sphincter, which is a 0.3‚Äì0.5 cm thick expansion of the circular smooth muscle layer of the rectum, and the external anal sphincter which is a 0.6‚Äì1 cm thick expansion of the striated levator ani muscles. Morphologically, both sphincters are separate and heterogeneous (16). The anus is normally closed by the tonic activity of the internal anal sphincter and this barrier is reinforced by the external anal sphincter during voluntary squeeze. The anal mucosal folds together with the expansile anal vascular cushions provide a tight seal. These mechanical barriers are augmented by the puborectalis muscle, which forms a flap-like valve that creates a forward pull and reinforces the anorectal angle to prevent incontinence (16). The anorectum is innervated by sensory, motor, and autonomic parasympathetic nerves as well as by the enteric nervous system. The principal nerve is the pudendal nerve, which arises from the second, third, and fourth sacral nerves and innervates the external anal sphincter, the anal mucosa, and the anorectal wall. This is a mixed nerve and subserves both sensory and motor function (17). Its course through the pelvic floor makes it vulnerable to stretch injury, particularly during vaginal delivery. It is likely that rectal contents are periodically sensed by the process of \"ano rectal sampling\" (18, 19). This process may be facilitated by transient relaxations of the internal anal sphincter that allows the movement of stool or flatus from the rectum into the upper anal canal where they may come into contact with specialized sensory end organs such as the numerous Krause end-bulbs, Golgi‚ÄìMazzoni bodies and genital corpuscles and the relatively sparse Meissner's corpuscles and Pacinian corpuscles (20). Specialized afferent nerves for touch, cold, tension, and friction subserve these organized nerve endings. An intact \"sampling reflex\" allows the individual to choose whether to discharge or retain their rectal contents, whereas an impaired \"sampling reflex\" may predispose to incontinence (19, 20). In contrast, the rectal epithilium shows no organized nerve endings (21). Myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers are present adjacent to the rectal mucosa, the submucosa and the myenteric plexus. These subserve the sensation of distention and stretch and mediate the viscero-visceral, the rectoanal inhibitory, and contractile responses (22). The sensation of rectal distention travels along the parasympathetic system to S2, S3, and S4 (21). Thus, the sacral nerves are intimately involved with the sensory, motor, and autonomic function of the anorectum and in maintaining continence. Pathogenic Mechanisms and Etiology Incontinence occurs when one or more mechanisms that maintain continence are disrupted to an extent that other mechanisms are unable to compensate. Thus, the cause of fecal incontinence is often multifactorial (23‚Äì25). In a prospective study, 80% of patients had more than one pathogenic abnormality (23). In adult women, obstetric trauma is a major predisposing factor (26). This injury may involve either the external anal sphincter, the internal anal sphincter, or the pudendal nerves or all three structures. In prospective studies, nearly 35% of primiparous women (normal ante partum) showed evidence of sphincter disruption following vaginal delivery (26‚Äì28). Other important risk factors include forceps delivery, prolonged second stage of labor, large birth weight, and occipito-posterior presentation (29‚Äì31). Perineal tears, even when carefully repaired, can be associated with incontinence, and patients may either present immediately or several years following delivery (27). Other causes of anatomic disruption include iatrogenic factors such as anorectal surgery for hemorrhoids, fistulas, or fissures. Anal dilatation or lateral sphincterotomy may result in permanent incontinence due to fragmentation of the internal anal sphincter (32, 33). The internal anal sphincter is occasionally and inadvertently damaged during hemorrhoidectomy (34). Accidental perineal trauma or a pelvic fracture may also cause direct sphincter trauma leading to incontinence (35). In the absence of structural defects, internal anal sphincter dysfunction may occur because of a myopathy (36, 37), or internal sphincter degeneration (37), or a complication of radiotherapy (38, 39). Neurological diseases can affect continence by interfering with either sensory perception or motor function, or both. In the central nervous system, multiple sclerosis, dementia, stroke, brain tumors, sedation, dorsal and spinal cord lesion may each cause incontinence (40‚Äì43). In the peripheral nervous system, cauda equina lesions, diabetic neuropathy (41, 44, 45), toxic neuropathy from alcohol, or traumatic neuropathy in the post partum setting may all lead to fecal incontinence. Up to 30% of patients with multiple sclerosis are incontinent (41). Skeletal muscle disorders such as muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, and other myopathies can affect external anal sphincter and puborectalis function. Reconstructive procedures such as ileoanal (46) or coloanal pouches (47) can increase anorectal capacity and may improve continence. However, up to 40% of patients with an ileoanal pouch experience periodic, often nocturnal fecal incontinence, possibly related to uncoordinated pouch contractions (48). Similarly, rectal prolapse may be associated with fecal incontinence in up to 88% of cases (49‚Äì51). This is most likely due to prolonged inhibition of anal tone from intussusception of the rectum into the upper anal canal. Conditions that decrease rectal compliance and accommodation may also cause fecal incontinence (52). Etiologies include radiation-induced inflammation and fibrosis, rectal inflammation secondary to ulcerative colitis (53, 54), or Crohn's disease and infiltration of the rectum by tumor, ischemia, or following radical hysterectomy (39). Rarely other causes include high intrarectal pressures generated in some patients with ulcerative colitis (53), or with severe voluminous diarrhea (55). In many patients fecal seepage or staining of undergarments is due to the incomplete evacuation of stool. A majority of these patients show obstructive or dyssynergic defecation (56). In these patients, anal sphincter and pudendal nerve function are intact but the ability to evacuate stool is impaired (56). Many also exhibit impaired rectal sensation (56, 57). Similarly, in the elderly and in children with functional incontinence, the prolonged retention of stool in the rectum leads to fecal impaction. Fecal impaction causes prolonged relaxation of the internal anal sphincter tone that allows liquid stool to flow around impacted stool and to escape through the anal canal (58). SUMMARY. Anal sphincter disruption or weakness, pudendal neuropathy, impaired anorectal sensation, impaired rectal accommodation, or incomplete evacuation may all contribute to the pathogenesis of fecal incontinence. These changes may be a consequence of local, anatomical, or systemic disorders. Thus, the origin of fecal incontinence is often multifactorial. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF FECAL INCONTINENCE Recommendation: Patients with fecal incontinence may be categorized into passive or urge incontinence or fecal seepage and their severity can be graded based on a prospective stool diary and clinical features. The evaluation of a patient with fecal incontinence involves a detailed clinical assessment together with the appropriate physiological and imaging tests of the anorectum. These three sources of information are complementary and should provide useful data regarding the severity of the problem, the underlying etiological factors, and the impact of the problem on the quality of life. Equipped with this knowledge, it is possible to design appropriate treatment strategies that could lead to clinical improvement. Clinical Features Many patients who suffer with fecal incontinence or soiling, take refuge under the term \"diarrhea\" or \"urgency\" (59). Thus, the first step in the evaluation is to establish a rapport with the patient and to confirm the existence of fecal incontinence. Thereafter, further characterization is desirable. This can include an assessment of its duration, its progression, its nature, i.e., incontinence of flatus, liquid stool, or solid stool, and its impact on the quality of life (Table 1). The use of pads or other devices and the ability to discriminate between formed or unformed stool and gas should be enquired. A detailed inquiry should also include obstetric history, a history of coexisting conditions such as diabetes mellitus, pelvic radiation, neurological problems or spinal cord injury, dietary history, and a history of coexisting urinary incontinence. Also, during clinical assessment, it is useful to ask if a patient can differentiate between formed and unformed stool or flatus, i.e., the presence of rectoanal agnosia. A prospective stool diary may also be very useful (Fig. 1).Table 1: A List of Important Information That Should be Elicited When Taking a History in a Patient with Suspected Fecal IncontinenceFigure 1: A sample stool diary for assessing patients with fecal incontinence. Use the following descriptors for describing stool consistency: Type 1: Separate hard lumps. Type 2: Sausage shaped but lumpy. Type 3: Like a sausage but with cracks on its surface. Type 4: Like a sausage or snake, smooth and soft. Type 5: Soft blobs with clear-cut edges (passed easily). Type 6: Fluffy pieces with ragged edges, a mushy stool. Type 7: Watery.The circumstances under which incontinence occurs should also be determined. Such a detailed inquiry may facilitate the identification of the following possible scenarios: Passive incontinence‚Äîwhich is the involuntary discharge of fecal matter or flatus without any awareness. This suggests a loss of perception and/or impaired rectoanal reflexes either with or without sphincter dysfunction. Urge incontinence‚Äîwhich is the discharge of fecal matter or flatus in spite of active attempts to retain these contents. Here, there is a predominant disruption of the sphincter function or the rectal capacity to retain stool. Fecal seepage‚Äîwhich is the undesired leakage of stool, often after a bowel movement with otherwise normal continence and evacuation. This condition is mostly due to incomplete evacuation of stool and/or impaired rectal sensation (56, 58). The sphincter function and pudendal nerve function are mostly intact (56, 57). Although there is an overlap between these three groups, by making a clinical distinction, it is possible to assess the underlying etiology and to guide investigations and management. Symptom assessment can also provide useful insights regarding the underlying mechanism(s), but may not correlate well with manometric findings. In one study, leakage had a sensitivity of 98.9%, a specificity of 11%, and a positive predictive value of 51% for detecting low resting anal sphincter pressures (31). The positive predictive value for detecting a low squeeze pressure was 80% (31). Thus, for an individual patient with incontinence, history and clinical features alone are insufficient to define the pathophysiology and therefore objective testing is essential. Nevertheless, based on the clinical features, several grading systems have been proposed. Recently, a modification of the Cleveland Clinic grading system (60) has been validated by the St. Mark's investigators (61). This system can provide an objective method of quantifying the degree of incontinence. It can also be useful for assessing the efficacy of therapy. This grading system is based on seven parameters that include whether the anal discharge is either solid, liquid or flatus, and whether the problem causes alterations in lifestyle, (scores: Never = 0, Always = 5); the need to wear a pad or the need to take antidiarrheal medication, and the ability to defer defecation (scores: No‚Äî0, yes‚Äî2). The score ranges from 0 (continent) to 24 (severe incontinence). Clinical features alone are, however, insufficient to define the pathophysiology. The use of validated questionnaires such as the SCL-90R SF-36 may provide additional information regarding the psychosocial issues and impact on the quality of or life. Physical Examination This should include a detailed physical and neurological examination of the back and the lower limbs, because incontinence may be secondary to a systemic or a neurological disorder. The perineal inspection and digital rectal examination is best performed with the patient lying in the left lateral position and with good illumination. Upon inspection, the presence of fecal matter, prolapsed hemorrhoids, dermatitis, scars, skin excoriation, the absence of perianal creases, or a gaping anus may be noted. These features suggest either sphincter weakness or chronic skin irritation and provide clues regarding the underlying etiology. Excessive perineal descent or rectal prolapse can be demonstrated by asking the patient to attempt defecation. An outward bulge that exceeds 3 cm is usually defined as excessive perineal descent (62). The perianal sensation should also be checked. The anocutaneous reflex examines the integrity of the connection between the sensory nerves and the skin, the intermediate neurons in the spinal cord segments S2, S3, and S4, and the motor innervation of the external anal sphincter. This can be assessed by gently stroking the perianal skin with a cotton bud in each of the perianal quadrants. The normal response consists of a brisk contraction of the external anal sphincter. Impaired or absent anocutaneous reflex suggests either afferent or efferent neuronal injury (63). Digital Rectal Examination Recommendation: Digital rectal examination can identify patients with fecal impaction and overflow. It is not accurate enough for diagnosing sphincter dysfunction or for initiating therapy. After inserting a lubricated, gloved index finger, one should assess the resting sphincter tone, the length of the anal canal, the integrity of the puborectalis sling, the acuteness of the anorectal angle, the strength of the anal muscle, and the elevation of the perineum during voluntary squeeze. Also, the presence of a rectocele or impacted stools may be noted. Unlike the examination of other organs, one should exercise considerable sensitivity and allay any fears when performing a digital rectal examination. The accuracy of digital rectal examination‚Äîas an objective test for evaluating anal sphincter function‚Äîhas been assessed in several studies. In one study of 66 patients, digital examination by an experienced surgeon was somewhat correlated with resting sphincter pressure (r = 0.56; p < 0.001) or maximum squeeze pressure (r = 0.72: p < 0.001) (64). In another study of 280 patients with several anorectal disorders, a reasonable correlation was reported between digital palpation and manometry (65). However, the sensitivity, the specificity, and the positive predictive value of the digital exam were very low (65). By the digital exam, the positive predictive value of detecting a low sphincter tone was 66.7% and a low squeeze tone was 81% (31). In another study of 64 patients, the agreement between digital examination and resting anal canal pressure or squeeze pressure was 0.41 and 0.52, respectively (66). These data suggest that digital examination is only an approximation, which is influenced by many factors including the size of the examiner's finger, the technique, and the cooperation of the patient. Thus, it is not very reliable and is prone to interobserver differences.Table 2: Treatment of Fecal IncontinenceINVESTIGATIONS OF FECAL INCONTINENCE Recommendation: Endoscopic evaluation of the rectosigmoid region is appropriate for detecting mucosal disease or neoplasia that may contribute to fecal incontinence. At the outset it is important to distinguish whether the incontinence is either secondary to diarrhea or independent of stool consistency. If there is coexisting diarrhea, a flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy should be performed to exclude colonic mucosal inflammation, a rectal mass, or stricture. Stool studies, including stool screening for infection, stool volume, stool osmolality and electrolytes may be performed. Similarly, biochemical tests may reveal thyroid dysfunction, diabetes and other metabolic disorders. Breath tests may reveal lactose or fructose intolerance or bacterial overgrowth (24). Several specific tests are available for defining the underlying mechanisms of fecal incontinence (23, 52, 63, 67). These tests are often complementary (23, 52, 63, 67). The most useful tests are anorectal manometry, anal endosonography, balloon expulsion test and pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (23, 52, 63, 67). A description of these tests and others that are commonly used for the evaluation of fecal incontinence and their clinical significance has been discussed in detail by Diamant et al. (67). Hence, a brief description of these tests and their clinical relevance is presented here with particular emphasis on recent literature and contentious issues. Anorectal Manometry and Sensory Testing Recommendation: Anorectal manometry with rectal sensory testing is the preferred method for defining the functional weakness of the external or internal anal sphincter and for detecting abnormal rectal sensation. Measurement of rectal compliance (reservoir function) may be helpful in some patients. These tests may also facilitate biofeedback training. Anorectal manometry provides an objective assessment of anal sphincter pressures together with an assessment of rectal sensation, rectoanal reflexes, and rectal compliance. Currently, several types of probes and pressure-recording devices are available. Each system has distinct advantages and drawbacks (63, 68, 69). A water-perfused probe with multiple closely spaced sensors is commonly used (63, 69). Alternatively, a solid-state probe with micro-transducers may be used (63, 69). Although more expensive and fragile, they do not require perfusion equipment, are easier to calibrate, and are possibly more accurate (63, 68). The anal sphincter pressures can be measured by stationary, station pull-through, or rapid pull-through techniques, but the former two are probably more accurate (63, 67, 68). A rapid pull-through technique can give falsely high sphincter pressures (67, 70). The resting anal sphincter pressure predominantly represents the internal anal sphincter function and the voluntary squeeze anal pressure predominantly measures the external anal sphincter function. Patients with incontinence have been shown to have low resting and low squeeze sphincter pressures (65, 71, 72). The duration of the sustained squeeze pressure provides an index of sphincter muscle fatigue. The ability of the external anal sphincter to contract in a reflex manner can also be assessed during abrupt increases of intraabdominal pressure such as when coughing (25, 63, 68, 69). This reflex response causes the anal sphincter pressure to rise above that of the rectal pressure to preserve continence. The response may be triggered by receptors on the pelvic floor and mediated through a spinal reflex arc. In patients with spinal cord lesions above the conus medullaris, this reflex response is present but the voluntary squeeze may be absent, whereas in patients with lesions of the cauda equina or sacral plexus both the reflex response and the voluntary squeeze response are absent (63, 73, 75). The response may be triggered by receptors on the pelvic floor and mediated through a spinal reflex arc. Sensory Testing Rectal balloon distention with either air or water can be used for the assessment of both the sensory responses and the compliance of the rectal wall. By distending a balloon in the rectum with incremental volumes, it is possible to assess the thresholds for first perception, a first desire or an urgent desire to defecate (25, 52, 63, 68, 69). A higher threshold for sensory perception suggests impaired rectal sensation (23, 25, 41, 52, 71). Also, the balloon volume required for partial or complete inhibition of anal sphincter tone can be assessed. It has been shown that the volume required to induce reflex anal relaxation was lower in incontinent patients than controls (71, 74). Because sampling of rectal contents by the anal mucosa may play an important role in maintaining continence (18, 19), quantitative assessment of anal perception using either electrical (22) or thermal (22, 76) stimulation has been advocated. In one study, anal mucosal sensation was assessed by recording perception threshold for electrical stimulation of the mid anal canal using a ring electrode (77). A combined sensory and motor defect was seen in patients with incontinence (77). In another study, although anal canal perception was impaired immediately after a vaginal delivery, there was no difference at 6 months (78). The role of thermosensitivity appears controversial (22). In one study, the ability of healthy anal mucosa to differentiate between small changes in temperature has been questioned (79). Hence, under normal conditions it is not possible to appreciate the temperature of fecal matter passing from the rectum to the anal canal during sampling (79). Whether patients have a pure sensory defect of anus without coexisting sphincter dysfunction or rectal sensory impairment has not been shown. In contrast, a combined sensory and motor defect has been reported in many studies (77, 78, 80). Rectal compliance can be calculated by assessing the changes in rectal pressure during balloon distention with air or fluid (41, 44, 52, 67, 68). The ratio dv/dp describes the relationship. Rectal compliance is reduced in patients with colitis (53, 54) and in patients with low spinal cord lesions and in diabetics with incontinence (41, 44, 52). In contrast, compliance is increased in high spinal cord lesion (42, 75). When performed meticulously, anorectal manometry can provide useful information regarding anorectal function (23, 52, 67, 80). A technical review recommended the use of anorectal manometry for the evaluation of patients with incontinence because it can define the functional weakness of one or both sphincters and helps to perform and evaluate the responses to biofeedback training (67). Unfortunately, to date there has been no uniform technique or equipment for performing anorectal manometry (81). Also, there is a dearth of normative data and uniform methods of interpreting test results. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop standards of testing anorectal function and to validate the significance of abnormal results. Recently, the American Motility Society has initiated an international collaborative effort to develop standards for manometry testing and a consensus document has been published (82). Such efforts may lead to standardization of testing and interpretation of anorectal manometry. Although there are insufficient data regarding normal values, overlap among healthy subjects and patients with incontinence (65, 67), and large confidence intervals in studies that have examined test reproducibility (64, 83), for the individual patient with incontinence, manometry testing can be very useful. Manometric tests of anorectal function may also be useful in assessing objective improvement following drug therapy (84), biofeedback therapy (85), or surgery (86). Imaging the Anal Canal Recommendation: Anal endosonography is the simplest, most widely available and least expensive test for defining structural defects of the anal sphincter and should be considered in patients with suspected fecal incontinence. ANAL ENDOSONOGRAPHY. Traditionally, anal endosonography has been performed using a 7 mHz rotating transducer with a focal length of 1‚Äì4 cm (87). It provides an assessment of the thickness and structural integrity of the external and internal anal sphincter muscle and can detect the presence of scarring, loss of muscle tissue, and other local pathology (87, 88). More recently, higher frequency (10‚Äì15 mHz) probes that provide better delineation of the sphincter complex have become available (89). After vaginal delivery, anal endosonography has revealed occult sphincter injury in 35% of primipara women and most of these lesions were not detected clinically (27). In another study, sphincter defects were detected in 85% of women with third-degree perineal tear compared with 33% of subjects without tears (28). In studies that compared EMG mapping with anal endosonography, there was a high concordance rate for identifying sphincter defects using both modalities (90, 91). The technique is, however, operator dependent and requires both training and experience (67). Although endosonography can distinguish an internal sphincter injury from that of an external sphincter injury, it has a low specificity for demonstrating the etiology of fecal incontinence (92). Because anal endosonography is more widely available, is less expensive, and is certainly less painful than needle insertion, currently, it is the preferred technique for examining the",

      "abstract": "The absorbed state-sexual arousal-orgasm pathway hypotheses assert that absorbed states of consciousness accompanying sexual arousal (sometimes called altered states of consciousness or sexual trance) play important roles in sexual response not previously recognized. Absorbed states are an obligatory pathway to high physiological sexual arousal and to orgasm in many, perhaps all, females. The role of absorbed states in males is facilitation of arousal and orgasm, with enhancement of pleasure and subjective quality of the experience. But the absorbed states pathway is not an obligatory feature of arousal and orgasm in most males. These hypotheses are empirically testable; absorbed states have objectively measurable defining characteristics as well as subjective dimensions presenting greater but not intractable methodological difficulties. Inclusion of a cognitive psychology of absorbed states can bring us closer to a more adequate and integrated psychobiological understanding of sexual response in both women and men.",

      "abstract": "How do married men and women remember their love for their spouse at the beginning of the relationship before marriage and how do they currently perceive their marital love? A total of 581 middle-aged adults, 44 to 47 years old, married an average of 18 years, was surveyed regarding four types of love (Eros, Ludus, Friendship-based Love and Agape) at two relationship stages-retrospectively, at the beginning of the love relationship with their current spouse and currently in the marriage. Findings showed that the perceived strength of erotic and ludic love was higher at the beginning than it was currently for both men and women, and the perceived strength of agapic love was higher currently than it was thought to have been at the beginning, but only for men. The perceived degree of Friendship-based Love (FBL) remained the same across stages. Results also indicated that men and women differed in love experiences to a greater extent at the beginning of the relationship than currently. Most importantly, changes in perceptions of love appeared to have meaningful implications for the current affective quality of the marriage for men and women. Shifts in perceptions of erotic, ludic, friendship-based and agapic love predicted marital satisfaction as well as other salient relationship characteristics, such as sexual satisfaction, non-monogamy, relying upon one's spouse for help and comfort, as well as spending time with, feeling close to, respecting and helping one's spouse.",

These behaviors are not only maladaptive‚Äîthey are criminal. But what about other atypical or unusual sexual behaviors that are noncoercive or do not involve children? Certainly, unusual sexual practices find their way into the sex lives of so‚Äêcalled normal people. For example, normal sexual interactions between consenting adults may include tying one another to the bedpost while making love. Or a man may enjoy sex more when his partner wears lacy panties because he finds it particularly titillating. Are these normal or deviant practices?",

      "abstract": "The present study investigated whether gender-based differences in the rating of sexual words still exist in the late 1990s. Men and women evaluated 400 English-language words on the characteristics of sexual charge and sexual ambiguity. Data gathered from these ratings were compared with other factors such as religious involvement, sexual experience, sex guilt, and social desirability. Men and women did not differ in their sexual ratings of the list. However, because the list contained a large number of words that had no sexual content at all, gender differences were examined for ratings of a sample of 30 sexually ambiguous words. As hypothesized, men rated these words as significantly more sexual than women. Significant gender differences were found on a number of sexuality and personality measures. Women were more religious than men, and religiosity was significantly correlated with most of the other measures. Women also had higher social desirability scores, which implies that they may have been responding in a socially desirable manner and were not completely honest. Overall, gender differences followed gender-oriented stereotypes: (a) Women have greater sexual guilt than men, (b) women are less sexually arousable or more \"erotophobic,\" and (c) women are less comfortable answering questions about their sexuality and rating words.",

      "abstract": "American Indians / Alaska Natives (AI/AN) bear a high burden of suicide, the reasons for which are not completely understood, and rates can vary by tribal group and location. This article aims to identify circumstances reported by a community group of American Indian adolescent participants to be associated with their depression and/or suicide. American Indian adolescents (n = 360) were recruited from contiguous reservations and were assessed with a semi-structured diagnostic interview. Twenty percent of the adolescents reported suicidal thoughts (ideation, plans), an additional 8% reported a history of suicide attempts, and three deaths due to suicide were reported. Suicidal behaviors and major depressive disorder (MDD) co-occurred and were more common among female adolescents. The distressing events that adolescents most often reported were: death in the family, family disruption, peer relationship problems, and school problems. All of these events were significantly associated with suicidal behaviors, however those with suicidal acts were more likely to report death in the family. Those with MDD but no suicidal behaviors were more likely to report disruptions in the family. Disruptions in falling asleep were also associated with suicidal behaviors and having experienced a death in the family. Disruptions in important relationships, particularly through death or divorce, may be interpreted as a loss or disruption in ‚Äúsocial zeitgebers‚Äù that may in turn disturb biological rhythms, such as sleep, thus potentially increase the risk for MDD and/or suicide. Prevention programs aimed at ameliorating the impact of disruptions in important relationships may potentially reduce suicidal behaviors in AI/AN adolescents.",

      "abstract": "While the contemporary therapeutic discourse inveigles us to talk about our personal problems, a countervailing neo-liberal healthist discourse, aligning with conventional masculinity norms, presumes that we will manage any issues independently. This discursive tension can be difficult to navigate, especially for men confronted with still powerful traditional expectations around masculinity (e.g., self-reliance; personal control; restricted emotionality). Although qualitative research has examined how men negotiate masculinities with respect to depression, to date there has been scant attention focused on men experiencing anxiety. This article reports on an interview study with men, some with anxiety diagnoses and some without ( N = 17). Thematic analysis highlights that participants can and do talk about their anxieties, most readily with significant women in their lives (e.g., partners; mothers)‚Äìalthough this is not always straightforward. Talking to other men was more fraught, and while participants were wary of sharing problems with male friends, or signaled issues indirectly, they also highlighted situations where they would open up e.g., workspaces where they felt safe; with best friends. Those who had gone through a therapeutic process over many years tended to me more comfortable talking to others, male or female, about their mental health‚Äìand were also keen to other support to others where they could. Our analysis suggests that despite stereotypical notions of silent, self-contained men, there are many contexts where men may feel comfortable sharing their stories of pain and suffering. This chimes with wider cultural changes and the reported experiences of some mental health initiatives.",

      "abstract": "World research has shown that adolescent and young adult women and girls have significantly \"poorer\" self-esteem than men and boys, on a variety of previously validated self-esteem measures. There is no consensus on reasons for this, and a variety of factors have been proposed: some adolescent girls have a preoccupation with facial and body features, and this leads to a global negative evaluation of self-characteristics; the measures themselves are biased towards describing self-characteristics on which men and boys are likely to evaluate themselves more favourably; and in an often-sexist world, women and girls experience (or anticipate) many structural disadvantages, in education, career and promotion, which lead girls to \"internalise\" an image of themselves as less able or worthy than men and boys. A separate literature on the sexual abuse and exploitation of children and adolescents has found that (a) sexual exploitation and maltreatment often has a sequel in impaired self-concept and self-esteem and (b) sexual maltreatment is twice as likely to occur in women and girls. It is puzzling that differential levels of child sexual abuse have not been advanced in many studies as an explanation of gender differences in self-esteem in the large-scale studies we review, although this effect is confirmed by clinical and social work literature.",

Is adultery so a character flaw that it imperils presidencyor is it merely a statistically likely behavior of powerful men? And, at a more coffee klatch level, is there a difference tetween hidden sins and public probity i.e., would all of it have been acceptal le if it had been discreet? Is problem a woman, women, or taste in women? Are psychologists or sociobiologists correct in their hypotheses about nubile young women and irresistible attractions they present for men? Or is attraction a mixture of culture and psychology allure of bad girls and thrill of l eing a bad boy, especially in White House? And let's not forget a more Freudian analysis. Should we have expected all this as a death wish for overachieving or, more close to subject, oedipal outcome for a child of a flaml oyant mother and an absent father? There is not much sociology here, is there? The debate about president has keen at o ut character, individual behavior, and a morality play. Only a few questions have had any sociological content. The most interesting was reaction to lack of public condemnation of president. When president's approval ratings stayed up, a surprised press (and, more interestingly, surprised kehavioral scientists) were at a l it o f a loss to explain or even interpret data.

      "abstract": "Ageing is a genetically programmed physiological process that is accompanied by certain age-related changes in the human psyche. The complex and contradictory nature of human ageing is associated with quantitative and qualitative changes in the biological structures. When changes in the personality of an old person are assessed, more often than not negative features are mentioned; however, positive changes in his or her intellectual-mental sphere must also be taken into account. Impaired performance in intellectual tests in the elderly may be linked not to a drop in mental abilities but with a loss of interest in trivial tasks of a formal-logical nature and a shift to different semantic content virtually not addressed by conventional tests. In addition, it should be particularly emphasized that all tests of the intellectual integrity of an elderly person only include questions related to the cognitive sphere, and do not contain questions from the creative sphere. And it is in the latter, in particular, where an elderly person often has significant advantages over younger age groups. Features of human mental development in old age are made up of several closely related factors, due to changes in the biosocial status of a person. The ageing process can, in certain elements, be controlled, and the intelligent participation of the individual in maintaining psychological health in the period of gerontogenesis should be increased.",

In fact, pornography is so commonplace that soon we will be unable to imagine a time when there were multiple obstacles to acquisition. Arousal patterns may be further intensified by the voyeuristic presentation of violent pornography, increasing susceptibility to escalation. The viewer may experience their libido diminishing as pornography takes the 'sex' out of sex. When a patient is at the stage of experiencing difficulties only with partnered sex there may be reluctance to admit that their 'satisfactory pornography driven sexual experience' may even be a factor. Sexual dysfunction recovery times seem to relate to pre-porn exposure to masturbation and sexual experience. If there has been a sexual template set prior to their compulsive pornography use then it can be re-awakened, as it will still exist within their limbic system memory.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Why do people think that someone living a morally bad life is less happy than someone living a good life? One possibility is that judging whether someone is happy involves not only attributing positive psychological states (i.e., lots of pleasant emotions, few unpleasant emotions, and satisfaction with life) but also forming an evaluative judgment. Another possibility is that moral considerations affect happiness attributions because they tacitly influence attributions of positive psychological states. In two studies, we found strong support for the second hypothesis. Moral considerations only appear to affect happiness attributions when they also affect attributions of positive psychological states. Additionally, both studies supported a hypothesis about why moral judgments have these effects. Specifically, we found that when people judge that someone is living a bad life, they infer that the person is not at peace with themselves. However, when this inference is blocked, moral considerations do not affect attributions of happiness or positive psychological states. In sum, although ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù appears to be a purely psychological concept, happiness judgments are sensitive to moral considerations because people often assume that immorality disrupts intrapersonal harmony.",

In addition, this inability has the clause ob causas naturae psychicae which excludes all forms of physical disability. For this reason, limited vaginismus can never become the cause of the invalidity of marriage within the meaning of can. 1095 n. 3 KPK. Such a cause may be psychogenic vaginismus, which may &lt;hinder&gt; or &lt;prevent&gt; sexual intercourse. In practical considerations a detailed diagnosis of an expert is required to determine the degree of the disease and to determine whether the identified vaginismus is primary, secondary, higher or lower.

      "abstract": "Scent communication in man is undoubtedly of importance, although it is unconscious, rather than active, as compared to subhuman primates. Besides human sexual life it also affects a number of further characteristics of human life and its infrastructure including the mother-child relationship, creation of the odour basis of the family with the possibility to identify the family members solely by their odour as well as other parameters investigated thus far. Pheromones have effect upon the selection of a suitable partner of the opposite sex (or of the same sex in homosexual partners). The formation of specifically significant responses during communication between the two sexes, first of all in sexual life and its manifestations, may also be influenced by pheromone-based perfumes or classical cosmetic perfumes, as far as they are selected and used appropriately. The situation is much easier if the partners are of the olfactory type where for both partners the mutual olfactory parameters are the most attractive for their sexual life and its parameters, which significantly contributes to the quality of their overall coexistence (Ref. 29).",

The elderly lose much with aging: decline in their senses, health, mobility, and independence. With admission to nursing homes, further loss occurs when the intimacy needs of the resident and their partner are often overlooked and ignored. This omission is resultant of society‚Äôs stereotypical and prejudicial thinking of the elderly as asexual or the sexual activity of older persons as perverse. Intimacy and touching are the last pleasurable things an elderly person gives up. The person who is denied touch, affection, or connection with another human being slowly deteriorates and dies physically and emotionally.",

Though - according to the results of medicinal surveys - there is no biological limit for a satisfactory sexuality during old age, after personal interviews with 500 random sampled people the hypothesis was confirmed, that older people are often thought to be asexual. Especially older women, who in most cases have no more sexual relations, often believed sexuality in age to be inappropriate, indecent, perverse or even sinful. More than that it could be shown, that sexual inactivity of older people cannot be explained by detoriation of old age only - like illness or loss of partner -, but that the normative evaluation of sexuality is probably an important determinant also.",

      "abstract": "Male homosexuality can be understood as an expression of the\r\ngender of the self. Three aspects of the self are proposed in a\r\nhypothetical model of the homosexual male and compared to the\r\nheterosexual male and female. One aspect is subjectivity and\r\nthis study hypothesizes that the subjective experience of the\r\ngender of the self is associated with homosexuality and\r\nheterosexuality. The remaining two aspects are both\r\nobjectivities. It is hypothesized that sexual preference is the\r\nobjective expression of the gender of the subjective self. It is\r\nhypothesized that sexual preference is not related to biological sex (sexual identity).\r\nThe two objective attitudes are defined as the extremities of\r\na continuum of spontaneity: from involved objectivity to\r\ndetached objectivity. This difference in spontaneity within a\r\nhomosexual group describes the differential development of\r\nhomosexual identification: from a developed homosexual role to\r\nan under-developed or absent homosexual role. The absence or\r\ndevelopment of the homosexual role are differences in\r\nspontaneity and these differences are associated with measures\r\nof psycho- and socio-pathology.\r\nTraditionally, homosexuality has been understood to be an\r\noutcome of a different sexuality. This study shows that \r\n\r\nsexuality is not related to homosexuality as a subjective\r\nexpression of self. Sexual preference is, however, the objective\r\nexpression of that subjectivity.\r\nSex and gender are confounded in the literature. The\r\nconfusion of the sex and gender literature, and the perplexity\r\nof the homosexuality literature, is partially resolved by the\r\nseparation of two distinct but inter-related frames\r\nreference. These are the sociological and the psychological\r\nframes of reference.\r\nThe results strongly support the conclusion that\r\nhomosexuality is related to the subjective experience of the\r\nself and that homosexuality is an objective expression of that\r\nsubjectivity as a sexual preference. Homosexuality is not\r\nsynonymous with sexual preference or homosexual role, it also\r\nincludes the psychological precursor of the subjective\r\nexperience of gender, that is, gender identity.\r\nThere is empirical support for a proposed persons-grammar\r\ntheory of personality that uses a psychological frame of\r\nreference. Overall the results support this theoretical\r\ndevelopment and models of homosexuality, anxiety, and psychosis\r\nutilizing this theoretical framework.",

      "title": "Sexual objectification and dehumanization: Implications for women‚Äôs sexual agency",
      "abstract": "While ideally sexual activities would only take place when mutually desired, many women participate in sex that they do not want. During their lifetimes, between 18% and 25% of women will experience rape or attempted rape, and 50% or more will experience some form of unwanted sexual activity (Gavey & Senn, 2014). The present research tests whether women‚Äôs ability to exercise sexual agency is undermined when her internal sense of humanness has been diminished by others thinking of and treating her like an object. In patriarchal cultures, women are chronically sexually objectified: represented as sexual objects, existing primarily for men‚Äôs sexual use. Conceptually, objectification implies dehumanization and previous research has found that when people evaluate another person‚Äôs appearance, they dehumanize women but not men (Heflick et al., 2011). When women or men are dehumanized by others, they self-dehumanize (i.e., experience diminished human characteristics and feel more object-like) (Andrighetto et al., 2018; Baldissarri et al., 2017; Bastian & Haslam, 2010; Loughnan et al., 2017) and experience diminished agency (Andrighetto et al., 2018; Baldissarri et al., 2017). Building on this previous research, the present research has two goals. Study 1 tests whether women are more commonly viewed as less human than men. In Study 2, experiences of being dehumanized were then examined as a cause of diminished agency (self-reported self-efficacy and sexual agency) due to self dehumanization. Women and men do not experience dehumanization equally. When people focus on another person‚Äôs appearance, women are viewed as less human than men; when instructed to focus on their performance or on them as a person, women and men are not viewed differently (Heflick et al., 2011). The conclusion from this research was that women are viewed as less human than men when the focus is on their appearance. Study 1 of the present research tested an alternate hypothesis: that women are generally viewed as less human than men except when the focus is on their personhood. Before viewing a video featuring either a woman or a man, participants were either given no instructions or were asked to focus on one of three things: the subject‚Äôs appearance; the subject as a person; or the video. Consistent with the hypothesis, when given no instructions, participants viewed the women as less human than the men (i.e., lower on competence and human characteristics). Study 2 then examined whether being dehumanized impacts women‚Äôs sense of their own humanness and, consequently, their sense of agency. After recalling either an experience of having their appearance evaluated by others or an experience of being treated primarily as an instrument in the workplace, women and men rated their internal feelings of humanness. Moderated mediation analyses demonstrated that both situations caused women and men to self-dehumanize and in turn report lower self-efficacy. Contrary to predictions, however, self-dehumanization did not diminish either women‚Äôs or men‚Äôs sexual agency. Challenges examining sexual agency are discussed.",

The aim of the present review is the theoretical approach, both of the changes that take place in the physiology of sexual function of elderly people and of the factors and situations that are blamed for the occurrence of these dysfunctions. For the writing of this review, a systematic approach was used to search and identify all recently published literature (articles, studies and reviews) related œÑŒø the factors that cause Sexual Dysfunctions in Elderly, through the scientific databases Pub Med, Academia.Edu, Research Gate. Pathophysiological and anatomical changes, organic and psychological problems, which occur over time, negatively affect the frequency of sexual intercourse, sexual desire and in general the sexuality of older people. Older men, on the one hand, have mainly problems with erectile dysfunction, problematic ejaculation and decreased sexual desire, while women, on the other hand, mainly due to menopause, which causes hormonal, physical and mental changes, mainly show reduced sexual desire and stimulation, insufficiency of vaginal lubrication and dyspareunia. Older people have a variety of health problems that have a negative effect on their sexual activity, while each gender is faced with specific problems, medical, pharmaceutical and psychosocial reasons, which negatively affect their sex life",

Functional outcomes depend on a complex interplay of physiological, developmental and environmental factors. We start with the premise that hearing loss by itself will often have an impact on cognitive organization but not necessarily or consistently on intellectual, neuropsychological, emotional, social or behavioral functioning. Disruption of these functions depends heavily on other factors that may be associated with etiology of the hearing loss or the interaction between individuals and their environment, including communication, family, educational, emotional and sociolinguistic environments. At the same time, effects related to a hearing loss can have significant negative impact in each of these areas, particularly without comprehensive and appropriate supports.",

The act ought to be widely understood, since much human happiness depends on proper sex knowledge and adjustment. Psychological factors may play a role in the failure of sexual satisfaction. Considering the facts above, the author assumes that there will be a relationship between anxiety and sexual problem in married life. The assumption encouraged the author to study the problem. A survey of sexual problems during married life was carried out in the Special Province of Yogyakarta, among cases who proposed divorce. Results show that most of the cases with sexual problems present anxiety. A comparison between the cases with and without sexual problem, shows significant differences in the distribution of anxiety.

Several \"developmental lines\" of anxiety are described in some detail: strangeness and stranger anxiety, anxiety by contagion, separation anxiety, and anxiety through loss of love or security. Stranger anxiety can occur whether or not mother is present, whereas separation anxiety occurs in the absence of mother whether or not anyone else is present. Harry Stack Sullivan describes learning by the \"anxiety gradient\" as learning to discriminate increasing from diminishing anxiety, with alteration of activity in the direction of the latter. The self-system is an antianxiety system - not the whole self - which functions as a compass to steer the infant away from experiences of increasing anxiety and toward maximum euphoria. The dynamism of the self-system is purely a product of interpersonal experience arising from the general pursuit of satisfaction.",

The propensity of children of absent fathers to act-out and of absent mothers to act-in was shown to be related to whether children were aware of their parents' incarceration. This association was true of those children who were told their parents were in prison but untrue of those offspring who were led to believe that their mother or father was absent for other more socially acceptable reasons.",

Studies indicate that the prevalence of sexual pain disorders (3‚Äì46%) seems to vary from culture to culture and also with respect to the setting in which a diagnosis is made. Several authors found discrepancies in the reported incidence of sexual pain disorders, which depended on whether the patient was self-reporting a particular problem or whether the clinician was actively questioning the patient on the sexual dysfunction [3, 4]. This is not surprising, since data indicates that only 52% of women actually ever receive a formal diagnosis of a sexual pain disorder [5].

Such aggression does not leave physical marks but nonetheless predicts invisible harm, including unhappiness and psychological distress.

Instead they may deny, minimize, or justify the aggression, particularly when they are strongly committed to their relationship.

      "title": "Exposure to sexually attractive men decreases women's preferences for feminine faces",
      "abstract": "Here we show that women's preferences for femininity (vs. masculinity) in men's faces are decreased after viewing a slideshow of images of highly attractive men, but not after viewing a slideshow of relatively unattractive men. As masculinity is thought to be a cue of men's heritable fitness, and viewing images of highly attractive opposite-sex individuals increases sexual motivation, this may indicate that women increase their preferences for male cues of heritable fitness in circumstances where mating is likely to occur. This context-sensitivity in women's face preferences may, therefore, be adaptive, since decreased preferences for feminine men (i.e. increased preferences for masculine men) when sexual motivation is enhanced may increase offspring viability. Interestingly, we found that viewing images of highly attractive men also decreased women's preferences for femininity in female faces. This latter finding could either reflect increased derogation of attractive (i.e. feminine) same-sex competitors when sexual motivation is enhanced or be a low-cost functionless by-product of a mechanism for increasing preferences for cues of men's heritable fitness when sexual motivation is high. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that recent visual experience with highly attractive opposite-sex individuals influences attractiveness judgments and present novel evidence for potentially adaptive context-sensitivity in attractiveness judgments.",

      "abstract": "In this paper are determined basic concepts of abuse. Abuse of children is defined on different manners in literature but the author gives essential elements for legal determination of this concept. Act of violence exists when a parent, using a physical power on a position of supremacy tyrannies a child endangering its life, health, physical or emotional development. Physical abuse of a child can be determined from several aspects: medical, legal, social and cultural. The phenomenon of abuse was first observed by medical doctor and described as 'the battered child syndrome'. Although, it seams easy to define the physical abuse, there are many various definitions. In this paper, physical abuse of a child in the family means physical acting of the parents or guardians, by which on purpose, by the use of physical force, with or without the use of other means, are caused or could be caused physical injuries or death of a child. Emotional abuse is defined as parent's or guardian's acting or non acting, such as rejection, insult, isolation, terror, verbal attack etc. that might cause serious and permanent disorders in child's emotional development. Sexual abuse is defined as the use of a child to satisfy the sexual needs of one or more adult persons who have authority over a child and in whom the child trusts. The sexual abuse survivors have lifelong psychological problems.",

      "abstract": "Ketentraman dan keserasian hidup antara perkawinan suami istri salah satunya ditentukan oleh faktor kesehatan pasangan hidup. Tidak jarang keretakan dalam rumah tangga yang disebabkan karena salah satu pihak yaitu suami atau istri menderita suatu penyakit bahkan cacat badan. Hal ini terbukti karena banyaknya gugatan cerai yang masuk di Pengadilan Agama dengan alasan tersebut. Salah satu penyebab tingginya angka perceraian adalah kurangnya keterbukaan membicarakan suatu masalah saat pranikah, sehingga salah satu pihak merasa tertipu dengan hal-hal buruk yang ditutupi saat berpacaran atau saat sebelum menikah sehingga memicu konflik ketika telah menjadi pasangan suami-istri (pasutri). Penelitiaan ini merupakan penelitian studi pustaka atau (library reseacrh) yang bersifat kualitatif deskriptif dengan mendeskripsifikasikan seluruh gejala atau keadaan secara faktual tentang kondiloma akuminata sebagai alasan penyebab perceraian perspektif hukum Islam. Hasil penelitian ini adalah bahwa adanya penyakit kutil kelamin atau yang disebut kondiloma akuminata mengganggu keharmonisan rumah tangga yakni dalam hubungan seksual antara suam-istri hingga terjadi perceraian. Sebab salah satu dari mereka tidak bisa menjalankan kewajibannya sebagai suami-istri yaitu dalam hubungan seksual. Para ahli fiqh sepakat bahwa sahnya seorang suami menjatuhkan talak ialah dewasa/baligh dan atas kehendak sendiri bukan karena terpaksa atau ada paksaan dari pihak ketiga. Para ulama menyatakan bahwa talak merupakan suatu hal yang dibolehkan apabila terjadi salah satu hal yang telah disebutkan dalam Kompilasi Hukum Islam (KHI) yang mengganggu atau menghalangi ketika bersenggama, yang mana Imam Syafi‚Äôi menyebutnya dengan al-ritqu yaitu tersumbatnya lubang vagina oleh benjolan daging.",

      "abstract": "In Russia, young adults face many barriers that prevent them from accessing reliable and up-to-date knowledge about what sexual communication between partners can look like. This may lead to episodes of sexual miscommunication, which in turn sometimes result in sexual aggression. The study aimed to identify how following prevalent sexual scripts facilitates clear sexual communication or alternatives leads to miscommunication between Russian young adults. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 14 women and 11 men aged 19-25 years living in St. Petersburg (Russia) who had had at least one sexual partner of the opposite sex. Data were analysed thematically. Four themes were developed from the interviews: (1) endorsing (or not endorsing) traditional sexual scripts, (2) the presence or absence of sexual compliance, (3) softening refusal of sexual contact or intercourse, (4) the belief that asking for consent is unusual. Findings indicate that patterns and clarity of sexual communication differ depending on the type of relationship (serious, casual, and other), its stage, and partners' beliefs. Study findings underscore the need for sex and sexuality education for young people in Russia.",

      "abstract": "Sex workers' noncommercial intimate partnerships are marginalized on two counts - they are non-monogamous and at least one partner is in sex work, an occupation with much stigma. We asked a heterogeneous sample of Canadian sex workers (N = 218) about their decisions to reveal/not reveal their sex work to intimate partners, and the resulting challenges and benefits. A minority (58/183) of participants who had been or were currently involved in an intimate relationship kept their work secret from at least one partner or disclosed limited information, shielding them from stigma but resulting in a burden of secrecy. The majority of participants (151/183) who had been/were currently involved in an intimate relationship chose to disclose their sex work to at least one partner, which for most, had one or more negative consequences. A small group of participants related that disclosure resulted in acceptance, support, and understanding from their intimate partner. Some participants avoided the disclosure dilemma by forming intimate relationships from social connections where sex work status was already known. These relationships were generally supportive. We conclude that intimate relationships provide positive experiences for many people who sell sexual services and that these relationships could be stronger if societal stigma was reduced.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Approximately 80% of adults aged 50+ report a desire to stay in their homes as long as possible, or to ‚Äúage in place.‚Äù Yet, as the US aging population becomes more racially and ethnically diverse, the frameworks used to describe ‚Äúaging in place‚Äù will require explicit recognition of the issues specific to racial/ethnic minorities. For example, given the intersection of historical discrimination related to race, gender, age, and lower socioeconomic status, older African American women are at increased risk for poor health outcomes as they attempt to ‚Äúage in place.‚Äù We conducted a scoping review of ‚Äúaging in place‚Äù studies in the US (N=479), to determine whether current ‚Äúaging in place‚Äù frameworks included issues relevant to racial/ethnic minorities generally, and African American women, specifically. Our inclusion criteria for articles were as follows: 1) a definition of ‚Äúaging in place‚Äù; 2) a conceptual framework related to ‚Äúaging in place‚Äù and/or 3) the incorporation of racial/ethnic minorities generally and African-American women specifically in the research sample. We adapted the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) framework for our review to search the PubMed database for ‚Äúaging in place‚Äù studies. After applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria (N=244), the findings from our review showed that approximately 40% of studies included an explicit definition of ‚Äúaging in place‚Äù (N=100), but few studies focused on African American women (N=20). Future studies on ‚Äúaging in place‚Äù should consider the unique challenges that African American women face as they navigate the challenges of ‚Äúaging in place.‚Äù",

      "title": "Challenges of Sexuality Expression in Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder",
      "abstract": "Introduction Sexuality, although an essential component of human health, remains a controversial topic shrouded in stigma, particularly in the context of neurodiversity, which includes autism spectrum disorder (ASD), where the expression of sexuality presents unique challenges. Autism and sexuality is a complex and multifaceted topic that involves understanding the unique ways in which individuals on the autism spectrum experience and express their sexuality. Objectives The purpose of this work is to address the complexity of the biopsychosocial sexuality components of people with autism, promoting a shift in the medical perspective, societal attitudes, and supporting greater inclusion of these individuals in current discussions regarding this area of human behavior and experience. Methods Evidence-based review, through research conducted on PubMed and selection of the most relevant studies on this topic, published in the last decade. Results Sexuality in autism is now recognized as a normative and integral aspect of development and functioning. Existing research suggests that most individuals with ASD display a clear interest in sexuality and relationships, with a study reviling that 96% of the ASD sample expressed an interest in sexuality. Individuals with high autistic traits tended to identify themselves more times as bisexual or presented a sexuality not definable within the categories of heterosexual. The relationship between autism and gender dysphoria is an area of ongoing research and discussion. Studies have suggested a higher prevalence of gender diverse identities and experiences within the autism community compared to the general population. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain the increased gender and sexual diversity among individuals with autism. People with ASD may face unique challenges when it comes to their sexuality. The impairments in social skills and communication central to ASD potentially impact an autistic individual‚Äôs expression and experience of sexuality by affecting their abilities to understand and interpret social cues, emotions, and nonverbal behaviors of others. Importantly, such individuals may be more vulnerable, as they may have different or even limited understanding of boundaries and consent. To address these challenges, it is important to acknowledge and respect the diversity of sexual experiences and desires among individuals with neuro(bio)logical differences. This can be done by providing accurate and inclusive sex education, creating safe spaces for such individuals to explore and express their sexuality, and working to address discrimination and abuse in intimate contexts. Conclusions Recognizing and respecting this diversity and fostering inclusive and accepting environments, we can help individuals with neurological differences to fully express and explore their sexuality and have satisfying sexual lives.

      "abstract": "Einleitung Ess- und K√∂rperbildst√∂rungen werden gesellschaftlich und wurden lange in der Forschung als St√∂rungen d√ºnner, wei√üer, wohlhabender M√§dchen betrachtet. Dagegen entwickelte sich in den letzten Jahren ein zunehmendes Bewusstsein f√ºr Diversit√§t als Forschungsdimension. So ergeben sich ‚Äì √ºberwiegend aus dem US-amerikanischen Raum ‚Äì belastbare Hinweise auf erh√∂hte Pr√§valenzraten in sexuellen und geschlechtlichen Minderheitengruppen. Mit soziokulturellen Theorien, Minderheitenstressmodell und Objektifizierungstheorie bestehen Rahmenkonzepte, die spezifische Einflussfaktoren auf K√∂rperbild und Essverhalten in diesen Personengruppen annehmen. Diese Theorien sind bislang wenig integriert und zu den Einfl√ºssen einzelner Faktoren wie bspw. community involvement oder Prozessen der (Selbst-) Objektifizierung ergeben sich widerspr√ºchliche Befunde. Zudem wird das K√∂rperbild h√§ufig auf einzelne Komponenten reduziert oder unidimensional (Schlankheit oder Muskularit√§t) konzeptualisiert. Schlie√ülich existiert insgesamt eine geringere Zahl diversit√§tssensitiver Untersuchungen aus dem deutschsprachigen Raum. Das vorgestellte Projekt erfasst mit Gender und sexueller Orientierung daher zwei Aspekte von Diversit√§t und begreift K√∂rperbild als multidimensionales Konstrukt. Neben der Erfassung von Gruppenunterschieden soll unter Zusammenschau obiger Theorien der Beitrag einzelner Faktoren zur k√∂rperbildbezogenen Unzufriedenheit und Modifikationsverhaltensweisen bei LGBTQ- und hetero-cis-Personen untersucht werden.",

      "title": "Disorganized Attachment, Development of Dissociated Self States, and a Relational Approach to Treatment",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Disorganized (D) attachment, and the double-bind characteristics of the relationships that foster it, form a basis for theoretical approaches to understanding the development of alternating, dissociated self states with incompatible, idealizing/devaluing or victim/persecutor models of attachment, such as are observed in borderline personality and dissociative disorders. This model proposes that the double binds inherent in abuse by a primary caretaker are likely to generate two or more dissociated self states, with contradictory working models of attachment. In contrast, because dissociated states ensuing from extra-familial trauma can be expected to have been constructed primarily around fear, all parts of the self will operate according to the same attachment paradigm. Because relationships within the family of origin appear at least as important as trauma in the development of dissociated self states, this has important implications for treatment of child abuse survivors. D attachment may result from several parental behaviors: abuse, neglect, frightening, intrusive or insensitive manner; and disrupted affective communication. Longitudinal research demonstrates that D attachment in infancy predicts dissociation in childhood and early adulthood. Theoretical models describing the relationships among D attachment, the development of segregated internal working models of attachment, and the emergence of dissociated self states will be discussed. A relational approach to therapy calls for consideration of attachment issues in creating the frame for therapy and tailoring treatment to the individual trauma survivor. The therapist can serve as a relational bridge between dissociated self states, allowing the patient to internalize a working model of the therapeutic relationship. This interaction provides a vehicle for integrating dissociated self states and opportunity for development of more flexible, adaptive models of being with others.",

Results replicated previous findings of a preference for stimulus persons who express \"appropriate\" sex-role interests, with feminine males being rated most negatively. However, as predicted, this effect was moderated by the attitudes toward women held by the research participants. Traditional participants showed a strong attraction preference for masculine male and feminine female strangers, but nontraditional participants were relatively nondiscriminating in their preferences. As attitudes slowly shift in a more egalitarian direction, individuals should become less constrained by current sex-role stereotypes. However, in view of the fact that all participants showed some degree of relative dislike for feminine males on all measures, freedom of role expression may remain more difficult for males than for females.",

      "abstract": "There is evidence to suggest that body image dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms are related among lesbians and that the strength of this relationship may be influenced by individuals‚Äô sense of belonging to the lesbian community at each of the three layers: broad, organizational, and friendship. The broad layer provides an overarching ideology and, within this layer, individuals may not have direct contact with each other. The organizational layer is represented by groups, organizations, or activities, which exist to bring together lesbians who have a shared interest or proximity, such as lesbian support, social, or interest groups. The friendship layer refers to one‚Äôs personal network of friends, and it provides general support and acceptance of oneself as a whole person. A sample of 162 self-identified Australian lesbians completed measures of body image satisfaction, depressive symptoms, and sense of belonging. Results demonstrated that sense of belonging to each layer moderated the body image dissatisfaction‚Üídepressive symptoms relationship such that the relationship weakens with increasingly higher levels of sense of belonging. Results further showed that high levels of sense of belonging to the organizational and friendship layers were particularly protective. Examining each layer of community simultaneously has shown the importance of more intimate relationships, in addition to the relationships at the broad layer. The results have significant implications for treatment interventions. Practitioners should consider ways to connect lesbians to these more intimate layers of community.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Theory and research regarding permissive or nonpermissive attitudes toward sexual behaviors have contained apparent contradictions: Those maintaining that men and women differ in permissiveness rely on differential socialization theory; those maintaining that men and women share a common level of permissiveness suggest new cohort‚Äêwide values as the explanation; and, discounting male/female differences, permissiveness has been held to vary by degree of involvement in familial or courtship processes. Questionnaire responses of 138 college students' attitudes toward seven sexual situations were analyzed by respondents' sex, class standing, attitude toward divorce, courtship status, and perception of parents' marital happiness. Results provided support for each of the theoretical explanations. Permissiveness varied by each of the independent variables and by specific sexual behaviors (e.g., premarital sexual intercourse, cohabitation, communal living, the nexus between pre‚Äê and extramarital sex and marital happiness, and the connection between each spouse's infidelity and divorce). Thus, simple theoretical explanations of permissiveness or its absence appear to be unwarranted. Behaviors must be specified and background variables must be taken into account.",

At the age of adolescence, namely the age range of 15 to 18 years adolescents will experiencethe first puberty, even some children experience puberty more quickly, which is around 10-13 years. In puberty,there is a strong urge that comes from within the individual to know something that he had neverknown. Circumstances like this that encourage adolescents in this case to try new things in life, including freesex (free sex). Sexual activity via mobile phones has now mushroomed in the community. Do not know thebeginning of when it began, but certainly there are many who know if sex can be done via cellular phone. Theactivity of having sex through a cellular phone is called phone sex. Telephone sex (Phone Sex) is a type ofvirtual sex that refers more to explicit sexual conversations that occur between two or more people over thetelephone especially when one participant or sex partner masturbates or performs sexual fantasies. Phone Sex (PS) is a sexual activity carried out by listening on a cellular phone.

      "title": "Re: Sexual Harassment",
      "abstract": "Sexual harassment is widespread and prolific across the human race, mostly of females by males. It is a spectrum, from the worst of criminal behaviour (e.g. rape and murder of strangers, of women and girls) to what might be considered harmless playful banter between the sexes from later childhood and ever after. It does not occur in infancy, and appears to begin as a ‚Äòlearned‚Äô phenomenon from later childhood. In his editorial, Isaacs considers sexual harassment occurring of women within our own profession, recognising that almost all examples of sexual harassment involve bullying, abuse of power and greater physical strength by males, often leading to emotional and/or physical harms.1 He does not mention the biological differences between the sexes.1 While sexual harassment is apparently learned, not innate, pre-pubertal boys and men are more aggressive than females, have more accidents and commit more violent crimes. While biological differences make males more often the initiators of sexual advances, they are no excuse for predatory or inappropriate behaviour, but any improvements will need to take these differences into account. Isaacs does not mention the importance of co-factors,1 the worst of which is alcohol. The disinhibiting effect of alcohol is relevant in both promoting and facilitating abuse, and any solution will need to take alcohol into account. Isaacs advocates greater fight-back by women and better behaviour by men.1 In truth, we really do not know what to do to prevent sexual harassment, but whatever it is, it needs to be on multiple fronts. We must start with teaching children, especially boys, that sexual harassment is unacceptable, like all bullying. As is clear from public health improvements, for example seat belts, pool fences and reducing drink driving, both active measures (sanctions) and passive measures (advocacy) will have to be used.",

      "abstract": "Looked after and adopted children are among the most vulnerable in our society and it is well established that they present with a higher prevalence of mental health problems than children who live with their birth family. In their histories, they frequently have birth parents who have lived chaotic lives, some with mental health problems and substance misuse, and have experienced disruptions of care as well as exposure to neglect and/or abuse. However, often when they try to access mental health services, all their problems are formulated as ‚Äòtrauma and attachment issues‚Äô with lack of data to support these. This article presents a case study of a 15-year-old boy whose severe difficulties were understood and formulated in terms of ‚Äòattachment problems‚Äô for many years. Neuro-developmental issues, unrelated to his being removed from his birth parents and adopted, had not been considered as the biological factors of the formulation (e.g. genetics and intra-uterus events) were ignored. Because there are no evidence-based interventions for a vaguely defined presentation such as ‚Äòattachment problems‚Äô, he was given non-evidenced therapies for years and the parents felt blamed. Understandably, there was then little progress with his difficulties and this in turn had a very detrimental impact on his family, academic and social life. It is recommended that looked after and adopted children have their presentations formulated using a biopsychosocial model that takes into account their complexities to personalise future interventions, just like children who live with their birth parents. It is imperative they stop receiving mental health services where ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô and that the training of staff working with this group ensures that children‚Äôs whole life experiences are understood.",

      "abstract": "Qualitative studies have begun demonstrating how heteropatriarchy negatively affects queer farmer well-being and farm viability. However, quantita¬≠tive surveys of farmers rarely ask questions about gender identity and sexual orientation, precluding analyses that could connect farmers‚Äô experiences to their queerness or to heteropatriarchy more broadly. In this article, we present data from one of the first surveys of U.S. queer farmers. This article inquires: (a) What barriers to farm viability and farmer well-being do queer farmers report? (b) How are these barriers related to or influenced by gender and sexuality? (c) How, if at all, do queer farmers mitigate heteropatriarchal barriers in farm¬≠ing? We find that queer farmers explicitly attributed interpersonal areas of discrimination to their queer¬≠ness‚Äîor rather, to heteropatriarchy‚Äîespecially anticipated discrimination, social isola¬≠tion, training opportunities and/or lack of skill, and family dynamics. We assert that farmers‚Äô reported chal¬≠lenges to farming success reflect areas of systemic heteropatriarchal oppression, especially in profita¬≠bility, land access, health insurance, and affordable and/or available hous¬≠ing. At the same time, queer farmers turn to each other for support in navi¬≠gating the heteropatri¬≠archal landscape of U.S. agri¬≠culture. The top area that queer farmers found helpful for their success was LGBTQIA+ farm mentors or peers. Our findings indicate that het¬≠eropatriarchy is a central force negatively affecting queer farmers‚Äô well-being and farm viability. This research offers critical information for farmers, farming organi¬≠zations, scholars, and policymakers to bolster farmers‚Äô contributions to U.S. agriculture and gain a more holistic understanding of (in)equity in U.S. agriculture.",

Perang suku merupakan jalan terakhir yang diambil ketika penyelesaian suatu masalah secara musyawarah tidak dapat diselesaikan atau pihak yang berkonflik memang ‚Äúmusuh‚Äù secara permanen. Tindakan yang dilakukan dalam perang suku tersebut merupakan perilaku agresi. Perilaku agresi ialah perilaku yang bertujuan guna melukai orang lain baik secara fisik maupun verbal. Berdasarkan hasil studi literatur ditemukan bahwa penyebab perilaku agresi pada budaya perang suku adalah karena faktor internal, eksternal, stressor lingkungan dan situasiasional. Pada faktor internal, perilaku agresi muncul akibat masalah yang mengancam harga diri, kemudian masalah ini disosialisasikan dengan muatan emosi sehingga memicu perang suku. Pada faktor eksternal telihat bahwa sejak anak-anak, masyarakat tradisional sudah belajar berperang dari lingkungan sosialnya dan mendapatkan penguatan positif ataupun negative yang turut meningkatkan perilaku agresi. Pada kondisi stressor lingkungan, perilaku agresi muncul akibat kompetisi populasi terhadap sumber daya yang terbatas. Pada faktor situasional dijelaskan bahwa perilaku agresi disebabkan oleh miras, provokasi konflik politik dan lain-lain. Keseluruhan faktor di atas tidak akan terwujud dalam perilaku agresi apabila tidak ada faktor pemicu yang dianggap oleh masyarakat tradisional telah merugikan aspek social-ekonomi atau melanggar norma adat yang berlaku.",

Older men and women aged 66-80 (N=17) who are married, healthy, and living in communities were interviewed regarding ADL, present and past sexual practices, prejudices on elderly sexuality, and obstacles to sexual life. The findings of this study are as follows: First, the old perceived that sexuality even in old age is an important part of life. However, they were also prejudiced about sexual intimacy in old age. Second, although an increase in age is correlated with a decrease in sexual activity, a number of older men and women continue to have active sexual life and they are satisfied with it as ever. This indicates a duality in the way the elderly perceive sexuality. Third, health status, partner's responsiveness, and environmental problems are prominent obstacles to sexual life. The study revealed that late-life sexuality must be conceived as a complex bio-psycho-social phenomenon. Consequently, it is important to hold sexual education programs for the young and the old.„Äë",

      "abstract": "Abstract Abstract Professional and popular discussions of the effects of adult-adolescent sexual relations focus almost exclusively on harmfulness. Possible benefit is almost never considered. Yet historical perspective shows that such relations were common in past times, often seen as socially functional. It is argued that the current narrow focus on harm is driven by ideology, with problems such as moral panic and consequence. To address this imbalance in focus and response, the present article (originally a conference paper) reviewed nonclinical empirical research and case studies involving adolescent boys' sexual experiences with adults, where evidence for positive reactions is common. Beyond mere reactions, perceived long-term benefit is common in certain types of adolescent boy-adult sexual relations and includes increased sexual confidence, bolstered self-acceptance, and enhanced development via mentoring. This evidence for frequency and importance of benefit, it is concluded, indicates that the current focus on harm is biased. Considering benefits as well can improve a valid understanding of adult-adolescent sex and lessen overreaction. Key Words: Adolescent-adult sexmoral panicbenefits",

To examine age differences in couples‚Äô emotional responses and in their I/we-talk, emotion word use, and immediacy (i.e., self-focused, present-tense style), 42 married couples ages 22‚Äì77 recounted their relationship‚Äôs history then rated the discussion and their moods. Compared to younger couples, older couples used more we than I language, more positive than negative words, and less immediacy. Partners in older pairs shared more similar language patterns.

      "title": "Dinamika Penyimpangan Seksual Pada Remaja Lelaki",
      "abstract": "Latar Belakang: Fenomena keberadaan laki-laki yang suka berhubungan dengan laki-laki atau yang lebih di kenal dengan nama LSL sebenarnya sudah lama ada. Dalam istilah kekinian, para kaum LSL enggan disamakan dengan kaum Gay, karena mereka menganggap dapat melakukan hubungan seksual dengan lawan jenis, sedangkan pada umumnya mereka melakukan hubungan sejenis dipengaruhi oleh faktor desakan atau dorongan birahi sesaat. Perilaku LSL yang cenderung tidak aman dapat menjadi bom waktu penyebaran HIV, apalagi komunitas meraka cenderung tertutup sehingga sangat sulit terjangkau dalam program penanggulangan HIV/AIDS. Tujuan: Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengkaji penyebab penyimpangan seksual pada remaja lelaki, mengkaji kehidupan sosial serta mengetahui kebijakan dan program pemerintah daerah terkait dengan penyimpangan seksual remaja lelaki. Metode: Penelitian ini menggunakan metode kualitatif dengan sampel adalah remaja lelaki yang mempunyai penyimpangan seksual (LSL), sedangkan teknik pengambilan sampel pada penelitian adalah dengan menggunakan¬† snowball sampling . Hasil: Penyebab penyimpangan seksual pada remaja lelaki diantaranya adalah karena kurangnya perhatian dari orangtua, laki-laki dianggap lebih mengerti dan penuh perhatian, serta adanya rasa bosan terhadap perempuan Simpulan: Penyebab terjadinya penyimpangan seksual pada remaja lelaki adalah remaja kurang mendapat perhatian dari orang tua dan kondisi lingkungan yang kurang mendukung dalam membentuk kepribadiannya. Perhatian dan rasa kasih sayang yang didapatkan dari sesama jenis menjadi pemicu seseorang mengalami perubahan perasaan, menjalani kehidupan asmara dengan sesama jenis dirasakan jauh lebih menyenangkan dan menantang. Kata Kunci: Dinamika, Lelaki Seks Lelaki (LSL), Penyimpangan, Remaja, Seksual ABSTRACK Background : The phenomenon of the existence of men who like to relate to men or whose relationship is better known as MSM actually has long existed. In contemporary terms, men with MSM are refuse to be equated with gays, because they consider that they are able to have sexual relations with the opposite sex, whereas in general, they conduct similar relationships by being influenced by a momentary pressure or urge. The behavior of MSM which tends to be unsafe can be a time-bomb for the spread of HIV; moreover, their communities tend to be closed so that it is very difficult to reach in the HIV / AIDS prevention program. Objective : This study aims to examine the causes of sexual irregularities in young men, study social life and find out the policies, and becomes programs of local governments related to sexual deviations of male adolescents. Methods : This study uses a qualitative method with a sample of young men who have sexual deviations (MSM), while the sampling technique in research is to use snowball sampling. Results : The cause of sexual deviation in young men is due to a lack of attention from parents, the fact that men are considered more understanding and attentive, and there is a sense of boredom towards women. Conclusion : The causes of sexual deviations in young men are adolescents who get less attention from parents and environmental conditions that are less supportive in shaping their personality. The attention and affection gained from the same sex trigger a person to experience a change of feeling, living a same-sex life is much more fun and challenging. Keywords : Adolescent , Dynamics, Deviation, Male Sex Men (MSM), Sexual",

      "abstract": "Informal discussions of human motivation typically start with several common assumptions that are generally considered uncontroversial: while we often want what is best for us and for others, there are also times when we want things that are bad for others and (or) for ourselves. In fact, our desires for bad things often compete with our desires for good things, and the former often overcome the latter. There are bad people ‚Äì evil ones even. They are bad because their desire to do what's bad almost always wins out over their desire to do what's good. They seek to harm others as a way of benefiting themselves. The most dangerous are those who are very knowledgeable. Smart but evil people are far more effective in harming others than are the ignorant and foolish ones. Even if we focus on good people (people who want to be good and benefit themselves and others), we find that many of them allow their desires for the bad to overwhelm their desires for the good. Weakness of will is a major reason why even good people often do bad things. One of the major problems with the world is that most people usually think about themselves and what is good for them, personally, when they act. The world would be a better place if, rather than focusing on our own self-interest, we were to focus on what is good for others.",

      "title": "Childhood Sexual Abuse",
      "abstract": "Sexual abuse is defined as use of child or adolescent by the adults for satisfying of sexual urges and needs with forcing, threatening or tricking. Sexual abuse can be in the form of sexual abuse without touch, sexual touch, interfemoral intercourse, sexual penetration, and sexual exploitation. The prevalence of sexual abuse is reported as 10-40%. It is seen in female four times more than in males. Abusers are frequently male, only 5-15% of them are female. The abuse by females is usually towards male child. Thirty-fifty percent of abuse cases among child and adolescent are outside the family including strangers or familiar person. Some features of abusers are introvert personality, pedophilic and antisocial personality. Most of the abusers have a history of sexual abuse or aggression during childhood. Sexual intercourse between two people who are not allowed to marry by law is called as incest. Family pattern of incest is defined globally as disorganized and dysfunctional. The most commonly reported familial pattern is rigid and patriarchal family pattern with a harsh father using force quite frequently. The clinical features and impacts of the sexual abuse on the child varies according to the relation between abusers and the child, form of abuse, duration of abuse, presence of physical assault, developmental phase, child age and psychological development before the abuse. Sexual abuse history may result in psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, substance dependence, suicide act, borderline personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder. Abuse negatively affects interpersonal relationships and self esteem of abused individuals. Several studies reported close association between risky sexual behaviors in adulthood and a history of of sexual abuse during childhood. Four traumatic dynamics including traumatic sexuality with abuse, feeling of betrayal, weakness, and stigmatization exist in childhood abuse. Trauma can cause behavioral and psychological results by itself, early trauma may also lead to biological effects. Especially traumas during neuron plasticity phase may lead hypersensitivity of neuroendocrine stress response. Early life stresses are shown to lead changes in corticotrophin releasing factor system in preclinical and clinical phase studies. In the treatment of sexual abuse, emotional process related with trauma should be focused on. This process may be conducted with play therapy. Development of higher level defense mechanism, increasing ego capacity, orientation to social activity and personal activity according to skills is aimed. For the elimination of guiltiness related with stigmatization, the child should be told that it is not herhis fault to incorporate into sexual interaction and the culprit is abuser. It is fairly important for medical staff, school and family to have sufficient information about sexual abuse for prevention and early recognition.",

Identity formation during adolescence is strongly affected by hormonal/body changes, the effects of culture and society, and cognitive and emotional difficulties. For adolescents, the new changes happening in their bodies can be overwhelming. Many things must be considered in a psychodynamic formulation that come to the fore in adolescence. For example, one's sense of gender is generally consolidated much earlier. Sexual identity may be somewhat fluid for adolescents, and experimentation is the norm. Adolescence may also be the time when cognitive and emotional difficulties first appear. Many factors can disrupt identity consolidation in adolescence. As always, traumas, family strife, and losses must be considered. A very common source of trouble in this area is drug and alcohol use disorders. Adult patients are likely to have strong memories of adolescence.",

The subject of the study is the characteristic features of understanding and defining happiness and well-being in the humanities and social practice. The purpose of the study is to identify in the domestic economic science the concepts associated with the categories of \"happiness\" and \"well-being\" and to propose approaches to determining their quantitative values. General scientific methods of analysis and synthesis, dialectical approach to concepts and phenomena, methods of interpretation of secondary data of sociological research are applied. The results of the study are the conclusions confirmed by sociological surveys and indicating the following: ‚Äì Russians most often associate a state of happiness with material well-being (income), which allows meeting various needs; ‚Äì in the interpretation of happiness as a state of satisfaction with life, gender differences are practically not expressed, at the same time, age-specific features turn out to be very significant; ‚Äì in meeting their needs, Russians increasingly associate the feeling of happiness and well-being with managing healthcare costs; ‚Äì experts note negative externalities: emotional exhaustion from the prioritization of the desire for income growth and the intergenerational nature of the negative consequences of overstating expectations; ‚Äì a situational rethinking of the factors that directly influence stereotypes and the format of a happy and prosperous person is in demand; clarification of the elements necessary to measure happiness and well-being as separate quantities; ‚Äì the economic behavior of a person is aimed at satisfying his needs and, thus, is associated with well-being and a sense of success as an attribute of a sense of happiness; ‚Äì a sustainable environment is included in the set of indicators of a happy and prosperous life of a Russian; ‚Äì an individual's self-assessment of his own life is the main method of forming subjective indicators of a person's satisfaction; ‚Äì life expectancy is a complex indicator that reflects the impact of objective and subjective factors of a person's satisfaction with their life (factors affecting a person'shappiness) and their indicators. The author's structural model \"Human Happiness\" which combines the factors that influence the individual's perception of the state of happiness is proposed. &nbsp",

      "abstract": "The evaluation of psychiatric histories of 56 women from the age of 45 to 60 diagnosed as monopolar depressions demonstrates the incongruence of natural-scientific and interpreting (hermeneutic) competence. In 60% of the cases no details about the gynecological anamnesis could be found; in 36% informations about the sexual selfperception by the patients were available; these informations were not placed under a specific category of anamnesis but scattered throughout the text and left a exigency of interpretation. Gynecological pains in a wider sense appeared in half of the cases. These datas are put in the frame of a specific, socially preformed idea of female aging, which indeed gives place to the here studied depressive syndrome, but not to a suitable mode of expression according to age, sexual desire resp. female individuality. The term of \"ideal motherliness\", i.e. a motherliness without the obligation to produce children, is introduced here as a possible therapeutic and social criticism. The interdependence of sexual mode of expression on one side, which is granted or not granted from a certain age on, of psychiatric symptoms becoming relevant and a fitting niche on the other is called 'ecology' with regard to the said background and according to Bateson. So the dysfunctional stabilization of the patient is regarded as a reflexive kind of way.",

      "abstract": "Psychological and brain science explore human behavior and the human brain by studying volunteers who participate in these studies, and the generalizability of findings in these fields largely depends on the representativeness of samples. However, the representativeness of samples in psychological and neuroscience research has long been criticized. There are two main problems with current research: (1) Lack of sample information. Most studies report only the gender/sex, age, and country of the subjects, while important information such as race/ethnicity, education level, and socio-economic status of the subjects is rarely reported. Moreover, this situation has not changed significantly over time; (2) The information provided suggests that the current sample is not sufficiently representative: there are more female participants than male participants, and they are concentrated in the Western, young, and highly educated populations, while middle-aged and older people, people with lower education levels, and low-income groups are less concerned by researchers. Asian, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino populations also receive less attention. From a national perspective, populations in Asian, African, and Latin American countries are less represented in psychological and neuroscience research. The above two major problems may be mainly due to the following reasons: convenience sampling method as the main sampling method; European and American researchers have led the research in psychological and brain science; neglect of the influence of culture and various demographic factors as a whole; researchers themselves have biases. Changing this situation will require the combined efforts of researchers, academic organisations, journal editors and funders. Improving the representativeness of samples will help to apply the scientific knowledge of psychological and brain science to a wider range of groups, thereby promoting the building of a community with a shared future for humanity.",

      "title": "Sexual Conflict",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although females and males share a common interest in successful reproduction, the sexes often maximise their reproductive success (fitness) in mutually incompatible ways. Two basic forms of sexual conflict are recognised: Interlocus sexual conflict reflects a conflict of interest over the outcome of an interaction between sexes (e.g. to mate or not?), with some genetic loci evolving to enhance male fitness at females‚Äô expense and other loci evolving to promote female fitness by mitigating male‚Äêimposed harm. This conflict drives the evolution of sexually antagonistic male strategies such as coercive behaviours and morphologies, toxic ejaculates and infanticide, and female counter‚Äêadaptations that confer resistance to such strategies. Intralocus sexual conflict reflects divergent selection on a shared trait whose expression is influenced by the same loci in both sexes, such that selection on one sex can displace the other sex from its phenotypic optimum. It selects for genomic adaptations that permit the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Key Concepts: Sexual conflict arises because strategies that maximise the fitness of one sex can reduce the fitness of the other sex. Two basic forms of sexual conflict are recognised: interlocus (between genetic loci) and intralocus (within a genetic locus). Interlocus sexual conflict is a conflict of interest over the outcome of some interaction (e.g. to mate or not?), mediated by different genetic loci in each sex. Sexual conflict can lead to sexually antagonistic coevolution and sexual ‚Äòarms races‚Äô, whereby adaptations that benefit males at females‚Äô expense select for counter‚Äêadaptations in females that mitigate male‚Äêimposed harm. Interlocus sexual conflict is manifested in a variety of traits that increase male reproductive success but harm females in the process, including behavioural harassment and coercion, morphological armaments such as genital spines and chemical manipulation via ejaculate components or pheromones. Intralocus sexual conflict is a conflict of interest over the expression of a shared trait that is subject to sex‚Äêspecific patterns of selection but influenced by the same genetic loci in both sexes. Intralocus sexual conflict selects for modifications to the genetic basis of trait expression that allow each sex to evolve towards its phenotypic optimum, resulting in sexual dimorphism. Intralocus sexual conflict challenges the ‚Äògood genes‚Äô model of sexual selection because females that mate with high‚Äêquality males may produce low‚Äêquality daughters. Sexual conflict may increase the costs of sexual reproduction, reduce mean fitness in populations and (in theory) even promote population extinction. The study of sexual conflict has become one of the most important and dynamic areas in evolutionary biology.",

      "title": "OF MICE AND KIN: THE FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE OF KIN BIAS IN SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR",
      "abstract": "Summary 1. Sharing recent ancestry (kinship) increases the degree of genetic similarity between individuals, where genetic similarity could mean anything from sharing a particular allele to sharing an entire genome. 2. Genetic similarity can influence behavioural and other responses between individuals in a number of ways, discriminatory and non‚Äêdiscriminatory. All are likely to result in kin bias, because of the correlation between genetic similarity and kinship, but only some should be regarded as involving kin discrimination. 3. Non‚Äêdiscriminatory kin bias could arise through close relatives sharing, for instance, physical characteristics (such as those influencing competitive ability), thresholds of behavioural response or requirements for particular resources. 4. Discriminatory kin bias could arise through the direct perception of genetic similarity between individuals (direct similarity discrimination) or the use of cues likely to correlate with genetic similarity (indirect similarity discrimination ‚Äì of which kin discrimination is one form). Alternatively, it could arise incidentally through mistaken identity or discrimination at some other level, such as species identification. 5. Experiments with laboratory and wild house mice have revealed kin bias in a number of contexts, including ( a ) parental and infanticidal behaviour, ( b ) sexual development and behaviour and ( c ) investigatory behaviour and passive body contact among juveniles and adults. 6. While kin bias in mice has been interpreted as evidence for kin discrimination, there are several problems with such an interpretation. These include ( a ) pronounced and complex effects of familiarity on discrimination, ( b ) a high risk of error‚Äêproneness in the indirect cues used in apparent kin discrimination and ( c ) weak and easily disrupted kin bias effects in certain contexts. 7. Consideration of social structure and discriminatory responses within populations of wild house mice leads to an alternative explanation for some kin bias in terms of incidental discrimination based on social group membership. 8. Several results from laboratory experiments suggest incidental discrimination is a more parsimonious explanation than kin discrimination for some intrasexual kin bias in behaviour. However, kin or direct similarity discrimination appears to be the most likely explanation for other aspects of intrasexual kin bias and for intersexual kin bias.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The phenomenon of reduced sexual activity in young couples is very common, with a high estimate being one out of three couples and a low estimate at one out of seven couples. Other than for couples who have become estranged and are angrily involved in a breakdown of their marriage, there is a prototypal situation where it is largely the wife who initiates the reduction or ends the regularity of sexual experience; the husband goes along with her; and the couple settle into a collusive marital and family lifestyle which involves a striking emphasis on the joys and meaningfulness of maintaining their shared home and raising their children while neglecting, minimizing, or pensating for dysfunctions and gaps in their basic relationship and intimacy with one another. Sixty-nine percentof sex-avoidant couples demonstrated a marital profile that we characterized as ‚ÄúHouse-Parent Marriages,‚Äù while only 23% of couples who maintain a more normal sexual frequency showed this pattern.",

It has serious physical and psychosocial consequences which adversely affect the health and overall well-being of a child. Large strides in addressing issues like child education, health and development have been taken but, child protection has remained largely unaddressed. There is now a realization that if issues of child abuse and neglect like female foeticide and infanticide, girl child discrimination, child marriage, trafficking of children and so on are not addressed, it will affect the overall progress of the society. The consequence of CAN is real or potential damage to the child‚Äôs life, health or development, especially for infants (1-4 years), wherein the commission or omission of an action could stake a claim on their future life and health. CAN is more widespread than many think.",

      "title": "Navigating Ambivalence: How Heterosexual Young Adults Make Sense of Desire Differences",
      "abstract": "Abstract The miscommunication hypothesis is the assumption that many incidents of acquaintance rape and coercive sex follow from miscommunication between men and women. This hypothesis is entrenched in popular, academic, and judicial understandings of sexual relationships. Recently some evidence has suggested that there is little miscommunication between sexual partners and that the hypothesis does not explain acquaintance rape or other forms of sexual violence. The present study used qualitative methodology in which men and women were asked to imagine themselves in a particular heterosexual dating situation and write what they think happened between the beginning (when sex was refused by one partner) and the end (when sex happened). Thematic analysis of the data found no evidence for miscommunication between partners under conditions of differences in desire. Instead, ambivalence about sexual activity was commonly described by women and men and was most often resolved to both parties' satisfaction. Coercion by men was present in a minority of narratives under conditions of clear understanding of women's refusals. The study thus provides a rich, experience-based representation of heterosexual sexual activity, with considerable potential for the development of effective education campaigns.

It is empirically linked with sexual offending against children: Child pornography offenders and sex offenders with child victims are more likely to be pedophiles based on self-report or objective measures of sexual interests. At the same time, some pedophiles have not had any known sexual contact with children, and perhaps half of sex offenders against children would not meet diagnostic criteria for pedophilia. Pedophilia can be diagnosed using a variety of methods and is an important factor to consider in the assessment of sex offenders because pedophilic offenders are more likely to sexually reoffend and require different interventions. There is no evidence to suggest that pedophilia can be changed. Instead, interventions are designed to increase voluntary control over sexual arousal, reduce sex drive, or teach self-management skills to individuals who are motivated to avoid acting upon their sexual interests.",

      "abstract": "One hundred and fifty-two heterosexual couples reported their actual and ideal duration of foreplay and intercourse, as well as their perceptions of their partners' desired duration of foreplay and intercourse. Further, participants reported the duration of foreplay and intercourse that they felt most men and most women wanted. Ideal length of foreplay did not differ for men and women. However, men reported a significantly longer ideal duration of intercourse than did their partners. The ideal duration of foreplay and intercourse were significantly longer than the actual duration for both genders. The women, but not the men, significantly underestimated their partners' desired duration of foreplay and intercourse. Further, both genders exhibited faulty stereotypes concerning men's but not women's ideal scripts. Men were seen as desiring a significantly shorter duration of foreplay and intercourse than the ideal reported by the men in the study. Both men's and women's perceptions of their partners' ideal duration of foreplay and intercourse were found to be more strongly related to their own sexual stereotypes than to their partners' self-reported sexual desires, suggesting that people rely on sexual stereotypes when estimating their partners' ideal sexual scripts. Men's and women's ideal scripts and men's and women's sexual stereotypes concerning the opposite gender's ideal duration of foreplay were found to uniquely predict the foreplay performance script. For intercourse, men's and women's ideal scripts and men's stereotypes concerning the duration of intercourse that women want uniquely predicated the performance script. We present potential reasons for the discrepancy in individuals' performance and ideal scripts.",

Derogatory attitude in an individual may exist in a setting devoid of politically based racism and may have nothing to do with race. The more widespread issue of prejudice is an individual attitude which may invoke race, but is as likely to be related to some other 'stigma'-generating marker. In normal practice it is unusual to find evidence of discrimination consequent on prejudice in open every-day therapeutic contact between workers/therapists and patients. Attempts were made to interview patients through relatives, neighbours and hospital personnel involved in their management, and to this end a semi-structured interview form was used which included data on mental, social, psychological and material factors.",

Examined the experiences and attitudes of students of both sexes regarding early gender socialization and it's characteristically stereotypes, stereotypes about dressing, instrumentalization of sexuality, the influence of parents/environment on the formation of sexual morality, own the gender socialization in the family, twin rules for the socialization of children of different gender and sex/gender roles in marriage. Belonging to the sex group has no effect on susceptibility to sexual stereotypes regarding early gender socialization and dressing. Difference may be seen in the effort to comment on and evaluate the wear behavior of girls more than a young man dressing, which may be an indicator for further research had sexual dimorphism in terms of dressing and nudity. It seems that the experience of respondents of both sexes are dependent primarily from the general family atmosphere (closeness, openness to communicate with each other, the absence of the traditional gender division of roles in the family/emotional distance from the parent of the opposite sex or of both parents, the rigidity, the strict division of gender roles in the family). In the first case, where both parents are involved in the upbringing of the child, relationships are intimate with both, and vice versa. Therefore, we can conclude about the lack of connection between the sex of the child and separated upbringing (traditional: the mother confides sexual education of women, a father of male child) in the first case, and a link to another should only check to prove it. Sex does not condition susceptibility to stereotypes about education and gender roles. Traditionally, transitional and modern attitudes are equally represented in subjects of both sexes.",

In addition, there is an assumed theoretical link between the desire and pursuit of short-term relationships and sexual activity and the desire and pursuit of long-term, commitment oriented relationships and romantic motivation. Our research tested how these assumptions hold for gender differences among lesbians and gay men. We tested these differences using measures of romantic obsession and sexual compulsivity, representing extreme forms of motivation for romance and motivations for sexual behavior. Gay men reported significantly greater symptoms of sexual compulsivity compared to lesbians. However, contrary to our expectations, gay men reported significantly greater symptoms of romantic obsession than lesbians. Sexual compulsivity and romantic obsession were significantly correlated. The study also discusses gender differences in relationship type and number of sexual partners, two factors often cited in research on gender differences.",

      "abstract": "Experiencing and anticipating discrimination because one possesses a visible (e.g., race) or concealable (e.g., mental illness) stigmatized identity has been related to increased psychological distress. Little research, however, has examined whether experiencing and anticipating discrimination related to possessing both a visible and concealable stigmatized identity (e.g., a racial/ethnic minority with a history of mental illness) impacts mental health. In the current study, we test two hypotheses. In the first, we examine whether experienced discrimination due to a visible stigma (race/ethnicity) and anticipating stigma due to a concealable stigma (e.g., substance abuse) each predict unique variance in depressive symptomatology. In the second, we examine whether experienced discrimination due to a visible stigma is related to greater anticipated stigma for a concealable stigma, which in turn is related to more depression. A total of 265 African American and Latinx adults who reported concealing a stigmatized identity at least some of the time completed measures of racial/ethnic discrimination, anticipated stigma of a concealable stigmatized identity, and depressive symptomatology. Results of a simultaneous linear regression revealed that increased racial/ethnic discrimination and anticipated stigma independently predicted greater depressive symptomatology (controlling for each other). A mediation analysis showed that the positive association between increased racial/ethnic discrimination and higher depressive symptomatology was partially mediated by greater anticipated stigma. These results demonstrate that a person can experience increased psychological distress from multiple types of stigma separately, but also may anticipate greater stigma based on previous experiences of racial discrimination, which in turn relates to increased distress.",

Scientists have learned that very young infants experience shame (as a personal feeling of unworthiness and shame), when they experience rejection-even if it is unintentional. Children, who are admonished for doing something over which they have limited or no control, are also capable of feeling shame. On a more serious, long-lasting scale, physical and sexual abuse and other traumatic experiences, particularly those that happen directly to the child, without adequate intervention, may lead to the development of shame as well. Considering the origin of the shame-wound is critical as well. If one is the child of abusive and/or addicted parents, their shame could have been an emotional and psychological transplant. Assessing if the shame is a consequence of actions, inactions, or someone elses conflicts, can allow for internal conflict resolution.",

Bien avant les premiers articles scientifiques, la litterature et le the√¢tre mettent en exergue les effets controverses de ce breuvage sur les relations amoureuses et sexuelles. Des publications recentes rapportent que l'ingestion de faible quantite de boissons alcoolisees ne modifie pas les comportements ni les competences sexuelles contrairement aux idees recues d'une amelioration des performances et de l'eveil sexuel. Lors de consommations moderees ou importantes, l'activite sexuelle masculine et feminine est alteree et caracterisee par une alteration de la sensibilite, une perte de l'envie sexuelle, des retards ou des absences d'orgasmes et d'ejaculations. L'alcool est implique de facon recurrente dans les violences sexuelles mais il semble qu'il soit une comorbidite associee a un trouble de la personnalite plus qu'un moteur en soi. La consommation ethylique altere le controle de ses propres pulsions et aussi la perception des reactions de l'autre selon la theorie de la myopie alcoolique. L'influence du milieu intervient aussi dans les facteurs favorisant les agressions. Les conduites sexuelles a risque pourraient aussi etre favorisees par l'alcool. Cependant, ces donnees sont controversees et font egalement intervenir d'autres facteurs comme la personnalite de l'individu, l'influence socio-culturelle, les campagnes de prevention... Malgre une association negative entre l'alcool et les comportements sexuels, les etudes sont contradictoires quant au lien de cause a effet. Il existe de nombreuses limitations methodologiques et il parait actuellement difficile de generaliser les resultats obtenus.

Secara umum perceraian atau gugat cerai dapat dilaksanakan apabila terdapat kelemahan atau cacat yang dimiliki suami istri, yaitu: Kelemahan atau cacat yang menjadi penghalang hubungan suami istri (seksual), misalnya bagi laki-laki zakarnya terpotong atau inpoten. Sementara wanita kemaluannya tersumbat (ar-ratqu) atau tersumbat tulang (al-qarnu).

      "abstract": "The past several years have brought about some changes in the legal status of the homosexual in USA. In some states, the homosexual is labelled as a criminal; in others, homosexuality is not a legal affair. Psychological theories tend to consider the homosexual from two general positions: the Oedipal and the non-Oedipal. The present study was conducted to try to determine how Oedipal and non-Oedipal male homosexuals perceived their self-image and emotional stability. Significant differences were found between the two groups. Considering self-image, Oedipal subjects were found to be more negative. They had less self-worth, self-confidence and self-acceptance than non-Oedipal. They had more negative self-concepts, self-attitudes, and self-motivation. Oedipal homosexuals had less emotional stability. They had more emotional problems, shame, guilt, withdrawal, and depression than non-Oedipal subjects, as well as less success in sexual activity and commitment to the homosexual partner.",

In the Prairie provinces and Ontario, mock weddings (folk dramatic travesties of the Christian/majoritarian wedding ceremony, usually performed cross dressed) can interrupt wedding showers or milestone anniversary parties. And from Prince Edward Island to British Columbia, charivaris (late night visits to a newly married couple, featuring extreme noisemaking and/or traditional trickery) can follow a marriage. The authors question whether these practices transgress against conventional heterosexual marriage or merely ritualise and thus contain potential resistance to its strictures, and find that they do both.",

      "title": "The Effects of Family Structure and Socialization Influences on Compulsive Buying: A Life Course Study in Thailand",
      "abstract": "Abstract Compulsive consumption is regarded as a global phenomenon that can adversely affect consumer well-being. Although the topic has been studied in different cultural settings, we have seen relatively little theory development and explanations of compulsive behavior Nearly all previous empirical studies attempt to explain this behavior by correlating measures of compulsive behavior with independent variables taken within the same time frame. However, recent developments in social sciences suggest that such a phenomenon may best understood in the context of the person's earlierin-life experiences. Using the life course paradigm as an overarching framework, the present research extends previous work on this topic. Following hypotheses were drawn from literature review: HI: The earlier in childhood and adolescence a person experiences family dislocation, the greater his or her likelihood of exhibiting compulsive behaviors in adulthood. H2: The earlier in life the young person experienced family dislocation, the greater the number of family disruption events the young person experienced prior entering adulthood years. H3: Family dislocation leads to (a) increased frequency of socio-oriented family communications and (b) decreased frequency of concept-oriented family communication. H4: Young adults who were raised in families characterized by a strong socio-oriented communication structure are more likely to exhibit compulsive consumption tendencies than those who were raised in families characterized by a weak socio-oriented family communication structure. H5: Young adults who were raised in families characterized by a strong concept-oriented communication structure are less likely to exhibit compulsive consumption tendencies than those who were raised in families characterized by a week concept-oriented family communication structure. H6: The relationship between family disruption events experienced during adolescence and perceived stressfulness of these events is moderated by (a) global family support, (b) emotional family support, and (c) material family support. Those reporting higher levels of family support as teenagers are less likely to report experiencing stress due to family disruption events. H7: Perceived stressfulness of family disruption events experienced during adolescent years are associated with compulsive consumption tendencies in early adulthood. H8: The greater the number of family disruption events young adults experienced during their adolescent years the more frequent was their communication about consumption with their peers. H9: The more frequent was the young persons' communication with their peers about consumption during their adolescent years, the more likely they are to report compulsive buying tendencies as young adults. We use a sample of 120 Thai undergraduate students attending classes taught in English as part of a four-year international program. Product-moment correlations, hierarchical regression analysis and partial correlation were used to analyze data. Results of testing hypotheses showed that hypothesis 2, 4, 7 and 9 were supported and hypothesis 1, 3, 5, 6 and 8 were not supported. Our study did not find a significant relationship between the age when a person experienced family dislocation and their compulsive behavior tendencies expressed as young adults. We did not find a significant relationship between family dislocation and family communication structures. But we found a significant positive relationship between socio-oriented communication structure and compulsive buying and a significant relationship between our peer communication and compulsive buying measures. Also we found perceived stressfulness due to the disruptive events to have a significant positive relationship between the perceived stressfulness and compulsive buying. Implications from these findings, limitations of this research and future research suggestions were discussed.",

Behaviours that lawfully accompany a certain state or trait and are used by most people to infer that state or trait are commonly called the expressions of that state or trait.

      "abstract": "Abuse is on the significant rise in the world and affects all populations of people equally. Abuse is the use of strenght and power on another person or group, resulting in negative consequences for the victim. As such, violence is a major problem in society, which nurses often encounter. A nurse is competent to recognize forms and types of violence, as well as victims and abusers. Abuse is a complicated phenomenon. It can be active, in the form of physical, sexual or psychological abuse of different intensity, or passive, in the form of neglect. Violence can be directed directly or indirectly. Violence occurred throughout the entire history of mankind. In the past, children and women were considered property by their fathers and husbands. Such behavior was acceptable at that time.There are various theories about the source of violence. Biological theories include neuropsychological, biochemical and genetic influences, and brain disorders. As for the psychological ones, there are psychodynamic theories and theories of learning. One of the sociocultorological theory is related to social influence. Data related to intimate partner abuse, child abuse and neglect, and sexual assault are useful in the use of health care process. Information on the characteristics of both victim and the abuser may be used as background knowledge in designing plans of care for clients who are victims of abuse. Physical abuse between domestic partners may be known as spouse abuse or relationship abuse. Women often get stuck in the cycle of battering, and most often stay in such a relationship because they fear for their own life or the lives of their children. The effects of child maltrearment are usually deep and longlasting, because children are vulnerable and powerless. Poor behavior towards children includes physical and emotional abuse or neglect, or sexual abuse. Attention should also be paid to the possibility of incest. Adults who have survived incest during their lives carry their scars for the rest of the life, and such childhood events can affect their present lives. In recent decades, International organizations warn people of an increasing number of violence against the elderly. Violence of a child over his/her parent is also an act with which a child intimidates and controls a parent, and can be in the form of physical, emotional, material violence and neglect. It can also lead to a high level of stress and is considered to be a risk factor for early death. Any type of sexual act in which an individual is threatened coerced or forced to do against his/her own will is considered to be sexual abuse. Sexual abuse include rape, which implies expression of power and domination, and some of its forms are acquaintance rape, marital rape and statutory rape. Two emotional response patterns for victims can be identified within a couple hours of rape. Those are: the expressed response pattern and the controlled response pattern. Some victims develop a compounded rape reaction while others develop the silent reaction. Health care management is an activity that is coordinated, and its purpose is to provide the quality health care to a sick or healthy individual. The basic management functions are planning, organization, management and control. They include human, financial, material and IT resources in an organizational environment. Nursing diagnosis is based on the data collected during the assessment phase and on background knowledge regarding predisposing factors for the situation. For assessing the outcomes in the care of victim of abuse, criteria for a sexually injured and physically injured patient and abused children may be used. A care plan for abuseed victims and nursing diagnosis was presented together with the outcomes criteria, appropriate nursing interventions, and rationales for each. There is also an innovative approach to planning and organizing nursing care. It is mapping the concept of care as a strategy of teaching and learning in the form of a diagram. Evaluation of nursing actions to assist victims of abuse must be considered on both a short- and a longterm basis. Among the treatments, crisis intervention, safe house or shelter and family treatment are mentioned.",

A significant percentage reported generally feeling visible \"never\" (7.5%), \"rarely\" (53.2%) or only \"sometimes\" (33.6%). Invisibility was felt in queer and heterosexual communities. Participants older than age 30 felt less visible than younger participants. A substantial majority (71.3%) desired increased visibility \"always\" or \"often.\" To this end, bi + individuals made use of a range of visibility-strategies, primarily (in-)direct communication, but also community engagement, public behavioral or gender-based visual displays. The findings emphasize the importance of supporting bi + visibility, shedding light on the challenges faced by non-monosexual individuals.",

This includes: the management of the anatomy, physiology and sexual behaviourof the young boar, that influences its performance as an adult. Normal reproductive activity in boars is coordinated by the endocrine and nervous system. Abnormal activity in one or more of these areas can result in reproductive problems. For the development of the sexual behaviour is important to considerer plays and social conditions of rearing of penmates. Play in animals is common in mammals, frequent in young and is not oriented to satisfy the immediate needs and carries appreciable costs in energy, time and even physical risk. Although, play contributes to the development of several functions that take place in the adult. Sexual behavior begin as early as 1 month of age in boars; mounting activity of penmates is observed more frequently for males than females. Some authors emphasized the importance of social conditions during rearing, due to the sexual activity showed in pubertal boars.",

Early marriage presents the facets of drive level differences, of sexual ignorance, fatigue states, and paired‚Äêrelation images. The sexual complaint is rarely presented as such. Middle marriage is laden with a host of troubles which will present some sexual face. Personal incompatibilities are well developed, progressive alienation is occuring, preoccupation with career or child raising is prominent, and frank psychiatric states come into full bloom. Sexual complaints are readily voiced at this stage. Advanced marriage is marked by the aggravated incompatibilities, the increasing occurence of disease states and both the conditioned libido loss and that induced by medications. The specific problems, and their possible solutions are more readily identified and dealt with within this kind of framework.",

      "abstract": "Research with lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) older widows rarely focuses on familial relationships. Studies on heterosexual spousal bereavement indicate older widows face issues influencing identity but show resilience by maintaining close relationships with adult children and extended family. Though research with older LGB widows suggests similarities around loss and resilience, grief and family engagement are markedly different.Guided by Relational Cultural Theory, which illuminates how LGB women cope through connection/disconnection, this qualitative descriptive study employed semistructured, open-ended interviews with 16 LGB women, 60-85 years of age from across the United States who had lost a spouse or partner within the past 5 years. We conducted interviews regarding the perception of self as bereaved LGB women and sustained or altered relationships with biological and chosen families following the loss of their spouses/partners.Findings are illustrated in three themes around acceptance, support, and identity. Participants: (a) experienced differing levels of acceptance, tolerance, and inclusion from biological families; (b) experienced family or friends \"disappearing\" or providing critical support following a spouse/partner's death; and (c) negotiated challenges by creating or seeking out families of choice, new communities, and a better understanding of themselves.While LGB widows share some grief experiences with heterosexual widows, they also experience varying biological family acceptance and support, as well as the need for friends and families of choice as advocates. It is important to recognize the unique consequences of spousal loss for this population and be cognizant of the differences in normative grief.",

Cross-sectional and longitudinal (over five years) results showed that more strongly endorsing internal/controllable causal beliefs (i.e., believing that making friends depends on effort) related to greater social participation. Moreover, greater social participation related to less loneliness. External/uncontrollable causal beliefs predicted greater loneliness.

      "title": "A qualitative analysis of themes in long-distance couples‚Äô relationship boundary discussions",
      "abstract": "Many couples have explicit discussions regarding the emotional and sexual boundaries in their relationship, which can benefit their relational and sexual health. However, the implicit assumption in health research that couples discuss relationship boundaries to protect their sexual health is counter to evidence that many couples discuss boundaries to increase trust, closeness, and intimacy. We examined long-distance partners‚Äô reasons for discussing boundaries and used an approach and avoidance framework to understand motives. Individuals in long-distance relationships ( N = 77 couples) described their relationship boundaries, what prompted their discussion about boundaries, and the goal of their discussion. We thematically analyzed their motives for the discussion as either approach or avoidance and identified sub-themes that emerged within the larger category of approach and avoidance motives. Most participants had discussed boundaries multiple times with their partner, and about one-third identified a specific event that triggered their discussion. A minority of individuals were motivated to discuss boundaries with their partner to avoid aversive outcomes (i.e., avoidance motives), but no participants reported motives to mitigate sexual health risks. Instead, most participants anticipated gaining individual and relational benefits from their discussion about boundaries (i.e., approach motives), which suggests that couples might be more motivated by what they have to gain by discussing boundaries and are not explicitly motivated to mitigate sexual health risks.",

      "abstract": "This chapter examines the interplay of love and aggression in the couple's emotional relationship. In a woman who did not have an early satisfactory relationship with a mother who tolerated her daughter's sexuality, the unconscious experience of a hostile and rejecting mother who interfered with the little girl's early development of bodily sensuality may result in exaggerated unconscious guilt about sexual intimacy in conjunction with commitment in depth to a man. The differences between men and women in the capacity for tolerating discontinuities also show in their discontinuities regarding love relations, as Alberoni has pointed out: Women usually discontinue sexual relations with a man they no longer love and establish a radical discontinuity between an old love relationship and a new one. One form that aggression related to oedipal conflicts frequently takes is the unconscious collusion of both partners to find a third person who represents a condensed ideal of one and a rival of the other.",

      "abstract": "Researchers are beginning to explore the variety of casual sexual relationships that individuals engage in. These relationships, and the subtle nuances that differentiate them, have not been studied collectively. The purpose of the present study was to qualitatively examine casual sexual relationships (CSRs), ranging from a single encounter to an ongoing sexual relationship with a friend. Male and female focus group participants identifi ed a number of implicit and explicit rules that guide the initiation, maintenance, and termination of four types of casual sexual relationships: One Nights Stands, Booty Calls, Fuck Buddies, and Friends with Benefi ts. Participants identifi ed these rules regardless of gender or whether they had previous personal experience with any of these CSRs. The results suggest that each of these relationship types can be placed on a continuum of casual sex according to various dimensions, including frequency of contact, type of contact (sexual and/or social), personal disclosure, discussion of the relationship, and friendship. Participants' shared understanding of CSRs suggests that young adults may have common cultural knowledge of these relationships and a fl uid conceptualization of what constitutes a relationship.",

      "title": "8 Measurements of Animal Behavior and Welfare As Related to Animal Growth and Performance.",
      "abstract": "An individual animal‚Äôs well-being is influenced by and/or related to every event and aspect of the animal‚Äôs life from conception to death. Thus, every animal science sub-discipline (nutrition, genetics, etc.) contributes to understanding welfare. While an animal‚Äôs behavior is a major component of both optimal production performance and good welfare, behavior as an established discipline continues to have fits and starts; in part, because behavior includes subjective states such as feelings, consciousness, etc. But behavior can also be motility which can be readily measured and shown to be highly correlated to growth, fat deposition, etc. Behavior as a component of care and husbandry is often accounted for in management decisions without the science-based reason being overtly recognized. For example beef and dairy heifers are typically managed separately, and from the viewpoint of behavior, this is an acknowledgement of the importance of social behavior, i.e., when mixed the larger, older, and more socially dominant cows can control access of the heifers to feed thus lowering herd performance. In feedlot cattle, the correlation between rate of gain and social rank is generally low as a consequence of proper pen design, bunk space, etc. being sufficient to overcome the potentially negative influence of social dominance. Relative to welfare, quantitative measures of individual animal growth and performance should be included when evaluating animal care programs. A sudden decrease in growth rate, milk yield, calving rate, etc. can be indicative of health or nutritional factors that have a concomitant state of poor well-being. However, very high levels of performance may not always be associated with positive well-being. For example, high levels of milk production can be associated with factors (mastitis, rebreeding, etc.) that arguably are related to negative well-being. Ultimately, at least from the public‚Äôs perspective, animal welfare has to do with how animals ought to be treated. Science traditionally has tended to avoid directly dictating answers to issues having to do with ought and should. Thus, addressing animal welfare presents certain challenges to animal scientists. A contention is presented that good welfare has to do with doing the right thing, and the right thing to do is that which has the best reasons for doing. Thus, welfare is a combination of ethics and science, and its assessment includes both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Specifically, if welfare is doing that which has the best reasons, appropriate welfare is ethically based and not in conflict with science.",

It includes the physical aspects of people's sexual lives (such as pregnancy, childbirth, and sexually transmitted diseases); the emotional relationships which allow us to develop as full human beings; and also reproductive health and all the decisions concerned with having or not having children and how this affects our lives and bodies. Like many other human rights, however, the right to sexual health is denied or abused, through social, political, economic, cultural, or psychological forces. Sexual health should be seen as an aspect of development, meeting the real needs of individuals, while facilitating community action for social change. Programs working on issues concerning sexual health and development must go beyond sexuality and self-awareness, and aim to facilitate a process of community action for social change. Many of the issues around sexual health are best dealt with through an integrated approach. Organization of community discussion groups on related topics such as self-awareness or other aspects of sexual health is a small, but significant, way to start the process.",

Gender and civil status differences were also explored. Results show that the most regret of the senior citizens is in the intrapersonal and interpersonal areas and the least regret are in the areas of family and relationship (partnership/spousal). Senior citizens have higher well-being in the emotional and psychological areas as compared to the social area. Regrets in career have a significant negative correlation with social well-being (r = -.255, p < .05) and psychological well-being (r = ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†-.258, p < .05) and regrets in the family have a significant negative correlation with psychological well-being (r = -.263, p < .05). Single individuals experience greater regret in specific areas as compared to the other statuses. Those married, experienced the least regret in certain areas as compared to the other civil statuses.¬† Those annulled/separated experience greater regret on the family area. Gender differences were all insignificant. This study aims to provide valuable information to the younger generation where an understanding about the regrets and well-being of senior citizens will give them greater insight about their own current life-styles and decisions that might affect their future.

La informacion recolecto a traves de una serie de entrevistas gravadas a los sujetos en estudio (hombres entre 50 y 60 anos). Las categorias que surgieron de las primeras entrevistas, generaron nuevos interrogantes y nuevas aproximaciones que permitieron esclarecer dudas, determinar otras categorias, refinar las existentes o establecer otras para luego tomar las relevantes. Los entrevistados manifestaron conocer genesis de los cambios que producen durante andropausia y asi lo expresan: de ciertas hormonas, declinacion biologica. El conocer los cambios les permite percibirlos cuando presentan; se pierde urgencia para eyacular, demora en ereccion, el rendimiento sexual y potencialidad son menores, sentimos o queremos sentir menos que mujer en menopausia, pero hay una disminucion en interes Se conserva la capacidad el entusiasmo. Se gana mesura, espiritualidad, conocimiento mutuo, afectividad, tranquilidad. Por todo lo anterior puede afirmar que los cambios surgidos contraindican las expectativas del papel sexual asignado culturalmente al hombre y en oportunidades no esta preparado para afrontar situacion que generan los cambios biologicos. Este proceso permitio replantear a los hombres lo que hasta momento era su vida sexual, llevandolos a una plenitud sexual. Se establece ayer (la juventud) y hoy (la senectud). El ayer en donde solo pensaban en su disfrute, en poder tener mayor numero de eyaculaciones, en donde presentaba ansiedad por quedarle bien a pareja, urgencia por eyacular y hoy cuando hombre siente en declinar biologico y sexual, busca sacarle partido a otros aspectos de sexualidad, a los que durante juventud les resto importancia, como ternura, comunicacion, preocuparse ahora por disfrute y satisfaccion sexual de pareja.",

      "abstract": "We wanted to describe the playful behavior of young children of both sexes from two and a half to six years of age who have been given a set of toys evoking motherhood. A girl doll or a boy doll was among the toys. Analysis points up two factors that allow us to explain the relative differences in behavior as noted in girls and boys while playing: The first factor is what we'll call the positive experience of mothering (girls play more than boys, older children are more involved than younger ones); a second factor, called a distant, defensive attitude, probably more closely characterizes boys with a girl doll (distance, aggressivity). The most positive \"mothering\" (various activities and outward tenderness) in a sub-group of older girls playing with a boy-doll. The doll's sex appears to be a determining element in child behavior. More general remarks are brought up regarding the theoretical questions of how the child perceives the beginning of the parents' role and how a sexual identity in the largest sense of the word are inter-related. The problem of a child's wants are also considered, inasmuch as they might come up in the cultural, social and psychological dimensions of childhood.",

      "title": "Pregnancy as a Reaction to Early Childhood Sibling Loss",
      "abstract": "Surrogate mothers, illegitimately pregnant teenagers, married women seeking abortions, women convicted of manslaughter, and sister survivors of early childhood sibling loss may share a common conflict. These women may be in a state of incomplete mourning, unconsciously wishing to master a trauma by turning a passive experience into a life event they can control. Pregnancy can function as that life event. Replacement daughters and/or sister survivors can present as our patients with a search for or an avoidance of pregnancy as a crucial though unconscious issue. Literature written about this sequelae of early sibling death is reviewed according to psychosexual and object relationship stages. Common and uncommon consequences are discussed. Vignettes from the course of psychoanalytic therapy with women whose brothers had been accidently killed; whose sibling had died of metabolic disease; and those whose siblings had been relinquished to foster care are used to illustrate the immediate and long-term reactions. The range of these include varieties of separation anxiety as well as learning inhibitions in latency; exaggerated pseudo heterosexuality and other risk taking at puberty; problems in self-esteem regulation relative to either the idealized memory of the missing sibling or the omnipotence connected with survivor guilt. This paper focuses on the choice of a sexual partner and pregnancy issues as symptoms of reworking established conflicts around self-valuation and abandonment by sibling and grieving parents. As the family relationships around the lost sibling become less distorted in her analysis via transference resolution, so do the feelings about contemporary relationships. Becoming pregnant is then not an event burdened by die past.",

      "abstract": "Most of the investigations on unemployment and mental disorder tend to indicate that these two issues have a clear, but not very strong, association. The data from these studies seem further to indicate that this association is not a linear cause-effect relationship in either direction, but a circular or interactional relationship. Unemployment may affect mental health by acting as a precipitating factor. But, on the other hand, it is evident that the risk for the mentally disturbed to become unemployed is clearly greater than for other people. Many other factors besides unemployment and mental disorder act in this complex interaction network too. All unemployed are not similar, but such factors as age, education, domicile, family, other social ties, and personality have a great effect on the whole. Work is an important resource for mental health. Unemployment can be regarded as a risk factor because it means that the individual loses the positive and supporting elements which work has. The negative factors are (i) the lack of emotional and economic security, (ii) the perplexity of the time perspective, (iii) isolation, (iv) identity diffusion, and (v) a general sense of frustration.",

      "title": "Sexual Assault and Birth Trauma: Interrelated Issues",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: A host of corresponding sensations and dynamics may be present during birth and during sexual abuse. Physical, emotional and environmental similarities between the original experience of birth and sexual abuse imbue these traumas with common symptomology, feelings and life patterns. The terrain of both traumas is the body which often stores both memories and affect. Later sexual abuse traumas often become merged with earlier birth and prenatal traumas. In the therapeutic setting the symptomology, abreaction and artistic expression of these two issues can be highly similar. These issues and concerns have only been briefly dealt with in the literature. Only a handful of clinicians, consulted during the preparation of this paper, were familiar with or knowledgeable about significant psychological relationships between sexual abuse and the trauma of birth. PRIMARY THEMES OF THIS ARTICLE Childhood sexual assault is one of the later life experiences which: 1) has a particular propensity to reform a latent birth stress into full blown trauma; or 2) can further activate reverberating elements of a painfully traumatic birth creating a compounding of the birth trauma (Grof, 1985; Roth, 1987). In compounded birth trauma an incidence of sexual assault, and what has been designated as rape trauma syndrome by Burgess and Holmstrom (1974), are experienced through and layered upon earlier interpretations of the traumas of birth (Grof, 1975). 3) Similarities between sexual abuse (SA) and birth traumas (BT) predispose their issues and symptomology to interconnection in the psyche (Irving in Carter, 1991). The experience of birth and sexual abuse, and the nature of how the psyche copes with these traumas means that as separate experiences they can have a legacy of similar feelings, life patterns and symptomology. 4) Sexual assault and traumatic birth can therapeutically present in manners which for all intents and purposes appear similar. While working psychotherapeutically with either sexual abuse or birth trauma the symptomology and issues of the other trauma may simultaneously and spontaneously appear (Bernhardt et al., 1993). COMPOSITE EXPERIENCES OF A TYPICAL CLIENT The client in regression is gagging, has feelings of a weight pressing down. There is the sense of being hot, sticky and maybe even being naked. In amidst the feelings of chaos and confusion, the body feels drugged and nauseated. There are few spoken words coming forward in expression which is largely body memory retrieved from what feels like a place of darkness and betrayal. The terrified person is overwhelmed with helplessness and despair, it feels like there is no way out of an imprisonment. In the sensation of suffocation and physical torment there is fear of impending death. Indeed the original primary recourse to survival of this long ago trauma was psychic death or some form of dissociative splitting. Seeking reprieve and understanding of the rising quagmire the client struggles with the few words of, I do not know where this is coming from. Watching this scene it is clear the client is experiencing great suffering and that a request is being made to be helped through terribly painful memories. The scene just described could be a client in regression to birth or regression to sexual abuse traumas. ENVIRONMENTAL SIMILARITIES The shared metaphors, feelings and somatic expression of birth trauma and sexual abuse which can be observed in various stages of the therapeutic process are in part a result of their similar original environmental conditions. Bass and Davis (1994) in Courage to Heal: A Guide for Women Survivors of Sexual Abuse, reassures survivors that as sexual abuse memories surface, You may physically reexperience the terror, your body may clutch tight, or you may feel that you are suffocating and cannot breathe (p. 83). This sounds quite similar to Khamsi (1987) in Birth Feelings: A Phenomenological Investigation reporting that when birth memories surfaced, Subjects reported having felt crunched, crushed or squished . ‚Ä¶",

      "abstract": "Liking and craving for chocolate and related substances were surveyed in a sample of University of Pennsylvania undergraduates (n = 249) and their parents (n = 319). Chocolate was highly liked in all groups, with a stronger liking by females. Chocolate is the most craved food among females, and is craved by almost half of the female sample (in both age groups). Although this craving is related to a sweet craving, it cannot be accounted for as a craving for sweets. About half of the female cravers show a very well defined craving peak for chocolate in the perimenstrual period, beginning from a few days before the onset of menses and extending into the first few days of menses. There is not a significant relation in chocolate craving or liking between parents and their children. The current motivation for chocolate preference seems to be primarily, if not entirely, sensory. Liking for chocolate correlates significantly with liking for sweets and white chocolate. The liking for the sensory properties could originate in innate or acquired liking based on the sweetness, texture and aroma of chocolate, or it could be based in part on interactions between the postingestional effects of chocolate and a person's state (e.g., mood, hormone levels). Based on correlational data, we find little evidence for a relation between addiction to chocolate or the pharmacological (e.g., xanthine-based) effects of chocolate and the liking for chocolate.",

      "abstract": "Research on self-perceived sexual attractiveness has predominantly focused on the importance of physical appearance, overlooking nonphysical traits that may contribute to these self-perceptions. The present study examined and compared the importance of a variety of traits for self-perceived sexual attractiveness. Self-identified heterosexual, gay, and bisexual men (N = 1,801) and heterosexual, lesbian, and bisexual women (N = 1,092) completed an online questionnaire examining self-perceived sexual attractiveness, body esteem, sexual esteem, adherence to gender norms, and sexual experience. Body esteem and sexual esteem were significant predictors of self-perceived sexual attractiveness, regardless of gender and sexual orientation. Adhering to a masculine gender norm was a significant predictor among all groups (to varying extents) but heterosexual women. Adhering to a feminine gender norm was a significant predictor among heterosexual men and bisexual women. Finally, sexual experience was a significant predictor for all men and bisexual women. Furthermore, while body esteem was a predictor across all groups, for most individuals it did not appear to be of primary importance, with either sexual esteem or masculinity proving to be of greater importance. These findings suggest the need to consider traits related to both physical and nonphysical factors for improving an individual's self-perceived sexual attractiveness.",

      "title": "The impact of ejaculatory dysfunction upon the sufferer and his partner",
      "abstract": "Ejaculatory function cannot be evaluated outside the dyadic process and without taking into account the men's and women's cognition of the condition and how their subjective perception impacts on the evaluation of the relationship and sexual quality. Although the distress of the sufferer and his partner has been a motivating factor in leading men with ejaculatory dysfunction to seek medical help, few objective or prospective evaluations of the effects on the couple have been reported. Specialized literature has been dealing with ejaculatory disorders in a heterogeneous manner. Comparatively, there are far more studies on premature ejaculation (PE) than on delayed ejaculation (DE) and even fewer studies on other male orgasm disorders. Therefore, the review focuses on the literature of the two most studied ejaculatory disorders. The matter presented in this article can also be considered for other ejaculatory disorders, since all of them relate to a failure of control, changing the intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), with consequences for men and their partners. There are multiple psychological explanations as to why a man develops PE or DE. Unfortunately, none of the theories evolve from evidence-based studies. The common final pathway of these factors is the irrational fear of ejaculating intravaginally. These sexual disorders may also cause personal distress for the sexual partner and decreased sexual satisfaction for the couple. An association between pre-existing anxiety disorders and sexual performance anxiety has been found in men and couples with ejaculatory dysfunction. This could reflect a process in which pre-existing anxiety triggers sexual dysfunction, causing performance anxiety and leading to a vicious cycle: anxiety, sexual dysfunction, more anxiety. Men with DE are similar to men with other sexual dysfunctions. They show the same elevated level of sexual dissatisfaction and they also show lower levels of coital frequency. To a lower extent, they use more masturbatory activity relative to controls. The burden of PE for the patient is revealed in three different levels: the emotional burden, the health burden, and the burden on the relationship. In terms of the emotional burden, there is often a sense of embarrassment and shame at not being able to satisfy their partner, and patients often have low self-esteem, feelings of inferiority, anxiety, anger, and disappointment. Men feel frustrated about their PE and how it affects their intimacy with their partners and the sexual relationship. In conclusion, ejaculatory dysfunction has a negative impact on both the man and his female partner and, consequently, it has implications for the couple as a whole. Additionally, ejaculatory dysfunction extending beyond a year elevates the risk of depression in these patients. Although partner perceptions of PE generally indicated less dysfunction than those of subjects, partner outcomes measures play a part in the assessment of PE. Ejaculatory dysfunction involves the integration of physiological, psychobehavioral, cultural, and relationship dimensions. All these elements need to be considered in the treatment.",

      "title": "Role of Sexuality in Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Summary Further evidence has been presented for the hypothesis that sexuality in the broadest sense (eroticism, menstruation, pregnancy, and motherhood) plays an important role in the occurrence of seizures in epileptic women between the menarche and the menopause. Most epileptologists have explained the seizures of epileptics by a seizure-threshold theory, which is both quantitative and nonspecific. The search for more specific factors has led some to stress the physiological aspects and others the psychological. Among the latter is the concept of the psychological conflict as cause of seizures, but often this is nonspecific with respect to the nature of the conflict and the psychological forces involved. Specific psychological theories which define the precise area of conflict have usually stressed the role of the aggressive instincts and their derivatives. Only a few epileptologists have referred to sexual conflicts, without, however, advancing any general hypothesis. The authors' experience in a three-year combined psychiatric and physiological study of more than 30 epileptic women leads to the conclusion that the nuclear conflict, the dynamic activity of which leads to seizures, is sexual. This hypothesis does not ignore the possible effects of other conflicts nor impugn the importance of aggression. Case material has been presented showing (1) that seizures occur in relationship to current sexual conflicts and to the sexual transference and (2) that past seizures occurred in relationship to past sexual conflicts, which were similar to the current ones. The material shows the concurrence of other conflicts and the importance of aggression. It shows, however, the subsidiary role these play, and the fact that aggression is mainly intelligible as either a response to the nuclear sexual conflicts or as an attempted solution of them.",

Many negative attitudes have been held traditionally relating to the sexual behaviour of older people, and this may account for the reluctance of many elderly clients to seek help, and for the lack of attention paid by helping professionals. The number of referrals for sex therapy from older persons is now beginning to increase, and evidence confirms that the majority of healthy older persons remain sexually active and sexually capable throughout their later years. Although there is a marked lack of empirical research, case studies suggest that cognitive-behavioural approaches offer promise in the treatment of psychosexual dysfunction in the elderly. Factors are discussed that relate specifically to older clients in the application of a cognitive-behavioural approach to assessment and therapy.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is most natural and healthy when it is part of an emotionally genuine relationship, not even as its central part but rather as an upgrade of the intimacy of two people who are mutually loyal, committed, loving and respectful. However, if an individual was sexually abused in childhood, they may have suffered the severest consequences of sexual abuse trauma in the area of sexuality, and their experience of sexuality will be completely different from those who were not sexually abused. The article first describes what children learn about sex if they have been sexually abused, as this experience is very much related to the most common behaviours and experiences in adult sexuality. Then we present a theoretical overview of research on sexuality in adults who suffered childhood sexual abuse. The theory will be supplemented and supported by the statements of individuals who have been attending a therapeutic group for the sexually abused in childhood for two years. The statements quoted in the article refer to the period prior to the therapeutic process. Clinical experience shows that, until the victim has resolved the trauma of sexual abuse, the dynamics between the offender and the victim during childhood abuse is most often very similar to the dynamics of the abused with their partner, even in their sexual life.",

For instance, it is estimated that 50‚Äì60% of the variation in risk for alcoholism is accounted for by genetic factors. Genetic influences are implicated in multiple aspects of substance involvement, including predispositions to drug‚Äêseeking behaviour and development of physiological dependence. These influences likely occur through multiple mechanisms, ranging from cellular processes (e.g. metabolic, pharmacologic) to psychological (e.g. personality traits). Environmental factors are also key ‚Äì individuals' psychosocial histories may outweigh their genetic predispositions or can combine with genetic factors to magnify or decrease risk for developing addictions. Key Concepts Substance abuse and addiction run in families. Genetic epidemiology uses family, adoption and twin studies to address whether the familiality of addiction is due to environmental factors, genetic transmission or a combination of both. For both men and women, 50‚Äì60% of the risk for developing alcoholism is familial and virtually all of this is due to genetic factors. Experimenting with tobacco is primarily environmentally influenced, but genetic factors influence who develops addiction. Addiction to illicit substances also appears to have a genetic component for males; fewer studies have been conducted in females. The available research is based on samples of European ancestry; genetic and environmental estimates could differ for other populations.",

      "title": "Half Sibling Relationships and Family Communication",
      "abstract": "Half siblings are brothers and sisters who share only one biological parent and are thus, half biologically related. Although half siblings may be the result of extramarital/partnership affairs or post-bereavement, most are the result of a divorce and remarriage. Half sibling research is rare, and existing research and even national and international statistical reporting agencies often incorrectly conflate half siblings with stepsiblings. Research that can be found on half siblings often illustrates a ‚Äúdeficit-comparison‚Äù approach where half and stepsiblings are compared to full biological siblings and studied for how they fall short of biological sibling outcomes. Early research speculates that children who reside with half siblings experience poorer educational outcomes, report significantly more depressive symptoms, exhibit poorer coping skills, are more likely to engage in risky behavior such as early sexual activity and drug and alcohol use, and have more strained sibling and parental relationships compared to those with no half siblings or those with only full biological siblings. The challenges that exist for half sibling relationships are often hypothesized as associated with either family structure (half siblings located within a complex stepfamily) or explained through evolutionary perspectives of Darwinian fitness. However, research on half siblings overall is mixed, with studies also positing these outcomes are not due to the presence of half siblings and that there are instead positive implications from having a half sibling on individual outcomes, sibling relationship quality, and overall family functioning. Overall, half siblings can form quality relationships and half brothers and sisters who share a residence, are closer in age, of the same gender, spend more quality time with one another, have parents who prosaically intervene on their behalf, and who emphasize their positive relationship and connection through addressing terms and sharing backstories of their family‚Äôs origins are more likely to report a positive relationship.",

Although it does not involve direct violent behavior, behaviors such as disturbing frequent phone calls, text messages, waiting and keeping watch around the workplace, university or home are among the persistent stalking behaviors. Persistent stalking can lead to an increase in the victim's feelings of fear and anxiety. Individuals exposed to this situation may experience psychological and/or physical health problems. According to researches, persistent stalking is a sexist act. The victims are mostly women. Stalking actions are generally carried out by men whom women know and have emotional relationships with. The difference between being a perpetrator or a victim in stalking actions depending on gender change also causes the formation of stalking myths in countries. In this study, stalking, which is a very current concept in the field of forensic sciences, was examined in terms of some sociological variables. Stalking and gender, the effects of honor culture and the meaning attributed to stalking in terms of gender were examined.",

Some sexual fantasies would pose harm if enacted in the real world but remain in fantasy only. These overlapping contexts pose unique challenges to researchers, as findings become discussed with regard to their potential impact on, for example, insurance payments for treatments, justification for medical sex reassignment of minors, parole and probation terms following sex-related crimes, and so on.

      "abstract": "Throughout history, societies have circumscribed certain forms of intimacy in the family setting. Transgression has been punished by force of ecclesiastical rules and government statutes. However, no single definition of incest is widely accepted, as the degree of kinship in which marriage is allowed and the age of consent vary. Fueled in part by the current emphasis on child abuse prevention, the reporting of incest is increasing. The perpetrator in the majority of reported cases is a male adult, and most often the victim is a young girl. Other dyads do occur and are probably under-estimated in frequency. Disturbed family relationships generate a shift in individual responsibilities and expectations that can lead to incest. A lack of spousal sexual activity is a common preceding factor. The sequelae of this breach of family integrity are significant. Frequently, the family itself is destroyed; the destruction often begins before incest occurs. The victim faces a future characterized by emotional turmoil, diminished self-esteem, impaired interpersonal relationships, and impulsive acting-out behavior.

      "abstract": "Animal models serve to imitate (patho)physiological states known to occur in target species (usually man but sometimes other species as well). The use of animal models has had and may continue to have a tremendous impact on medical progress. Laboratory animals are now used in the study of basic (patho)physiological mechanisms, in the development, production and evaluation of therapeutic and diagnostic agents, in safety studies to assess carcenogenic, teratogenic or reproductive toxicity of investigational agents, and in education and training. The quality or utility of a model often depends upon its validity, which is highest in so-called homologous models where the symptoms displayed as well as the cause of the condition in the animal are identical to those of the human condition. Isomorphic models display similar symptoms, but the condition is not provoked by the same events as the human condition. Partial models do not attempt to model the entire condition, but focus only on limited aspects. Models can be further classified into spontaneous, induced, negative and \"orphan\" models. Uncritical extrapolation of animal findings to the human condition may lead to unreliable or even dangerous conclusions. Extrapolation tends to be most reliable when a plurispecies approach is taken, and when differences in metabolic patterns and speed as well as several other confounding variables are taken into account. Animal models have been crucial to neurological and psychiatric research, even though the search for valid models has been difficult in these fields because of the differences in brain structure and function between humans and other species.",

For example, men show a more stationary, linear sexual desire, more often separate sex-life from love-life, engage in heterosexual or homosexual one-night-stands and more often buy sex from a prostitute. Some sexual deviations manifest themselves only in males. Most sexual offences are committed by mean. Sexual assaults are, of course, unacceptable. But sexual offences are often a token of powerlessness when failing in relation to oneself and/or other people. Thus not only victims of sexual assaults, but also the perpetrators need help in order to prevent further sexual assaults.

      "abstract": "Permasalahan agresivitas pada remaja semakin beragam dan kompleks bentuknya. Bahkan agresivitas pada zaman sekarang sudah menjalar ke media sosial, yang mana hampir setiap remaja mengenal dan menggunakan media sosial dalam kehidupan sehari-hari mereka. Permasalahan perilaku agresi di media sosial menjadi menonjol akhir-akhir ini karena tidak ada kekhawatiran pelaku akan dibalas secara langsung oleh korban ketika agresivitas remaja itu diluapkan di media sosial. Sehingga, keberanian mereka untuk menyakiti orang lain melalui media sosial lebih tinggi daripada dilakukan secara tatap muka langsung.\r\nPada zaman sekarang, agresivitas remaja perempuan juga cenderung meningkat. Bahkan, hasil terdapat hasil penelitian yang menyebutkan bahwa agresivitas perempuan tidak jauh berbeda tingkatnya dengan laki-laki. Remaja laki-laki lebih cenderung untuk meluapkan agresivitasnya baik proaktif maupun reaktif dengan teman sebayanya, lebih menekankan pada agresi fisik maupun verbal. Berbeda dengan perempuan, agresivitas mereka diluapkan dalam bentuk kebencian dan kemarahan, yang mana kebencian dan kemarahan mereka akan cenderung menetap lebih lama jika dibandingkan dengan remaja laki-laki. Bahkan tidak jarang pula ditemukan agresivitas remaja perempuan diluapkan dalam bentuk fisik dan verbal. \r\nPermasalahan agresivitas remaja usia sekolah ini perlu ada upaya penanganan agar kecenderungan mereka untuk meluapkan agresivitas mereka bisa di tekan dan dapat meminimalisir perilaku agresinya. Pada buku ini dikembangkan sebuah model bimbingan yang menggunakan ide-ide pokok dari pendidikan kedamaian, yang dalam buku ini disebut dengan bimbingan kedamaian. Model bimbingan kedamaian ini dirancang untuk mereduksi agresivitas remaja. Akan tetapi, tidak menutup kemungkinan bimbingan kedamaian ini dapat digunakan untuk membantu remaja keluar dari tekanan hidupnya seperti menekan perilaku bullying, cyberbullying, kekerasan fisik maupun non fisik, bahkan percobaan bunuh diri, dan lain sebagainya.\r\nBimbingan kedamaian yang dikembangkan dan termuat dalam buku ini terdiri dari tujuh komponen utama, yang digunakan untuk mengintervensi aspek-aspek dari agresivitas, baik fisik, verbal, kemarahan, dan kebencian. Ketujuh komponen dari bimbingan kedamaian tersebut adalah (1) rendah hati terhadap idealisme; (2) kontrol diri terhadap persamaan; (3) toleransi terhadap perbedaan; (4) memaafkan kesalahan orang lain; (5) memilih kekuatan daripada kelemahan; (6) mengatur emosi saya; dan (7) mengatur perilaku saya. \r\nBimbingan kedamaian ini dapat diimplementasikan dalam dua jenis layanan bimbingan dan konseling. Pertama, bimbingan kedamaian diimplementasikan dalam layanan bimbingan klasikal. Kedua, bimbingan kedamaian diimplementasikan dalam layanan bimbingan kelompok. Implementasi dari bimbingan kedamaian ini diharapkan dapat menekan agresivitas remaja yang mana agresivitas remaja ini dapat berdampak buruk bagi dirinya sendiri maupun orang lain. \r\nKonselor perlu menumbuhkan kreatifitasnya agar bimbingan kedamaian yang diimplementasikan tidak membosankan dan menarik bagi siswa. Terlebih remaja pada zaman sekarang, akan mudah bosan apabila mereka diberikan layanan bimbingan dan konseling yang tidak kreatif dan inovatif. Oleh sebab itu, penggunaan kearifan lokal sangat penting untuk menambah nilai lebih dan keefektifan dari bimbingan kedamaian itu sendiri. Kearifan lokal yang digunakan oleh konselor bisa merujuk dan memodifikasi kearifan lokal di daerahnya masing-masing.",

      "abstract": "Reporting of sexual behaviour is subject to bias, perhaps most importantly social desirability bias. This is a particular problem in communities where discussion of sex is considered taboo and when disclosure of sexual activity can have serious consequences for the individuals concerned (eg, for young people or those in same-sex relationships). Mis/under-reporting of sexual behaviours can result in the design of interventions being poorly informed as well as in intervention effectiveness being unreliably measured. There is increasing evidence to suggest that questionnaire delivery method (in addition to a host of other factors) can impact the validity of reported data and that validity can be improved by careful consideration of questionnaire delivery mode. Computer-assisted questionnaire delivery has been shown to increase reporting of socially sanctioned behaviours in many settings and even in rural, resource poor settings, where people traditionally have limited experience of using computers, have been shown to be highly acceptable and feasible to research participants.",

      "abstract": "Accepted at the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships Abstract: Support for a spouse with psychological distress can be expressed in many different ways. Previous research indicates that support expression is shaped by gender, but we do not know much about how support within marriage is provided in response to a spouse‚Äôs distress outside of a different-sex couple context. In this study, we analyze dyadic data from 378 midlife married couples (35-65 years; N = 756 individuals) within the U.S. to examine how men and women in same- and different-sex relationships provide support when they perceive that their spouse is experiencing distress. We find women in different-sex couples are less likely to report taking care of their distressed spouse‚Äôs tasks or giving their distressed spouse more personal time and space compared to women in same-sex couples and men. We also find that men in different-sex couples are less likely to report encouraging their spouse to talk compared to men in same-sex couples and women. Being personally stressed by a spouse‚Äôs distress is positively associated with providing support to that spouse, whereas feeling that a spouse‚Äôs distress is stressful for the marriage is negatively associated with providing support. This study advances understanding of gendered provisions of support in response to psychological distress in marriage, moving beyond a framing of women as fundamentally more supportive than men to a consideration of how these dynamics may be different or similar in same- and different-sex marital contexts.",

This article identifies five meanings for which social scientists often use the terms sex or gender and proposes a distinct term for each of those five meanings. The terms proposed are (1) sex: to refer to the biological function; (2) biologically sex-linked: to refer to traits or conditions that are causally biologically related to being male or female; (3) gender-linked: to refer to traits or conditions that are causally linked with maleness or femaleness but are culturally based as opposed to biologically based; (4) sex- and gender-linked: to refer to traits or conditions that are causally related to both a biological component and a cultural component; and (5) sex-correlated: to refer to traits or conditions that are related to being male or female without asserting a causal relation to either biology or culture (because we do not wish to make such an assertion or cannot do so confidently). It is hoped that adopting a terminological standard will reduce the confusion resulting from nonspecific language use.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In the domesticated Zebra Finch, unpaired males behaved sociably towards one another, but could be provoked to fight by the sight of a female nearby; the amount of fighting shown depended on the distance to the female. Qualitatively similar aggressive behaviour was provoked between males by the sight of a male, and between a male and female by the sight of another female. However, males were less effective than females in provoking fighting between females, and pair-bonded females were more effective than non-bonded females in provoking fighting in mixed or male dyads. Homosexual pair bonds had a similar effect to heterosexual ones in stimulating attacks on a male, but had not effect on aggressive behaviour towards a female. The aggressive behaviour seen could not be due to redirection of aggression, since the stimulus properties which were necessary to provoke attack on another individual were those relevant to sexual behaviour, and were different from those necessary to elicit attack on the individual itself. It is shown that in other cases of apparent redirection of aggression in sexual contexts, a similar conclusion can be drawn, indicating a link between the motivational systems controlling sexual and aggressive behaviour. Since stimuli from an individual may both sensitize a bird to respond aggressively to stimuli from other individuals, and elicit attack by the bird on the individual itself, a distinction between these modes of action (similar to TINBERGEN'S distinction between releasing and motivational effects) is necessary.",

Kegiatan seks bebas yang terjadi dalam beberapa waktu ini menjadi salah satu permasalahan yang dilakukan oleh remaja Indonesia. Remaja dalam pergaulanya sangat mudah terpengaruh oleh ajakan lawan jenis dalam melakukan kegiatan penyimpangan seksual yang didasarkan atas dasar saling menyukai dan rasa ingin tahu yang tinggi. Remaja tidak pernah memikirkan akan dampak dari kegiatan hubungan seksual yang mereka lakukan mulai dari dampak negative pandangan masyarakat yang akan diterima remaja maupun dampak kesehatan yang akan terjadi dengan hubunangan seksual diluar pernikahan. Remaja tersebut biasanya masih menyandang status sebagai siswa atau siswi sehingga perlu mendapatkan perhatian khusus dalam hal peningkatan kemampuan kognitif atau pengetahuan tentang dampak-dampak dari kegiatan seks bebas yang kerap kali terjadi dilingkungan siswa ataupun siswi. Pemberian informasi yang kurang tepat akan menyebabkan persepsi atau prilaku dari siswa tersebut dapat mengalami penyimpangan salah satunya kegiatan seks bebas. Kondisi ini jika dibiarkan berlanjut akan meningkatkan prilaku seks bebas dilingkungan remaja dalam hal ini siswa. Adapaun beberapa dampak dari prilaku penyimangan seperti seks bebas akan berdampak pada terjadinya kehamilan yang tidak diinginkan, melakukan aborsi sebagai akibat dari seks bebas, mengalami masalah kesehatan seperti berisiko terinfeksi HIV AIDS. Bentuk pencegahan yang dapat dilakukan untuk meminimalisir berbagai dampak tersebut maka perlu diberikan edukasi kesehatan sehingga siswa, siswi dapat memahami akibat dan dampak dari kegiatan pergaulan bebas terutama seks bebas sehingga diharapkan prilaku seks bebas dapat dihindari, diminimalisir oleh siswa, siswi sebagai penerus kehidupan Berbangsa dan Bernegara.

      "abstract": "Parents of undergraduates were asked whether they would be more distressed by the sexual or the emotional infidelity of their child‚Äôs partner. Comparing the responses of mothers and fathers may offer a rare, ‚Äúcrucial‚Äù instance in which evolutionary and socialization perspectives offer different predictions. Socialization theory, broadly conceived, predicts an effect for the gender of the parent: Consistent with their differing gender socialization histories, mothers should be more distressed by the emotional infidelity of their child‚Äôs partner, and fathers by the sexual infidelity of their child‚Äôs partner. In contrast, an evolutionary psychology approach predicts little or no effect for the sex of the parents: Both mothers and fathers should be more distressed by infidelities that pose a greater threat to their genetic interests. Results were largely consistent with the predictions derived from evolutionary psychology: Both mothers and fathers regarded sexual infidelity as more distressing when committed by a daughter‚Äìin‚Äìlaw than by a son‚Äìin‚Äìlaw, and emotional infidelity as more distressing when it involved a son‚Äìin‚Äìlaw rather than a daughter‚Äìin‚Äìlaw. Discussion centered on the theoretical implications of research that examines the behavior of those who are, genetically, one step removed from the sexual behavior of others, but still affected by the reproductive consequences of that behavior.",

      "title": "Predictors of depression for the male partner following miscarriage",
      "abstract": "Masters Research - Master of Clinical Psychology (MCIPsych)%%%%An abundance of research indicates that following miscarriage, both male and female partners can experience a grief reaction, similar in intensity to that which is felt following the loss of a loved one. There is less consideration of the possibility that miscarriage is a form of bereavement, with the potential to elicit complicated, long term grief that is associated with depression in both partners. This review evaluates the literature which indicates that expectant mothers and fathers become attached to the unborn foetus and argues that the strength of this emotional attachment may help explain why the loss of an unborn foetus can be so significant for the potential parents and can be included as an example of bereavement. Nevertheless, the literature on bereavement appears to have largely ignored miscarriage. Yet it is an experience of loss that shares risk factors, consistently associated with complicated grief reactions to bereavement including; being sudden and unexpected, involving the loss of a child (even if imagined) and a lack of social support. Despite this, the incidence of longer term psychological morbidity following miscarriage in either partner but particularly for males, has received scant attention. There is some evidence to suggest that a small group of males do experience depression and associated physical health problems. If this group of at risk males could be identified at an early stage, they may benefit from intervention and support. To that end, theories will be evaluated which suggest that moderating factors of this more complicated reaction in males may include; less active grief following miscarriage, higher levels of despair following miscarriage and a grief reaction that is incongruent with that of the female partner.",

Lu Xun once sagaciously pointed out that \"sexual desire is a matter of maintaining prosperity and perpetuating life.\" Once young people enter puberty, they have natural sexual desires and impulses. Often they try to relieve their sexual tensions and satisfy their sexual desires by masturbation or other self-comforting means. If young people do not control themselves, masturbation will become a bad habit that damages their physical and mental well-being. Some young people who cannot control their sexual impulses engage in premarital sex and even commit sexual crimes. Sexual debauchery after marriage may even lead to extramarital affairs and result in marital tragedy. Whether one is married or not, every person should keep a tight reign on his or her sexual desires and avoid licentiousness through self-control.",

Here, we tested whether sex differences in social motivation emerge in infant monkeys ( n = 48) reared in a controlled postnatal environment. Compared to males, females at 2‚Äì3 weeks looked more at conspecifics‚Äô faces ( d = 0.65), especially the eyes ( d = 1.09) and at 4‚Äì5 weeks exhibited more affiliative behaviors ( d = 0.64), including gesturing, looking and proximity to familiar and unfamiliar human caretakers. In sum, converging evidence from humans and monkeys suggests that female infants are more social than males in the first weeks of life and that such differences may arise independent of postnatal experience. Individual differences in social interest have wide-ranging developmental consequences, impacting infants‚Äô social interaction quality and opportunities for learning. Understanding the evolution of sex differences and their developmental emergence is necessary to best support infants with varying levels of sociality.",

      "title": "Sexual inadequacy in the male",
      "abstract": "Summary The adequacy of sexual functioning in the male depends on a complex interaction between psychological, hormonal and neurophysiological factors. Disturbance of any one of these factors may lead to sexual inadequacy. In the majority of cases no gross abnormality is found but the absence of gross hormonal or neurophysiological abnormality does not necessarily imply a purely psychological cause. Individual variations in the pattern of response of the autonomic nervous system or in the ability to learn control of autonomic responses such as erection or ejaculation may be sufficient to account for some cases of inadequacy and in others may increase the susceptibility to psychological factors. Further research is required to clarify these undoubtedly important psychophysiological relationships. Treatment has been most successful when it has taken into account both psychological and physiological factors. The advances made by Masters &amp; Johnson (1970) in this area have partly depended on their earlier physiological and anatomical studies of sexual response (Masters &amp; Johnson, 1966). It may be that in some cases the use of anxiety-reducing drugs or androgens will be all that is required but further work is required to identify such cases. The placebo effects of such preparations should not be overlooked particularly as many cases of sexual inadequacy are based on lack of confidence or ignorance and require little more than good advice or reassurance. Considerable advances in our understanding of these problems have been made in the past 20 years and techniques of endocrine, physiological and behavioural assessment are now available which should enable further progress to be made in the near future.",

      "abstract": "Research comparing the quality of monogamous and non-monogamous (\"open\") relationships among gay men has produced mixed findings. In addition, little is known about the consequences of breaking the rules of relationship agreements about extra-dyadic sex. Results from a survey of 229 gay men in romantic relationships showed that open relationships were less passionate, but no less intimate or committed, than monogamous or \"threesome-only\" relationships. However, men who broke rules reported lower relationship quality overall, regardless of the relationship agreement. Thus, it is less the nature of the agreement itself than adhering to the conditions of it that influences relationship quality.",

      "abstract": "Bei der Untersuchung von Geschlechtsunterschieden und -gleichheiten konnen eine Reihe von methodischen Verzerrungen auftreten, die Unterschiede groser erscheinen lassen. Basierend auf der Erkenntnis, dass Frauen und Manner bei den meisten psychologischen und sozialen Merkmalen gleich oder sehr ahnlich sind, wird die Frage untersucht, ob der bekannte Geschlechtsunterschied bei Aggression ein methodisches Artefakt darstellt, also ganz oder teilweise verschwindet, wenn eine methodenkritische und sozialkonstruktivistische Perspektive gewahlt wird. Dabei wird die Geschlechtsvariable aus Sicht der Geschlechterforschung hinterfragt und eine feministisch-kritische Herangehensweise gewahlt. Anhand einer quantitativen Sekundardatenanalyse eines Paneldatensatzes von SchulerInnen (13 bis 16 Jahre) aus Duisburg (D) werden die Hypothesen uberpruft. Es zeigt sich, dass etliche methodenkritische Einwande bestatigt werden. Zwar ergibt sich der bekannte Geschlechtsunterschied, dass Jungen bei korperlich-aggressivem Verhalten gegenuber Madchen uberwiegen, allerdings fallt der Unterschied im Schnitt gering bis mittelmasig aus. Untersucht wurden vor allem Einstellungen zu Gewalt und aggressiven Delikten sowie die Jahrespravalenz und -inzidenz von aggressiven Delikten im Dunkelfeld. In 80% der Falle zeigten sich signifikante Geschlechtsunterschiede, wobei in jedem dieser Falle Jungen aggressiver waren. Dennoch gleichen sich die Geschlechter in allen Fallen mehr als sie sich unterscheiden und Geschlecht kann nur einen sehr geringen Anteil an Aggression statistisch erklaren. In der multivariaten Analyse zeigt sich, dass der direkte Effekt von Geschlecht auf Aggression bei Berucksichtigung von Drittvariablen abgeschwacht wird, aber nicht verschwindet. Im Langsschnitt ist Aggression stabil und die Geschlechtsunterschiede vergrosern sich mit zunehmendem Alter. In Summe wird die Relevanz von methodenkritischen Einwanden bestatigt und die Risiken eines uberzogenen Differenzansatzes werden dargestellt.",

Bi+ individuals may have difficulty accessing social supports for mitigating minority stress. A religious upbringing may complicate this process. This study sought to compare a survey sample of bi+ individuals (n = 153) and their gay/lesbian (n = 231) peers from religious families on minority stress factors, depression, and partnering. Results highlighted differences between gay/lesbian and bi+ individuals in partnering and LGB community connection with bi+ group reporting more minority stressors. Bi+ individuals in same-gender partnerships reported lower parent rejection and being more out than those who were single or in different-gender partnerships. Family religiosity was associated with family rejection; however, it did not directly predict minority stress factors or depression for bi+ individuals.

      "abstract": "The purpose of the article is to analyse the reasons for cohabiting. Or, in other words, the reasons for which marriage is postponed and not flatly excluded. In fact, from the data (interviews with 50 cohabitating couples) it appears that cohabitation is a fortuitous and occasional event rather than a conscious and reflective choice made by the couples: cohabitation is the best practice and a prompt solution to likewise practical and urgent problems. So, there is a sort of gap between intention and the effective realization of the decision which determines both the choice of cohabiting and the one of marrying. In fact, most of the reasons which could explain marriage (being Catholic, the solemnity of the marriage, a moment of joy) ‚Äì which could reach or go beyond the moment of acting on the basis of a specific intention ‚Äì have to face many other choices that continue to be attractive or based on other reasons (cohabitation is as if it was marriage, the wedding is expensive). And the couples act exactly following these reasons, ignoring the original or desired intention. On the contrary, this intention is further strengthened or confirmed by these other reasons. For explaining the behavior of the couples, the author thinks that the category of akrasia is helpful since it shows how the couple mirrors and reformulates those fortuitous reasons which, at the beginning, affected the choice of going to live together in an active way, trying to overcome the casual order.",

      "abstract": "Why do people think that someone living a morally bad life is less happy than someone living a good life? One possibility is that judging whether someone is happy involves not only attributing positive psychological states (i.e., lots of pleasant emotions, few unpleasant emotions, and satisfaction with life), but also forming an evaluative judgment. Another possibility is that moral considerations affect happiness attributions because they tacitly influence attributions of positive psychological states. In two studies, we found strong support for the second hypothesis. Moral considerations only appear to affect happiness attributions when they also affect attributions of positive psychological states. Additionally, both studies supported a hypothesis about why moral judgments have these effects. Specifically, we found that when people judge that someone is living a bad life, they infer that the person is not at peace with themselves. However, when this inference is blocked, moral considerations do not affect attributions of happiness or positive psychological states. In sum, although ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù appears to be a purely psychological concept, happiness judgments are sensitive to moral considerations because people often assume that immorality disrupts intrapersonal harmony.",

The present study was carried out to evaluate the existence of a nycthemeral rhythm of human sexual behavior and to identify environmental factors responsible for the rhythmic pattern.Methods: Non-traditional university students (ages 18 to 51 years) recorded the times of day when they went to sleep, when they woke up, and when they had sex for 3 consecutive weeks. They also answered a questionnaire designed to identify the causes of their selection of time for sex.Results: The majority of sexual encounters took place at bedtime (11 pm to 1 am). The most common explanations for this temporal pattern were the rigidity of the professional work schedule and family obligations and the availability of the partner, which reduced the opportunity for sexual encounters at other times of the day.Conclusion: Most sexual encounters take place around bedtime. Although the presence of an endogenous component responsible for this temporal pattern cannot be excluded, the evidence indicates strong environmental forcing, particularly from the work/family schedule of the individuals and from partner availability.",

The research method uses the principles of the phenomenological research paradigm. Primary data was obtained from the results of ethnographic interviews with actors or perpetrators because the focus of this research was directed at tracing the causes and effects of divorce from the perspective of the perpetrators or actors. While secondary data is several kinds of literature related to the research focus. The results showed that several factors cause divorce, namely; differences in character between partners, failure to understand each other, and husband's sexual behavior disorders. The impact of divorce can befall the child and each partner, especially the psychological impact. Similarly, the impact of divorce for couples who already have children with those who do not. For couples who already have children, the impact is wider and inner. Furthermore, efforts to form a divorce can be carried out with several recommendations, First, every couple who will get married must know their potential partner well to their sexual behavior, Second, build a shared commitment about where to go and the desired family model. Third, mutual trust, respect, and support. Fourth, provide good service to partners. Fifth, do not let the small problems that arise in marriage in a long time. Sixth, avoid third-party intervention.

Whalen proposed to replace the abstract concept of \"power of desire\" with a more specific concept of sexual excitability, i.e., readiness to respond to a sexual situation sexually and erotically.Sexual excitability has great individual variations determined by the physiological state of the body (hormonal balance and such) as well as the life (sexual, emotional, and communicative) experience of the subject and their non-sexual motives.According to R. Whalen, sexual arousal, i.e., current, temporary psychophysiological state, is a function of stable excitability of the subject, and particular given external and internal situation.Modern psychological literature describes sexual motivation in terms of the theory of needs, the theory of emotion, and cognitive psychology alike.However, the most productive theory in terms of opportunities for integrating psychological and sociological data is the theory of \"sexual script\" suggested by William E. Simon and John Gagnon.Presenting main material.As the special studies show, erotic dreams, night dreams, and fantasies are an essential aspect of our sexuality.They do not only substitute actual sex life or fill in its deficit, as S. Freud believed, but also constantly accompany it.More sexually active people also have more intense erotic imagination that supports, encourages and diversifies their real experience.For those brought up in Victorian spirit, the words \"erotic\" and \"eroticism\" sound as offensive phrases denoting something \"animal\" and low.In fact, animals do not know what eroticism is.The ability to not only respond to erotic signs and images, but also create them implementing your imagination is an exclusively human property, inherent to us, as the history of art says, from ancient times.Erotic images perform four main functions.First, they are all tools of cognition, displaying and capturing sexually significant properties and experiences.Second, they serve as a kind of psychological stimulants of sexual arousal.Third, they expand the",

The results obtained in the survey described in the present paper show that love is considered to be an emotion which binds two persons together, occurs suddenly and unexpectedly, is relatively lasting, comprising various relations and usually involving sex. Friendship is in turn described as a union of two persons who are not infrequently of the same gender and relate to each other on the basis of common views or attitudes. This kind of union is in most cases lasting, it does not involve sexual behavior, but demands specific relations of other types. However, the relations in question, which also determine the differences in the perception of love and friendship, have not been extensively described by the respondents. Since the characterizations of love and friendship one may fi nd in the literature on the subject focus precisely on the relations between the persons involved in these two types of relation, the present paper has investigated these relations more closely. The survey in question focused on (1) the characteristics desired in a friend and those desired in a loved person, (2) the characteristics that preclude a person from becoming a friend or a lover, (3) the scope of action one is willing to perform for a friend and for a lover, and (4) the ways of expressing friendship and love. The results of the survey have shown that the semantic profi les of highly stabilized collective symbols of love and friendship slowly evolve and tend to exhibit collectivist rather than individualist attitudes. The young respondents who completed the survey tend to abandon romantic attitudes based on abstract values and adopt various rationalist approaches in order to derive particular benefi ts from a given union, either for themselves or for themselves and their partner.\r\nTranslated by Dorota Chabrajska",

      "abstract": "People with learning disabilities are frequently denied or restricted in their right to express their sexuality by restrictive policies, negative attitudes or lack of awareness of their needs. They also tend to have differing and unrecognised sexual health needs to those of the general population. Evidence suggests that acquiring a greater knowledge and awareness of sexuality and relationship issues helps to decrease these disadvantages and to promote a greater sense of well-being for this group.The experiences of eight adults with learning disabilities attending a sexuality and relationship group, based on a mixture of validated and established sexuality and relationship programmes, were explored using a case study approach. Participants' experiences were gathered through semi-structured interviews and analysed using qualitative content analysis supported by participant observation and pre- and post-group assessment of knowledge.Participant experiences were unique and individual, with few shared opinions. All participants demonstrated increases in their total knowledge scores in the post-group assessment and felt that attending the group had changed their views on relationships; they felt that they were more able to talk to others, to trust someone, to feel confident to want longer relationships and to be married with children.Sexuality and relationship groups can offer participants a beneficial and positive experience to explore such issues. The experiences of participants could be enhanced through adopting a person-centred approach and through recognising that participants have individual experiences that may not be shared within the group environment.",

This raises questions of how to define and investigate conduct problems in females as well as how to identify differential childhood antecedents. A developmental psychopathology perspective is advanced as one useful approach to understanding adaptive and maladaptive social patterns in males and females that may lead to different developmental trajectories and influence the forms of psychopathology that develop. The utility of de-emphasizing serious physical aggression as one important criteria for conduct problems is questioned. Recommendations that particular forms of deviance in females be considered as markers of their antisocial patterns (e.g., somatic complaints, friendlessness, underachievement) are also called into question. Rather than adopt sex-specific criteria to assess conduct problems, it is necessary to expand and broaden the diagnostic categories to include serious externalizing problems regardless of whether they occur in males or females.",

      "abstract": "Ray Bachtian Rangkuti (* Nurmalawaty (** Mohammad Ekaputra (*** Hukum positif di Indonesia tidak memandang semua hubungan kelamin diluar perkawinan sebagai zina (overspel). Perbuatan zina menurut KUHP hanya meliputi mereka yang melakukan persetubuhan atas dasar suka sama suka tanpa ada unsur paksaan, kekerasan dan ancaman kekerasan, KUHP juga memandang ada suatu perbuatan yang melakukan persetubuhan dengan daya paksa, kekerasan, atau ancaman kekerasan, yaitu delik pemerkosaan, Tindak pidana pemerkosaan ironisnya tidak hanya berlangsung di lingkungan luar atau tempat-tempat tertentu yang memberikan peluang manusia berlainan jenis dapat berkomunikasi, namun juga dapat terjadi di lingkungan sekitar yang seharusnya menjadi tempat memperoleh perlindungan. Pada hakikatnya korban tidak dapat melindungi diri sendiri dari berbagai macam tindakan yang menimbulkan kerugian mental, fisik, sosial dalam berbagai bidang kehidupan dan penghidupan. Kejahatan seksual sekarang ini merebak dengan segala bentuk. Khususnya pada kasus pemerkosaan, pelaku tidak mengenal lagi status, pangkat, pendidikan, jasmani, dan usia korban. Bahkan banyak juga yang tega memperkosa orang yang dalam keadaan tidak berdaya, baik secara fisik maupun mental. Semua ini dilakukan apabila mereka merasa terpuaskan hawa nafsunya. Demikian juga usia pelaku yang tidak mengenal batas usia. Pada penulisan skripsi ini, penulis menggunakan metode penelitian hukum normative melalui studi pustaka (Library search). Sumber hukum dalam penulisan skripsi ini adalah bahan hukum primer, yaitu Undang-undang, bahan hukum sekunder yaitu buku yang relevan dan putusan pengadilan, serta bahan hukum sekunder yang bersumber dari artikel, majalah, internet, dan lain-lain. Hasil penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwasanya pelaku pemerkosaan dapat dikenakan pasal 285 KUHP, tetapi jika korban adalah orang yang tidak berdaya maka dikenakan pasal 286 KUHP, ditambah lagi jika perbuatan tersebut dilakukan secara berkesinambungan, maka akan ditambah pemberatan atas perbuatan pidana tersebut. Maka dari itu peran pengadilan terutama hakim sangat menentukan dalam proses penegakkan keadilan, hakim dituntut bijaksana, adil dan jeli dalam menjatuhkan pidana bukan hanya melihat dari sisi pelaku tapi juga dari sisi korban.",

During this time, sexual desire, pleasure, and activity often diminish. Sexual dysfunctions can also appear. Active intervention by health professionals, based on respect and empathy and following a biopsychosocial approach, can help improve sexuality. Normalizing the physical and emotional changes of this period, and dismantling prejudices and erroneous beliefs about sexuality during pregnancy, we can dispel many fears and doubts, improving self-confidence and self-esteem and reducing stress and anxiety. The most important aspect in achieving a satisfactory sexuality is the quality of the couple‚Äôs relationship. Therefore, we must help both members to improve their emotional approach. In a normal pregnancy, sexual activity is safe and healthy. Adequate sexual health during pregnancy provides important benefits: it reduces stress levels, maintains adequate self-esteem, and enhances intimacy and complicity in the couple‚Äôs relationship, thus improving overall well-being.",

      "abstract": "In the United States, mental health disparities persist between sexual minorities - people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or other nonheterosexual identifications - and heterosexuals. Although research shows that structural stigma in one's environment may contribute to such disparities, little research has examined religious environment as a source of structural stigma for sexual minorities. Given historic and ongoing religious-based sexual minority stigma, such research is needed. Thus, we conducted a secondary analysis of the Household Pulse Survey (n = 824,900) to test whether facets of the religious environment (i.e., presence of places of worship and conservative Christian adherents in one's U.S. state of residence) are associated with anxiety and depression. We test if associations are stronger for sexual minorities compared to heterosexuals and if associations remain significant after including other facets of the social environment (same-sex households, political conservatism, and urbanicity) and individual-level controls. We found that when considered separately, religious and social environmental factors demonstrated stronger associations with anxiety and depression for sexual minorities relative to heterosexuals, even after controlling for individual variables. Findings were more nuanced for integrated models. Overall, we address a gap in the literature by examining religion as a structural part of one's environment.",

      "title": "Does atypical interoception following physical change contribute to sex differences in mental illness?",
      "abstract": "Sex differences in the prevalence and presentation of mental illnesses are well documented. Women are more likely to experience common mental health disorders (e.g., anxiety and depression), and when they experience these conditions, they often present differently to men (e.g., women are more likely to report somatic complaints). Periods of physical and hormonal change (e.g., adolescence, pregnancy, and menopause) are particular risk periods for the development of mental illness in women. In this article, we advance the proposal that interoception (the perception of the body's internal state) is one mechanism that might explain sex differences in vulnerability to mental illness. We argue that known sex differences in interoception, whereby women, compared to men, report heightened attention to internal signals coupled with worse interoceptive accuracy, may result from the increased amount of physical and hormonal change women experience across development. Given links between interoception and mental health, we propose that sex differences in interoception may partly explain sex differences in the prevalence and presentation of certain mental illnesses. Further scrutiny of this proposal may aid our understanding of sex differences in mental illness with implications for assessment, early intervention, and the development of novel treatment approaches.

It could be demanding in either of two ways: by answering too many practical questions, leaving too few to be resolved on non‚Äêmoral grounds, or by thwarting too many of our natural, non‚Äêmoral desires. The former is irrelevant to making/allowing but the ‚Äòthwarting‚Äô kind of demandingness is not, and attempts by Bentham, Mill, and Sidgwick to fend off the threat are failures. The ‚Äòthwarting‚Äô threat might be countered by adopting a morality that requires or permits more attention to one's own interests than to others‚Äô, but when that is combined with the moral neutrality of making/allowing, the result is requirement or permission for behaviour that no decent person would agree to.",

The correlates of father absence early (before age 5) or late (between 5 and 11) in childhood were studied in a sample of college-aged women; father absence was due to either death or divorce. In comparison to father-present controls the father-absent subjects showed few deviations in such personality measures as degree of sex-role typing, attitudes toward romantic love, sex-role traditionalism, manifest anxiety, or locus of control. There did appear to be some attitudinal differences about the acceptability of sexual intercourse for the father-absent groups, but there were no differences in the amount of heterosexual behaviors actually reported. The father-absent subjects did not differ from the controls on various measures of nonverbal behavior to male interviewers. Reasons for the lack of agreement with a study by E. M.

      "title": "FEMALE = SUBMISSIVE and MALE = ASSERTIVE Sexuality-priming leads to gender-based self-perception and automatic behavior",
      "abstract": "Sexuality is a domain in which gender stereotypes thrive. A cultural standard for the sexual experience and expression of women and men prescribes different gender roles in sexuality. WomenÔøΩs sexual role is submissive and tender, menÔøΩs assertive and dominant. These sexual roles reflect the stereotypical view of women as more communal and men as more agentic. If gender stereotypes and sexual roles are activated by sexuality cues, this may have consequences for subsequent thought and behavior. Specifically, following reminders of sex, menÔøΩs and womenÔøΩs self-perceptions may become more gender-stereotypical, and they may identify more strongly with their respective sexes. Moreover, research on prime-to-behavior effects has shown that priming affects a personÔøΩs momentary self-representation (the ÔøΩactive selfÔøΩ), which can lead to corresponding behavioral effects (e.g., Wheeler, DeMarree, & Petty, 2007). Thus, after sex-priming the prescriptive gender stereotypes of sexual submissiveness among women and sexual assertiveness among men may manifest themselves in participantsÔøΩ non-sexual social behavior. In four studies, sexuality was primed using visual (Study 1) and verbal (Study 2 through 4) material. Sex-priming led to a gender-based self-perception, i.e. womenÔøΩs communal orientation was more pronounced relative to their agency, whereas for men the opposite was true (Study 1 and 4), heightened identification with oneÔøΩs own gender (Study 2), and prompted greater submissiveness in women (Study 3 and 4) and greater assertiveness in men (Study 3). More specifically, in Study 3 changes in participantsÔøΩ signature size were unobtrusively measured after sex-priming to check for changes in assertiveness. MenÔøΩs signatures were larger following sex-priming whereas womenÔøΩs were not. In Study 4 sex-primed women hesitated longer before interrupting an experimenter chatting on the telephone, thus revealing a more submissive approach to social interaction. In sum, these findings support the hypothesis that following sex-priming, self-perception and social behavior ÔøΩtune inÔøΩ to gender stereotypes. The potentially detrimental effects of casual ÔøΩsex-primingÔøΩ in everyday life on self-perceptions and mixed-sex social interactions are discussed.",

      "title": "Permissiveness, Permission, and Aggression: The Effect of Adult Presence or Absence on Aggression in Children's Play",
      "abstract": "It has become conventional to think of an adult's permissiveness toward a child as representing neutralization of adult control. By behaving permissively (acceptantly, nonjudgmentally, etc.), the adult is thought to be freeing the child from his presence and authority, and in some loose sense to be permitting the child to behave as he would in the absence of any adult. Such thinking has emphasized the punitive or threatening aspects of adultchild relations. Adult permissiveness is seen as a way of reducing the child's fear of adult punishment and thus as a way of encouraging him to express in behavior those impulses whose expression he knows to be normally unacceptable to adults. Such thinking about permissiveness has been the basis for explanations which have been advanced for a frequent finding about aggression in doll play. It has repeatedly been observed that aggression in doll play increases over time or from session to session (i, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9). This finding has typically been explained by reference to the adult experimenter's acceptant and nonjudgmental interaction with the child and the fear-reducing effect this interaction has. For example, in discussing recent evidence confirming the finding, Levin and Sears state that",

      "abstract": "Haircare and psyche reciprocally reflect each other both positively and negatively (bad hair days). Contrary to the bad haircare and negligence of a depressed person or a man in grief, generally people tend to offer themselves the best of haircare when they are feeling happy or when they want to show their internal feelings to others through body language. This is particularly obvious during public appearances and important social gatherings (e.g., parties, marriage ceremonies). Haircare by itself can induce a state of self-confidence and may reflect social status. This may explain significant differences in shampooing regimens, which range from once or twice a week to once a day.",

      "abstract": "Primates and dolphins exhibit comparable examples of all categories of non-conceptive sexual behaviors, including sexual interactions involving immature individuals, those involving individuals of the same sex, and copulation during the non-conceptive period. Although mammals of other taxa also perform non-conceptive sexual behaviors, the fact that there are so many reports of non-conceptive sexual interactions among higher primates and dolphins suggest a link between the nonreproductive use of sexual behaviors and high intelligence. This link might be because the greater role of learning in sexual behavior expands the possibility for sex to be incorporated into a variety of non-conceptive functions. Non-conceptive sexual behaviors seem to reflect or be influenced by important social factors, including affiliative relations and alliance between individuals of the same or different sex, high social status of females, within-group or between-group tension resolution, mate selection, and infanticide prevention. Animals may employ non-conceptive sexual behaviors to control various important aspects of their relationships with others which they cannot control with other social behaviors, which suggests that instances of non-conceptive sexual behaviors may serve as keys to understanding important aspects of the social relationships or social structure of the species.",

      "title": "F7. SEX DIFFERENCES IN THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SELF-REPORTS OF CHILDHOOD ADVERSITIES AND SCHIZOTYPAL PERSONALITY TRAITS",
      "abstract": "While it has been repeatedly documented that people with schizophrenia report higher levels of adverse events in childhood (emotional, physical and sexual abuse), this has not been extensively examined in healthy individuals who score highly on schizotypal personality traits. The continuum hypothesis of psychosis and schizophrenia suggests it is important to assess the relationship in those who are healthy but who experience some psychotic-like symptoms. Of course, it is problematic to rely upon the veracity of events that anyone might recall from their childhood, but this is likely to be compounded by the presence of well-documented memory and executive problems, as well as symptoms such as delusional thinking, in some adults with psychosis. One advantage of examining healthy participants is that recall is not affected by the condition itself or memory- and executive-function problems. As there is evidence that the expression of psychotic disorders differ between males and females, the etiological mechanisms and pathways to the development and experience of psychotic symptoms may equally differ. Indeed, sex differences in the association between childhood trauma and psychotic symptoms have been noted. The aim of this present study was to investigate any links between childhood trauma and psychotic-like symptoms in healthy individuals. Based on previous research the expectation is that associations will be found between self-reports of childhood trauma and schizotypal personality traits. These associations would be expected to differ between males and females. The sample consisted of 320 participants (221 females, 99 males) with a mean age of 28.24 (SD 12.76). Childhood traumatic events were assessed by three sub-scales (Physical Punishment; Emotional Abuse; and Sexual Events) of the Early Trauma Inventory Self Report-Short Form (ETISR-SF; Bremner et al., 2007). Schizotypal personality traits were assessed using the Five Factor Schizotypal Inventory (FFSI; Edmundson et al., 2011). This consists of nine subscales (Interpersonal Suspiciousness; Social Anhedonia; Social Isolation and Withdrawal; Physical Anhedonia; Social Anxiousness; Social Discomfort; Odd and Eccentric; Aberrant Ideas; and Aberrant Perceptions) which were constructed as schizotypic variants of respective facets of the five factor personality model. The relationship between childhood trauma and schizotypy was examined using Spearman‚Äôs bivariate correlation analyses. Males showed significant positive correlations (ranging from .28 to .39) between Emotional Abuse and seven out of nine schizotypal sub-scales. The other two childhood trauma scales were not associated with any schizotypal sub-scales in males. Females showed significant positive correlations (ranging from .19 to .34) between Physical Punishment and eight out of nine schizotypal sub-scales. Additionally, females showed significant positive correlations (ranging from .26 to .35) between Emotional Abuse and all schizotypal sub-scales. Sexual Events positively correlated with two schizotypal sub-scales (Aberrant Ideas and Aberrant Perceptions) in females. From the results of this study it appears that emotional abuse was linked to the expression of psychotic-like symptoms in both sexes across a wide array of symptomatology. Therefore, any effect of emotional abuse should not be considered sex or symptom specific. By contrast, physical abuse appeared to be sex specific ‚Äì affecting only females ‚Äì but not symptom specific. Finally, sexual abuse appeared to have a specific link with disorganized thoughts and hallucination-like experiences in females.",

Data claiming that psychological factors are causal in nonorganic female infertility are reviewed. Speculations concerning the question of whether there are emotional factors in infertility still require experimental work. From the psychosomatic point of view there is no real evidence that the uterus and infertility represent a modality of responding to life. Regarding infertility as a genetic matter Polman argues that instinctual drives to parenthood if they exist in humans at all must play a minor role and that what is considered instinctual may be social learning. Many of the clinical symptoms considered to be the basis of infertility are actually indications of the patients attempts at keeping a psychological equilibrium. Analysis of the psychologic test data in terms of infertility is inconclusive at best. Although male infertility once all organic factors have been eliminated appears to have a psychologic basis there have been no controlled studies. The commonly held belief that adoption is followed by normal pregnancy is without proof. There is an almost complete absence of scientifically valid supporting data for the hypothesis that psychologic factors are causal in nonorganic female infertility.",

      "abstract": "Relative to heterosexual peers, sexual minority youth experience significant mental health disparities. This is partly due to prejudicial encounters (e.g., discrimination, victimization) because of their sexual minority status, and potential intersecting and compounding prejudicial experiences related to their ethnic minority status. However, even though religiosity has been identified as a protective factor in the general literature and may be especially relevant for youth in Latinx families, few studies have examined whether religiosity serves as a buffer of the relations between discrimination-related stress and mental health in sexual minority Latinx youth. Thus, the aims were to examine (a) whether ethnic and sexuality discrimination have additive or multiplicative effects on depressive symptoms, and (b) whether own or family religiosity (defined by religious importance and attendance) moderates the relations between discrimination and depressive symptoms. Sample included 377 youth (Mage = 20.29, SD = 2.61, age range 14-24). Results did not support an interaction between ethnic and sexuality discrimination, nor between own religiosity and ethnic discrimination, in predicting depressive symptoms. There were significant interactions between family religiosity and discrimination (ethnic and sexuality), in which family religiosity was negatively associated with depressive symptoms only at average and low levels of discrimination. There was a significant interaction between own religiosity and sexuality discrimination, in which own religiosity was negatively associated with depressive symptoms only at the low level of sexuality discrimination. Findings highlight the importance of examining the intersection of religion, sexuality, and Latinx minority status in relation to mental health outcome.

Antithetical to this model is the contention that divorce per se need not always be a trauma, but may also be a stren, a strengthening experience. Available research literature on the responses of married persons to divorce is reexamined in terms of an alternative query: under what conditions is divorce, a potentially traumatic experience, actually experienced as a stren, a personality enhancing or growth experience? Seventeen factors contributing to this outcome are discussed: the definition of divorce as a normal event; the personalities of the participants, including the ability to define experiences as strens; age and sex; marital life style; the quality and length of marriage; the length of termination of the marriage; the status of 100initiator or noninitiator; attachment and the ex-mate; income and education options; traditional or nontraditional gender roles; supportive networks; geographical mobility; the presence of peer support groups; and the role of a significant other. Suggestions are made for processes to facilitate the adjustment of divorced persons, and for future research.",

This has been demonstrated empirically for multiple aspects of fertility and partnership histories, including timing of births and marriage, parity, and the presence and timing of a marital disruption. Most previous studies have, however, addressed particular aspects of fertility or partnership histories singly. We build on this research by examining how a holistic classification of family life course trajectories from age 18-50, incorporating both fertility and partnership histories, is linked to later life physical health for a sample of Australian residents. Our results indicate that long-term family life course trajectories are strongly linked to later life health for men, but only minimally for women. For men, family trajectories characterized by early family formation, no family formation, an early marital disruption, or high fertility, are associated with poorer physical health. Among women, only those who experienced both a disrupted marital history and a high level of fertility were found to be in poorer health.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric and psychological testing are used extensively in both clinical and research contexts, with the goal of providing an objective indication of the construct being measured. At the same time, it has long been recognized that there is no such thing as a culture free or even fair test, to the extent that cultural bias-the constant and systematic statistical error due not to chance but to ethnic group membership-can seriously undermine the validity of a psychological or psychiatric test. The very construct being measured may not have a culturally compatible equivalent, or, relatedly, the behavior sampled in a given item or combination of items may not be associated with the construct in question in the same way across all cultures. In addition the means by which the behavior is sampled-the instrument construction, the sorts of questions or their structure, for example-can vary in familiarity across cultures. Finally, the individual items themselves may be poorly or ambiguously translated, may be predicated on specific cutlural norms, or, indeed, the meaning of the item can vary cross-culturally. Finally, sampling bias pertains to the representativeness of the sample, however, this is all the more complex given that constructs such as ‚Äúrace‚Äù, ‚Äúethnic group‚Äù and so forth are often poorly defined and ambiguous, and thus who is and who is not included in a given group may further undermine the validity of the test. Despite these difficulties, concrete steps can be taken to increase the cultural validity of the test used.",

      "title": "Aggression and Criminal Behaviour",
      "abstract": "Abstract The reasons for criminal and aggressive behaviour in humans are complex and include both biological and nonbiological explanations. Twin studies estimate that up to half of the variance in aggressive behaviour can be attributed to genetic factors. Genes play a role in aggression, and both human and animal studies suggest that common gene variants predispose some people to violent actions and criminality. Several studies have found associations between aggressive behaviour in males and a low‚Äêactivity variant of the monoamine oxidase A ( maoa ) gene. These associations are often dependent on environmental insults, which dependent on maoa genotype may increase susceptibility for aggressive behaviour. These and other findings pose a challenge in determining criminal responsibility as the complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors in the aetiology of violence becomes better understood. Key Concepts: Aggression has an evolutionary basis with both positive and negative aspects. Criminal behaviour falls under a larger phenotype of antisocial and aggressive behaviour, marked by an inability to conform to social norms. Twin and adoption studies demonstrate that roughly half of the individual variance in aggressive behaviour is due to genetic factors. Despite well‚Äêknown gender differences in aggressive behaviour, biological evidence in humans tying differences in aggression to sex hormones remains equivocal. There is a robust literature demonstrating the association between serotonin and aggressive behaviour, highlighted by candidate genes along the serotonergic pathway. A number of studies have identified interactions between environmental adversity and the low‚Äêactivity variants of the MAOA gene as a predictor of aggressive behaviour.",

How does one distinguish between love and the out-of-control behavior of addiction? This paper addresses these issues of love, differentiating between what Maslow has called B-love, love for the being of the other, and D-love, love which fills a deficiency within oneself. Sexual addiction, with its unfulfilled quest for unity with another, is the outer limit of D-love. The form behavior addiction takes depends on what is being defended against. Sexual addiction, which frequently has its roots in sexual abuse, is usually accompanied with extreme levels of unhealthy shame. Successful treatment will focus on building positive relationships with self and other.",

      "abstract": "Dog social behaviour has been well studied, but little is known about affiliative relationships between dogs. We report a yearlong study of dominance and affiliation in 24 dogs at a dog daycare facility and provide additional details on dog relationships through long-term observations of pairs of dogs who lived together in the same household or met frequently for years. Companion dogs formed highly differentiated relationships with one another. At daycare, some dyads affiliated and displayed one-way submission (formal dominance), others affiliated without a dominance relationship (egalitarian), and the majority of dyads did not affiliate at all (agonistic or non-interactive). The dogs in household environments showed formal and egalitarian relationships, and two dyads exchanged two-way agonism without submission (unresolved). Sex influenced the types of relationships dogs formed, with mixed sex dyads more likely to affiliate and less likely to exhibit dominance than same-sex pairs. Dominance influenced the nature of affiliation in relationships; egalitarian dyads were more likely to play and showed more equitable gentle affiliation. Gentle affiliation was reciprocal in the group as a whole, but it was highly skewed in many dyads, especially those with dominance relationships. Gentle affiliation was usually, but not always, directed up the hierarchy. Certain dyads affiliated at much higher rates than others, indicating that the dogs formed friendships. Most friends were mixed sex and/or egalitarian pairs, but friendships occurred in all of the sex class/dominance combinations. Long-term observations demonstrated how dyadic relationships can change over time. Such highly differentiated relationships suggest significant social complexity in dogs.",

      "abstract": "To build on existing theories about love, we propose that passion is a function of change in intimacy (i.e., the first derivative of intimacy overtime). Hence, passion will be low when intimacy is stable (either high or low), but rising intimacy will create a strong sense of passion. This view is able to account for a broad range of evidence, including frequency of sex in long-term relationships, intimate and sexual behavior of extraverts, gender differences in intimate behavior, gain and loss effects of communicated attraction, the biologically atypical human preference for face-to-face coitus, and patterns of distress in romantic breakups. Although this view may provide a good fit to available evidence, the totality of evidence is not yet adequate for a definitive conclusion, and suggestions for further research are offered.",

      "abstract": "While research generally supports that greater outness about one's sexual identity is associated with improved well-being, emerging evidence suggests that outness may have negative consequences for bisexual individuals. Yet, few studies have examined sexual identity as a moderator of the associations between outness and well-being, especially among youth. As such, the role of outness in the mental health of diverse sexual minority youth (including pansexual, queer, questioning, and asexual youth) remains unclear. Thus, we examined how the associations between outness and well-being differed as a function of sexual identity in a sample of sexual minority youth. Using data from the LGBTQ National Teen Study (N = 11,225), we tested sexual identity as a moderator of the associations between outness and well-being (depression and self-esteem). In the full sample, greater outness was significantly associated with lower depression and higher self-esteem. However, these associations were significantly different for gay/lesbian versus questioning youth. Greater outness was associated with lower depression and higher self-esteem for gay/lesbian youth yet was associated with higher depression and was not associated with self-esteem for questioning youth. The association between outness and self-esteem was also significantly different for gay/lesbian versus bisexual youth. Greater outness was associated with higher self-esteem for both groups, but the association was stronger for gay/lesbian youth. These findings suggest that outness may have benefits for gay/lesbian and bisexual youth, yet it may have negative consequences for questioning youth. These findings can inform efforts to promote positive sexual identity development and wellbeing of sexual minority youth.",

This study reports findings from a 13-year, 4-phase longitudinal study in which trait anxiety, measured when spouses were newlyweds, consistently predicted marital negativity which, in turn, was associated with partner's marital dissatisfaction. Some support was also found for effects of trait anxiety on partner's marital satisfaction, independent of marital negativity, as well as for the idea that trait anxiety is directly related to spouses' own marital satisfaction. Trait anxiety did not distinguish couples who divorced from those who remained married, and it generally did not predict declines in marital satisfaction. The disagreeable impact of trait anxiety on marriage was evident at the outset of marriage and was stable over time.",

Women's preferences for sexually dimorphic characteristics in male faces (facial masculinity) have recently been reported to covary with self-reported attractiveness. As women's attractiveness has been proposed to signal reproductive condition, the findings in human (Homo sapiens) and other species may reflect similar processes. The current study investigated whether the covariation between condition and preferences for masculinity would generalize to 2 further measures of female attractiveness: other-rated facial attractiveness and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Women with high (unattractive) WHR and/or relatively low other-rated facial attractiveness preferred more \"feminine\" male faces when choosing faces for a long-term relationship than when choosing for a short-term relationship, possibly reflecting diverse tactics in female mate choice.",

      "abstract": "First sex is an important event in an individual's sexual development. Previous literature has, however, primarily investigated first heterosexual sex, overlooking important contextual factors specific to same-sex/gender sexual experiences. Seventeen in-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other sexual minority (LGB+) individuals, ages 18-23 years. Four themes emerged from thematic analysis of reported thoughts, affect, and behavior. First, participants reported difficulty defining sex between same-sex/gender partners, especially women who reported that this undermined their personal relationships and identity. Second, participants met partners through several means; however, it was almost exclusively men who reported meeting their first partners online. Third, motivations for first same sex/gender sex included affirmation of personal sexual identity, sexual exploration, social expectation, and spontaneity. Fourth, participants felt underprepared for their first same-sex/gender sex, noting that their earlier sex and relationship education had not included information on same-sex/gender sex or LGB+ identities. Consequently, participants reported relying on experienced partners and seeking information on the internet, including pornography and social media. Greater cultural representation and more comprehensive sex education that recognizes sexual diversity is needed to better prepare LGB+ young people for early sexual encounters.",

      "title": "Reduced Fertility in Patients' Families Is Consistent with the Sexual Selection Model of Schizophrenia and Schizotypy",
      "abstract": "Background Schizophrenia is a mental disorder marked by an evolutionarily puzzling combination of high heritability, reduced reproductive success, and a remarkably stable prevalence. Recently, it has been proposed that sexual selection may be crucially involved in the evolution of schizophrenia. In the sexual selection model (SSM) of schizophrenia and schizotypy, schizophrenia represents the negative extreme of a sexually selected indicator of genetic fitness and condition. Schizotypal personality traits are hypothesized to increase the sensitivity of the fitness indicator, thus conferring mating advantages on high-fitness individuals but increasing the risk of schizophrenia in low-fitness individuals; the advantages of successful schzotypy would be mediated by enhanced courtship-related traits such as verbal creativity. Thus, schizotypy-increasing alleles would be maintained by sexual selection, and could be selectively neutral or even beneficial, at least in some populations. However, most empirical studies find that the reduction in fertility experienced by schizophrenic patients is not compensated for by increased fertility in their unaffected relatives. This finding has been interpreted as indicating strong negative selection on schizotypy-increasing alleles, and providing evidence against sexual selection on schizotypy. Methodology A simple mathematical model is presented, showing that reduced fertility in the families of schizophrenic patients can coexist with selective neutrality of schizotypy-increasing alleles, or even with positive selection on schizotypy in the general population. If the SSM is correct, studies of patients' families can be expected to underestimate the true fertility associated with schizotypy. Significance This paper formally demonstrates that reduced fertility in the families of schizophrenic patients does not constitute evidence against sexual selection on schizotypy-increasing alleles. Futhermore, it suggests that the fertility estimates derived from extant studies may be biased to an unknown extent. These results have important implications for the evolutionary genetics of psychosis.",

      "title": "Stress Mediates the Health Effects of Many Social Determinants",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter examines current scientific knowledge of how stress influences health and health disparities. Stress (the experience of feeling ‚Äústressed‚Äù or ‚Äústressed out‚Äù) is distinguished from a stressor (an event or condition that causes stress) and from the stress response (the body‚Äôs physiologic response to stress). Advances in neuroscience indicate that stress is likely to be an important link between many social factors and many health outcomes. Chronic exposure to multiple everyday hardships (especially conditions over which one has little control) is likely to be more damaging to health than dramatic acute stressors. ‚ÄúBad‚Äù (‚Äútoxic‚Äù) stress is stress that overwhelms one‚Äôs ability to cope, causing adverse cognitive, behavioral, and/or physiological effects. The links between social disadvantage (e.g., poverty and discrimination) and stress are explored in this chapter. For example, having chronically inadequate economic resources to cope with basic everyday needs‚Äîsuch as food, shelter, child care, elder care, or medical care‚Äîis likely to be stressful, as is experiencing ongoing discrimination (unfair treatment based on attributes such as race/ethnic group, skin color, religion, gender, disability, or LGBTQ status). Social support appears to protect to some extent against the health-damaging effects of stress. Strategies to reduce stress, particularly that due to social disadvantage, are discussed.",

Love is daily lived and told not only from the beautiful but especially from the conflicts that produce disharmony. Love experienced in conjugality is ruled by monogamy, which is fostered by the desired ideal of fidelity as an option. However, many people establish sexual and affective relationships out of the conjugal bond, awakened by sexual and affective dissatisfaction, lack of tenderness, love and care, or perhaps desire, pleasure, passion, vengeance or competition, considered to be socially undesirable behaviors. This work tried to unveil how relationships of infidelity are daily lived by eight women and five men in Belem, Para, which have agreed to share their stories and secrets about the subject with the researcher. As there was a circularity of ideas in the narratives, the informants allowed finding many visions of and innumerous justifications to the practice of affective or sexual infidelity, as well as different nuances that inform the feminine and masculine representations about infidelity. This gave the opportunity to read the limits that structure conjugal relationships, because infidelity ‚Äì thought as a disarrangement element ‚Äì is in general juggled and serves as a strategy for the love game, assuring sometimes, when it is undiscovered, the maintenance of the couples bonds.",

      "abstract": "This study of 679 social science students in an Ontario university attempts to up grade and retest some of the notions in the literature about male-female relations in dating. Specifically, the approaches of Walter, Lowrie, and Burgess and Wallin were tested in this sample using semantic-differential items. Dating experiences for these students were positive and reflected values and experiences consonant with current beliefs; females were close to males in scoring their dating as sexual and hedonistic, while the general pattern involved high ratings of dating as pleasant, educational, cooperative and growth oriented. Inexperienced daters saw their dating as more positive than experienced daters. For most in the sample, dating was an end in itself and was not status or competition exploitation oriented‚Äîat least for the most part, even though these elements have not notably disappeared. Males were seen as less often cooperative in dating than females, while men registered more feelings of exploitation. While few of the respondents rated their dating as sexually aloof (less than ten percent), men were seen as too sex-oriented and women as immature. Men less often perceive their dating experiences as growth oriented while women see men as more crude and less often genteel. The relatively heavy emphasis on sensuatity and sexuality by both males and females is seen as indicating some change in dating patterns.",

      "abstract": "Animals act to obtain rewards such as food, shelter, and sex. Sometimes, their actions are rewarded or reinforced immediately, but often this is not the case; to be successful, animals must learn to act on the basis of delayed reinforcement. They may also profit by choosing delayed reinforcers over immediate reinforcers, if the delayed reinforcers are sufficiently large. However, individuals differ in their ability to choose delayed rewards. Selfcontrolled individuals are strongly influenced by delayed reinforcement, and choose large, delayed rewards in preference to small, immediate rewards; in contrast, individuals who are relatively insensitive to delayed reinforcement choose impulsively, preferring the immediate, smaller reward in this situation (1). Impulsivity has long been recognized as a normal human characteristic (2) and in some circumstances it may be beneficial (3), but impulsive choice contributes to deleterious states such as drug addiction (4-8) and attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (9).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Pedophilia is typically defined as sexual attraction to prepubescent children, reflected in a person's sexual thoughts, fantasies, urges, sexual arousal, or behavior regarding children (American Psychiatric Association, 2000; World Health Organization, 1997). There are two key aspects to emphasize in this definition: first, the sexual interest in children is persistent, and second, the children of interest are prepubescent and thus show few or no signs of secondary sexual development. This means that someone who has expressed a sexual interest in children or who has engaged in sexual behavior involving a child is not necessarily a pedophile. It also means that individuals who are attracted to sexually maturing children or sexually mature adolescents, even if they are below the legally defined age of consent, are unlikely to be pedophiles.",

      "abstract": "Using ethnographic and survey data on low-income families residing in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio, we examine the relationship between women's patterns of union formation and their experience of physical and sexual abuse. Both sets of data suggest that women who have been physically or sexually abused are substantially less likely to be married or to be in stable, long-term cohabiting relationships. The data also suggest that the timing and different forms of abuse may have distinctive associations with union formation. Women who have experienced abuse beginning in childhood, particularly sexual abuse, are less likely to be in sustained marriages or stable cohabiting relationships and instead are more likely to experience transitory unions: multiple short-term, mostly cohabiting unions with brief intervals between them. Women who have not been abused in childhood but experience adult physical abuse, however, are less likely to be in either a marriage or a cohabiting union, long-term or transitory; and some have withdrawn from having relationships with men. The relevance of these findings for the decline of marriage among low-income women and men is discussed.",

      "title": "Trauma and Stress-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Traumatic events have permeated our lives throughout history and across the globe, inflicting profound losses on individuals, families, and communities during warfare, armed conflict, natural disasters, and relational violence. Although many survivors of these events harness their resilience and cope without long-term negative mental health effects, others experience a range of physical and mental health conditions, including trauma- and stress-related disorders. With an emphasis placed on adult trauma survivors, the conditions of posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, adjustment disorders, complex trauma, and other stress-related conditions have been explored within a social context. Starting with a historical context, the following topics were addressed. The typologies of trauma were introduced including the definitions of Type I trauma‚Äîa single discrete event including natural catastrophes; Type II trauma‚Äîchronic and repetitive traumatic physical, sexual, and/or emotional abuse; and Type IIII‚Äîsevere and multiple abusive events with multiple perpetrators. Historical and intergenerational trauma reflect a collective of complex traumatic events throughout generations that resonate in subsequent generations in terms of ungrieved losses and survivor guilt, among other psychosocial issues. Cultural and racial trauma include chronic verbal and/or physical assaults that involve racialized bigotry. Combat trauma involves a combination of deployment stressors that have affected servicemembers in distinct ways with ‚Äúsignature injuries‚Äù associated with different wartime conflicts. The next section addresses the current typology of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>‚ÄîV, noting the changes in diagnostic criteria, in particular related to the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mental health responses to trauma vary a great deal based on a balance of risk and protective factors, often revealing noteworthy resilience and the absence of negative aftereffects. The neurobiological effects of trauma are addressed along with mental health conditions or disorders (e.g., acute stress response, PTSD, complex trauma, and anxiety disorders). Specific phase-oriented and multimodality treatment interventions are reviewed that focus specifically on the mental health conditions presented. These approaches are research-informed, culturally responsive, and theoretically grounded Finally, the responses experienced by clinicians who work with traumatized clients are outlined along with recommendations for ways to minimize the effects of secondary, or vicarious, traumatization. Clinical <underline>v</underline>ignettes based on case composites have been utilized to illustrate central points.",

      "abstract": "In addition to causing physical injury, sexual abuse of a child also disrupts normal psychosexual development. Multiple psychological and behavioural symptoms of sexual violence have been described by various authors. These include excessive eroticisation of the child. Such abused children often display provocative and seductive sexual behaviour. Parents or guardians report depressed mood or anxiety in the child. Young victims of sexual offenses usually experience psychosexual problems and have low self-esteem, also in adulthood. Furthermore, masturbation inadequate for the stage of psychosexual development is another symptom, which was discussed in the historical context of sexual deviations involving children. There is full consensus in terms of sexology, sexual ethics and other sciences as well as strong social condemnation of sexual violence against children: the perpetrators are dangerous criminals, who sometimes try to justify their pathological sexual activity by describing it as ‚Äòa harmless weakness of the elite which is rooted in antiquity‚Äô. However, this type of child abuse cannot be justified in any way.",

      "abstract": "Although casual sex is increasingly socially acceptable, negative stereotypes toward women who pursue casual sex remain pervasive. For example, a common trope in television, film, and other media is that women who engage in casual sex have low self-esteem. Despite robust work on prejudice against women who engage in casual sex, little empirical work has focused on the lay theories individuals hold about them. Across six experiments with U.S. adults ( N = 1,469), we found that both men and women stereotype women (but not men) who engage in casual sex as having low self-esteem. This stereotype is held explicitly and semi-implicitly; is not driven by individual differences in religiosity, conservatism, or sexism; and is mediated by inferences that women who have casual sex are unsatisfied with their mating strategy‚Äîyet the stereotype persists when women are explicitly described as choosing to have casual sex. Finally, the stereotype appears to be unfounded; across experiments, the same participants‚Äô sexual behavior was not significantly correlated with their self-esteem.",

      "abstract": "The association between religiosity and the construct of sexual passion was examined to see whether religiosity is associated with harmonious, inhibited, and obsessive sexual passion styles. Using multiple regression and checking for interactions between religiosity, gender, broad categories of religion (Catholic, other Christian, other religious, nonreligious), and the three sexual passion styles, the following associations were found: Religiosity had a significant curvilinear relationship to all three sexual passion styles, suggesting an overlap in levels of religiosity and the construct of sexual passion. Optimal sexual passion outcomes were found at both higher and lower levels of religiosity, whereas mid-level religiosity was associated with the less beneficial sexual passion outcomes. Religious men were significantly more obsessively passionate than religious women, and religious men and women were similarly high on levels of harmonious and low on inhibited sexual passion. There were no significant interactions between religiosity, broad categories of religion, and sexual passion styles. Understanding how religion and sexual passion are associated could be useful for applied researchers as well as those who work with religious individuals who want to help these individuals develop beneficial patterns of sexual passion.",

      "abstract": "Aim: The present research aims to investigate the civil and criminal liability for emotional damages inflicted by spouses on each other in married life. Methods: This research employs a descriptive-analytical method and is conducted using authoritative legal and jurisprudential library sources. Results: Undoubtedly, the primary objectives of marriage for spouses are not profit and benefit, but rather to achieve peace, respect, loyalty, intimacy, and security. Among the damages that can be inflicted on a person is moral damage, which is not about losing property; rather, these damages affect the individual emotionally and psychologically. Moral damage is often related to the rights associated with a person's character and includes harm to physical and moral integrity, such as physical suffering, identity, reputation, emotions and feelings, and dignity. Conclusion: Consequently, we find that if spouses suffer from mental illness or are harmed due to constant quarrels, blame, suppression, or slander, the culprit is liable for civil and criminal damages. However, it is also understood that compensating for emotional damage is not solely through monetary payment but should also involve expressions of affection, commitment to not repeating behavior, public apologies, psychotherapy, etc.",

      "title": "Some Evidence Bearing on the Aim-Inhibition Hypothesis of Love",
      "abstract": "ONE OF THE more tenacious but, curiously, not very provacative issues centering around premarital sexuality concerns the consequences of coitus on established love relationships. Although sexual involvement between meaningful pair members is sometimes advocated in the folk culture, it is usually with the intent of precipitating a commitment for marriage; the generation of feelings of obligation and guilt, not love, become paramount. With respect to enhancing love, we find little encouragement for sexual activity. Quite to the contrary, our culture abounds with expressions admonishing the young, especially the female, of the unhappy consequences of premarital intercourse. Premarital concessions, she is warned, bring rejection and vitiates the love relationship. Generations of daughters have been cautioned that he won't love (respect) you anymore. This avenue of thought is by no means unique to the layman. Significant figures in sociology and psychology have also invested belief in the hypothesis that sexual intercourse corrupts love. Contemporary family writers, influenced by the works of Freud (1960) and Waller (1938), perpetuate with varying degrees of commitment the aim-inhibition hypothesis: romantic love is the consequence of sexual inaccessibility of the love object. Although a wide variety of explanations are offered concerning the psychological mechanics underlying this hypothesis, the central idea is essentially that romantic love is a subliminal phenomenon emerging from the social frustration of biological impulses. For our purposes, aim-inhibition is synonymous with the idea that romantic love and sex are incompatible, the dynamics accounting for that incompatibility being ignored. There has been a paucity of research on the consequences of sex on love in American society. The existent studies, however, do not support the aim-inhibition hypothesis (Burgess and Wallin, 1953:239-242; Kirkendall, 1961:chapter 8). For some of the more devout proponents of the hypothesis, the coup de grace has simply been the observation that romantic love tends not to survive long into marriage.' Efforts have also been exerted to bring anthropological materials to bear on this issue. These investigations have, at best, produced mixed evidence (Blood, 1952; Stephens, 1963:207; Chard, 1961). It is possible, moreover, that these cross-cultural studies have been aimed at a conceptually alien question, i.e., not whether the introduction of sexual intercourse vitiates love but rather do the two elements tend to co-exist on a societal level at any given time.

      "abstract": "Separate lines of research show that men overestimate the extent of male peers' sexual activity, and independently, that sexually aggressive men believe that other men approve of coercive behavior. This study examined the intersection of these lines of inquiry, testing whether the degree of male participants' misperception of other men's sexual behavior differs as a function of perpetrator status. In a national sample, we presented heterosexually active men (n = 497) with sexual scenarios varying in sexual acts, partner types, and circumstances. Results showed that participants significantly overestimated the typicality of all types of sexual situations for other men. Participants also misjudged the desirability of scenarios consistent with a traditional masculinity sexual script to other men; these scenarios reflected an adversarial perspective on relationships and an impersonal approach to sexuality ‚Äì a known risk factor for sexual aggression. Further, sexually aggressive men overestimated the desirability of these traditional masculinity scenarios to a greater extent than non-aggressive peers. Findings suggest that interventions that provide accurate knowledge about social norms, or \"typical\" sexual desires and behaviors among other men, may reduce pressure to live up to perceived but perhaps inaccurate masculine ideals, as well as reduce social norm-related risks for sexually aggressive behavior.",

The drive to have support in child care is one, as evidenced by evolutionary theory, but that does not explain the formation of stable homosexual relationships, in which there is no risk of pregnancy from casual sex. Surveys were administered to 177 gay males to understand this phenomenon. Anxious attachment style and base sex drive were found to be the strongest predictors of, respectively, interest in uncommitted sex and interest in (stable) sentimental relationships. Avoidant attachment, sexual attitudes, and internalized homophobia also have an influence on the type of relationship sought. Interestingly, interest in sentimental relationships and interest in uncommitted sex appear not to be correlated.",

Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones. Various explanations such as diagnosticity and salience help explain some findings, but the greater power of bad events is still found when such variables are controlled. Hardly any exceptions (indicating greater power of good) can be found.

Se pretende profundizar en la vinculacion existente entre la vejez y el proceso de envejecer desde un enfoque de genero y, en algunos casos, su vision del feminismo. El prisma de genero resulta fundamental para analizar el envejecimiento, ya que aun hoy, no es lo mismo envejecer siendo hombre o mujer. En los resultados iniciales, parece que el feminismo/s (e incluso el constructo genero o vejez) solo forma parte del discurso de algunas entrevistadas que muestran un perfil muy concreto. Esta ausencia puede interpretarse como indicador de que la perspectiva de genero (y/o feminismo) aplicada al envejecimiento activo y a la vejez, aun no ha calado de manera clara en las organizaciones sociales mas implicadas en las personas mayores.",

      "title": "Motif dan Konflik pada Laki-Laki Berpoligami",
      "abstract": "Menikah adalah salah satu usaha yang dilakukan sebagian besar manusia untuk memenuhi kebutuhan biologis, seksual maupun kebutuhan psikologisnya (Saxton,1986 :\r\n235). Dalam perkawinan ada dna bentuk kategori dasar yakni monogami (satu istri\r\ndengan satu suami) dan poligami yang terdiri dari polyandry (dua atau lebih suami dengan satu istri), polygyny (dua atau lebih istri dengan satu suami) dan group marriage (dua atau lebih pasangan hidup bersama dalam sebuah perkawinan). Meskipun Pemerintah mempersulit dan mempersempit poligami dalam praktiknya cukup banyak laki-laki Indonesia yang melakukan poligami baik secara sah di Pengadilan maupun hanya kawin agama saja atau siri. Di dalam berpoligami masing-masing individu memiliki banyak motif, baik yang ditimbulkan oleh faktor luar maupun dari dalam individu. Pernikahan poligami tidaklah mudah, karena mulai dari memutuskan untuk berpoligami sampai perjalanan kehidupannya mereka mengalami konflik, baik konflik interpersonal maupun intrapersonal.\r\nPenelitian ini melibatkan 3 responden laki-laki yang memiliki istri lebih dari satu. Metode penelitian yang digunakan adalah kualitatif-studi kasus dengan teknik wawancara mendalam. Wawancara dilakukan secara terpisah dan dijadwalkan sesuai dengan kegiatan masing-masing responden. Metode analisis data mengacu pada analisis isi tematik, yang dimulai dengan wawancara kemudian memunculkan tema-tema, kategori-kategori dan pola hubungan diantara kategori-kategori tersebut.\r\nHasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa motif responden menikah lagi adalah mencapai\r\npemuasan dan kebahagiaan pribadi karena responden tidak puas dengan kehidupannya, lari dari masalah rumah tangga yang dihadapinya dengan mencari tempat yang baru dan karena kekuatan ekonomi serta sikap otoriter laki-laki. Keputusan untuk menikah lagi mendapatkan protes baik dari keluarga,istri dan anak, karena tidak setuju dengan poligami. Pertentangan tujuan itu menjadi konflik tersendiri bagi responden baik bersifat interpersonal maupun intrapersonal, konflik itu timbul tidak hanya pada saat memutuskan untuk berpoligami saja melainkan pada saat setelah berpoligami. Pada saat memutuskan poligami konflik interpersonal timbul karena adanya perbedaan pendapat dan tujuan antara suami, keluarga, istri dan anak. Konflik intrapersonalnya dikarenakan dihadapkan pada dua pilihan atau dua situasi yang tidak mengenakan. Konflik interpersonal setelah atau selama berpoligami dikarenakan ketidakmampuan responden untuk me-manage para istri sehingga istri tidak bisa saling mengerti, memahami dan menerima.",

      "title": "Social Exclusion and Social Anxiety Disorder: The Temporal Need-threat Model of Ostracism",
      "abstract": "Social exclusion, or ostracism, is being excluded or rejected by others. It is the common behaviour within social situations. Detecting social exclusion could be essential for the survival of human creatures, as social exclusion could threaten the basic needs of human creatures: self-esteem and feelings of belongingness. Williams temporal need threat model introduces how individuals react toward ostracism. Usually, individuals can recover from social exclusion quickly by behaving pro-socially to reconnect to others and fortify the basic need(s) threatened by social exclusion. However, for individuals with higher social anxiety or social anxiety disorder, the negative social belief about themselves (unpopular, shyness) within a social situation inhibits their recovery speed from exclusion and desire to reconnect to others. When social exclusion happens, individuals with higher social anxiety or social anxiety disorder become more vulnerable in social situations. Individuals lose their ability to get used to social situations when they suffer long-term social exclusion. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is suggested to be a helpful therapy for individuals suffering from long-term social exclusion and social anxiety disorder.",

      "abstract": "Domestic violence is every act or omission from an act or threat with any of them, committed within the family, resulting in material or moral harm. That evidence has an important role in these crimes, and it is an effective tool in achieving justice. Equally, the accused is considered innocent if there is no evidence against him, and he will be released if the evidence weakens. And the subjectivity of proving domestic violence crimes is reflected in the nature of the occurrence of the crime. It often occurs inside the home and weakens or sometimes fails to find sufficient evidence for judgment, and that the proof for evidence of domestic violence crimes is not different from the evidence in proving other crimes. Self-evident stands out in the obstacles and difficulties related to filing a complaint or news and obtaining evidence due to the specificity of this type of crime, as well as legal barriers related to testimony, as one of the spouses is not a witness to the other, and the origin is not a witness to his branch or the branch is a witness to his origin, Unless he was accused of a crime against them, and thus the subjectivity becomes clear in proving this type of crime.",

There are problems with this approach, however, for some aspects of human life are more widely understood than others, and what is thought to be a valid generalisation may in fact be nothing more than a vague or unwarranted stereotype. Moreover, conventional wisdom itself may be suspect because different cultural groups (including different generations) are unlikely to view the world in the same way or share the same values. What might appear to be a valid generalisation to one generation might well be considered absurd by another.

      "title": "Clinical practice guidelines for child sexual abuse",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Child sexual abuse (CSA) is the involvement of children and adolescents in sexual activities (usually for adult sexual stimulation or gratification) that they cannot fully comprehend and to which they cannot consent as a fully equal, self-determining participant, because of their early stage of development [Box 1].Box 1: Defining child sexual abuseIt is important to understand the nature and type of CSA as the severity of the impact of the abuse depends on not only on the type of abuse but also on the duration of the abuse and very importantly, whether the abuser is a known/trusted person or a stranger [Table 1].Table 1: Nature or type of child sexual abuseThus, CSA is a complex issue, wherein impact and recovery depend on all of the above variables and how they combine to influence the child's experience of abuse. Even where there are two children, who have been impacted by identical forms and processes of abuse (similar variables), they may still be different in terms of their responses. This difference is accounted for personality and temperament of each child, and social context and circumstances of each child, due to which each child perceives and internalizes the abuse differently, thus resulting in different emotional and behavioral states to the abuse, and necessitating different psychosocial and mental health responses. CSA is not a clinical condition or diagnosis. Clinical practice guidelines for standard child psychiatric conditions can be developed based on existing knowledge and practices. However, to develop clinical practice guidelines for an experience that is both nuanced and complicated by psychological and social processes is a particular challenge. Clinical practice guidelines for CSA, therefore, necessitate mental health professionals to work with many processes and systems to effectively assist the child. CONTEXT OF CONSULTATION There are broadly three contexts in which children present for consultation on sexual abuse issues. The first is when CSA is already established by agencies and individuals, and they refer the child to the mental health system. Such referrals may be received from: (i) District Child Protection Units; (ii) Childline and child care agencies/service providers; (ii) Police; and (iii) Courts and judicial personnel. Children are brought by such agencies and bodies either for interventions in the wake of trauma and emotional problems and/or for inquiry and evidence gathering for use in court cases. Thus, in this context, the mental health system is not required to establish whether or not CSA has occurred, as it is already known ‚Äì usually, children would have reported abuse or in case of children in sex trafficking, they have been rescued through a raid on sex work institutions, and so the abuse has come to light. The second context is one in which the child has reported to his/her parents but they, in turn, have not reported the abuse to police or legal systems. However, they seek consultation to provide the child with mental health interventions. The third context is when it is not (yet) known that he/she has been sexually abused; the child comes to the mental health system for some psychological or psychiatric manifestation, but on enquiry and examination, CSA issues emerge in one of the following ways: The child discloses or reports abuse An adolescent girl is found to be pregnant (Frequent) urinary tract infections in the child are reported by the child/caregivers and/or genital injuries in the child are reported/observed Emotional and behavioral issues that are associated with anxiety, anger, and depression. There is what is called an index of suspicion in CSA, i.e., when to suspect CSA and how true one's suspicions likely to be. Figure 1 represents the index of suspicion in CSA. At the peak of the triangle, the index of suspicion is the highest, i.e., there is no doubt when a child reports or discloses that abuse has taken place, especially when a child spontaneously reports without particular inquiry by an adult.Figure 1: Index of suspicion in child sexualEqually high on the index is pregnancy (in adolescent girls) ‚Äì a sure sign that sexual abuse has occurred. Genital injuries and frequent urinary tract infections must lead to suspicion that there is digital handling and sexual abuse is very likely to have taken place. Emotional and behavioral changes observed in the child are important indicators of CSA; however, they come lower on the index of suspicion because these psychological changes may occur due to some reasons (unlike pregnancy or genital injuries which do not have a range of reasons for their occurrence!). Emotional and behavioral issues relating to anxiety and depression may occur due to sexual abuse but may also be due to other difficult and traumatic experiences such as parental marital conflict, bullying, learning difficulties and academic pressures, loss, and grief (death-related) experiences‚Ä¶ so, while emotional and behavioral changes may lead to CSA suspicion, further examination and inquiry needs to be made (by a psychosocial or mental health professional) to understand exactly what difficult event(s) or experiences they are attributable to in a given child. During the inquiry, if sexual abuse is ruled out, then the signs and symptoms may be attributable to other difficult experiences. Below are indices of CSA [Table 2].Table 2: Emotional and behavioral indices of child sexual abusePROCEDURE FOR ESTABLISHING AND CONFIRMING CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE The procedure for establishing and/or confirming CSA has three components, namely, (i) Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment; (ii) Developmental Assessment; (iii) Abuse Inquiry or Forensic Interviewing for CSA. The third component particularly, is predicated on the first two components, which makes it necessary for the three assessments to be done in the order in which they are listed and described. Psychosocial and mental health assessment It is important to obtain a detailed history and assessment of the child, including information on family and school context, developmental level and functionality, emotional and behavioral issues (pre- and post-sexual abuse), circumstances of the alleged abuse, the child's experience and understanding of the abuse and other related problems. Treatment and interventions for abuse must be developed based on the complete assessment of the child's context and issues; this is because every child is unique and has his/her own unique ways, based on age, developmental stage, personality and temperament, family and social circumstances, and the nature of abuse, of processing the abuse experience. Information requires to be obtained through the assessment of the child and family/caregivers. The immediate aftermath of the abuse, i.e., within the first few days is not the time for asking the child to provide the abuse narrative in great detail as this is likely to distress and traumatize the child further. The objective of the Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment [Box 2] is to establish that abuse has occurred and to know the nature of abuse, i.e., contact versus non-contact, penetrative versus nonpenetrative abuse with a view to making decisions regarding medical interventions, as well as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) interventions, as necessary.Box 2: Psychosocial and mental health assessmentIt is important to understand any emotional and behavioral issues the child had before the abuse and compare these to those that may have occurred post-abuse. This is because (i) we need to understand exactly which emotional and behavioral problems that are attributable to abuse; (ii) we need to understand how pre-abuse emotional and behavioral issues may have determined the ways in which the child has processed the abuse experience and been impacted by it. In either case, the child would need to receive treatment and assistance for all emotional and behavioral issues, both pre-existing ones as well as those that developed as a result of the abuse. Developmental assessment The developmental assessment requires to be completed before any forensic interviewing processes and/or interventions are entered into with children for eliciting abuse narratives. The purposes of conducting a developmental assessment in the context of CSA are two-fold: To make decisions about the feasibility and use of methods to elicit the abusive narrative in accordance with the developmental abilities of the child, for treatment and intervention purposes and/or as part of evidence gathering for court cases/legal processes To be able to design and/or deliver age-appropriate interventions; this includes the use of communication and methodologies that are comprehensible to a child in the course of treatment, including to provide personal safety education and awareness (which forms a part of the treatment interventions). There are five specific domains of development that children require to be assessed in: physical or locomotor, speech and language, cognitive, social and emotional development. If the abilities and skills in these domains are not age-appropriate, then there are implications for forensic interviewing and evidence gathering for court cases and legal processes [Box 3].Box 3: Applying child development assessment to CSA inquiry and interventionInquiry with the child: Forensic interviewing for child sexual abuse This includes interviewing the child to obtain information on the sequence of abuse events and how they occurred according to the child, and how the child perceived and understood the abuse. The interview may have to be carried out in well-planned sessions, over a period of time, especially in the case of younger children or children with posttraumatic disorder. Creative play methods, such as stories, art and toys/dolls may have to be used to elicit children's narratives. Such indirect methods are gentle and nonthreatening and also allow younger children with less developed verbal abilities to communicate their experiences of abuse. During these sessions, while eliciting children's abuse narratives, open-ended questions that encourage children to express themselves freely should be used. A detailed verbatim recording of the interview should be done through written documentation as well as video recordings in case of play sessions with young children so that these can also be used for legal proceedings. Introduction and rapport building Greet the child and tell him/her your name and then, ask the child his/her name Sit at the same physical level as child (if the child is on the floor, sit on the floor‚Ä¶ if the child is sitting on a chair, sit on the chair next to her) Use toys and play activities (dolls, puzzles, picture books, and coloring books‚Ä¶) to engage young children and give it to the child as soon as (s)he comes to the court (while waiting for you) Enter into play with the child and spend 5‚Äì10 min engaging child in play activity‚Ä¶ \"what are you doing? What is the doll doing? May I see what you are coloring?\" Engage in neutral conversation with the child for a few minutes (this also helps to assess the child's developmental abilities and skills as well as mental state)--What did you eat for breakfast today? How did you come here today? Who are these people who have come with you?.... \" For older children and adolescents, you may say \"I really want to know you better. Tell me about the things you like to do\" Introduce the space and the purpose of the child being there, including your role: \"My name is‚Ä¶ my job here is to make sure that children are safe and no one hurts them. If we hear that someone is hurting or troubling children, then we do things to stop that from happening\" \"You may be wondering about this busy place and many rooms‚Ä¶many people come here, just like you to talk about people who have hurt or troubled them‚Ä¶that's why we need a big space like this and many people to help\" \"Although this place may seem a little scary and confusing, you are safe here‚Ä¶and after we have spent a little time talking, you can go back home with your parents or caregiver.\" Explain the need for video camera/microphone (in case you are using such equipment) ‚Äì \"As you can see, we have a video-camera and microphones here. They will record our conversation so I can remember everything you tell me. Sometimes, I forget things and the recorder allows me to listen to you without having to write everything down.\" (In case you are taking notes, you may provide a similar explanation to the child). Ensuring accurate reporting This is to ensure that the child has the competency to differentiate between truth and lies and to ensure that children tell the truth. Establish the need for telling the truth, and child's capacity to differentiate between what's true or not and to say \"I don't understand\" or to tell examiner when he makes a wrong statement: Part of my job is to talk to children (teenagers) about things that have happened to them. I meet with lots of children (teenagers) so that they can tell me the truth about things that have happened to them. Hence, before we begin, I want to make sure that you understand how important it is to tell the truth For younger children, explain: (\"What is true and what is not true\"). \"If I say that my shoes are red (or green) is that true or not true?\" (Wait for an answer, then say:) \"That would not be true, because my shoes are really (black/blue/etc.). And if I say that I am sitting down now, would that be true or not true (right or not right)?\" (Wait for an answer.) It would be (true/right) because you can see I am really sitting down.' \"I see that you understand what telling the truth means. It is very important that you only tell me the truth today. You should only tell me about things that really happened to you.\" (Pause) \"If I ask a question that you don't understand, just say, \"I don't understand.\" Okay?\" (Pause) \"If I don't understand what you say, I'll ask you to explain. \"What would you say if I made a mistake and called you a 2-year-old girl (when interviewing a 5-year-old boy, etc.)?\" (Wait for an answer.) \"That's right. Now you know you should tell me if I make a mistake or say something that is not right. You may record your observations as follows: Capacity to differentiated \"truth\" established Yes No Capacity to say \"I don't understand\" established Yes No Capacity to tell interviewer that she/he \"is not right\" established Yes No. Training in episodic memory Episodic memory represents our memory of experiences and specific events in time in a serial form, from which we can reconstruct the actual events that took place at any given point in our lives. It is the memory of autobiographical events (times, places, associated emotions, and other contextual knowledge) that can be explicitly stated. Individuals tend to see themselves as actors in these events, and the emotional charge and the entire context surrounding an event is usually part of the memory, not just the bare facts of the event itself (http://www.human-memory.net/types_episodic.html). It is essential to encourage children to provide detailed responses early in the interview as this enhances their descriptive responses to open-ended prompts in other parts of the interview, particularly those related to the abuse incident. Hence, at this stage of the interview, training in episodic memory or narrative practice should be done as follows: \" It is very important that you tell me everything you remember about things that have happened to you. You can tell me both good things and bad things\" Identify a recent event the child experienced- the first day of school, birthday party, holiday) and build up on that using qualifiers like tell me, what happened next, \"Think hard about (activity or event) and tell me what happened on that day from the time you got up that morning until (some portion of the event mentioned by the child in response to the previous question). \"Tell me more about (activity mentioned by the child).\" (Wait for an answer.) Use this prompt as often as needed throughout this section] \"Earlier you mentioned [activity mentioned by the child]. Tell me everything about that.\" Note: Focus on real-life events; avoid focusing on accounts relating to television, videos, and fantasy. Abuse enquiry Now transition to substantive issues to enable the child to provide you with the narrative by using open questions such as: \"Now that I know a little about you, I want to talk about why (you are here) today\" \"I heard you talked to \"X\" about something that happened ‚Äì tell me what happened\" \"I see you have (a bruise, a broken arm, etc.,) ‚Äì tell me what happened\" \"I heard you saw (the doctor, a policeman, etc.) last week ‚Äì tell me how come/what you talked about\" \"Is (your mom, another person) worried about something that happened to you? Tell me what she is worried about\" \"I understand someone might have troubled you ‚Äì tell me what happened\" \"I understand someone may have done something that wasn't right ‚Äì tell me what happened\" \"I understand something may have happened at (location) ‚Äì tell me what happened\" Young children, who either do not have the language to name private parts and genitals or are unwilling to name these parts due to fear and embarrassment, use pictures or dolls to assist the child--\"I will show you a picture (here is a doll)‚Ä¶ can you show me/point to where this person touched or hurt you‚Ä¶\" Probe for disclosure Use gentle probes, including some close-ended questions to confirm some details. If child has mentioned telling someone about the incident(s), ask details, if not then probe about possible immediate disclosure by saying: \"Does anybody else know what happened?\" How did they come to know? [Box 4]Box 4: Techniques of Inquiry: Leading questionsClosing the interview The closure phase helps to provide an end to a conversation that may have been emotionally difficult for the child. \"You have told me lots of things today, and I want to thank you for helping me.\" \"I want to especially tell you how brave you are for telling me all that happened‚Ä¶ things like this happen to many children, but they don't always want to tell others about it‚Ä¶ because they are afraid. You may also have been scared, but you were brave to tell people about it ‚Äì I am sure your parents are proud of you‚Ä¶ I am too\" \"Is there anything else you think I should know?\" \"Is there anything you want to tell me?\" \"Are there any questions you want to ask me?\" \"If you want to talk to me again, you can call me at this phone number and come and see me again.\" (Give the child or caregiver your name and phone number). IMPACT OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION After eliciting the abuse narrative, it is critical to understand the methods and processes used by the perpetrator to sexually abuse the child. CSA is a process that consists of a series of actions entailing lure, seduction, manipulation and/or coercion and threat. Different methods and processes of abuse have different psychological impacts on children and adolescents. Not all CSA results in trauma; in fact, where CSA methods use lure, seduction, and manipulation to \"manufacture\" the consent of the child (versus methods of threat, violent coercion, and aggression), there may be the less overt or visible traumatic reaction in the child [Table 3].Table 3: Understanding trauma dynamics: The impact of child sexual abuseAbuse in the context of \"manufactured consent\" When abuse has taken place through grooming processes (i.e., lure, inducement, and manipulation) and violence, threat and coercion methods have played little or no role in the abuse process, children/adolescents are less likely to be aware of and acknowledge the abuse [Box 5].Box 5: When and why children do not acknowledge abuse experiencesImplications for intervention Focus on helping children recognize various types of child (sexual) abuse, including understanding why and how certain actions constitute abuse Reassurances to child on safety and protection (from the perpetrator) Arrangements with parents/caregiver to ensure the child's safety and protection. Abuse of young children In younger children, the methods of abuse entail (i) inducement and lure and/or (ii) coercion and threat. Inducement and lure entail the use of sweets and toys to get children to perform or cooperate in sexual acts for adult stimulation. Perpetrators also use attention and affection in exchange for sexual favors, i.e., provision of attention and affection when the child complies with the adult on sexual acts and withdrawal of attention and affection when the child does not. These methods are followed by the perpetrator creating excitement and secrecy around the sexual act, often presenting it to the child as a \"special new game,\" a \"secret game\" that no one else plays and no one else knows about; and young children, who have no understanding of sexuality are vulnerable to such ruses. Implications for intervention Medical assistance in case of violent abuse and physical injury Teaching children about safety issues related to strangers as well as known persons Enabling children to learn how to protect their bodies, i.e., which body parts should not be touched by anyone except for select family members such as mothers/caregivers during personal hygiene activities Helping children discern between \"safe\" and \"unsafe\" secrets Validation of emotions and provision of reassurance for children who may be traumatized by the CSA. Abuse of adolescents In older children and adolescents, the processes of abuse are similar, but the use of lure and inducement are slightly different and these processes are also known as 'grooming' [Box 6]. Given that adolescents are at a life stage wherein they are interested in issues of love, attraction and sexuality and are also keen to experiment with these experiences, perpetrators tend to use lure and inducements that are more emotional in nature (rather than the more material ones used with younger children). This means that they smooth talk adolescents about their physical appeal and qualities, making promises of long-term emotional, and romantic relationships with them‚Äîand adolescents interpret these actions as being loving and romantic.Box 6: The grooming processAgain, given the life stage adolescents are at, often also under peer pressure to experiment with sexuality, offenders have the perfect opportunity to manipulate them into sexual engagement by transmitting all sorts of misconceptions about sexual behaviors and norms. For instance, appealing to adolescents' need to \"fit in\" with their peers, perpetrators tell adolescents that it is necessary to gain sexual experience, that it would be \"uncool\" if they are ignorant about sexual acts. As a result, adolescents, who are still acquiring life skills such as (sexual) decision-making, are negatively influenced, believing in the misconceptions transmitted to them, confused by how they should respond. Following such manipulation and abuse, adolescents experience feelings of tremendous confusion, especially as they have shared \"deep\" sexual and romantic relationships with the offender. They find it exceedingly difficult to discern this as an abused process and defend the offender, often refusing to accept that this is abuse. Implications for intervention Medical assistance in case of violent abuse and physical injury In case of pregnancy, decisions around medical termination of pregnancy, depending on the medical issues as well as the adolescent's desire to have/keep the child, i.e., from a child rights' perspective, facilitating discussions with the adolescent to help her make decisions about her pregnancy Helping adolescents explore notions of love, romance, and relationships Enabling adolescents to understand various forms of coercion, ranging from material lure to persuasion and threat; focussing on an understanding of consent in sexual relationships [Box 7] Personal safety awareness and education focussing on equipping adolescents with sexual decision-making skills (a life skills approach) Validation of emotions and working with notions of self-identity, including feelings of guilt and shame, in children and adolescents who may be traumatized by the CSA. Box 7: The issue of consentINTERVENTIONS As also shown in Figure 2, CSA interventions can be broadly categorized into three types of responses:Figure 2: Child sexual abuse interventions Medical assistance Psychosocial interventions First level responses for children Depth therapeutic interventions for children Interventions for parents and caregivers. Legal assistance. Medical assistance In case a child is referred immediately after abuse, i.e., within a few hours or days), it is necessary to first proceed with a medical evaluation and requisite medical interventions as a priority. Treatment history and response to treatment (in case the child has already undergone or is undergoing treatment) should be recorded. Ideally, it must be ensured that the child is provided with emergency medical services within 24 h of filing the first information report (FIR) in case a police report has been filed or even otherwise. Physical examination Physical examination of the child to be conducted including 2 ID marks The child's family or caregiver should be present in the room during the examination Permission of the child and consent of the parent to be taken before the examination What physical symptoms does the child have at present/(e.g., burning sensation during micturition, White Discharge per Vagina, itching in the perineal area, bleeding, any injury, pain in any area, etc.) Post-exposure prophylaxis If a child is within the 36 h window period (especially in case of penetrative abuse): Has the child received Postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) (within 36 h) in case of penetrative abuse? If not, refer to Paediatric ART Centre for PEP Even if the child is not in the window period and the penetrative abuse has occurred within a month, refer to the Paediatric ART Centre so that a decision can be taken regarding initiation of PEP Ensure that the child/adolescent has received oral contraceptive pills to prevent pregnancy Ensure that the child has been medically evaluated by a Registered Medical Practitioner, namely a pediatrician or gynecologist from a government hospital, for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), urinary tract infection and/or injuries. The STD investigation must be repeated at the end of 4 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Forensic examination Check whether an additional specific forensic evaluation has been done (examination requested by police documenting abuse, if swabs have been taken in case of penetrative abuse), and if so, whether the report is available. Obtain the report from the relevant source. Pregnancy tests Ensure that a urine pregnancy test has been done In case the results are a false negative, it would be best to obtain an additional gynecological opinion In case the child/adolescent is under 20 weeks pregnant, discussions about abortion may need to be done with the child/adolescent and her caregivers. It is also advisable to liaise with an obstetrician at this time. Psychosocial and mental health interventions for children and families Following medical assistance, or simultaneously, psychosocial and mental health interventions should be initiated for the child and family, based on the Psychosocial and Mental Health Assessment completed. Developmental assessments and forensic interviewing may follow subsequently, and be embedded in the counseling and therapy processes. Pharmacotherapy Pharmacotherapy is not specifically indicated for CSA unless it results in severe anxiety and depressive states. Children who have undergone CSA and present with severe PTSD will require medication in addition to other psychosocial interventions: These medications include specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or benzodiazepines, in dosages recommended as per body weight. SSRIs are also indicated in situations where CSA results in severe depression associated with self-harm behaviors, dissociation, and agitation. States of agitation may call for SOS medication with low dosage benzodiazepines There are a group of children with pre-existing vulnerabilities or those in whom the trauma is so destabilizing that it results in mood dysregulation. This group of children may require mood stabilizers. Older children and adolescents, particularly, must not be coerced to take medication in case they are unwilling i.e. they require to be counselled, including on issues of need and adherence [Box 8].Box 8: Preparing the children and adolescents for medical tests and treatmentFirst level psychosocial responses for children Asking questions, and attempting to establish depth interventions when the child is facing a crisis, i.e., in the immediate aftermath of abuse, is not a useful beginning. This is not the time to for detailed enquiry. If there are serious and disruptive manifestations such as self-harm behaviors, incapacitating anxiety, PTSD symptoms with severe panic, appropriate psychiatric referral at this stage is important (as psychiatric medication may be required for anxiety symptoms to reduce before any counseling work is initiated). However, certain initial responses or what are know as first level responses [Box 9] of a supportive nature require to be provided to the child.Box 9: Objectives of first level responses to child sexual abuseEnsuring child's safety Depending on where the abuse occurred and who the perpetrator is, it is essential to immediately take measures to protect the child from further abuse. This is especially applicable when the perpetrator is a family member or a person known to the child, and where the abuse has occurred at home or in places the child frequents on a daily or regular basis (such as school/tutorials, etc).

      "abstract": "Nonsexually offending psychopaths (N = 32) were compared to sexual homicide perpetrators (N = 38) and nonviolent pedophiles (N = 39) on select Comprehensive System Rorschach variables (Exner et al., 1993). Results indicate similarities among the groups in pathological narcissism, formal thought disorder, and borderline level reality testing. Nonsexually offending psychopaths are distinguished by their lack of interest in and attachment to others and their seemingly conflict-free internal world. While both sexually deviant groups evidenced interest in others and appear to experience a very dysphoric internal world, the sexual homicide perpetrators are distinguished by high levels of obsessional thought and an inability to disengage from environmental stimuli. Pedophiles show significantly more characterological anger, which may stem from their general inadequacy, cognitive rigidness, less alloplastic (acting out) style, and their introversive inability to gratify their needs. Rorschach differences add to our understanding of sexual deviation and violence among these three groups. ¬© 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. J Clin Psychol 56: 757‚Äì777, 2000.",

The involvement of the spouse or partner is important because of the family system dynamics that caused, perpetuated, and/or enabled the chemical dependency needs to be addressed and all involved need some treatment. Recognizing the source of marital or relationship discord is helpful in determining the chemically dependent and codependent couple's needs in terms of aftercare of therapy needed to resolve these conflicts. This article reviews the common probelms encountered by many chemically dependent and codependent couples: codependency, sexual identity conflicts, violence in their relationship, confusion in roles, communication difficulties, unhealthy sexual and intimacy attitudes and values and sexual dysfunctions. Essentially, the chemically dependent or codependent couple is experiencing intimacy dysfunction and is often lacking in intimacy skills. These skills need to be learned in order for them to experience intimacy and to feel more complete in their sobriety.",

      "title": "Adolescent Sexual Wellbeing: A Conceptual Framework",
      "abstract": "Positive aspects of sexuality remain understudied among adolescents globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries. In particular, consensus is lacking on how to conceptualize different aspects of sexual wellbeing among young people. We propose a new conceptual framework for adolescent sexual wellbeing that draws on existing theories and definitions, grounded in theories related to positive youth development, empowerment, human rights, gender, social-ecological and life-course perspectives. The framework highlights six interrelated domains of key competencies that are central to healthy adolescent sexuality development, whether or not sexual activities occur: 1) sexual literacy, 2) gender equal attitudes, 3) respect for human rights and understanding consent, 4) critical reflection skills, 5) coping skills and 6) interpersonal skills. These competencies have the potential both to strengthen and impede adolescents‚Äô sexual wellbeing in relation to both themselves and others. Personal sexual wellbeing includes, but is not limited to, having a positive sense of one‚Äôs own (sexual) self and body, and recognising and appreciating feelings of pleasure and desire. Relational sexual wellbeing can include developing and maintaining mutually respectful, gender equal relationships with other people that are that are part of young people‚Äôs sexual socialisation, such as peers, parents and community members. Over time, relational sexual wellbeing may also include outcomes related to intimate partners, such as equality in relationships, safe and pleasurable sexual interactions, free from violence and coercion. Whether young people are able to translate competencies into desired actions and achieve a sense of sexual wellbeing depends on the personal, social and economic resources available to them, their (sexual) agency, and on the influence of opportunity structures such as policies, laws and norms. We end with discussing the potential implications of the framework for public health programmes and research studies aiming to improve adolescent SRHR and wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Being hit or being given away are subabusive, common behaviors that harm companion animals. Violent childhood socialization increases the risk of adult abuse of animal companions, but relatively little is known about the origins of societally tolerated maltreatment of pets by adults. University students completed surveys about general attitudes toward animals, family socializaton, and current relationships with pets. These students generally had positive childhood socialization about pets and reported high levels of current attachment. Adults whose parents had given children's companion animals away had a heightened likelihood of giving their own pets away. Mothers' kindness to their children's pets was associated with adults' attachment to animal companions, but attachment was not related to the likelihood of hitting current pets. People who score high on a measure of pet abuse potential hit their pets. The pattern of findings related to gender implies that males are at somewhat greater risk for having negative socialization experiences involving pets, for greater pet abuse potential as adults, and for weaker attachments. However, females were equally likely to hit their pets or give them away. The childhood predictors of attitudes about animals, pet abuse potential, hitting pets, giving away pets, and attachment found in this nonclinical, noncriminal sample contribute to our understanding of developmental influences upon relationships with companion animals.",

      "abstract": "Assortative mating results both from social homogamy (coming for similar environments) and active phenotypic assortment (seeking a mate with desired attributes). Dating advertisements provide a means of assessing the role of active phenotypic assortment in the absence of social homogamy. The relative frequency of mention of different attributes (given limited advertising space) is informative regarding the salience of these attributes in active phenotypic assortment. Sex differences in self descriptions and in attributes desired in others in dating advertisements provide a means of evaluating sociobiological issues. Data were analyzed from 191 ads placed by females and 253 ads placed by males seeking to meet members of the opposite sex. The most frequently mentioned attributes are age, race, occupation, moral characteristics, and physical attractiveness. While close to 80 per cent of the advertisers provided information concerning their own race/ethnicity, only a minority of those providing such information limited their quest for a partner to members of their own race/ethnicity. There is substantial assortative mating for religion, family background, status, and educational attainment, yet these attributes are rarely (religion and education) or never (family background) mentioned in advertisements, suggesting that assortative mating on these dimensions may be solely a consequence of social homogamy.",

Dating violence is an important problem in society not only due to worrisome prevalence but also because of its negative effects on physical and mental health. Some of the problems that arises as a result of dating violence are anxiety, depression, suicide attempts, alcohol use and risky sexual behavior. Dating violence includes physical, psychological / emotional, verbal and sexual violence and some factors such as parental punishment, have a friend who has been exposed to dating violence, alcohol and substance use and have tranditional attitudes towards gender roles increase the risk of dating violence. The steps that need to be taken to solve the problem are increasing the awareness of dating violence and defining risk factors.

      "title": "Subjective Ambivalence and the Expression of Anti-Gay Bias",
      "abstract": "Univalent attitudes toward gay people have been widely studied, but no research to date has examined ambivalent (i.e., torn, conflicted) attitudes toward gay people. However, the Justification-Suppression Model (JSM; Crandall & Eshleman, 2003) proposes that ambivalence leads to biased expressions through intrapsychic processes which facilitate biased expression, particularly in contexts presenting strong justifications for expressing prejudice and weak pressures to suppress prejudice. I test these implications in the context of bias toward gay people. In Study 1, the measurement of ambivalence is examined in terms of both subjective ambivalence (i.e., the reported experience of ‚Äútorn‚Äù attitudes) and calculated ambivalence (i.e., mathematical conflict between positive and negative attitude components). I find that higher subjective ambivalence is only associated with more negative attitudes toward gay people (and not positive attitudes toward gay people), and that higher subjective ambivalence predicts less gay rights support even after taking negative and positive attitudes toward gay people into account. Further, higher subjective ambivalence is associated with ideological opposition to gay people and more negative intergroup emotions (e.g., intergroup disgust). These findings suggest it is valuable to examine the unique component of subjective ambivalence separate from univalent negativity. Because calculated ambivalence measures are mathematically dependent upon a univalent negative measure, they cannot be examined separately from negativity. Therefore, subjective ambivalence is the focus of Study 2.\nThe main goals of Study 2 were to determine why and when subjective ambivalence is related to bias. I examined the extent to which the negative relation between subjective ambivalence and opposition to anti-gay bullying can be accounted for by lower intergroup empathy and lower collective guilt, which may facilitate the expression of bias in keeping with the JSM. The relation between subjective ambivalence and anti-gay bullying opposition was examined within four social contexts based on a 2 (high vs. low offensiveness) x 2 (normatively unjustified vs. normatively justified) manipulation. I expected that higher subjective ambivalence would be most strongly related to lower intergroup empathy and collective guilt when there are the strongest justifications for bias expression, and that lower intergroup empathy and collective guilt would lead to less opposition to anti-gay bullying. Higher subjective ambivalence predicted less anti-gay bullying opposition. After accounting for positivity and negativity, the direct effect of subjective ambivalence was no longer significant, yet subjective ambivalence uniquely predicted intergroup empathy, which in turn predicted less anti-gay bullying opposition.\nThese findings provide evidence that subjective ambivalence is largely negative in nature, but also presents evidence for a unique component of subjective ambivalence (separate from univalent attitudes) associated with‚Ä¶",

      "title": "Reducing Racism, Sexism, and Homophobia in College Students by Completing a Psychology of Prejudice Course",
      "abstract": "Students enrolled in Psychology of Prejudice and Introductory Psychology courses completed measures of racism, sexism, and attitudes toward homosexuals at the beginning and end of the term. We predicted that those who took part in the Psychology of Prejudice class would have significantly reduced prejudice as a result of the course experience. We also predicted that the Introductory Psychology students would show a minimal decrease in prejudice. As predicted, students in the prejudice class showed significant decreases in prejudice, while the introductory psychology students did not. Course involvement was related to greater prejudice reduction in two prejudice areas, but course grade was not related to prejudice reduction. We discuss the implications for prejudice reduction through class activities and education. ********** Prejudice is a serious issue that has perpetually faced humankind. Allport (1979) defined prejudice as a feeling, favorable or unfavorable, toward a person or thing, prior to, or not based on, actual experience (p. 6). Prejudice is unusually negative and causes individuals to form preconceived notions of groups, assuming that all group members are the same. People's perceptions of others are filtered through their previous experiences and attitudes. Therefore, it is important to consider the outgroup as well as the individual when studying prejudice. Psychologists have studied the causes and consequences of prejudice and have developed effective prejudice reduction techniques based on education and experience. School-based interventions have shown that talking about race and racial attitudes and focusing on internal attributions instead of race can reduce prejudice (Aboud & Fenwick, 1999). Cognition, affect, and behavior all play a role in students transferring what they learn in the classroom to the real world, and students can find ways to reduce prejudice on an interpersonal level (Harris, 2003). Multicultural education and diversity appreciation training has been effective in reducing prejudice among counseling trainees (Kiselica, Maben & Locke, 1999). Students who took part in a prejudice and conflict seminar had significantly lower anti-Black attitudes when compared with other students who had not taken the seminar (Rudman & Ashmore, 2001). In college, attitudes toward homosexuals improved with the amount of college education (Schellenberg, Hirt, & Sears, 1999) and students who completed a diversity course reported less racism and greater intergroup tolerance than those who did not take the course (Hogan & Mallott, 2005). Individual-oriented techniques have been found to reduce contemporary prejudice. These techniques help individuals recognize the contradictions in their own personality and behavior, and therefore, become more tolerant of people of different groups. Intergroup approaches also help prejudiced people to realize that individuals comprising different groups are not homogeneous and begin to realize that each group is as assorted and diverse as their own. Recognizing the foundation of prejudice helps to reduce prejudice through intervention techniques (Dovidio & Gaertnet, 1999). Along these same lines, forcing people to be aware of their hypocrisy seems to be effective in reducing prejudice. Making people feel guilty and uncomfortable with their racism has been found to reduce aversive racists' prejudice towards Asians, although the hypocrisy technique did not seem to be as effective for those who were considered to be low in prejudice (Son Hing, Li, & Zanna, 2002). Research shows that ingroup prejudice can be reduced through educational programs dealing with diversity. We were interested in the effects Psychology of Prejudice and Introductory Psychology courses have on racism, sexism, and homosexual attitudes in college students. In addition, we were interested in the relations between course outcomes, course involvement and prejudice reduction. ‚Ä¶",

Cross-Cultural Interactions Cross-Cultural Interactions In An American Day Care Setting Since the early 1970's, increased attention has been focused on understanding the dynamics and determinants of peer interaction. In a major review of peer relations, Hartup (1983) credits such interest to the acknowledgement that peers are a significant force in the socialization process. Not only are children exposed to peers at earlier ages for longer periods of time, but children are also responsive to, and interested in, peers at ages much earlier than was once believed. Howes (1988), for example, found that social interaction among young toddlers (between the ages of 13 and 24 months) was characterized by complementarity as well as reciprocity--the ability to exchange roles and turns within the context of play. In addition, young toddlers were able to form stable and emotionally responsive friendships. The recognition of the precocity of preschool peer interaction has led to a number of interesting findings that incorporate several factors influencing the ways young children relate to one another. For example,",

      "abstract": "Although theorists acknowledge that beliefs about emotions may play a role in age-related emotion behavior, no research has explored these beliefs. This research examined beliefs about the experience and expression of emotions across the life span, especially across the adult years.Younger and older adults rated the extent to which infants, children, adolescents, young adults, middle-aged adults, and older adults were likely to experience and express a range of emotions.Younger and older adults held similar beliefs about the course of emotions across the life span. Moreover, these beliefs differed across emotion categories. In particular, although older adults were believed to experience and express fewer highly charged, negative emotions, they were expected to be more likely to experience and express positive, low arousal emotions, as well as negative, low arousal emotions. The experience and expression of positive, high arousal emotions were seen as more characteristic of very young age groups as opposed to older age groups.These findings beg questions about if and how beliefs about emotion may affect age-related emotion regulation strategies and other everyday emotion-focused behaviors, as well as social reactions to older adults observed experiencing and expressing particular types of emotions.",

      "abstract": "It has been argued that stereotype priming (response times are faster for stereotypical word pairs, such as black-poor, than for non-stereotypical word pairs, such as black-balmy) is partially a function of biases in the belief system inherent in the culture. In three priming experiments, we provide direct evidence for this position, showing that stereotype priming effects associated with race, gender, and age can be very well explained through objectively measured associative co-occurrence of prime and target in the culture: (a) once objective associative strength between word pairs is taken into account, stereotype priming effects disappear; (b) the relationship between response time and associative strength is identical for social primes and non-social primes. The correlation between associative-value-controlled stereotype priming and self-report measures of racism, sexism, and ageism is near zero. The racist/sexist/ageist in all of us appears to be (at least partially) a reflection of the surrounding culture.",

This clinical study with 30 middle-years couples provides some preliminary hypotheses and tentative conceptualizations. The outstanding characteristic of these couples is that they devoted little time or energy to their marital and sexual relationships. A dysfunctional or dissatisfied sexual relationship can undermine and devitalize the marital relationship. An alternative conceptualization of the role sexuality plays in middle years marriages is presented. The functions of sexuality include: 1) A shared pleasure which serves as a reinforcer; 2) Being emotionally closer and more intimate; and 3) As a tension reducer.",

Attachment theory was used as a framework for examining individual differences in the ways in which people experience and express jealousy. Emotional, behavioral, and cognitive concomitants of romantic jealousy were related to differences in attachment style in ways consistent with attachment theory. For example, anxious participants were relatively more likely than others to resist expressing their anger, avoidant participants were especially likely to turn their anger and blame against the interloper, and securely attached participants were especially likely to express anger toward the partner and to maintain their relationship. Differences in attachment style, not just differences in level of security, are predictive of qualitative individual differences in jealousy experiences.",

After spinal cord injury (SCI), the modification of neurologic control and its consequences on reproductive organs have been extensively described in humans. Globally, sexual satisfaction decreases but sexuality remains a major concern, specifically after the first year following the injury.1 Moreover, recovery of sexual function is the major concern of paraplegic patients before locomotion,2 after the acute rehabilitation phase. For these specific sequelae/ complications we have to keep in mind that the majority of patients are male and young.3 The impact of the neurologic lesion and its physiologic consequences must be balanced by the fact that the quality of life with respect to sexuality after spinal cord lesion concerns more the relationship with a partner and mental well-being rather than the preservation of sexual ability.1,4 In clinical practice it is well known that this population have specific problems such as dissociation between sensation, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm. Such dissociation is only seen in cases of neurologic lesion. Erection can be improved by several treatments, but sensation is not modified, and furthermore the ability to ejaculate during intercourse is not improved by any of the available treatments.",

      "abstract": "The quintessential feature of on-off relationships is the experience of both breakups and renewals. This chapter reviews how breakups and post-dissolution relationships are different for on-off partners as compared to those who have not experienced a renewal. Few differences emerged between the two relationship types in terms of breakup experiences. However, although on-off partners did not report any greater breakup distress, they did report more contact with their former partners, and did so for reasons related to continued attraction, sexual access, and practical reasons (e.g., having children together) more than non-cyclical partners. Using data that tracked ex-partners for several months, this chapter also reports initial findings on what predicts renewals for those with and without a history of relationship cycling. In general, first renewals were predicted by not wanting the breakup and perceiving a lack of alternatives. Renewals by those already with a history of cycling were predicted by problematic dynamics (e.g., aggression) while dating, post-dissolution sex, and having less negative experiences with the partner after the breakup. The collective of findings suggest reconciliations are best predicted by what happens after the breakup rather than by why or how the breakup occurred.",

In Study 1, men viewed more erotica than did women, supporting a gender‚Äêtyping interpretation that legitimizes erotica enjoyment for men but condemns it for women. In Study 2, gender was a situational variable; men viewed erotica while alone, with a female co‚Äêparticipant, or with a male co‚Äêparticipant. As expected, female (but not male) presence inhibited men's enjoyment, suggesting that the female presence was associated with negative sentiments about erotica. In Study 3, the co‚Äêparticipants explicitly expressed either a positive or negative sentiment about pornography. As predicted, only these expressed sentiments influenced erotica enjoyment; the gender‚Äêbased norms were no longer salient. Overall, the findings suggest that erotica enjoyment is a gender‚Äêtyped behavior and that a man's enjoyment is influenced by both predisposition and normative situational cues.",

      "title": "Unrequited Love",
      "abstract": "Unrequited love is the love felt by one person towards another but is not reciprocated. Several typologies have been developed, however studies often do not distinguish between differing relationships (e.g., strangers, acquaintances, friends). Unrequited love relationships are less emotionally intense than equal-love relationships. If one falls upward (falls in love with someone with higher mate appeal), that person is not likely to reciprocate one's love and that love will be unrequited. In addition, unrequited love can be a 'false start' on the path to a mutual-love relationship. Research suggests that the pursuer/rejected and the target/rejecter of unrequited love have substantially different perspectives on the situation. Pursuers look back on the episode with both positive and intensely negative emotions, whereas rejecters are more uniformly negative in their accounts. Rejectors and rejected persons also differ in their guilt, self-esteem, and perceptions of persistence. Some dyads can maintain a friendship after the rejection, depending of variables such as prior commitment and current friendship maintenance behaviours. Unfortunately, unrequited love sometimes leads rejected pursuers to engage in negative relationship behaviours, including stalking-related behaviours.",

      "abstract": "In this survey of literature on the subject, we discuss the question of whether or not and if so to what extent a mature, adult ability to love depends on relevant early experience, or whether it functions as a corrective to unfavorable emotional experience in early childhood. There is no compelling connection between certain disturbances of partner relations and concrete family circumstances in the first years of life. Such disturbances are regarded by traditional psychoanalysis as the result of an unresolved infantile conflict; however, since there is no psychoanalytical interaction theory for the description and explanation of interpersonal phenomena, recent discussions have drawn increasingly on a systematic approach. From a historical point of view, psychoanalytical discussions reflect essential changes in theories about the ability to love. More recent empirical studies point to a possible involvement of corrective and compensatory mechanisms for unfavorable early experiences of a medium degree of seriousness. Nevertheless, warm affection based on needs during the first years of life (at best from loving parents with a partner-oriented relationship) provides a basis for the adult's ability to love and form partnerships.",

Multilevel models revealed that individuals viewed certain close familial ties (e.g., spouse, son or daughter, parent, sibling) with greater ambivalence than they viewed more distal family ties, friendships, or acquaintances. Participants classified more acquaintances than other relationships as solely problematic. Feeling closer to a social partner was associated with increased ambivalence. Older adults were more likely to classify their relationships as solely close than as ambivalent, in comparison with younger adults. Discussion focuses on tension and closeness in familial and nonfamilial relationships.",

Like all interpersonal behaviors, affectionate communication has biological and physiological antecedents, consequences, and correlates, many of which have implications for physical health and wellness. Investigating these factors within a biological framework allows for the adjudication of influences beyond those attributable to the environment. In particular, there are observable genetic and neurological differences between individuals with a highly affectionate disposition and those less prone to communicating affection, suggesting that variance in the tendency to engage in affectionate behavior is not entirely the result of environmental influences such as enculturation, parenting, and media exposure. In addition, the expression of affection is associated with markers of immune system competence and appears to help the body to relax and remain calm. The biological effects of affectionate communication are perhaps most pronounced in situations involving either acute or chronic stress. Specifically, highly affectionate individuals are less likely than others to overreact physiologically to stress-inducing events. Whatever stress reaction they do mount is better regulated than among their less affectionate counterparts. Moreover, highly affectionate individuals‚Äîor simply those who receive expressions of affection prior to or immediately following a stressful situation‚Äîexhibit faster physiological recovery from their elevated stress. Perhaps unsurprisingly, therefore, being deprived of adequate affectionate communication is predictive of multiple physical and psychological detriments, including elevated stress and exacerbated depression, social and relational problems, insecure attachment, susceptibility to diagnosed anxiety and mood disorders, susceptibility to diagnosed secondary immune disorders, chronic pain, and sleep disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Sex differences in the brain are reflected in behavior and in the risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. The fetal brain develops in the male direction due to a direct effect of testosterone on the developing neurons, or in the female direction due to the absence of such a testosterone surge. Because sexual differentiation of the genitals takes place earlier in intrauterine life than sexual differentiation of the brain, these two processes can be influenced independently of each other. Gender identity (the conviction of belonging to the male or female gender), sexual orientation (heterosexuality, homosexuality, or bisexuality), pedophilia, sex differences in cognition, and the risks for neuropsychiatric disorders are programmed into our brains during early development. There is no proof that postnatal social environment has any crucial effect on gender identity or sexual orientation. Structural and functional sex differences in brain areas, together with changes in sex hormone levels and their receptors in development and adulthood, are closely related to sex differences in behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders. Knowing that such a relationship exists may help bring about sex-specific therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "In self-report questionnaires, men report higher scores than women on variables such as desire for sex, frequency of sexual thoughts, number of sex partners, etc. Based on this, men are considered to have a higher level of sexual motivation than women. However, retrospective self-reports may be unsuitable for estimations of the inherent level of sexual motivation. We review data on automatic (unconsciously controlled) responses and measures of implicit motivation during exposure to sexual stimuli. These responses and measures are inaccessible to willful manipulations and make it possible to determine whether the sex difference in answers to questionnaires is replicated when volitional response manipulations are unlikely. We complement the human data with observations from some rodent and non-human primate species. The attentional resources allotted to stimuli with sexual relevance as well as genital responses to such stimuli are similar in men and women. Measures of implicit motivation also fail to detect any sex difference. Finally, the frequency of masturbation is superior in female infants before the age at which social expectations begin to determine behavior. Neither in rodents nor in non-human primates is there any clear-cut evidence for sex differences in motivation. It seems that males and females are similar with regard to the intensity of sexual motivation. The responses to questionnaires may be affected by social learning of sexual scripts and/or the inferior quality of sexual experiences in women, among other things.",

Hence, the reasons for, and circumstances of, sexual homicide differ from one offender to another. Still, subgroups of sexual homicide offenders are currently defined in terms of a fairly limited combination of risk factors. The purpose of this chapter is to suggest that neuropsychological/neurological assessments may help in confirming the presence (or absence) and severity of key risk factors in sexual homicide offenders. Based on data obtained with other types of offenders, it will be argued that using a few targeted neuropsychological tasks, and low-cost electroencephalography, would help evaluate pivotal factors in sexual homicide offenders, such as empathy, impulsivity, deviant sexual interests, social cognition, proclivity for outbursts and rage, and intelligence. These evaluations should help not only in confirming the presence of these neurologically related traits, but also in determining objectively the therapeutic effects (or lack thereof) of these specific factors in a given individual (e.g. higher empathy, lower impulsivity).",

      "abstract": "Abstract As prenatal genetic testing technologies have become both easier and more accessible, women are increasingly choosing prenatal genetic testing for a reason that is largely unexamined in the clinical literature: preparation. This reasoning, offered not only from pregnant women but frequently from testing laboratories and health care providers, reflects long‚Äêheld assumptions that prenatal genetic results‚Äîproperly delivered and followed with information, clinical surveillance, and/or social supports‚Äîprepare families for a child with a genetic condition, and even improve health and social outcomes for children and families. But these assumptions remain unexamined, since there are no clear definitions or recommendations for prenatal preparation. Preparation may refer to several overlapping ways in which prenatal information may change parents' approach to the rest of the pregnancy, including: (a) clinical activities, including surveillance, interventions, and delivery planning; (b) social and informational support, such as interacting with patient support groups and gathering information about quality of life; and (c) psychological ‚Äúcoping‚Äù or adjustments to the reality of raising a child with a genetic condition. These meanings and activities intersect and influence one another and form a foundation for postnatal family adaptation, but they are rarely parsed out in studies examining the impact of prenatal diagnosis. Based on previous work delineating conceptual models as middle terms between theory and reality, we are building a conceptual model that incorporates an empirical understanding of meanings and actions encompassed by prenatal preparation. Comparing diverse families' expectations with the resources they are offered can identify (mis)matches between priorities and approaches.",

The purpose of this study was to understand what behaviors are typically considered to be masturbation as well as the situational and individual variables that may affect the labeling of a behavior as such. An online study of 564 individuals demonstrated that a wide variety of behaviors were considered to be masturbation by a majority of participants. No difference was found between men and women in the total number of behaviors labeled as masturbation. Both men and women were more likely to label a behavior as masturbation (1) if there was no sexual partner present than if there was and (2) if an orgasm occurred than if it did not. In addition, women were more likely than men to label a behavior as masturbation if they were alone and if no orgasm occurred. Younger age was associated with labeling more behaviors as masturbation, but sexual identity, self-pleasuring experience, partnered sexual experience, and attitudes toward masturbation were not related to the number of behaviors labeled as masturbation. Results speak to the importance of behavioral specificity when discussing masturbation with students, clients, and in sex research.",

While attribution patterns vary across sex, age, dysfunction status, and generations, to date no studies have investigated how they might vary across cultures. We compared attribution patterns of (presumed) heterosexual/cisgender Pakistani women with varying levels of orgasmic difficulty (OD) on hypothetical scenarios presenting either positive or negative partnered sexual outcomes, with attributions to four possible targets: self, husband, situation, and relationship. Similar to previous research using Western samples, Pakistani women with greater OD were more likely than non-OD counterparts to blame themselves and their partners for negative sexual experiences. In contrast with prior research, for Pakistani women, attributions were distributed widely across all targets, including relationship factors (e.g., compatibility and communication). Specifically, Pakistani women tied their explanations for both positive and negative sexual outcomes more strongly to assessment of their relationship with their husband. The way in which women with sexual difficulties in non-Western cultures interpret their sexual experiences suggests the need for remediation strategies sensitive to socio-sexual scripts of the culture.",

      "abstract": "Social exposures and their impact on mental health has proven hard to capture, partly owing to the complex and multifaceted nature of the social reality. Sexual harassment and sexual violence (SHV) are no exceptions. SHV can be conceptualized as a continuum of negative sexual experiences whose severity varies depending on multiple determinants (type of SHV, frequency, power relations, etc.). Further, exposure to SHV may be conceptualized either as discrete exposures (i.e., experiences of specific SHV events) or as exposure to a sexually hostile environment, often represented by a latent variable reflected by patters of SHV events. With any of these conceptualizations, SHV constitutes a broad construct containing many kinds of negative experiences. The ambiguity of SHV pose a challenge when attempting to determine its mental health consequences, as different forms of SHV may vary in terms of their mental health impact. In this article we use the potential outcomes framework to discuss the conceptualization of SHV in relation to mental health outcomes, focusing on the consistency condition. We discuss limitations and possible interpretations of estimates of the causal effect of SHV on mental health, both when SHV are conceptualized as discrete exposures and when conceptualized as one or several latent variables. We present the recently developed multiple versions of treatment theory and show how it can provide a formal interpretation of causal estimates under ambiguous exposures. Lastly, we provide suggestions on how the increase the clarity and interpretability of estimates of the effects of SHV on mental health, by increasing the precision of the causal questions and the use of more specific definitions of SHV exposures.",

      "abstract": "Expressions of sadness and anger during a romantic relationship conflict can have distinct impacts on partners‚Äô feelings of closeness and perceptions of conflict resolution. For example, previous research with younger couples suggests that expressions of sadness can help partners feel closer to one another, while expressions of anger tend to harm closeness and short-term conflict resolution. However, research has not considered whether older couples differ in their responses to sadness and anger expression during conflict, despite different theories of aging which suggest that older adults may be better or worse at regulating negative emotion in their relationships than younger adults. The current study (N = 280 dating and married couples, 30-88 years old) tested whether age buffers or exacerbates the effects of observed emotional expression (sadness or anger) on partners‚Äô perceptions of closeness and conflict resolution. Contrary to the pre-registered hypotheses derived from theories of aging and emotion, no significant age differences in partners‚Äô responses to sadness or anger expressions emerged. Expressions of sadness were also not significantly related to perceptions of closeness or conflict resolution. However, consistent with previous research, expressions of anger negatively related to both partners‚Äô perceptions of closeness and conflict resolution. The present findings extend previous research by testing whether expressions of sadness and anger have distinct impacts at multiple stages of the lifespan. Additionally, the non-significant age differences contribute to a growing literature which identifies contexts where age differences in responses to negative emotional expression may be less likely to emerge.",

Juvenile sex offenders (N = 34) were identified among a sample of chronic violent offenders (N = 242) from official records and face-to-face interviews. Juvenile sex offenders were 14. 1 percent of the sample. Sex offenders more often lived with their birth parents while violent offenders often lived in single parent families. Sex offenders had fewer nonviolent offenses, but more often had been incarcerated. Sex offenders had lower self-reported delinquency, fewer drug and alcohol problems, and less often were gang members. Their families, their sib lings and friends had less justice system involvement. However, sex offenders more often came from families with spousal violence, child abuse, and child sexual molestation, according to both official and self reports. They appear to be more sexually and socially isolated, less often have girlfriends or report sexual activity, interest or experience. They had stronger beliefs in the law, but fewer internal behavioral controls. Juve nile sex offenders appear to be a \"hidden\" population, more closely resembling normative populations than delinquent populations on a vari ety of social factors and attitudinal variables. Further research is needed on broader populations of sex offenders to expand and validate these preliminary findings.",

      "abstract": "In discussing the psychological aspects of natural family planning (NFP) focus is on males and females experiencing difficulty and the problems unique to the interaction of the couple and not primarily due to their separate personalities. Men who experience the most difficulty are those in whom a rich emotional life is either missing or deficient. This has particular application to Australian men who appear to be more affectively restricted as a national group than either their English or American counterparts. Tender affection and the raw expression of sexuality can be considered as 2 linked sides of a scale kept in balance. Men who lack the capacity to both give and receive tenderness tend to feel that they need more rather than less sexual outlet. Boys in whom gestures of affection toward parents siblings and peers are discouraged after puberty tend to become those men for whom sexual continence is most difficult. Their mode of approach to life consists of 2 poparities -- the intellectual and the physical -- with the middle emotional aspect usually missing or stunted. Many men are basically insecure about their masculine identity. Consequently sex becomes a means of overcompensating for other deficiencies in the sense of being manly. Despite recent relevations from womens magazines and sex researchers most wives are not yet disposed to think of themselves as as much in need of coitus as their husbands. There is a striking exception to this i.e. the pumpkin eater syndrome. This refers to a dwindling but appreciable minority of wives who pay verbal homage to abstinence but seductively invite impregnation because they only feel complete or secure as persons when constantly conceiving or carrying babis. 1 difficult example of a problem peculiar to the interaction of the couple is that many men suffer from the problem of premature ejaculation which it si alleged a period of abstinence aggravates. The wife responds to this with mingled feelings of guilt and resentment which eventually outweigh her initial sympathy. Many of the problems in family planning can be reduced at the outset by sound premarital sex education particularly in relation to the psychological aspects of sexuality.",

      "title": "Unwanted escalation of sexual intimacy: Male and female perceptions of connotations and relational consequences of resistance messages",
      "abstract": "In heterosexual dating situations, males sometimes attempt levels of sexual intimacy that exceed the threshold desired by the female partner. For the woman, these situations often are extremely unpleasant. Most explanations of these episodes assume that the offending male has ignored or disregarded the messages by which his partner has indicated her resistance to escalated intimacy. The present study supports an explanation whereby males do not understand certain sexual resistance messages to indicate resistance. Indeed, it appears that the resistance messages most often used by some women are the least understood by most men. This suggests that unwanted sexual escalation efforts might be minimized if men were to better understand women's resistance messages, and/or if women were to use the clearer messages. Ironically, the resistance messages that males understand best happen to be messages that often are avoided by women because of anticipated relational consequences. The study suggests, however, that males perceive these relational consequences as very unlikely outcomes of resistance messages. The study has implications for a communication‚Äêbased explanation of unwanted sexual escalation behaviors, and has pragmatic implications for reducing the frequency of these episodes via the reduction of certain male/female misunderstandings.",

      "title": "Sex, drugs and escape: A psychological model of HIV-risk sexual behaviours",
      "abstract": "Abstract Abstract The lack of an effective HIV vaccine or other biomedical intervention means that behavioural change will continue to be critical to the prevention of HIV infection. Despite near universal knowledge of HIV and sexual safety, and widespread intentions to be safe, rates of unprotected sex and HIV sero-conversion remain high among gay and bisexual men. Explanatory models that link risk-taking and prevention to rational processes such as knowledge, social norms, behavioural intentions, or perceived vulnerability to infection, cannot fully account for the continued risk behaviours observed in virtually all cohorts of gay men. We feel that innovative conceptions of risk and risk prevention are needed, that emphasize non-rational, affective processes in risk-taking and decision-making. Consistent with recent models from social psychology, we propose that for many people sexual risk does not stem from a lack of community norms or personal standards, but from a desire to escape cognitive awareness of very rigorous norms and standards. Being self-aware of HIV risk arouses anxiety and precludes highly-desired activities: fatigue, fatalism, or other negative affect over HIV may lead people to 'cognitively disengage' within the sexual situation, and not to follow their norms or intentions toward safety. We propose that both substance use and the approach of high stimulation or other sexual settings facilitates this cognitive disengagement, wherein people enact 'automatic' sexual scripts and or become more responsive to external pressures toward risk. We briefly review current psychosocial models of HIV risk behaviour, outline a cognitive escape model with particular emphasis on substance use as a behavioural risk factor, and discuss implications of an escape model for behavioural interventions among gay and bisexual men.",

      "abstract": "A field study of the normal tactile interpersonal behaviors of forty-five motherchild pairs in a public, recreational setting. No phase of high tactile contact between mothers and children was evident. Mothers met the children's basic needs for food, tactile comfort and safety. All mothers gave less tactile communication to their youngest children than they gave to their just-walking ones. Tactile contact declined from this peak on. Mothers were most active in the areas of Control and Nursing; much less frequent were Play, Affection, Comfort, and Anger. Most of the childinitiated contacts were of the affectionate attachment kind. Tactile communication has been a relatively neglected area of psychological interest, yet it plays a crucial role in all human relationships. It appears to be biologically essential to the human being in the first four months of life; throughout the life cycle it is physically and psychologically useful in returning the individual to normal functioning after experiencing stress; and finally, it is the main avenue through which the human need for intimacy and acceptance is satisfied. The lack of interest in this fundamental modality can be viewed as an indication of a number of American attitudes. For example, there is the American preoccupation with words and with the articulated part of our culture; there is also the lack of concern with the subject of happiness as compared with the volume of problem literature; and finally, there is the attitude of prudery and anxiety about sexual matters which carries over into the tactile area because of the relationship between touch and sex.",

      "abstract": "You should consider the possibility of sexual abuse when evaluating a child with a traumatic or infectious genital lesion. As will be discussed, certain lesions are highly specific for sexual abuse while others may be nonspecific or more consistent with a medical disorder or accidental injury. It is important to remember that the vast majority of children disclosing sexual abuse do not have physical evidence of injury or infection on examination. Sexual abuse describes involvement of children and adolescents in developmentally inappropriate sexual activities to which they are unable to consent and which they cannot comprehend. Violent assault causing severe injuries is the exception in child sexual abuse, as sexual abusers often exploit the power differential between victim and perpetrator to manipulate children into complying with sexual activity.",

      "abstract": "Young adulthood is characterized by an increased focus on serious, long-term relationships. Stressors such as negative communication within couples can impede the enactment of pro-social, relationship maintenance behaviors, which may be especially salient for Latinx young adults who place importance on personal relationships. Familism, a cultural value that emphasizes supportive bonds and a cognitive orientation towards maintaining relationships, may protect against negative communication by inspiring more prosocial responding. In a sample of 475 Latinx young adults (M = 24.8 years, SD = 3.22), I found that negative communication (e.g., partners' propensity to withdrawal or criticize during interactions) was inversely associated with individuals' own relationship maintenance enactment (e.g., affectionate and supportive efforts to sustain the relationship). However, familism buffered the association between negative communication and relationship maintenance; in instances of low familism, participants who observed more negative communication reported fewer relationship maintenance behaviors. Conversely, under conditions of high familism, the association between negative communication and relationship maintenance was no longer significant. Findings reinforce the negative effects of maladaptive communication in relationships more broadly and highlight the protective role of cultural values for Latinx relationships.",

      "title": "Sexuality among elderly patients with dementia: Are we aware of their needs?",
      "abstract": "Introduction Sexuality is one of the basic needs in human life and its positive effects for the wellbeing are undeniable. People with dementia, despite cognition and functioning impairments, still pursue intimacy as part of their expression of basic human instincts. Objectives We aim to address the subject of sexuality among patients with dementia, emphasizing the physiological, environmental and legal barriers. Methods We conduct a non-systematic review of recent evidence on dementia and sexuality, using PubMed/Medline database. Results People with dementia face several difficulties expressing their sexuality. First, they struggle with physiological barriers to enjoyment of sexuality, such as ageism, apathy and limited free mobility. Secondly, either at home or in long-term care facilities, privacy is usually abolished. For care facilities, the Sexuality Assessment Tool supports the normalization of sexuality and self-audit policies that promote resident rights for privacy and assistance. Moreover, expression of sexuality in elderly can be misinterpreted as disinhibition, leading to unnecessary use of psychotropics to cease these behaviors. Additionally, legal barriers regarding consent arise when a partner loses the ability to consent sexual activity, questioning agreement and mutual desire. The Lichtenberg and Strzepek Decision Tree for Capacity to Participate in Intimate Relationships can be helpful to address this issue. Conclusions Sexuality in older people remains neglected in clinical intervention. Besides the urgent need to deconstruct stereotypes, families and staff must be sensitized to understand the changes in expression and perception of sexuality among people with dementia, rather than being indifferent or medicate what can be perceived as disinhibited/distorted expressions of normal needs.

More freedom, and decrease of sexual inhibition, has implications both in the cases of men who tend to make split object choices and in those who fear intimacy and merging experiences with the object. Feminine sexuality has been considered the obscure area of psychoanalytic theorisations, as though everything regarding masculine sexuality had, instead, been totally clarified. During the years in which transformations in sexual habits were developing, \"unisex\"‚Äîif the author uses a more or less wild analogy‚Äîseemed to have become equivalent to \"egalite, liberte, fraternite\". She returns to the point from which her reflections started, namely to the attempt to understand the underlying vicissitudes of male sexuality. Sexuality in its more mature, genital expressions includes sensuality as the earliest phases of \"affection\", but entails the emergence of object-directed libidinal and aggressive drives.",

      "abstract": "Romance is not only difficult in primary reality but also in the secondary reality of videogames. It especially applies to writing and designing interactive romances in a believable way that allows for a realistic rendering of a character‚Äôs romantic life and sexual identity. This chapter will reflect on the player‚Äôs possibilities for romantic interactions with non-player-characters (NPCs) in videogames. It will also discuss the lack of risk of failure when conquering someone‚Äôs heart. As Mitu Khandaker-Kokoris states this is not only ethically questionable, but also a flawed representation of the real world. BioWare‚Äôs most recent role playing game (RPG) Dragon Age: Inquisition (DA:I) seeks out a new approach to simulating romances and flirting, as NPCs are given their own sexual identities. While other games, like Mass Effect 3, have already done that, they mostly prevent any romance options right away if the NPC is not interested. In DA:I, NPCs express and (to some extent) live their sexual identities. When talking to a non-interested NPC, the player is still given dedicated romance-options during conversations. However now it is possible that the player character‚Äôs advances are refused, even though the NPC might be romanceable by a different main character. For what seems to be the first time, players are exposed to an extensive pool of romantic and sexual choices while their agency is consciously limited.",

      "title": "Applying a Pattern-Centered Approach to Understanding How Attachment, Gender Beliefs, and Homosociality Shape College Men's Sociosexuality",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although early research and the popular press have characterized college men as universal beneficiaries of uncommitted sex, emerging research notes considerable variability in men's sociosexuality (i.e., uncommitted sexual beliefs, desires, and behaviors). This study examined how diversity in sociosexuality is tied to the ways in which attachment orientations, conformity to masculinity norms, and homosocial engagement (i.e., nonromantic same-sex bonds) are organized across individuals. Latent profile analysis of 495 college males (ages 17 to 25, 62% White, 83.5% heterosexual) detected five subgroups: Fully Unrestricted (10% of sample; high on sociosexuality and conformity to masculinity norms); Cognitively Unrestricted (36%; comparable to Fully Unrestricteds but low on sociosexual behavior), Fully Restricted (30%; opposite on all constructs when compared to Fully Unrestricteds); Avoidant (16%; similar to Fully Restricteds but with greater attachment avoidance); and Discrepant (8%; above average on sociosexual behavior but discordant within and across constructs). There were notable demographic, personality, and behavioral differences among the subgroups (e.g., nearly 50% of the Discrepants self-identified as sexual minorities; Fully Restricteds were the most religious; Avoidants were the most shy). Findings indicate that college men's sociosexuality is highly nuanced and suggest the need for additional work to understand how attachment, masculinity norms, and homosociality shape men's sexual relationships.

The respondent-driven sample was also significantly older than the subject pool sample. However, method of recruitment was not significantly related to subgroup membership. *Participant reported having engaged in either vaginal or anal sex. 2Although it is possible that these values overlap, together they provide an estimate of level and frequency of uncommitted sex and new sex partners. The structure of this measure is similar to other measures used to assess discrete risk behaviors, such as alcohol consumption (e.g., Johnston, O'Malley, Bachman, & Schulenberg,, Citation2008). 3This conceptualization may not accurately reflect the level of sexual experience for sexual-minority participants who, for multiple reasons, might not engage in vaginal or anal sex. However, because virginity status is used here as a correlate and not a central behavioral outcome, this conceptualization does not represent a significant limitation. a Significantly different from b, c, d. b Significantly different from a, c, d, etc. ‚Ä°Participant reports having engaged in either vaginal or anal sex. ‚Ä°Participant reports having engaged in either vaginal or anal sex. * p < .05. **p < .01. ***p < .001.",

      "abstract": "Women high in alienation may in a sense be victimized by a higher probability of having unwanted pregnancies than women low in alienation. From this perspective high alienation may be concomitant with a sense of (at most) going through the motions of family planning with a rather low confidence that ones ability will suffice to achieve the desired goal and a tendency therefore not to be particularly involved in the mechanisms of family planning. High alienation in its separate and combined aspects may constitute a highly salient social psychological obstacle of the probability of acting with confidence in the emotionally charged area of fertility and family planning behavior. The major control relevant implication is that ineffective family planning may derive not only from lack of knowledge or of access to methods but also from the social psychological inaccessibility of knowledge generating a dominance of emotional over rational elements in the decision making process.

A Polish sample of 565 participants aged between 18 and 57 was tested. In females, regardless of chronotype, the greatest need for sex occurred between 18:00 and 24:00, but a secondary peak appeared only in morning types at 6:00‚Äì9:00. In males, the greatest need for sex occurred either in the morning or evening hours: in evening types at 9:00‚Äì12:00 and 18:00‚Äì3:00; in neither types at 6:00‚Äì9:00 and 18:00‚Äì24:00; in morning types at 6:00‚Äì12:00 and 18:00‚Äì24:00. Considering time of day when subjects were undertaking sexual activity most frequently, this appeared between 18:00 and 24:00 for all the participants, and prolonged until 3:00 at night in evening type males. Morningness preference was more strongly related to the timing of need for sex than to the timing of actual sexual activity (r = ‚àí0.275 vs. r = ‚àí0.174), while the timing of desire and the timing of sexual activity were positively, but moderately related (r = 0.320).",

Canonical correlation yielded two orthogonal patterns between the avoidance and anxiety scores with individual, demographic, and family variables. Relationship avoidance was most parsimoniously related to unresolved issues with one's family of origin, having been sexually abused, and being male (canonical correlation = .33). Relationship anxiety was most parsimoniously related to unresolved issues with one's family of origin, lack of personal income, having a strong libido, being young, and being female (canonical correlation = .25). Relationship avoidance was also correlated with not having affectionate and available parents, not having a secure and loving family, high parental conflict, low parental education and income, not having grown up with both parents, family violence, and low libido. Relationship anxiety was also correlated with low personal education. Marital status, ethnicity, and religious denomination were unrelated to either construct.",

Adapun gangguan reproduksi pada usia subur salah satunya adalah infertile. Infertile adalah keadaan dimana pasangan suami istri yang sudah menikah lebih dari 1 tahun dan rutin melakukan hubungan seksual tanpa alat kontrasepsi akan tetapi belum memiliki anak. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui aspek-aspek yang mempengaruhi kepuasan pernikahan pada pasangan suami istri yang mengalami infertile menggunakan metode kualitatif deskriptif dengan jenis penelitian studi kasus. Data yang diperoleh melalui wawancara dan observasi dengan jumlah informan 4 pasangan suami istri yang salah satunya mengalami infertile. Hasil dari penelitian ini menunjukkan bahwa meskipun mengalami infertile keempat pasangan suami istri yang menjadi informan merasakan kepuasan dalam pernikahan mereka karena adanya dukungan dari keluarga dan pasangan, serta tidak ada perubahan sikap dari pasangan mereka ditunjukkan dengan tetap bersikap romantis, tetap memberikan kasih sayang, dan saling membantu. Adapun aspek-aspek yang ditemukan dan berperan besar terhadap kepuasan pernikahan seluruh subyek ada enam aspek yaitu komunikasi, fleksibilitas, kedekatan, kecocokan kepribadian, relasi seksual dan pengelolaan keuangan",

      "abstract": "Having multiple identities as a homosexual American Indian or Alaska Native adolescent male increases the likelihood for poorer health and diminished well-being. This study assessed the differences in self-perceived health status between gay adolescent males and their heterosexual counterparts. A national nonrepresentative sample of 5,602 Indian and Native adolescent males was surveyed about issues of sexual behavior, physical and sexual abuse, mental health status, substance use, attitudes about school, participation in violence, and access to health care. Results indicate that there were no real differences between gay and heterosexual male respondents for substance use or attitudes about school. Statistically significant differences were found, however, in areas of mental health, as well as physical and sexual abuse. Gay adolescents were twice as likely to have thought of or attempted suicide. Gay adolescents were twice as likely to have been physically abused and nearly six times more likely to have been sexually abused. Gay American Indian or Alaska Native adolescent males constitute a very vulnerable population and are clearly in need of targeted health and social services. Unfortunately, the benefits seen by adults of the \"two-spirited\" gay and lesbian American Indian movement have not been accessible to Indian and Native adolescents.",

Typically, there is a great deal of complexity in the system of concern and uncertainty concerning the relationship between cause and effect. The reasons for this include the facts that (a) one typically encounters combinations of toxic substances, rather than single pollutants; (b) the system of concern may not in itself be clearly understood, even in the absence of chemical perturbation; and (c) data, particularly from field studies, are often incomplete. Yet, the environmental toxicologist is frequently challenged to address the effects of natural or anthropogenic perturbations, either after the fact or, ideally, in the planning stage of any human endeavour that might have an environmental impact.",

      "title": "Experiencing sexuality in the perinatal period: what are the challenges?",
      "abstract": "Introduction The perinatal period, encompassing pregnancy and the first postpartum year, is a transformative phase in a woman‚Äôs life. It involves profound physical, psychological, social, and emotional changes that can significantly impact sexual experiences. Objectives The purpose of this work is to address the challenges of experiencing sexuality during the perinatal period. Methods Evidence-based review, through research conducted on PubMed and selection of the most relevant studies, published in the last decade, using the keywords: ‚ÄúSexuality‚Äù and ‚ÄúPerinatal period‚Äù. Results Hormonal fluctuations, physical discomfort, and body image changes during pregnancy can significantly affect sexual desire and satisfaction. By the third trimester, between 83 to 100% of first-time mothers report a decrease in sexual activity. Recent studies indicate that this trend continues into the first postpartum year, with over 60% reporting decreased sexual activity. Postpartum challenges, such as physical recovery, breastfeeding, and fatigue further complicate sexual intimacy. The anticipation of parenthood and shifts in relationship dynamics also play a significant role. Societal pressures and cultural norms regarding sexuality in the perinatal period can influence personal experiences and expectations, and contribute to communication barriers between partners regarding sexual needs and concerns. Conclusions The perinatal period presents unique challenges to sexual health and intimacy. A holistic perinatal care, incorporating comprehensive sexual health education and promoting open communication between partners are crucial for addressing these challenges effectively.

      "abstract": "Extract All human beings who spend any time on this planet face the challenges of sex and affectionate love. Indeed, even if one realizes that being sexually or affectionately intimate with others is something that one neither needs nor wants, one has not thereby avoided the issue; rather, one has found a way to engage these complexities that is good for oneself. Others do not want (intimate) sexual interactions with the same partners (only); one way they address their needs and wants is to pay others for sexual experiences. It is not an exaggeration to say, however, that many or even the majority of people (also) try to realize ongoing, longer-term, intimate affectionate and sexual relations with others, and that they experience this striving as a central concern in their lives. It seems fair to say that it is in these more intimate relations many people experience some of their most precious encounters as well as some of their most devastating failures and losses. We fall in love and we fall in lust; we sometimes live together as partners, and some of us marry, and some of us have children. At the same time, we break each other's hearts, we betray each other's trust, we need each other's forgiveness, or we must learn to deal with the fact that loved ones sometimes die far too early. A theory that could account for all these ever-so-common human experiences and challenges would be an improvement to existing theories, because most theories currently on offer aspire to explain only one or selected issues.",

      "abstract": "In actual numbers the successes achieved by psychoanalytic treatment of the various forms of homosexuality, which, to be sure, are manifold, are not very striking. As a rule the homosexual is not able to give up the object of his pleasure, and one cannot convince him that if he changed to the other object he would find again the pleasure that he has renounced. The girl's inversion, however, received its final reinforcement when she found in her 'Lady' an object which promised to satisfy not only her homosexual tendency, but also that part of her heterosexual libido still attached to her brother. Homosexual enthusiasms, unduly strong friendships tinged with sensuality, are common enough in both sexes during the first years after puberty. The cases of male homosexuality in which Steinach has been successful fulfilled the condition, which is not always present, of a very patent physical 'hermaphroditism'.",

Health is both physical, mental and social well-being, and it also includes understanding sexual health. Care in the context of sexual health includes not only the issue of reproduction, but also the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of sexual dysfunction or sexually transmitted diseases. Sexual health is also one of the determinants of the quality of life and the feeling of happiness in a relationship with a partner. Human activities to satisfy \"sexual need\" are complex - they involve many different mechanisms and extend far beyond sexuality itself. Therefore, in phylogenetic terms, only in the case of the human species is eroticism that includes sexuality together with the sphere of feelings, intellect and the sphere of the psyche. Human sexuality is the sphere of emotions and behaviors aimed at sexual intercourse and is one of the basic ways of human freedom.",

      "title": "COPING ARRANGEMENT OF SPOUSES WITH EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE IN FAMILY CONFLICTS.",
      "abstract": "Along with several social institutions, the family has its unique place as the foundation of a strong state. For this reason, family problems are at the center of research in modern psychological science aimed at identifying key factors of health, well-being and a prosperous life in the family. The purpose of this work is to identify the ability of spouses to cope with family difficulties or conflict situations and to study their correspondence to the manifestations of a person's emotional intelligence as a guarantee of satisfaction and family health. At different stages of its development the family very often faces problems, for which the spouses use a conscious toolkit. Emotional intelligence, being one of the fundamental components of personality, influences the choice of a person's coping strategy in conflict situations: Studies have shown that a person's high levels of emotional intelligence (EQ or EI) have a reciprocal relationship with coping, a rational problem-solving orientation. It also leads to personal satisfaction, creating the basis for family well-being and a healthy psychological atmosphere. We can conclude that the higher a person's perception and recognition of his own and others' emotions, emotional states, the easier and faster he distinguishes between his own and others' emotional manifestations and expressions, and of course is able to freely manage them, the more a person is able to show organization when facing various difficulties, the better he can regulate actions, as well as control the current situation. As a result, the person experiences satisfaction with family life.",

Fur die hier berichtete Studie wurden 20 Manner zwischen 18 und 40 Jahren interviewt, die innerhalb von drei Monaten mindestens einmal ungeschutzten Analverkehr mit anderen Mannern hatten. Ein wesentliches Ergebnis ist, dass viele Befragte, die uber Analverkehr in Gelegenheitsbeziehungen berichteten, an Erfahrungen interessiert waren, die nicht unmittelbar die sexuelle Ebene tangierten. Wesentlich war vielmehr der Wunsch nach Bestatigung des eigenen Wertes und der eigenen physischen Attraktivitat, der Wunsch, eigenen Defiziten oder erlebter Einsamkeit zu entkommen, die Suche nach Verbundenheit und Intimitat, Verliebtheit oder die Tendenz, das Risiko als Vergnugen am Verbotenen umzudefinieren und gegen etablierte Strukturen zu rebellieren. ‚Äì In all diesen Fallen wurde die Sorge um die eigene Gesundheit und Unversehrtheit wahrend des ungeschutzten Analverkehrs ausgeblendet.

This is the reason behind the frustration of sexually energetic people with spouses who dislike having sex. In this qualitative study on a small sample of elderly married Korean people, men were found to be sexually frustrated while their wives reported marital dissatisfaction. The men persistently asked for sex with the belief that consistency of active sexual expression is important in keeping their masculinity. Although they eventually have sex with their wives, the men were found to remain sexually frustrated for over several days because of their wives' initial disregard of their sexual advances. This disregard was mainly due to the husbands' involvement in extramarital sexual affairs.",

      "abstract": "Genetic research raises ethical issues that differ in many ways from those that arise in other kinds of human subject research. Aside from the generally low likelihood of injury from drawing blood, the harms that might result to subjects once the genetic data is obtained range from minor to major, from physiological to psychosocial and even economic. Disclosure of results may cause loss or increased cost of health and/or life insurance, discrimination and stigmatization. In this presentation, I am going to discuss the issue through the followings: Privacy and confidentiality Unlike other kinds of health data, genetic information applies to or is about more than one person. (parents, siblings, children, and perhaps others). Research that includes follow-up studies requires that a subjects unique information be linked to the genetic information. For this and other reasons, many investigators seek to unlink personal identifiers from genetic data or biological specimens. Successful unlinking reduces or eliminates some threats to privacy and confidentiality. Informed consent The participant should be adequately informed. Consent should be free from coercion or undue influence. The participant should be fully competent. Risks of harm The idea of testing can cause pre- and post-test anxiety. Disclosure of results may result in employment and social bias, discrimination and stigmatization. Family members of the index subject may face similar risks of harm. The presentation also tackles the subject of research on stored biological samples and the ethical issues, with discussion of the laws and regulations applicable.",

The possibility for variation is extensive. Among males, there are boys and men whose stereotypical masculinity may pose problems in mental health and criminality. They are not the focus here. Rather, here it is the marked deviation from the mean towards the ‚Äònon-masculine‚Äô or ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô extreme. That pattern can also cause clinical concern and constitutes gender identity disorder (GID) as manifested in childhood.

      "abstract": "La sexualidad desempena un papel muy importante a lo largo de la vida, asi que no existe motivo alguno para creer que con la edad desaparecen el interes o las practicas sexuales; el placer no solo depende del aparato genital, sino tambien de toda una serie de excitaciones y actividades efectuadas desde la infancia, las cuales producen un placer que no puede reducirse a la satisfaccion de una necesidad fisiologica basica, denominada como ‚Äúnormal‚Äù en el amor sexual. Por lo general, la sociedad relaciona mas a la sexualidad con la juventud, alimentando muchos estereotipos negativos acerca de la sexualidad en la vejez. El objetivo del presente estudio es identificar los factores psicologicos y socioculturales que intervienen en la percepcion de las personas adultas mayores de 60 a 80 anos de edad que viven en el poblado de Sabancuy perteneciente al Municipio del Carmen, Campeche. Para ello se utilizo el metodo descriptivo, no experimental con alcance cualitativo, con instrumentos: ficha de identificacion, test bienestar psicologico y la satisfaccion sexual en parejas de edad adulta media y edad adulta tardia, Inventario de Autoestima de Coopersmith, version para adultos. El analisis de datos se realizo mediante un ordenador personal (PC) con herramientas tales como: manejador de bases de datos (Word) y hoja de calculo (Excel). Los sujetos objeto de estudio fueron 50 personas adultas mayores de 60 a 80 anos de edad. En los resultados se encontro que la autoestima, considerada un factor psicologico, no intervino en su percepcion de mantener una vida sexual activa, ya que la mayoria de la poblacion manifesto tener autoestima alta, aunque estos no tienen una vida sexual activa, es decir, la autoestima no influyo de manera directa en la actividad sexual de los adultos mayores investigados. Se pregunto a los adultos mayores en estudio: ?cree que es malo para la salud, especialmente en la vejez, la actividad sexual?, ante lo cual, 20 % de los hombres con rango de edad de 70 a 79 contesto en las encuestas que no es malo para la salud tener relaciones sexuales, pero que ya no lo realizan porque ya no es lo mismo; asimismo, se les pregunto si en la actualidad mantenian relaciones sexuales, y los resultados mostraron que 34 adultos mayores ya no tienen relaciones sexuales y 10 hombres si tienen relaciones sexuales aunque ya no sea con su pareja. Al preguntar a los adultos mayores si consideran necesaria la penetracion o coito para obtener satisfaccion sexual, 13 de los adultos mayores varones respondieron que consideran necesaria la penetracion para obtener satisfaccion sexual. En conclusion, la creencia de que la edad y el declinar de la actividad sexual estan inexorablemente unidos, ha provocado que no se preste atencion suficiente a una de las actividades que provee mayor calidad de vida, la sexualidad. Sin embargo, la mayoria de las personas de edad avanzada son capaces de tener relaciones y de sentir placer en toda la gama de las actividades como sucede en las personas mas jovenes.",

      "abstract": "Sexual minorities are one of the most vulnerable and marginalised groups in the society. Sero-positivity accentuates social exclusion among the sexual minorities. The article aims to appraise the factors that make Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) vulnerable to HIV infection and lead to their social exclusion. Qualitative in nature and based on fifteen in-depth case studies of HIV-infected MSM, the study is located in Delhi, India. Findings show that variables such as age, child sexual abuse, marital status and multiple sex partners, contribute to vulnerabilities of respondents. Sociocultural milieu puts structural barriers, restricting integration of MSM in the society. Culture of silence over sexual matters, notions of proving ‚Äòmanhood‚Äô through aggression and sexual violence are some of the factors that hamper healthy behaviours and relationships among the MSM. At the interpersonal level, possessiveness, betrayal, infidelity, heartbreak, strong emotional whirlpool when love‚Äìrelations go incongruent, all take a heavy toll of their mental and physical health. These variables socially exclude the sexual minorities from the mainstream life. Findings reflect both positive (disclosing to family, abstinence, spiritual growth) and negative (suicide attempts, drug use) ways of coping among the MSM respondents. Critical areas of concern for service providers while planning interventions for social inclusion and empowerment of people with sexual minority are delineated.",

This chapter suggests that the possible positive benefits of hypo-egoicism associated with experiences of transcendence may be interpreted as vertical (more common in psychology of religion) or horizontal (more common in positive psychology). However, the empirical consequences may be similar. The measurement of hypo-egoicism associated with reported mystical experiences is well established and the correlates of such experience are seldom associated with psychopathology. Likewise, that mysticism can be facilitated by appropriate set and setting circumstances and associated triggers such as isolation and chemicals suggests that hypo-egoicism is a human ability that can be facilitated among those interested in its likely positive outcomes for lives framed in terms of religion, spirituality, or both.",

      "title": "Emotional barriers to contraception.",
      "abstract": "In addition to ignorance and anticontraception beliefs it is proposed that adolescents emotional responses to sexuality may affect their use of contraception. A teenager who is somewhat anxious and ambivalent about sex will be uneasy about acquiring and using contraception while an adolescent who is emotionally more at ease about sex should also be more relaxed about obtaining and using birth control. Several hypotheses are proposed concerning the link between sex-related emotions and contraceptive behavior describing research that is pertinent to each of these assumptions and discussing possible applications of what has been learned about adolescent contraception. Data suggest that those individuals with a negative emotional response to sex may have difficulty in learning what they need to know about conception and contraception. The findings also indicate that erotophobic young adults may not accurately anticipate future intercourse and this may prevent them from taking contraceptive precautions in advance. Erotophobic individuals appear to find discussion of sexual topics aversive and hold relatively negative attitudes about birth control; they are inconsistent contraceptive users. Across a series of studies erotophobic persons seem to be less likely to engage in each behavior that is required for effective contraception. Evidence exists that erotophobia/erotophilia may have quite general effects on approach or avoidance of sexuality. The negative emotions which seem to inhibit contraceptive use also seem to inhibit performance of sex related health care practices. 3 strategies that might be pursued to improve adolescent contraception are considered: educating for change in erotophobia/erotophilia; changing the emotional tone of contraceptive learning acquisition and use; and changing beliefs and expectancies. Educating for change in erotophobia/erotophilia involves desensitizing persons to alleviate their negative emotional responses to sex and the systematic association of sexual cues with positive emotions in order to foster the development of an erotophilic disposition. It is also necessary to change the feelings about the specific behaviors that are required for effective contraception. Also necessary are interventions that focus on changing relevant beliefs and expectancies in addition to emotional changes.",

In Orthodox Judaism, though gender norms dictate everyday life, research on the role of gender in disaffiliation is scarce. This study analyzed data from a parent study describing the personal experiences of men and women raised as Orthodox Jews who either disaffiliated from the practice (N women = 153, N men = 153) or continued practicing (N women = 168, N men = 146), examined through the lens of gender. Gender differences had a divergent pattern: disaffiliated women reported adverse social/emotional experiences at a significantly higher rate than disaffiliated men and all affiliates, while all men reported adverse education experiences at a significantly higher rate than women. These patterns may, in part, be due to community norms and differential willingness to report outcomes by disaffiliated and affiliated individuals. Our findings highlight the influence of gender on the experiences within the religious community and the complex process of disaffiliation.",

      "title": "Developmental pathways to antisocial behavior: The delayed-onset pathway in girls",
      "abstract": "Recent research has suggested that there are two distinct trajectories for the development of antisocial behavior in boys: a childhood-onset pathway and an adolescent-onset pathway. After reviewing the limited available research on antisocial girls, we propose that this influential method of conceptualizing the development of severe antisocial behavior may not apply to girls without some important modifications. Antisocial girls appear to show many of the correlates that have been associated with the childhood-onset pathway in boys, and they tend to show impaired adult adjustment, which is also similar to boys in the childhood-onset pathway. However, antisocial girls typically show an adolescent-onset to their antisocial behavior. We have proposed that these girls show a third developmental pathway which we have labeled the ‚Äúdelayed-onset‚Äù pathway. This model rests on the assumption that many of the putative pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to the development of antisocial behavior in girls, such as cognitive and neuropsychological deficits, a dysfunctional family environment, and/or the presence of a callous and unemotional interpersonal style, may be present in childhood, but they do not lead to severe and overt antisocial behavior until adolescence. Therefore, we propose that the delayed-onset pathway for girls is analogous to the childhood-onset pathway in boys and that there is no analogous pathway in girls to the adolescent-onset pathway in boys. Although this model clearly needs to be tested in future research, it highlights the need to test the applicability of current theoretical models for explaining the development of antisocial behavior in girls.",

ECC is a complex entity in which feeding practices alone does not play a prime role but is influenced by a myriad of cultural, behavioral, biological and microbiological factors. So, the area has conflicting reports which needs further research.",

      "abstract": "Subjective age (how old or young individuals feel relative to their chronological age) is gaining popularity in gerontology and related disciplines because of its relation with biopsychosocial processes of aging. Evidence from Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) and other cohorts is reviewed on the predictors and outcomes of subjective age. An older subjective age is predicted by age discrimination, negative changes in one‚Äôs social and family networks, lower well-being and perceived control, poor physical conditions and more chronic health problems. Subjective age is also predictive of a range of crucial outcomes. Indeed, feeling younger is related to better physical and mental health, cognition, more favorable personality changes, lower risk of incident hospitalization, and longevity. These findings suggest that the subjective experience of age is a biopsychosocial marker of aging with promise as a predictor of crucial age-related outcomes, beyond chronological age.",

      "abstract": "Stress occurs when homeostasis is threatened or perceived to be so. The stress system with its central and peripheral effectors regulate the brain's cognitive, reward and fear systems, wake-sleep centers as well as the growth, reproductive and thyroid hormone axes, and influence the gastrointestinal, cardiorespiratory, metabolic and immune systems. Malfunction of the stress system might impair growth, development, behavior and metabolism, which potentially lead to various acute and chronic disorders.\r\n\r\nThe speech will be focused: a) On linguistics, where stress is the relative emphasis that may be given to certain syllables in a word and stress manifests itself in the speech stream are highly language dependent. b) Gender is an important biological determinant of vulnerability to psychosocial stress. Research studies focused on the sex differences in stress responses revealed individual differences in stress reactivity in addition to genetic, socio-cultural, hormonal and developmental factors. Women appear more physiologically reactive to social rejection challenges, but men react more to achievement challenges. Women's greater reactivity to rejection stress may contribute to the increased rates of affective disorders in women. Another study specifically indicates that women with the BDNF Val/Met genotype and men with the Val/Val may be particularly vulnerable to social stress mediated by brain stress system activity (Psychoneuroendocrinology, 2009). c) Poor self-concept, impatience, poor consequential thinking, inability to set realistic goals and to prioritize, poor resource management, poor health habits, over-dependence, inflexibility are some of personality-related stressors. d) Stress responses associated with possible implications for psychopathology during childhood, adolescents and older adults. Prenatal stress and maternal exposure to exogenous glucocorticoids can lead to permanent modification of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal function and stress-related behaviour. Childhood stress and trauma have been related to adult psychopathology in different psychiatric disorders. e) Some transitions and dynamics can lead families to excessive stress. There are many stresses in healthy and dysfunctional families. Research revealed that secure-base interactions between parents and adolescents facilitate physiological regulation of stress, especially for adolescents with externalising symptomatology. f) Finally, the effects of stress reactivity may lead to physical symptoms and disorders (e.g. hypertension, appetite and gastrointestinal problems, skeletal muscles increased tension, smooth muscles increased contraction, visceral obesity, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, suppression of immune system). There is also a link between stress and fertility. Women with infertility report equivalent levels of anxiety and depression as women with cancer, HIV status, and heart disease. Men also suffer fertility related stress, though they frequently keep their anxiety to themselves for fear of adding to their partner's burden.",

A competi√ß√£o entre machos pelo acesso a f√™meas pode levar √† evolu√ß√£o de atributos sexualmente dim√≥rficos (dimorfismo sexual). Esses atributos presentes de forma mais exagerada nos machos supostamente sinalizam a qualidade fisiol√≥gica do indiv√≠duo, seja para rivais em intera√ß√µes agon√≠sticas ou para f√™meas na escolha de parceiros sexuais (Andersson 1994).As brigas entre machos por acesso a f√™meas, que frequentemente ocorrem na forma de briga, podem ser muito custosas, pois consomem grande parte do or√ßamento temporal e energ√©tico dos indiv√≠duos, al√©m de poderem causar les√µes (Arnott &amp; Elwood 2009). Logo, mecanismos que permitam que os indiv√≠duos avaliem seus rivais e decidam se devem entrar em um confronto deveriam ser favorecidos (Enquist &amp; Leimar 1983).

      "abstract": "Human substance use is complex, being influenced by many psychopathological and sociological factors as well as the substance's pharmacological effects. Dependence development is not attributable directly to the consumed substance, but takes also all the other issues into regard. One of all these issues might be that gender represents an influencing factor and impacts on tolerance of a substance, on abuse patterns and finally on development of dependence as well as on addiction related disorders. Therapeutic programs' needs might be different too. In general, more men than women are alcohol dependent or have alcohol problems, but women are at greater risk for adverse effects and alcohol related diseases. Death rates among female alcoholics are 50 to 100 percent higher than those of men. Major impairments, diagnosis, medical and psychosocial consequences and their implication on treatment will be outlined.",

In most cases, the experiences about mathematics are perceived negatively, and the relationship between belonging to a gender (male or female) and difficulties (feelings) in learning mathematics, are a proof that have a close relationship. Therefore, you can plan an integral teaching-learning process that also involves other dimensions to providing knowledge like the socio-affective case, embodying a gender perspective and human rights in a transversal way, achieving a more meaningful learning of mathematics in all the students.RESUMENLa construcci√≥n de representaciones sociales que se forman alrededor de las matem√°ticas tiene una funci√≥n importante en la regulaci√≥n del aprendizaje, tanto individual como colectivo, que influye en el proceso de asimilaci√≥n y aprendizaje de las mismas.En la mayor√≠a de los casos, las experiencias alrededor de las matem√°ticas son percibidas de forma negativa, y la relaci√≥n que existe entre la pertenencia a un g√©nero (masculino o femenino) y las dificultades (sentidas) en el aprendizaje de las matem√°ticas, demuestran que tienen una estrecha relaci√≥n.Por lo cual, se puede planificar un proceso de ense√±anza-aprendizaje integral que involucre adem√°s de lo cognitivo otras dimensiones, como es el caso de la socio-afectiva, que incorporando la perspectiva de g√©nero y de Derechos Humanos de manera transversal, propicie que en las y los estudiantes se logre un aprendizaje m√°s significativo de las matem√°ticas.Contacto principal: yanira.mejia@gmail.com",

      "title": "Self-Disgust and Sexual Functioning: A Scenario-Based Study Testing the Ability of Sex-Related Experiences to Elicit Self-Directed Disgust",
      "abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates that disgust might compromise sexual functioning and can contribute to sexual problems. Although the stimuli and conditions that elicit disgust vary greatly across individuals, they cluster in three categories of disgust elicitors: Stimuli that are associated with an increased risk of the transmission of infectious diseases (pathogen disgust), stimuli that signal poor mating quality and may jeopardize reproductive success (sexual disgust), and behaviors that violate social norms (moral disgust). It has been argued that each of these categories of disgust may interfere with sexual responses. Thus far, research on the role of disgust in sexual contexts focused on external stimuli (e.g., sperm). Yet, recently it has been proposed that disgust can also become directed to features of the self. Such self-directed disgust may also apply to sexual contexts and contribute to sexual problems. As a first step to explore the relevance of self-disgust in sexual functioning, we tested if indeed particular sexual experiences have the ability to elicit self-disgust. Using a within subject design, participants (N = 124; all women) imagined themselves as well as others experiencing a series of sex-related scenarios, each relevant for one of the three categories of disgust, and subsequently rated their self-disgust. For all types of disgust, the scenarios evoked self-disgust, and the \"self-perspective\" elicited significantly more self-disgust than the \"other-perspective.\" These findings support theoretical models pointing to the relevance of taking self-disgust into consideration as a factor that may compromise sexual functioning. Future research should test whether this also holds for men.",

However, little is known regarding the effect of individual differences in the ability to seek, maintain, and benefit from close relationships in this context. Accordingly, we examined the associations between subjective age (i.e., how old/young one feels vis-√†-vis his/her chronological age; SA), attachment patterns, and loneliness. Data were collected from 840 older adults in Israel ( Mage = 74.75, SD = 5.50, range = 67‚Äì94), who provided information pertaining to SA, attachment anxiety/avoidance, and loneliness. Loneliness was associated with an older SA, as well as with high levels of attachment anxiety/avoidance. Moreover, the association between SA and loneliness was nullified for individuals with low levels of attachment anxiety/avoidance. The discussion highlights the importance of both age perceptions and attachment patterns for understanding the underlying mechanisms of late-life loneliness.",

      "abstract": "La sexualidad desempe√±a un papel muy importante a lo largo de la vida, as√≠ que no existe motivo alguno para creer que con la edad desaparecen el inter√©s o las pr√°cticas sexuales; el placer no solo depende del aparato genital, sino tambi√©n de toda una serie de excitaciones y actividades efectuadas desde la infancia, las cuales producen un placer que no puede reducirse a la satisfacci√≥n de una necesidad fisiol√≥gica b√°sica, denominada como ‚Äúnormal‚Äù en el amor sexual. Por lo general, la sociedad relaciona m√°s a la sexualidad con la juventud, alimentando muchos estereotipos negativos acerca de la sexualidad en la vejez. El objetivo del presente estudio es identificar los factores psicol√≥gicos y socioculturales que intervienen en la percepci√≥n de las personas adultas mayores de 60 a 80 a√±os de edad que viven en el poblado de Sabancuy perteneciente al Municipio del Carmen, Campeche. Para ello se utiliz√≥ el m√©todo descriptivo, no experimental con alcance cualitativo, con instrumentos: ficha de identificaci√≥n, test bienestar psicol√≥gico y la satisfacci√≥n sexual en parejas de edad adulta media y edad adulta tard√≠a, Inventario de Autoestima de Coopersmith, versi√≥n para adultos. El an√°lisis de datos se realiz√≥ mediante un ordenador personal (PC) con herramientas tales como: manejador de bases de datos (Word) y hoja de c√°lculo (Excel). Los sujetos objeto de estudio fueron 50 personas adultas mayores de 60 a 80 a√±os de edad. En los resultados se encontr√≥ que la autoestima, considerada un factor psicol√≥gico, no intervino en su percepci√≥n de mantener una vida sexual activa, ya que la mayor√≠a de la poblaci√≥n manifest√≥ tener autoestima alta, aunque estos no tienen una vida sexual activa, es decir, la autoestima no influy√≥ de manera directa en la actividad sexual de los adultos mayores investigados. Se pregunt√≥ a los adultos mayores en estudio: ¬øcree que es malo para la salud, especialmente en la vejez, la actividad sexual?, ante lo cual, 20 % de los hombres con rango de edad de 70 a 79 contest√≥ en las encuestas que no es malo para la salud tener relaciones sexuales, pero que ya no lo realizan porque ya no es lo mismo; asimismo, se les pregunt√≥ si en la actualidad manten√≠an relaciones sexuales, y los resultados mostraron que 34 adultos mayores ya no tienen relaciones sexuales y 10 hombres s√≠ tienen relaciones sexuales aunque ya no sea con su pareja. Al preguntar a los adultos mayores si consideran necesaria la penetraci√≥n o coito para obtener satisfacci√≥n sexual, 13 de los adultos mayores varones respondieron que consideran necesaria la penetraci√≥n para obtener satisfacci√≥n sexual. En conclusi√≥n, la creencia de que la edad y el declinar de la actividad sexual est√°n inexorablemente unidos, ha provocado que no se preste atenci√≥n suficiente a una de las actividades que provee mayor calidad de vida, la sexualidad. Sin embargo, la mayor√≠a de las personas de edad avanzada son capaces de tener relaciones y de sentir placer en toda la gama de las actividades como sucede en las personas m√°s j√≥venes.",

      "abstract": "Perpetration of aggressive and violent sexual behaviours may be a sign of behavioural addiction. Previous research has suggested that frequent users of pornography also experience signs of behavioral addiction such as loss of control over use and preoccupancy with thoughts of using. Research has also suggested that frequent users experiencing signs of behavioural addiction are more likely to copy or fantasize about imitating what the see in pornography. However, most research has shown that only individuals experiencing psychopathic personality traits are the ones who will imitate what they see in pornography. A study of 1,060 persons explored the effects of addiction to pornography, the dark triad and personality, and addiction to sex as contributing factors to the perpetration of aggressive or violent sexual behaviours. Persons with higher scores of psychopathy and problematic pornography use and compulsive sexual behaviours were more likely to behave aggressively sexually, but the findings also indicate that, regardless of personality, individuals experiencing lower levels of sexual satisfaction also reported more sexual aggression.",

Violence has very diverse forms and properties, one of which is sexual harassment. Violence. Sexual violence can occur anywhere, no matter the educational institution, office, public place, or even the safest place such as Islamic boarding schools. Many cases of violence in pesantren are not revealed because of threats received by victims from the perpetrator, victims feel ashamed if they tell the truth, fear of being viewed obliquely by society, bring down the good name of the family, and many other reasons. Some violence prevention actions that Islamic boarding schools can carry out include frequent raids on mobile phones and social media belonging to students or students, conducting various studies on the boundaries that must be maintained between men and women, and so on.

Gender identity encompasses an individual's biological sex (genitalia), knowledge of membership in a gender category (core gender identity), felt compatibility with one gender group (gender compatibility), felt pressure for gender conformity (gender typing and gender roles), and sexual orientation (heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality). The salient phases, characteristics, and determinants of gender identity development and the distinctions among the different constructs are presented. Gender identity represents a psychological achievement and covers a wide spectrum of gender‚Äêfluid characteristics, whose determinants are scientifically known to be both biological (genetic and hormonal) and social cognitive (parenting, stereotyping, gender roles). Low gender compatibility and discontent with one's own gender are some of the possible factors associated with gender identity disorders and gender variance phenomena such as transsexualism.",

      "abstract": "Closeness, in the sense of inclusion of other in the self, has been found to be an important factor for relationship well-being, satisfaction and pair-bonding. In the past ten years, the self-expansion theory has also been incorporated into sex research, although studies are still very scarce and not without limitations. The present research aimed at further elucidating the relevance of relational factors for couple's sexuality, and to clarify the role inclusion of other in the self plays for sexual satisfaction and sexual distress. A broadly representative sample of 3,046 men and women aged 18 to 75 was taken from the German Health and Sexuality Survey (GeSiD). Throughout analyses, inclusion of other in the self and love were positively related to sexual satisfaction. Furthermore, inclusion of other in the self was negatively related to how strongly someone was distressed by experiencing sexual problems. Closeness seems to have a compensatory role especially for women with sexual problems, protecting them from experiencing sexual distress. In future research, couple's sexual satisfaction should not be compartmentalized from relational aspects. Results clearly promote the Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale as an interesting tool for both research and treatment.",

This study compared relationship outcomes in love-based and arranged marriages contracted in the U.S. A community sample of 58 Indian participants living in the U.S. (28 arranged marriages, 30 love-based marriages) completed measures of marital satisfaction, commitment, companionate love, and passionate love. Men reported greater amounts of commitment, passionate love, and companionate love than women. Unexpectedly, no differences were found between participants in arranged and love-based marriages; high ratings of love, satisfaction, and commitment were observed in both marriage types. The overall affective experiences of partners in arranged and love marriages appear to be similar, at least among Indian adults living in contemporary U.S. society.",

The four stages of sexual function are modified: 1. delayed erection; 2. plateau prolongation; 3. orgasm modifications; 4. fast penis detumescence. In addition to organic impairment, aesthetic, social, environmental and psychological factors can restrict sexual activity, as well as past sexual experiences and co-morbidity. There are specific aspects concerning sexuality in the elderly, such as the increased chances of public relations and emotional involvement, the more intense psychic activity and the stronger process of removal and sublimation of impulses. In conclusion the best way to deal with sexuality in the elderly is the multidimensional assessment.",

      "abstract": "Adolescents and young adults who disclose a minority sexual orientation (‚Äúcome out‚Äù as gay, lesbian, or bisexual) to their parents often are met with varied negative reactions. The current work builds on a growing literature aimed at understanding the myriad causes of negative parental reactions to these disclosures. Specifically, this work evaluates a hypothesis derived from evolutionary psychological logic: that variation in parental responses to offspring‚Äôs sexual orientation disclosures is driven, in part, by perceived costs to parents‚Äô inclusive fitness (i.e., implicit or explicit concerns related to the reproductive success of genetic relatives). Across three studies (total N = 493), we examined whether daughters‚Äô and sons‚Äô perceptions of parents‚Äô negative reactions to their sexual orientation disclosures systematically co-varied with inclusive fitness concerns, as indexed by parent gender, sexual orientation, and offspring number. This perspective received partial support among daughters, who reported more negative reactions from their mothers (vs. fathers), particularly in response to lesbian (vs. bisexual) disclosures. Reactions to sons‚Äô disclosures did not vary across parent gender, sexual orientation, or offspring number. Taken together, this work provides preliminary evidence that perceived fitness costs may lead mothers to respond negatively to their daughters‚Äô lesbian orientation disclosures.",

Child Sexual abuse will result continuously terrible impacts, not only on its victims‚Äô health problems but also on their psychological condition, such as permanent trauma, even after they have been grown up. The traumatic impacts of sexual abuse experienced by children are as follows: betrayal (betrayal or trust crisis of the children towards adults); traumatic sexualization; powerlessness (helpless feeling); and stigmatization. Physically, there is perhaps nothing to be questioned on sexual abuse victims, but psychologically, it can cause addiction, trauma, and even revenge. Unless it is treated seriously, child sexual abuse can lead to a broad social impacts in the society.

      "title": "The function of female resistance behavior: intromission by male coercion vs. female cooperation in sepsis flies (Diptera: Sepsidae).",
      "abstract": "Female resistance behavior that occurs prior to intromission does not by itself imply forced copulation. Such behavior may function instead as a test of the male in order to favor some males over others, or to induce the male to desist. Thus, male persistence and forcefullness may sometimes be better described as persuasion rather than coercion. Under the persuasion hypothesis, the male only gains intromission due to an active response of the female. Under the coercion hypothesis, male and female are opposed in a physical battle which the female loses if copulation occurs. In species in which males are morphologically incapable of forcing intromission without active female cooperation (I argue here that this is probably a very common situation), data on the behavioral and ecological context in which resistance occurs can distinguish between the two possibilities. Partially congruent functions of resistance, seen from the female point of view, are female resistance to screen (male persuasion), and female resistance to avoid males non-selectively (male coercion). Sepsis flies illustrate these ideas. Females often struggle energetically in apparent attempts to dislodge mounted males and to prevent intromission, and males grasp females with powerful species-specific structures on their front legs and genitalia. This suggests the possibility of coerced intromission. But behavioral and morphological evidence demonstrate that active female cooperation occurs at the moment of intromission, and that males are probably dependent on this cooperation because they are not morphologically equipped to force their genitalia into those of an uncooperative female. Despite the impression from previous publications, male insects in general may seldom be able to achieve intromission by genitalic force. The species-specific forms of the grasping genitalia of male sepsis are probably not the result of an evolutionary arms race between coercive males and unselectively resistant females.",

      "abstract": "Extensive cross-cultural evidence supports the conclusion that children and adults everywhere understand themselves to be cared about (accepted) or not cared about (rejected) by the people most important to them (e.g., parents) in four ways. These four ways include the perception of warmth/affection (or coldness/lack of affection), hostility/aggression, indifference/neglect, and undifferentiated rejection. In addition, extensive cross-cultural evidence supports the conclusion that psychological adjustment of children and adults everywhere tends to be affected in the same way when they feel their attachment figures do not care about or love them (i.e., reject them). About 11 prior meta-analyses have documented these conclusions about the relationship between psychological maladjustment and the experiences of parental coldness/lack of affection, hostility/aggression, and indifference/neglect, among offspring. However, the cross-cultural link between psychological maladjustment and undifferentiated rejection has not heretofore been explored via meta-analysis. That is the purpose of this study. It examined relations among children‚Äôs current perceptions and adults‚Äô remembrances of parental undifferentiated rejection in childhood, and offspring‚Äôs psychological adjustment. The meta-analysis was based on 102 studies (89 published and 13 unpublished) from 17 countries involving 24,003 respondents. Results showed that both maternal and paternal undifferentiated rejection correlated significantly in all countries with overall psychological maladjustment of both children and adults. However, maternal undifferentiated rejection had a significantly stronger relationship with both children‚Äôs and adults‚Äô psychological maladjustment than did perceived paternal undifferentiated rejection. Perceived maternal undifferentiated rejection also had a significantly stronger relationship with children‚Äôs psychological maladjustment than with adults‚Äô psychological maladjustment.",

Studies show that a majority of individuals have experienced an on‚Äêagain/off‚Äêagain (on‚Äêoff) relationship at some point in their dating history. As compared to partners whose relationships do not break up and renew, on‚Äêoff partners report lower relational quality (e.g., lower satisfaction, more relational uncertainty, greater conflict, more aggression) as well as greater structural constraints (e.g., children, lower income). Further, a cyclical nature during dating predicts a cyclical nature in cohabiting and marital relationships. Research identifying different types or trajectories of on‚Äêoff relationships, however, has revealed that some partners may use the relational transitions to improve their relationship. Certain theoretical perspectives have been applied (e.g., interdependence, commitment theories) to explain the development and maintenance of these relationships.",

      "abstract": "Although research has focused on the ‚Äúinnocence problem‚Äù, ‚Äúpartial innocence‚Äù may also plague individuals who plead guilty to crimes they did not commit, but that are either comparable, more severe, or less severe than their actual crimes. Using a high-stakes experimental paradigm and an immersive role-playing paradigm, we examined the psychology of experimentally-induced partial innocence on plea decisions. Participants were randomly induced to be either wholly innocent, guilty, or partially innocent of committing an academic transgression and then given the choice to accept or reject a plea deal to avoid disciplinary sanction. Partially innocent participants pled to cheating nearly as often as guilty participants and vastly more often than innocent participants. Partially innocent participants‚Äînot unlike guilty participants‚Äîexperienced greater feelings of guilt than did innocent participants. In turn, these feelings of guilt, but not shame, were associated with taking responsibility for comparable, less severe, and more severe transgressions not committed.",

      "abstract": "We explored subtle prejudice against lesbians by examining heterosexual women's tendency to distance themselves socially from lesbians. People can distance themselves socially by expressing beliefs that are dissimilar to another person's beliefs, regardless of whether they agree with the other person. We used a conformity paradigm, in which the majority was perceived to be heterosexual, and a dissenter was represented as either lesbian or heterosexual, to investigate social distancing. The majority expressed unpopular personal preferences (e.g., preference for different types of musical instruments), gave sexist responses, and did not identify as feminist; the dissenter did the opposite. The sexual orientation of the dissenter affected high-prejudiced participants' expression of personal preferences and both high- and low-prejudiced participants' expression of modern sexist beliefs and self-identification as feminist. The consequence was that participants said more sexist remarks and were less likely to identify as feminist when the dissenter was a lesbian. We discuss results in terms of prejudice and fear of association with the lesbian.",

      "title": "FEATURES OF PERCEPTION BY SUBJECTS OF GENDER AND AGE DISCRIMINATION SETTINGS IN RELATION TO THEM",
      "abstract": "The article presents the results of an empirical study to identify signs of gender and age discrimination, based on its perception by discriminated subjects. It is shown that gender discriminatory attitudes on the part of society are felt to a greater extent by women. They are differentiated into two groups: a) the nuclear zone - discrimination in the professional sphere, which is noticed by a large number of women b) the peripheral zone, which includes the prevailing attitudes in the distribution of domestic responsibilities in traditional society, as well as stereotypes and prejudices regarding womens abilities and opportunities. The signs of male discrimination were revealed, the indicators of which do not differ among themselves at a statistically significant level, and therefore are equivalent. These include the following attitudes that are perceived by men as discriminatory: attitudes in the family sphere (the rights to a child are not equal with a woman in a divorce, full responsibility for the financial well-being of the family), social (earlier retirement of women with a longer life expectancy, lack of women of military duty), personal (social prohibition on a mans weakness). Representatives of the older age (50-65 years) are more likely to experience age-related discriminatory installations. The core of these attitudes is formed by those factors that relate to their professional activities (refusal to apply for a job, discrimination in wages, and the employers condescending attitude towards them), and the periphery is the discrimination they perceive in the field of free medical care. Young respondents (17-29 years old) feel the effect of only one discriminatory attitude towards them - a frivolous (mocking) attitude to their opinion, beliefs, values due to lack of life experience. –í —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã —Ä–µ–∑—É–ª—å—Ç–∞—Ç—ã —ç–º–ø–∏—Ä–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ –≤—ã—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–∫–æ–≤ –≥–µ–Ω–¥–µ—Ä–Ω–æ–π –∏ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–π –¥–∏—Å–∫—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤—ã–≤–∞—è—Å—å –Ω–∞ –µ–µ –≤–æ—Å–ø—Ä–∏—è—Ç–∏–∏ –¥–∏—Å–∫—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∏—Ä—É–µ–º—ã–º–∏ —Å—É–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç–∞–º–∏. –ü–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ –≥–µ–Ω–¥–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–µ –¥–∏—Å–∫—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∏—Ä—É—é—â–∏–µ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∏ —Å–æ —Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—ã –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –≤ –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω–∏ –æ—â—É—â–∞—é—Ç –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω—ã. –£ –Ω–∏—Ö –æ–Ω–∏ –¥–∏—Ñ—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ü–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã –Ω–∞ –¥–≤–µ –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø—ã: –∞)—è–¥–µ—Ä–Ω–∞—è –∑–æ–Ω–∞ –¥–∏—Å–∫—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∞—Ü–∏—è –≤ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ—Å—Å–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—É—é –∑–∞–º–µ—á–∞–µ—Ç –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ —á–∏—Å–ª–æ –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω –±)–ø–µ—Ä–∏—Ñ–µ—Ä–∏–π–Ω–∞—è –∑–æ–Ω–∞, –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞—é—â–∞—è –≤ —Å–µ–±—è —É—Å—Ç–æ—è–≤—à–∏–µ—Å—è –≤ —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–º –æ–±—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∏ –≤ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –¥–æ–º–∞—à–Ω–∏—Ö –æ–±—è–∑–∞–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫–∂–µ —Å—Ç–µ—Ä–µ–æ—Ç–∏–ø—ã –∏ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—É–±–µ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –∂–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π –∏ –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–µ–π. –í—ã—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω—ã –ø—Ä–∏–∑–Ω–∞–∫–∏ –∏ –º—É–∂—Å–∫–æ–π –¥–∏—Å–∫—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –ø–æ–∫–∞–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö –Ω–µ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –º–µ–∂–¥—É —Å–æ–±–æ–π –Ω–∞ —Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏ –∑–Ω–∞—á–∏–º–æ–º —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–µ, –∏ –ø–æ—ç—Ç–æ–º—É —è–≤–ª—è—é—Ç—Å—è —Ä–∞–≤–Ω–æ–∑–Ω–∞—á–Ω—ã–º–∏. –ö –Ω–∏–º –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—Å—è—Ç—Å—è —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–∏–µ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∏, –≤–æ—Å–ø—Ä–∏–Ω–∏–º–∞–µ–º—ã–µ –º—É–∂—á–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏ –∫–∞–∫ –¥–∏—Å–∫—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ: —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∏ –≤ —Å–µ–º–µ–π–Ω–æ–π —Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ (–Ω–µ —Ä–∞–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Å –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω–æ–π –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ä–µ–±–µ–Ω–∫–∞ –ø—Ä–∏ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–æ–¥–µ, –ø–æ–ª–Ω–∞—è –æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –∑–∞ —Ñ–∏–Ω–∞–Ω—Å–æ–≤–æ–µ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏–µ —Å–µ–º—å–∏), —Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π (–±–æ–ª–µ–µ —Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–∏–π —É—Ö–æ–¥ –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω –Ω–∞ –ø–µ–Ω—Å–∏—é –ø—Ä–∏ –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ–π –ø—Ä–æ–¥–æ–ª–∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∏—Ö –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏, –æ—Ç—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ —É –∂–µ–Ω—â–∏–Ω –≤–æ–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±—è–∑–∞–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏), –ª–∏—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–Ω–æ–π (—Å–æ—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –∑–∞–ø—Ä–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –º—É–∂—á–∏–Ω–æ–π —Å–ª–∞–±–æ—Å—Ç–∏). –í–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–Ω—ã–µ –¥–∏—Å–∫—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∏—Ä—É—é—â–∏–µ —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∏ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –æ—â—É—â–∞—é—Ç –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–∞–≤–∏—Ç–µ–ª–∏ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä—à–µ–≥–æ –≤–æ–∑—Ä–∞—Å—Ç–∞ (50-65 –ª–µ—Ç). –Ø–¥—Ä–æ —ç—Ç–∏—Ö —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–æ–∫ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—É—é—Ç —Ç–µ —Ñ–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä—ã, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –∫–∞—Å–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –∏—Ö –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ—Å—Å–∏–æ–Ω–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π –¥–µ—è—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ (–æ—Ç–∫–∞–∑ –≤ —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–µ –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É, –¥–∏—Å–∫—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∞—Ü–∏—è –≤ –æ–ø–ª–∞—Ç–µ —Ç—Ä—É–¥–∞, —Å–Ω–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–æ–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—è –∫ –Ω–∏–º), –∞ –ø–µ—Ä–∏—Ñ–µ—Ä–∏—é –æ—â—É—â–∞–µ–º–∞—è –∏–º–∏ –¥–∏—Å–∫—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∞—Ü–∏—è –≤ —Å—Ñ–µ—Ä–µ –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–µ–¥–∏—Ü–∏–Ω—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –æ–±—Å–ª—É–∂–∏–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è. –ú–æ–ª–æ–¥—ã–µ —Ä–µ—Å–ø–æ–Ω–¥–µ–Ω—Ç—ã (17-29 –ª–µ—Ç) –æ—â—É—â–∞—é—Ç –¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –ª–∏—à—å –æ–¥–Ω–æ–π –¥–∏—Å–∫—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–π —É—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∫–∏ –ø–æ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—é –∫ –Ω–∏–º –Ω–µ—Å–µ—Ä—å–µ–∑–Ω–æ–µ (–Ω–∞—Å–º–µ—à–ª–∏–≤–æ–µ) –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫ –∏—Ö –º–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—é, —É–±–µ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è–º, —Ü–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—è–º –∏–∑-–∑–∞ –æ—Ç—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∏—è –∂–∏–∑–Ω–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –æ–ø—ã—Ç–∞.",

      "abstract": "Gender diversity is seemingly prevalent among asexual people. Drawing on qualitative research, and focusing on agender identities in particular, this article explores why this might be the case. I argue that previous explanations that center biologistic understandings of sexual development, the liberatory potential of asexuality, or psycho-cognitive conflict, are insufficient. Instead, I offer a sociological perspective in which participants‚Äô agender subjectivities can be understood as arising from an embodied meaning-making process where gender was understood to be fundamentally about sexuality. I emphasize the importance of understanding asexuality and agender in the broader structural context, as particular subjectivities were shaped and sometimes necessitated in navigating hetero-patriarchy. However, these entangled understandings of (a)sexuality and (a)gender were sometimes rendered unintelligible within LGBTQ+ discursive communities, where there is often a rigid ontological distinction between gender and sexuality arising from histories of misrecognition and erasure. I complicate this, arguing that already-invisible subjectivities may be made even more invisible by this distinction. The article illustrates the need to empirically explore the meanings of the categories ‚Äúgender‚Äù and ‚Äúsexuality,‚Äù and the relationship between them, rather than siloing them in our methodological and conceptual frameworks.",

Two love-shy groups (an older one and a younger one) were compared to a nonshy group on several family background variables. The love-shys were found to have been about five times as likely as the nonshys to have grown up without having any female siblings. They were also found to have grown up in homes which were isolated from any kin family network. Besides not receiving much emotional support from kin, the shys tended to have been social isolates as far as agemate peers were concerned. Further, the love-shys were found to have been more than three times as likely as the nonshys to have grown up as only children. Disharmony and verbal abuse had been commonplace components of the love-shys' family atmosphere.",

Preventing low-level stressors developing into pervasive stress requires identifying and sharing the nature of the stress that each partner is under. This helps to build empathy and adds resilience to their relationship. Stress may come from, or be expressed through, sexual functioning. The impact of comorbid conditions and interactions between prescribed and non-prescribed substances need to be taken into account in understanding sexual problems. Enabling couples to have a satisfying-enough sex life, and to cope with each partner's differences about this, requires them to understand more about their sexual make-up. This applies to gay and lesbian as well as heterosexual couples. The former are likely to have to cope with additional stresses arising from external and internal homophobia.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThe roots of deviance are often sought in the family of origin, and the families of male heroin addicts have not escaped such attention. (See Seldin, 1972, for a review of this literature.) A composite picture derived from the previously reported findings summarized in Table 1 suggests that the addict's mother is typically the dominant and pathological parent, while the father is either weak or absent. Yet it is usually the mother who is seen in positive terms by the addict himself, and the father who is viewed negatively. Presumably in many cases the addict simply accepts his mother's negative view of his father. Some common consequences of this family situation have been reported: (1) the addict's mother may depreciate her son because she sees him as like her husband, and the addict may incorporate his mother's negative appraisal into his self-concept; (2) the addict may experience unusual difficulty in achieving independence from his mother; (3) when he does, he may then select a similarly deviant woman for a mate; and (4) both wife and mother may unconsciously attempt to perpetuate the addict's drug use.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We investigated whether the nature of the relationship with a partner (a serious vs. casual relationship) influences youths' sexual behaviors and attitudes. We asked 452 youths, ages 18‚Äì25, drawn from 4 ethnic groups (White, African American, Latino, and Asian American) about their own past sexual behavior (personal sexual timetables) and about acceptable ages for youths, in general, to engage in different sexual behaviors (normative sexual timetables). Students answered these questions twice: once when describing partners in a serious relationship and once when the partner was not well known. The results revealed that the interpersonal context had opposite effects on normative and personal timetables. Although sexual explorations were more acceptable with a serious partner, youth generally began sexual activities with a partner they did not know well. As predicted, the interpersonal context influenced the sexual timetables of White adolescents more than other groups, although only under certain conditions. Contrary to predictions, the effect on interpersonal context on sexual timetables was similar for both genders. Additionally, women had more restrictive timetables than men, and Asian American adolescents held more restricted timetables than other",

Without question, attaining love and romance can enrich your life and can help satisfy the need for positive, long-term social bonds. Yet, you can have trouble finding the \"right\" partner or any partner at all, and even if you find a suitable partner, so many things can go wrong. Your satisfaction can wane, and your level of commitment can go with it. You can be tempted by infidelity, or your partner may fall prey to similar temptations. These challenges can be particularly troublesome among emerging adults, who tend to have relatively little experience with forming and maintaining a successful long-term relationship.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT In adolescence curiosity about sexual problems is very important in the formation of a new, more mature relationship with the opposite sex. Information about sexual problems should be started, so that teens do not seek information from another person or from sources that are not clear or even wrong at all. Giving information about sexual problems become s even more important in view of teenagers who are sexually active in potency, because it is associated with hormone-influenced sexual drive and often do not have enough information about their own sexual activity. Of course it w ill be very harmful to the mental development of a teenager when he does not have the right knowledge and information. Facts show that the majority of our youth do not know the impact of sexual behavior that they do, often adolescents are not mature to have sexual intercourse especially if you have to bear the risk of the sexual relationship.

Attitudes towards dating, of both elderly themselves and their children, had influence on the elderly`s dating experience, regardless of gender. This indicates that the elderly`s own acceptance and their children`s positive attitude are important to the elderly`s dating experience. 3. Gender differences were found in influences of living arrangement (whether they lived with their children or not), economical reasons, and personality factors. These variables proved significant only for the elderly men. More elderly men who did not live with their children than the elderly men who did had experienced dating, and economical reasons along with personality factors proved to be obstructive for elderly men`s dating life.",

      "title": "The ‚ÄòGender Life-Satisfaction/Depression Paradox‚Äô Is an Artefact of Inappropriate Control Variables",
      "abstract": "Abstract Previous research has suggested that there is a ‚Äògender paradox‚Äô associated with life satisfaction and depression: women are said to have higher levels of life satisfaction on average but also a higher likelihood of experiencing depression. That finding comes from quantitative analyses that include socio-demographic control variables. In this article I show that the inclusion of these control variables leads to biased results. In general, controls are to be selected on the basis that they are antecedents of the focal independent variable (as well as the dependent variable). When the focal independent variable is gender (or, more precisely, sex), no controls are required: there are no determinants of life satisfaction that also determine someone‚Äôs sex. If we include socio-demographic controls, we get biased results ‚Äì because the controls themselves are affected by sex. More precisely: if we include controls (e.g. for income) to discern the difference between women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs life satisfaction, we get a result that fails to reflect the way women experience specific disadvantages (e.g. lower income) that contribute to lower life satisfaction. The same points apply to an analysis of depression. In a properly specified model (using data from the European Social Survey), there is no difference between women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs life satisfaction ‚Äì so, there is no paradox with respect to depression.",

      "abstract": "Early social experiences can affect the development and expression of individual social behaviour throughout life. In particular, early-life social deprivations, notably of parental care, can later have deleterious consequences. We can, therefore, expect rearing procedures such as hand-raising-widely used in ethology and socio-cognitive science-to alter the development of individual social behaviour. We investigated how the rearing style later affected (a) variation in relationship strength among peers and (b) individuals' patterns of social interactions, in three captive groups of juvenile non-breeders consisting of either parent-raised or hand-raised birds, or a mix of both rearing styles. In the three groups, irrespectively of rearing style: strongest relationships (i.e., higher rates of association and affiliations) primarily emerged among siblings and familiar partners (i.e., non-relatives encountered in early life), and mixed-sex and male-male partners established relationships of similar strength, indicating that the rearing style does not severely affect the quality and structure of relationships in young ravens. However, compared to parent-raised ravens, hand-raised ravens showed higher connectedness, i.e., number of partners with whom they mainly associated and affiliated, but formed on average relationships of lower strength, indicating that social experience in early life is not without consequences on the development of ravens' patterns of social interaction. The deprivation of parental care associated with the presence of same-age peers during hand-raising seemed to maximize ravens' propensity to interact with others, indicating that besides parents, interactions with same-age peers matter. Opportunities to interact with, and socially learn from peers, might thus be the key to the acquisition of early social competences in ravens.",

Salah satu orientasi seks yang sering mendapat stigma negatif tersebut adalah biseksual yang dapat memengaruhi konsep diri individu yang bersangkutan. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui konsep diri pada pria biseksual. Subjek penelitian ini adalah laki‚Äìlaki yang berusia antara 23‚Äì30 tahun, belum menikah dan memiliki kelainan orientasi seksual yaitu biseksual. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa secara umum subjek pertama cenderung memiliki konsep diri yang positif, karena subjek pertama tidak pernah merasa terganggu dengan keadaannya sebagai seorang biseksual bahkan subjek bisa menghargai dirinya sendiri walaupun orang‚Äìorang di sekitarnya berpandangan negatif mengenai keadaan dirinya, sehingga subjek pun selalu merasa percaya diri. Adapun pada subjek kedua cenderung memiliki konsep diri yang negatif, karena subjek selalu melihat dirinya banyak kekurangan, sehingga subjek merasa terbatasi saat berinteraksi dengan lingkungan sosial, tetapi terkadang subjek melihat keadaan biseksual sebagai kelebihan karena pada saat yang sama dirinya bisa menyukai lawan jenis dan sesama jenis. Subjek pun belum bisa menghargai dirinya sendiri dengan baik karena masih ada penolakan dari dalam dirinya terhadap orientasi seksualnya, begitu pula di tempat subjek bekerja ada beberapa orang yang meremehkan kemampuan kerja subjek seperti tenaga subjek untuk mengangkat barang, kecepatan kerja.",

To address this topic, we conducted a secondary data analysis of 57 human sexuality students‚Äô narratives regarding the emotional and situational contexts of the first sexual image they recalled. We examined those narratives where participants reported that they saw was a ‚Äúreal person‚Äù either nude or engaged in sexual behavior. These participants reported viewing three kinds of sexual behavior or nudity: parental, other family members, and nonfamily. In examining participants‚Äô immediate reactions and long-term reflections, we found that many participants, especially females, were confused or upset by what they saw, but few reported a lingering discomfort. Our results indicate that children would benefit from immediate, nurturant, and clarifying parental responses, particularly when children walk in on parents having sex.",

It is generally a long-term pattern of behaviour although specific short-term interactions can be labelled abusive. Recently the following categories have been included in definitions of abusive behaviour: social, economic, intellectual and spiritual. With child abuse neglect is also an important component. Abuse cuts across all social categories and classes. It occurs in well-educated high-income areas and in low-income working-class areas; it happens in all races and religions. It can occur in families, extended families, in neighbour hoods, schools, churches, and community groups. Both men and women can be abusive and it can occur in virtually all age groups.

      "abstract": "Suicide among service members is associated with several demographic and social risk factors, especially precipitating intimate partner relationship issues, but the cause and nature of these failed relationships in the military have not been well explored. Service members have histories leading up to a suicide analogous to those among civilians. However, separations from families, deployments, combat or other trauma, command climate, and medical and psychological injuries are also stressors and may be linked to additional risks related to substance abuse, sexual dysfunction, domestic violence, lifestyle disagreements, or secretive thoughts and behaviors, which distance couples and add to disintegration of the supportive dyad the relationship could provide. Loss of vital social supports impacts resilience and facilitates a mindset enabling suicidal or other harmful thoughts and actions. Therefore, prevention programs that build, maintain, and sustain resilience are critical, as is availability of mental health clinicians trained to address relationship issues.",

By this time the figure has lost most of its childish characteristics and the mind has reached a point of great intelligence. Although the individual has scarcely passed the half-way mark in the years of growth, and has only attained half his future weight, yet he resembles the adult much more than he resembles the infant. At this stage the sex glands have not yet begun the rapid development of puberty with its profound effect on the whole organism. Curiously enough there is a sudden increase in the rate of growth which takes place at this time. In fact, we may consider boys in the period of prepubescence as individuals of adult form but of small size, growing rapidly, and as yet scarcely influenced by the internal secretions of the sex glands.",

      "abstract": "I propose a theory that puts the notion of two sexual attractions into a precise, testable form, and then I mesh it with the periodic table model of the gender transpositions described previously (Pillard & Weinrich, 1987). I define a limerent sexual attraction, active in eroticizing the physical and personality characteristics of a particular Limerent Object, and a lusty sexual attraction, active in producing erotic arousal when encountering a new Lusty Object. Three hypotheses then account for much of what we know about sexual orientation: (a) Limerence and lustiness are experienced by both men and women‚Äîbut there is an average difference in the ease with which each can be elicited in a particular sex. Limerence is experienced by most women in our culture as an autonomously arising desire, whereas lustiness, when it occurs, is experienced mostly as a reaction to particular stimuli. Lustiness is experienced by most men in our culture as an autonomously arising desire, whereas limerence, when it occurs, is experienced mostly in reaction to particular stimuli. (b) In some people the limerent attraction can be indifferent (or nearly so) to the sex or gender of the Limerent Object. (c) The lusty attraction is rarely indifferent to the sex or gender of the Lusty Object. Individuals may vary in their readiness to respond to the two kinds of attraction. Some of this variability can be understood in the light of the periodic table model described previously, and some of it can be understood in the light of cultural conditioning and socialization. The result is a theory that deduces many of the major facts about sexual orientation from only a small number of hypotheses.",

The realization of such a network of relationships is of crucial importance for alleviating loneliness. Loneliness concerns a situation in which the number of meaningful, lasting, interpersonal relationships is experienced by the person as deficient, either qualitatively or quantitatively, and as less than satisfying in meeting the person's desires. Intimacy scores were higher for respondents who mentioned a partner as most confidant relationship than for respondents who mentioned either a friend or a close relative. People living without a partner, whose most confidant relationship has little or no intimacy, and who express the desire for new relationships can, as a consequence, be characterized as people with a high probability of loneliness. A confidant relationship with little intimacy was related to greater occurrence of loneliness.",

Neither gonads nor chromosomal sex decide the direction of overt sexual behavior. Libido, in great measure, is a chemical test‚Äêtube equation. Testosterone is the hormone that intensifies sexual drive in both man and woman; it is particularly useful in restoring sexual drive in the woman who once knew, but has lost her libido. Testosterone in the adult female does not alter the direction of sexual behavior or amatory responsiveness. Age need not alter performance nor eliminate the satisfaction and pleasure that attend sexual gratification. Several illustrative cases are presented.",

Then, I focus on how aromantic and asexual spectrum interviewees (1) subvert expectations for normative sexual and romantic partnership, (2) untangle notions of sex, romance, and family, and (3) reimagine relationships and kinship to form their own intimacies.",

A qualitative analysis of 25 interviews with kink-identified, bisexual/pansexual/queer identified people highlighted the following patterns: the term queer, for some people, includes kink or BDSM sexualities; kink activities can be avenues for exploring gender identity and sexual orientation; and kink activities and community can be important elements in healing from shame, isolation, grief, and loss. Discussions of possible elements of competent care are reviewed in relation to kink sexuality and identity.",

Dissatisfaction to some degree is everywhere, since societies rarely, if ever, can have both. Its dissonance sounds in all spheres of culture. To date, either cultural anthropologists or evolutionary oriented researchers have confronted this eternal human conundrum. Evolutionary theory is relentless in documenting the sex link differences in erotic perception and behavior, while virtually silent in its examination of emotional intimacy. In this entry I have explored the human pair bond from the other side of the equation ‚Äê emotional intimacy. Specifically I have argued that love in all its variations has a consistent theme: it is dyadic or it is 186‚Äênothing. Moreover, the universality of the human pair bond is evident in the rise of favorite wife or husband in polygynous family systems. This strongly suggests that human as are more emotionally monogamous than they are sexually monogamous.",

      "abstract": "Sexuality is one of the basic determinants of human identity and sexual satisfaction is one of its most important components. Sexual satisfaction can be described as an affective response resulting from a subjective evaluation of both the positive and negative dimensions of sexual relationship. It is one of the most studied constructs of sexuality and has been connected to many variables in previous studies. Some of them are sociodemographic variables, with emphasis on gender and age. Also, sexual satisfaction was viewed in the context of different forms of partnership, as it was interesting to see the importance of socio-cultural factors through gender roles. More recently, the cognitive aspects of sexuality have been receiving more attention, which is why sexual satisfaction has been correlated with sexual self-schema. However, many results of these earlier studies show contradictions or poor research of a particular population. Because of this, the focus of this study lies in a sample of middle-aged population and one of the main objectives of the study was to examine the contribution of some aspects of marital relationship, sexual self-schema, achieved gender partner roles and some sociodemographic characteristics to the sexual satisfaction of men and women. In addition, due to contradictory results, the effect of gender on some aspects of marriage, sexual self-schema, achieved gender partner roles and sexual satisfaction was examined. The relationship between sexual satisfaction and some aspects of marriage, sexual self-esteem and achieved gender partner roles in men and women was also examined. The study was conducted on a sample of 164 participants, and following measures were used: General Information Questionnarie, Marital Satisfaction Scale, Communication Scale, Perceieved Attachment Scale, Achieved Gender Partner Roles Scale, Sexual Subjectivity Inventory and New Scale of Sexual Satisfaction. The results indicate that women, compared to men have higher sexual satisfaction and achieve more egalitarian gender partner roles. Correlations show that man and women who have greater sexual satisfaction, also have greater marital satisfaction, better communication and percieved attachment, achieve egalitarian gender partner roles and report positive sexual subjectivity. Within a whole sample of participants, hierarchical regression analysis using eight predictors explained 51% of the variance of sexual satisfaction. Significant predictors were age, marital satisfaction and sexual subjectivity. Younger age, greater marital satisfaction, positive sexual subjectivity contribute to greater sexual satisfaction of middle aged men and women.",

However, little is known about whether emotional synchrony between partners is similar across marriages in different cultural contexts. We assess differences in levels of synchrony using daily diaries from 35 couples from the United States and 89 couples from India (41 in love marriages, 48 in arranged marriages). Results show group differences in levels of synchrony, with American couples showing greater synchrony than Indian couples. Somewhat surprisingly, synchrony of negative partner-induced emotions was associated with greater marital satisfaction across marriage types, while for Indian-love couples synchrony of positive partner-induced emotions was associated with decreased satisfaction. Finally, synchrony of both positive and negative partner-induced emotions was associated with higher closeness for Indian-love couples, but reduced closeness for American couples. These findings suggest synchrony may not have the same implications for couples' emotional functioning across marriage types.",

Aversion may be seen along with other sexual dysfunctions, as a precipitating cause or as a consequence. However, aversion can also be the only dysfunction present. Once aversion is correctly diagnosed, identifying the type of aversion present is a prerequisite to appropriate therapy. Primary and secondary aversion are treated differently and have a different prognosis.

Research in the area of self-handicapping has consistently shown that men alone tend to self-handicap behaviorally.

Men and women were presented with an important intellectual evaluation and were allowed to practice for the upcoming test as much as they wanted. Results showed that men self-handicap more when they are self-focused but women do not behaviorally self-handicap under self-or other-focused conditions. Heightened concern over possible failure in self-focused conditions appeared to be the critical mediator in encouraging self-handicapping behavior among men.",

As per the American Psychological Association,[2] LGBT stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender. The \"LGB\" in this term refers to sexual orientation. Sexual orientation has been defined as an often enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions of men to women or women to men (heterosexual), of women to women or men to men (homosexual), or by men or women to both sexes (bisexual). It also refers to an individual's sense of personal and social identity based on those attractions, related behaviors, and membership in a community of others who share those attractions and behaviors. Some people who have same-sex attractions or relationships may identify as \"queer,\" or, for a range of personal, social, or political reasons, may choose not to self-identify with these or any labels. The \"T\" in LGBT stands for transgender or gender nonconforming and is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity or gender expression does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth. Some who do not identify as either male or female prefer the term \"genderqueer.\" While it is important to understand that sexual orientation and gender identity are not the same thing, they do both reflect differing forms of gender norm transgression and share an intertwined social and political history.[2] Historical Background Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) (Section 377. Unnatural offences.‚ÄîWhoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine) has been considerably debated in the last two decades. This section, which criminalized same-sex relationship, was introduced by Lord Macaulay in 1860 in British India. Historically, Common Law in England (Fleta, 1290 and Britton, 1300) was the first legislature to consider sodomy as a crime, the punishment for which was to burn alive such individual. In 1563, under Queen Elizabeth-I, the punishment changed to death by hanging, but it was not until 1861 that the death penalty was abolished. Sodomy, however, continued to be a crime in England until 1967 when the Sexual Offences Act, 1967, decriminalized the acts of sodomy between consenting adults.[1] Fifty years since then, many countries have adapted laws to decriminalize nonheterosexual sexual relationship and some have even allowed same-sex marriage. There are certain peculiarities of Section 377, IPC. First, it uses the expression \"carnal intercourse\" instead of the term \"sexual intercourse\" used in Section 375 (Rape) and Section 497 (Adultery). Second, no distinction regarding age is made in the section. Third, consent is no defense to an offence under Section 377. It has been contended that Section 377 is based on archaic religious moral and ethical standards which consider sex as merely a functional activity ‚Äì for procreation purpose only. Thus, nonprocreative sex is viewed as \"carnal,\" i.e., for pleasure of senses. Criminalization of a consensual and private same-sex conduct has been a weapon for police for abuse including locking-up, extortion, intimidation, harassment, payment of hush money, and forced sex. Apart from victimization of homosexuals, the section also perpetuates negative and discriminatory attitude toward same-sex relationship. As per estimates for the year 2006, in India, about 25 lakh men practice homosexuality.[3] Section 377 has being argued to be a roadblock in identification, prevention, and treatment of those with sexually transmitted diseases, particularly the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Psychosocial Aspects Psychological investigations in people with homosexual orientation do not show any objective impairment or dysfunction in judgment, stability, or vocational abilities.[4] Mental health-related classification systems of the World Health Organization and American Psychiatric Association also do not deem homosexuality as a disorder. Regrettably, homosexuality continues to be stigmatized due to which nonheterosexual individuals experience chronic stress. Minority stress theory[5] hypothesizes three processes, in addition to universal stressors, that compromise the psychological well-being of nonheterosexual individuals: (1) institutionalized discrimination and directly experienced prejudices, (2) expectation of victimization/rejection and the efforts to avert them, and (3) internalization of stigma (internalized homophobia). Multiple studies across the world have shown increased rates of depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol use and abuse, suicidal ideation and attempts, and suicides as well as other comorbid psychiatric disorders in homosexual men.[6] In a community-based study, nearly one-third of nonheterosexual individuals met diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder and/or reported suicide attempt.[7] In addition, there are sufficient data to show that a significant number of LGBT students regularly experience bullying at school; end up homeless; are more likely to contemplate or attempt suicide; and the LGBT community has elevated rates of poverty, food insecurity, and joblessness compared to the general population.[8] Indian Scenario However, from India, there is a paucity of literature on the prevalence and the emotional problems faced by individuals with homosexual orientation, primarily due to lack of generation of systematic data.[4] In their editorial of 2012, Rao and Jacob[4] had highlighted the lack of clear understanding and stand by the Indian mental health professionals on the issue of homosexuality and LGBT. However, in 2014, the Indian Psychiatric Society acknowledged that homosexuality is neither a mental illness nor a disease.[9] More recently, the Indian Psychiatric Society in collaboration with the Bombay Psychiatric Society arranged the first conference in Mumbai on March 10, 2018, to address mental health issues faced by LGBT community, in which the President of Indian Psychiatric Society Dr. Ajit Bhide discussed the sexual identity issues of LGBT community. The aim of this conference was to \"positively impact LGBT community by being better equipped to help them.\"[10] The Legal Aspects Background It was on July 8, 2001, that the police raided the Lucknow premises of Bharosa Trust, an nongovernmental organization working for LGBT rights; beat up; and arrested Mr. Arif Jafar, the Director and his four colleagues, and seized literature on gender, sexuality, safe sex, and a large amount of condoms as evidence of a gay sex racket being run from there (which was actually a training material on how to reach out to the vulnerable men having sex with men). The lower court denied bail to Mr. Jafar on the grounds of promoting homosexuality under Section 377 and criminal conspiracy, and he had to spend 47 days in custody before granted relief by Allahabad High Court.[11] Thereafter From a legal standpoint, Section 377 IPC has been argued to impinge upon basic freedom guaranteed under the Constitution of India, including the Right to Equality (Article 14), nondiscrimination (Article 15), and Right to Life (Article 21). It is understandable that no aspect of an individual is more private than sexual relations and hence criminalization of sexual preference is a violation of right to privacy under Article 21. In 2007, a group of human right experts formed the Yogyakarta Principles with the idea of equal application of human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender equality.[12] They defined sexual orientation as an individual's capacity for profound emotional, affectional, and sexual attraction to, and intimate and gender relation with, individuals of the different gender or the same gender or more than one gender. The principles recognize that human beings of all sexual orientation and gender identities are entitled to the full enjoyment of all human rights and that all persons are entitled to right to privacy, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. When this section was challenged on in the honorable High Court of Delhi, the Union of India filed two separate affidavits, both of which contradicted each other.[1] In an affidavit filed on behalf of the Under Secretary of Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, it was asserted that indeed this section prevented high-risk groups from revealing their same-sex behavior. This resulted in a large section of population with HIV/AIDS being unreachable, thereby pushing the cases of infection underground and making it difficult for public health workers to even access them. On the other hand, the Director (Judicial) in the Ministry of Home Affairs felt that Section 377 was required as it was the only tool for the prosecution of perpetrators of child sexual abuse. It further argued that the society has not yet shown readiness or willingness to accept homosexuality. After going through scientific and medical literatures, international law, and judgments of superior court, in a historic judgment, the honorable High Court of Delhi declared that Section 377 IPC does violate the right to dignity and privacy guaranteed under Article 21 of the constitution.[1] It also pointed out that India is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 17 of which states \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home and correspondence, not to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.\" However, this decision was overturned by a two-judge bench of the honorable Supreme Court of India in 2013 on the ground that it is the responsibility of the parliament to bring in a suitable law in order to enact changes in Section 377. It also observed that the section affected only a miniscule percentage of population and that, since 1860, only 200 individuals were prosecuted under it. With regard to misuse of the law, the Supreme Court observed that just because the police is misusing the law does not make the law invalid.[13] It must be noted that the challenge to the Delhi High Court verdict had not come from the Government of India but from private individuals. In fact, the government worked to pass the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act, which it achieved in 2012. The Act criminalized any form of sexual assault on children up to the age of 18 years, thereby reducing the ambit of Section 377 to adults. Political will can also be noted in ministers' addresses. Speaking on the sidelines of the 17th International Conference on AIDS, the then Health Minister said that a proposal for decriminalization of Section 377 was under consideration by the Government of India.[14] In June 2008, the then Prime Minister in his remarks on the release of the Report of the Commission on AIDS in Asia said \"We should work to remove legislative barriers that hinder access of high-risk groups to services. The fact that many of the vulnerable social groups, be they sex workers or homosexuals or drug users, face great social prejudice has made the task of identifying AIDS victims and treating them very difficult.\"[15] A parliamentarian, Dr. Shashi Tharoor, also made two attempts to present a private member's bill with regard to decriminalization of homosexuality which was not taken up by the legislatures.[16] Last year, a nine-judge bench of the honorable Supreme Court headed by the Chief Justice, in its judgment regarding privacy as a fundamental right, declared that sexual orientation is an essential attribute of privacy and discrimination against an individual on the basis of sexual orientation which is deeply offensive to the dignity and self-worth of the individual. It further stated that miniscule fraction of the country's population that constitutes the LGBT community is not a sustainable basis to deny them the right to privacy.[17] This remarkable judgment on privacy has provided the much-needed opportunity to revisit the honorable Supreme Court judgment of 2013. Current scenario On April 27, 2018, Mr. Arif Jafar, Director, Bharosa Trust, filed a writ petition in the honorable Supreme Court where he has sought scrapping of Section 377. His petition has received impetus as it has been tagged with similar pleas by prominent individuals, namely, journalist and noted LGBT activist Ashok Row Kavi; Executive Director of Lalit Group of Hotels Keshav Suri; businesswoman Ayesha Kapur; Bharatnatyam dancer and recipient of 2014 Sangeet Natak Akademi award Navtej Singh Johar; well-known journalist Sunil Mehra; noted chef, author, restaurateur, and TV personality Ritu Dalmia; and hotelier, writer, and historian Aman Nath. These combined petitions have been placed before a constitution bench, and the honorable Supreme Court has already issued notice to the Government of India, seeking its views on legalizing homosexuality.[11] A Corollary‚Ä¶ It may be recollected that section 309 IPC, which criminalizes suicide attempt, had also been a subject of debate in jurisprudence. Health-care professionals wanted the said clause to be removed as it hindered accesses to mental health services. The law enforcement agency however felt that in the absence of such a provision it shall be difficult to stop a person from attempting suicide for political/religious reasons. The Union of India re-enacted the Mental Health Care Act, 2017, in which Section 115 states \"... any person who attempts suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to have severe stress and shall not be tried and punished under the said code.\"[18] In effect, Section 309 IPC remains but prioritizes mental health needs of an individual over criminalization of the behavior. It would indeed be interesting to see how the judiciary and legislature deal with the much-debated decriminalization of Section 377. To conclude, the authors would like to clarify that this editorial in no way is trying to put forward any assertions or take any stand with respect to the issues related to the sexual orientation and LGBT phenomena. On the other hand, we have attempted to provide an insight into not only the historical perspective related to this topic in India, the psychosocial issues, and related consequences, but most importantly, the complex interplay of moral, social, and legal dilemmas operating in our society that have gathered steam over the last two decades, reaching a crescendo point in the current year. The outcome of the Supreme Court judgment should serve as a guiding beacon for all mental health professionals in the times to come. \"We wait with bated breaths‚Ä¶\"!",

      "abstract": "In a context of ageing human population, the question of the elderly people's sexuality, a recent phenomenon, remains without precise and obvious answer. Still, the sexuality of the older person must be viewed as the continuation of the adult's sexuality. However, it is partially or completely, depending on gender, dissociated from the concept of reproduction. Partly for this functional reason, the society estimates that the elderly person cannot feel sexual desire, are not physically attractive, therefore not desirable. Even if they felt sexual need, they would be physiologically unable. Sexuality is an integral part of the quality of life, well-being, and undoubtedly of the person's health whatever their age. It is thus important to deal with this matter from a physiological and biological point of view. Sexuality and deteriorations related to the process of ageing have to be taken into consideration. These deteriorations are not automatically linked to the increase in longevity. It is in the responsibility of health workers, professionally in charge of the elderly people, to help them better understand their desires which lies in a framework of normality. A greater knowledge of their sexuality will fight the current repression of the sexuality of the elder ones.",

First, some findings have indicated that parental alcohol abuse may be associated with the physical or sexual abuse of children. Research findings in this area remain inconsistent, however. Second, the experience of being abused as a child may increase a person's risk for alcohol-related problems as an adult. This relationship has best been demonstrated in women who had been victims of childhood abuse. Several factors most likely contribute to or influence this relationship, including coping skills; antisocial behavior; and psychological problems, such as posttraumatic stress disorder.",

We sought to characterize, by ethnic group and gender, one important spiritual concern, what happens to the soul after bodily death. <h3>Methods</h3> We conducted open-ended interviews with 26 Mexican American (MA), 18 European American (EA), and 14 African American (AA) men and women. A consensus-based content analysis identified themes. Because some subjects responded several ways about a theme, percentages may add to over 100%. <h3>Results</h3> Majorities of all groups believed the soul lives on after bodily death (see the Table). Majorities or near-majorities also expressed seemingly inconsistent beliefs that the soul both remains in the body and leaves it at bodily death. Yet clear differences arose over when, if ever, the soul leaves the body and where the soul is after bodily death. For example, subjects timed the soul9s departure from before life support stops to 15 minutes to a month after bodily death. <h3>Conclusion</h3> The ethnic-gender groups share one belief, that the soul lives on after bodily death, but differ on others. Sensitive end-of-life care requires health professionals to anticipate varying beliefs about the soul at bodily death and to adjust care accordingly. For example, professionals should time organ donation requests or invite discussions about encounters with the dead according to survivors9 beliefs.",

This paper aims to clarify the concepts of health disparities/inequalities (used interchangeably here) and health equity, focusing on the implications of different definitions for measurement and hence for accountability. Health disparities/inequalities do not refer to all differences in health. A health disparity/inequality is a particular type of difference in health (or in the most important influences on health that could potentially be shaped by policies); it is a difference in which disadvantaged social groups‚Äîsuch as the poor, racial/ethnic minorities, women, or other groups who have persistently experienced social disadvantage or discrimination‚Äîsystematically experience worse health or greater health risks than more advantaged social groups. (‚ÄúSocial advantage‚Äù refers to one's relative position in a social hierarchy determined by wealth, power, and/or prestige.) Health disparities/inequalities include differences between the most advantaged group in a given category‚Äîe.g., the wealthiest, the most powerful racial/ethnic group‚Äîand all others, not only between the best- and worst-off groups.

      "abstract": "Purpose of review The review assesses recent research and its impact on understanding of intimacy and sexuality in older adults with dementia. Recent findings There is no universally accepted definition of inappropriate sexual behaviors (ISBs), but they have been divided into overt acts associated with increased libido and uninhibited sexual behaviors directed at oneself or other people. Couples affected by dementia frequently maintain physical intimacy. Nonintercourse intimate activities may be preferred over intercourse. Early therapeutic interventions may assist partners in modifying activities, behaviors, and expectations about the future of the relationship. Inappropriate sexual behaviors are commonly due to the disruption of interconnected brain structures. Trauma to the temporal lobes may lead to hypersexuality and ISB. Trauma to the limbic system can produce changes in sexual preference. Both temporal and frontotemporal dementias, or either of them, often present with socially and sexually inappropriate behaviors. Huntington's disease can exhibit hypersexuality, pedophilia, promiscuity, and marital infidelity. The involvement of the medial striatum of the basal ganglia in this disease explains the prevalence of ISB. There is no consensus regarding first-line pharmacotherapy for ISB. Little information is known about the adverse effects. Summary Clinicians and society need to consider how dementia might affect physical intimacy.",

      "abstract": "Gender diverse sexual minority youth (SMY) must manage disclosure decisions and the related implications of disclosure for two minoritized identities. However, little is known about the patterns of outness for gender diverse SMY or how these patterns are associated with their well-being. Using a sample of 4,200 gender diverse SMY ages 13-17 years old (M age = 15.43), this paper used latent profile analysis to examine diverse patterns of outness to family (e.g., parents, siblings, and extended family) among gender diverse SMY and how various social positions (e.g., sexual and gender identity, race/ethnicity, geographic region, and age) are associated with profile membership. We also examined how gender diverse SMY's well-being (e.g., depressive symptoms and feelings of stress) differ by outness profiles. We found five profiles: Limited Outness to All Family (n = 1,791), Only Sexual Identity Out to All Family (n = 781), Sexual/Gender Identities Out to All Family (n = 705), Sexual/Gender Identities Out to Parents/Siblings (n = 699), and Only Gender Identity Out to All Family (n = 224). We found significant differences in profile membership based on sexual and gender identity, race/ethnicity, geographic region, and age. Our results indicate that youth who were out about only one identity experienced more depressive symptoms and/or feelings of stress than youth who were out about both identities. We describe implications for identity-specific interventions and programs that help youth in disclosing to their family.",

      "title": "Boarding school: the trauma of the ‚Äòprivileged‚Äô child",
      "abstract": "Sending young children to boarding school may be considered a particularly British form of child abuse and social control. The trauma of the rupture with home may be followed by other ordeals such as emotional deprivation and, in extreme cases, physical and sexual abuse. The taboo on expressing emotion, which is common in such institutions, may lead to an encapsulation of the self. Consequently, the needs of the distressed child/self remain active, but unconscious, within the adult. This maybe disguised by an armoured, and very often socially successful, persona. The psychological interplay, between these two facets of the personality, may be detrimental to intimate relationships. In clinical practice the emotional conflict between a desire for intimacy and anticipated exile comes to the fore. Three examples demonstrate how within the transference this may lead to a dependent and erotic atmosphere, which abruptly changes to sever all connection. Changes in the frame, breaks in analysis, and confessions of emotional need are all points at which vigilance is required if such disturbance in analysis is not to end in its abrupt termination.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a time of great physiological and psychological change. Individuals have to progress from the dependence of childhood to the independence and maturity of the adult state whilst they are still regarded by many adults as predominantly children. Adolescents have to cope with the central problem of identity and of motivation and ambitions. They have to come to terms with the perceptions and judgements of other people on them and often experience stress in situations where they feel they are unable to reach the ideals of themselves or of others. Relationships with the opposite sex and acceptance by friends become crucial since they are the only means of judging one's self-value until the individual has achieved a reasonable degree of confidence and self-integration. This dependence on the opinions of others or on perhaps inappropriate ideals can lead to strong feelings of insecurity or inadequacy in adolescents. Adults obviously face similar problems but the myriad of physical and physiological changes which adolescents experience serve to heighten their emotional sensitivity. As a consequence of these adjustment problems, adolescence is often a period of unrest, of questioning and sometimes of outright rebellion and hostility.",

      "abstract": "Fear of missing out (FoMO) creates a strong urge to stay continuously connected and informed about peers‚Äô activities, identified as a risk factor for problematic social media use and risky behaviors. Sexting is generally defined as the exchange of sexually suggestive or explicit photos, videos, or text messages through cell phones or other technologies. Despite its social relevance, the link between FoMO and sexting remains underexplored. This study examines their relationship in young adults‚Äîan understudied group compared to adolescents‚Äîwhile controlling for age, sex, and sexual orientation. The study surveyed 911 Italian young adults (18‚Äì30 years, Mage = 22.3, SDage = 2.57, 74% women, 70.4% heterosexual) through an online questionnaire. The results indicate that FoMO predicts only risky sexting behaviors (sexting under substance use and sexting for emotion regulation) while not influencing experimental sexting (sending one‚Äôs own sexts). Additionally, the link between FoMO and sexting for emotion regulation is stronger among LGB individuals. Therefore, FoMO has proven to be strongly related to the two kinds of risky sexting but not to experimental sexting. Understanding this relationship can inform prevention and intervention programs on relationships, online communication, and sexting in young adults.",

      "title": "Issues and challenges in sexuality and sex education in Intellectually Disabled",
      "abstract": "All human beings are sexual from birth to¬†death, and the Intellectually Disabled (ID) are not exempt from this. The issues of sexual needs and¬†sexual behaviour of the ID have been a sensitive and¬†controversial topic. Perhaps because of the taboos¬†associated with Intellectual Disability and sexuality,¬†individually or in combination, very little is known¬†about the sexuality of people with ID, but research¬†studies do indicate that it is much the same as¬†the general population, although opportunities for¬†sexual expression are limited. This article provides an overview of sexuality issues in ID, with regard to¬†sexual rights, sexual development and maturation,¬†menstruation and menstrual hygiene, masturbation,¬†petting, sexual activity, marriage, pregnancy,¬†parenting, sexual abuse, fertility and birth control, menopause, and the progress and issues in sexuality education for ID. Prior research shows that¬†individuals with ID show secondary sexual¬†characteristics and development similar to that of¬†intellectually averaged peers; those in the lower¬†range of functioning develop those characteristics¬†at a slower pace. ID children often neglect¬†menstruation and are non-co operative in menstrual¬†grooming due to poor understanding, irritability, fatigue and increased seizure. Research reports vaginal hysterectomy as management of this. They show a lower rate of offspring production than the non retarded. It is estimated that ID children are sexually victimized at 4-10 times the rate of the general population, 39-83% of girls and 16-32% of boys experience sexual abuse before they reach the age of 18. Parents and professionals are pessimistic in the sexual needs of people with IDD and consider them as asexual. There is an urgent need for development of methods to teach them about sexuality and sexual abuse prevention, since research on sex education revealed poor¬†generalization of skills to real life situations. In situ training revealed better generalization, but has the issue of causing emotional distress and dissonance among ID.",

      "title": "Sexual abuse of children and adolescents.",
      "abstract": "Parents, relatives, and friends may inflict their passions on children of the same or opposite sex. This is often initiated by sleeping together. Sexual abuse contributes to and causes emotional trauma, although the child's turmoil, confusion, wish for acceptance, and anxiety may be overlooked by the parent and professional. Mutual silence aided by threats adds to the anxiety. Despite the notion that reports of parental sexual exploitation of their children are usually fantasies, there appear to be increasing data that incest and sexual abuse are frequent traumata. At present, there is increased risk of lowering the incest barrier because of increased rates of divorce and step- or surrogate parenthood, since they provide additional potential for being sexually and emotionally traumatized. Sexual abuse seems to be part of a constellation involving neglect and a pathological symbiosis. That sexual abuse is emotionally traumatic is apparent, but it needs emphasizing. Children's defensive reactions may cloud this, and it may be years before such incidents are connected to symptomatic behavior, even when the child is in intensive therapy. In the reported cases, there appears to be a pattern of reactions and defenses related to the traumata that are embedded in imprinting and identification with the aggressor. This leads to sexual abuse being a legacy passed on to the next generation of victims, as the victim becomes the molester through identification. Adolescent self-destructive behavior may stem from guilt about sexually abusing younger children. Therapists may be better able to understand and deal with some of their patients' symptoms if sexual abuse is considered as a possible factor in one or both directions.",

Five indicators of social support were used: positive appraisal, perceived isolation, enacted social support, perceived material support, and perceived emotional support. The main results, which are cross validated across the two samples, are as follows.Most men score high on all five indicators of social support. Social relationship conflicts are either nonspecific or related to the steady partner. Isolation and lack of positive appraisal are also nonspecific or related to gay friends. Parents still function as important sources of material support. Men without a steady partner and men with low socioeconomic status experience more isolation. Single men also report less positive appraisal, while older men have less material support.",

Raising happiness within the set range can involve high self-esteem, a sense of control over life, and an outgoing, optimistic personality. In addition, the person‚Äôs view of the world influences his or her level of happiness. Flow, personal relationships, and having values and goals can also contribute.

In general divorced people have the most and married people the least health problems. Married people have less health problems than unmarried people living with a partner. Differences in mortality by marital status are smaller among women than among men. There are two explanatory theories: the social causation theory (marital status influences health) and the selection theory (health influences marital status). Both theories play a role in the explanation of the health differences. The effect of marital status on health among men is mainly mediated by psychosocial factors, whereas material circumstances are the principal intermediary factor among women. Health intervention among unmarried men should be aimed at intensifying social support from the environment, among divorced women it should be aimed at improving material conditions.",

Anger and aggression exist in all human beings, though these may remain buried, as in some passive, quiet children who may give an impression of meekness and gentility. A possible outcome is, therefore, the attempted self-destruction by the adolescent of his own body, it is as if his body is held responsible for his unbearable thoughts or his guilt feelings, or for the physical sensations that he experiences. The extent of guilt that exists is never easy to assess in any individual, but the breaking-point may be much closer in vulnerable young people than may seem to be the case at first glance.",

This project aimed to describe how sexual consent is conceptualized across the adult lifespan, drawing comparisons between young, middle-aged, and older adults. Additionally, we examined variables that may differ by age group and influence sexual consent conceptualization. In a survey, young adults (n= 266), middle-aged adults (n= 236), and older adults (n= 51) were asked to define sexual consent and complete a measure on the appropriateness of giving and receiving consent in different types of sexual relationships. Participants also reported on their exposure to formal sex education and their current sexual relationship status. More than half (57.4%) of participants included basic elements of a simple core definition (agreement in reference to sexual acts), and most (63.3%) expanded beyond a simple definition. Age groups differed significantly on variables expected to influence sexual consent definitions, including exposure to sexual education and sexual consent attitudes. Age group differences were not found when examining the simple core definition, but young adults and middle-aged adults differed significantly in their expansion on the definition. Sexual consent attitudes were also significantly related to the scope of the supplied definition. These findings suggest that sexual consent definitions vary in scope across at least a portion of the lifespan and that the importance placed on sexual consent may be a reasonable intervention target regardless of age differences in sexual experience and education.",

      "title": "Awkward but so what: Differences in social trait preferences between autistic and non-autistic adults",
      "abstract": "Autistic and non-autistic observers form less favorable impressions of autistic adults relative to non-autistic adults, yet only non-autistic adults report lower interest in socially interacting with them. This discrepancy may relate to differences in how autistic and non-autistic people value and interpret social traits, with autistic people viewing characteristics such as ‚Äúawkwardness‚Äù in neutral or positive terms rather than as a deterrent to interaction. Here, 24 autistic adults and 24 non-autistic adults rated themselves on 20 traits, their preferences for these traits in others, and their perception of them in an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù person. Autistic participants rated themselves as more awkward, less socially keen, and less socially ‚Äúnormal‚Äù than non-autistic participants. Self-ratings and preferences in others correlated on three attributes‚Äîawkward, socially keen, and socially ‚Äúnormal‚Äù‚Äîwith the autistic group demonstrating a large effect ( r = .70) for partners similar to their self-perception of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Collectively, these findings suggest that common social descriptors like awkward have different appeals for autistic people and should not be universally assumed to be undesirable characteristics. Future studies should seek to replicate these findings with larger and more diverse samples and more established measures.",

      "abstract": "Contrary to popular belief, the majority of adults over the age of 65 are physically and psychologically healthy. They are not cognitively deficient, socially isolated, or lonely, nor do they drain society's resources. They are aging well, and to the extent that they are able to engage in valued activities, they will continue to do so. A key component of adapting to growing older is the ability to maintain the sense of personal control that can be threatened by normal aging processes. The Activity Restriction Model of Depressed Affect proposes that to age successfully is to maintain physical and cognitive functioning via engagement in personally meaningful activities. Indeed, activity restriction‚Äîor the inability to continue normal activities that often follows stressful life events such as debilitating illness‚Äîis a major factor in poorer mental health outcomes. Potential contributors to activity restriction and depression are identified. Interventions to reduce activity restriction in older adults should focus on promoting manageable activities, taking into consideration individual differences in functional, psychological, and social resources.",

      "abstract": "The potential impact of traditional Latinx masculine gender norms (e.g., traditional machismo and caballerismo) on sexual identity development of Latino sexual minority men (LSMM) is an expanding area of inquiry in Latinx psychology. The purpose of this cross-sectional study is to determine whether endorsement of traditional machismo and caballerismo among LSMM vary based on their (a) sexual identity development status and (b) self-labeled sexual identity. We surveyed 499 LSMM (aged 18-57 years) across the United States via an online study. Based on correlational analyses and a multivariate analysis of variance, we describe how traditional machismo and caballerismo are related to (a) different levels of theorized sexual identity development statuses (uncertainty, exploration, commitment, synthesis/integration) as well as (b) participants' use of sexual identity labels (exclusively heterosexual/straight, mostly heterosexual/straight, bisexual, mostly homosexual/gay, exclusively homosexual/gay). Mixed results were found regarding hypothesized differences in participants' traditional machismo and caballerismo endorsement across the four sexual identity development statuses. Findings support the hypotheses that LSMM who indicate more traditional machismo and caballerismo tend to self-identify with heterosexual/straight labels compared to respondents who identify with bisexual or homosexual/gay labels. Implications for psychological research and clinical practice are discussed concerning the promotion of healthy and culturally congruent sexual identity development of LSMM.",

Few studies were available. Those most likely to have \"sexual difficulties\", among persons with vitiligo, would be those with low self-esteem. Relational problems with the opposite sex are mainly related to feelings of shame and embarrassment.

In six experiments, Implicit Association Tests (IATs) showed female + sex/male + science associations. The bias was observed (a) in both men and women; (b) in participants who reported sexual attraction to both females and males (greater for the former); (c) in members of the general population as well as among STEM faculty from the highest ranked U.S. STEM universities; (d) even when both gender categories were clearly presented as scientists, via photos and words, (e) using both the standard IAT and a single category variation; and (f) hardly at all on explicit measures in contrast to implicit measures. By introducing the attribute of sexuality, these studies bring to light a robust if unintended mental association of women as sexual beings. The automaticity and surprising generality of the effect suggests that this association may be an unintentional yet potent barrier to women's lower representation and success in STEM.",

      "abstract": "Suicidal behaviour (e.g., suicide and suicide attempt) is a multifaceted phenomenon which often draws on several social and psychological contexts. This research examines how men's suicides and attempted suicides are embedded in the contextual praxis of intimate relationships in Bangladesh. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were undertaken with family members, close relatives, and friends of 37 men who died by suicide or attempted suicide. This research's findings identify five key risk factors associated with men's suicide and attempted suicide, namely: troubles over the designated family provider's responsibilities; troubles emanating from second marriage; betrayal of loyalties; complications in non-marital relationships; and feelings of no control over wife. Each theme suggests that men who died by suicide or who attempted suicide found it challenging to balance their culturally expected (hegemonic) masculine image with their intimate relationships. Suicide and attempted suicide surfaced as a consequence of such challenges in their life. Efforts are suggested to lessen the burden on men's masculine expectations and promote an egalitarian social space in order to reduce suicide risk in men.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We explored subtle prejudice against lesbians by examining heterosexual women's tendency to distance themselves socially from lesbians. People can distance themselves socially by expressing beliefs that are dissimilar to another person's beliefs, regardless of whether they agree with the other person. We used a conformity paradigm, in which the majority was perceived to be heterosexual, and a dissenter was represented as either lesbian or heterosexual, to investigate social distancing. The majority expressed unpopular personal preferences (e.g., preference for different types of musical instruments), gave sexist responses, and did not identify as feminist; the dissenter did the opposite. The sexual orientation of the dissenter affected high-prejudiced participants' expression of personal preferences and both high- and low-prejudiced participants' expression of modern sexist beliefs and self-identification as feminist. The consequence was that participants said more sexist remarks and were less likely to identify as feminist when the dissenter was a lesbian. We discuss results in terms of prejudice and fear of association with the lesbian.",

By this I mean much more than legal sanctions or explicit prescriptions. While the formal rules governing sexual practices changed a little during the colonial period, on the whole they remained consistent: sex was sanctioned only in marriage, which meant that it had to be monogamous, heterosexual, racially endogamous, and exclusive of close kin. Even though we know that extramarital sex of many kindsmasturbation, prostitution, fornication, homoeroticism-could be allowed on a de facto basis, sexual activity outside marriage never received explicit sanction. We also know that, in marriage, forceful sexual aggression frequently received tacit permission if not outright approval. Many scholars have focused on the prohibitions or abuse; few have examined the aspirations. What was sex supposed to be about? This is a question about meaning and ideals rather than about practices and therefore becomes a cultural and intellectual question rather than a social or legal one. Once we get into the realm of normative sexual ideals we immediately encounter a closely related topic: romantic love. Indeed, historians",

Dentro do campo da sexualidade, a ejacula√ß√£o precoce pode ter v√°rias consequ√™ncias negativas na vida de um homem, incluindo: ansiedade e estresse, problemas de relacionamento, problemas de sa√∫de mental. A insatisfa√ß√£o sexual pode levar a uma diminui√ß√£o do desejo sexual, tens√£o e ressentimento em um relacionamento. Em alguns casos, pode at√© levar a uma separa√ß√£o ou div√≥rcio. Felizmente, existem v√°rias op√ß√µes de tratamento para ejacula√ß√£o precoce, os homens podem procurar ajuda de um profissional de sa√∫de e utilizar medicamentos prescritos, terapia comportamental ou uma combina√ß√£o de ambos que auxiliar√£o no tratamento desse problema.

Al√©m disso, a ejacula√ß√£o precoce pode desencadear ansiedade, estresse e baixa autoestima nos homens, afetando sua sa√∫de emocional e bem-estar geral. Outra consequ√™ncia relevante √© o impacto nos relacionamentos √≠ntimos, com a ejacula√ß√£o precoce contribuindo para conflitos conjugais, diminui√ß√£o da intimidade emocional e at√© mesmo o t√©rmino de relacionamentos. The history of human sexuality is long and complex, and is influenced by many factors, including culture, religion, politics, science, and technology. Within the field of sexuality, premature ejaculation can have several negative consequences on a man's life, including anxiety and stress, relationship problems, and mental health problems.: Sexual dissatisfaction can lead to a decrease in sexual desire, tension, and resentment in a relationship. In some cases, it can even lead to a separation or divorce. Fortunately, there are several treatment options for premature ejaculation, men can seek help from a healthcare professional and use prescription medications, behavioral therapy, or a combination of both that will help treat this problem. It is concluded that the consequences of premature ejaculation in men have negative impacts on sexual satisfaction, emotional health, and intimate relationships. Furthermore, premature ejaculation can trigger anxiety, stress, and low self-esteem in men, affecting their emotional health and general well-being. Another relevant consequence is the impact on intimate relationships, with premature ejaculation contributing to marital conflicts, decreased emotional intimacy, and even the end of relationships.",

These relationships, however, are often explained by the influence of other factors, such as unique personality traits, previous experiences, and demographic variables. The empirical literature on the effects of pornography consumption is substantial. Generalizing the findings to simple conclusions is, however, difficult. Studies conducted on the topic are inconsistent in their conceptualization and measurement of pornography and often ignore or neglect the specific content of the pornography consumed. Much as in the case of other media content, the effects of pornography consumption are dependent upon the individual and not all consumers are affected the same way. Some consumers experience positive outcomes (sexual satisfaction, increase in relationship quality), others experience negative outcomes (sexist attitudes, risky sexual behaviors).",

      "title": "Sex drive: Theoretical conceptualization and meta-analytic review of gender differences",
      "abstract": "Few spheres in life are as universally relevant for (almost) all individuals past puberty as sexuality. One important aspect of sexuality concerns individuals‚Äô sex drive‚Äîtheir dispositional sexual motivation. A vigorous scientific (and popular) debate revolves around the question of whether or not there is a gender difference in sex drive. Several theories predict a higher sex drive in men compared to women, with some theories attributing this difference to biased responding rather than true differences. Currently, there is little consensus on how to conceptualize sex drive, nor does a quantitative summary of the literature exist. In this paper, we present a theory-driven conceptualization of sex drive as the density distribution of state sex drive, where state sex drive is defined as momentary sexual motivation that manifests in sexual cognition, affect, and behavior. We conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of gender differences in sex drive based on 211 studies, 856 effect sizes, and 621,463 persons. The meta-analysis revealed a stronger sex drive in men compared to women, with a medium-to-large effect size (g = 0.69, CI95 [0.58, 0.81]). Men more often think and fantasize about sex, more often experience sexual affect like desire, and more often engage in masturbation than women. Adjustment for biased responding reduced the gender difference (g = 0.54). Moderation analyses suggest that the effect is robust and largely invariant to contextual factors. There was no evidence of publication bias. The discussion focuses on validity considerations, limitations, and implications for psychological theory and people‚Äôs everyday lives.",

Normal physiological changes with age affect erectile function and ejaculation in males, and the vaginal tissue in females. Psychological and social factors that affect sexual function in old age include the individual's degree of sexual activity throughout earlier life, the psychological resiliency in adapting to the altered physiological conditions, demographic factors, and society's attitudes towards sex in old age.

      "abstract": "Abstract Existing research on prejudice and discrimination towards disabled people (i.e. ‚Äòableism‚Äô) has conceptualized it as a general attitude, obscuring the role of social context in its manifestation. We aimed to investigate whether and how ableism manifests differently depending on the nature of the disability, the disabled person's gender and the social context of the interaction. A nationally representative sample of 2000 adults read a series of vignettes about issues faced by disabled people (e.g. employment, relationships). Vignettes varied by presence and type of disability and the disabled person's gender. Judgements about how a disabled person was treated showed clear evidence of ableism towards some conditions (e.g. autism) but not others (e.g. a spine disorder). Judgements about the actions of a disabled person were more nuanced. A disability‚Äêgender intersectionality effect was observed for judgements about romantic relationships, with physically disabled women penalized compared to men but no gender difference was observed for intellectual disability. No intersectionality or ableism was observed on a vignette about refusing poorly paid work. We find clear evidence that ableism manifests differently depending on the nature of the individual's disability, their gender and the social context, questioning previous conceptualizations of ableism as a general attitude.",

      "abstract": "According to the cross-cultural data, violence has two fundamental certainties: 1) that the overwhelming majority of perpetrators are men; and 2) that the targets are usually women. Sexual and physical abuse subsume a wide variety of violent behaviors, some of which are legally recognized as criminal acts. Evidence indicates that the most invisible of all is child sexual abuse, in which nonreporting of crime is prevalent. Although there appears to be no simplistic response to the question as to why men are violent towards women, it is noted that it involves several contributing factors. These include inequalities between women and men at the societal level, and cultural norms and expectations about behaviors of women and men at another level. In terms of the identity of the perpetrators, research has found that a large majority of perpetrators are socialized for violence. The effects of violence on the sexual and reproductive health of the victim are multiple and long lasting. For example, physical consequences of rape include sexually transmitted diseases and HIV infection, as well as unwanted pregnancy, miscarriage, unsafe abortion, homicide, and suicide. With respect to the psychological consequences, the most common symptoms are anxiety, depression, sexual dysfunction, and difficulties with interpersonal relationships. In view of this, there is a need for a long-term management of victims of sexual abuse.",

Leaving in the background the perspective that our rarities and choices do not represent, nor do they point to any kind of pathology or abnormality, therefore, they are themes that are inscribed in each subject based on singular representations.

      "abstract": "Abstract Love is a complex construct of undeniable importance for human beings and an area of research that has progressed over the past decades. The capacity to love, specifically, refers to the capacity for involvement, investment, and maintenance of a committed romantic relationship, resulting from complex developmental processes that begin in childhood and continue to be shaped throughout development. Despite its relevance, there is still little evidence of its relationships with indicators of positive human functioning. This study examines the link between the capacity to love and emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Furthermore, it delves into potential differences in the capacity to love based on life cycle stages (emerging adulthood and midlife) and gender. The research involved 535 participants, with 282 (52.7%) falling under the emerging adulthood category (18‚Äì25 years) and 253 (47.3%) classified as middle-aged adults (45‚Äì65 years). Multivariate variance analyses indicate emerging adults demonstrate a greater capacity to love in all dimensions except acceptance of loss, grief, and jealousy. Concerning gender, there were no significant differences. Prediction models indicate that age and acceptance of loss and grief are significant and positive predictors of all types of well-being, and basic trust is a significant and positive predictor of emotional well-being. Overall, this research sheds light on the vital role the capacity to love plays in human well-being and emphasizes the need for interventions that focus on nurturing and developing this aspect of human relationships.",

      "abstract": "Several hypotheses have been advanced in an effort to explain the association that several decades of research suggests may exist between animal cruelty and delinquency. First, there is the violence graduation hypothesis, which holds that animal cruelty serves as a springboard to later interpersonal violence. Then, there is the deviance generalization hypothesis, which postulates that animal cruelty is part of a larger deviance syndrome. Finally, there is the antecedent lifestyle hypothesis, which maintains that animal cruelty and behaviors like bullying have their basis in a fearless temperament, callous/unemotional traits, and a proactive antisocial attitude. The antecedent lifestyle hypothesis further contends that in some cases delinquent behavior stems either directly or indirectly from one or more of the developmental antecedents identified by the hypothesis (i.e., animal cruelty, bullying, parental defiance, fire-setting, drug use, sexual promiscuity). In the first part of this chapter, the concurrent and predictive relationships that appear to connect animal cruelty to delinquency are explored, verified, and documented. In the second part of this chapter, the violence graduation, deviance generalization, and antecedent lifestyle hypotheses are evaluated against existing data in an effort to determine which hypothesis or set of hypotheses best explains the animal cruelty‚Äìdelinquency relationship.",

But in reality, in social life, a woman often gets inhumane treatment, be it in public life or domestic life, is treated rudely, and impressed as not considered, women are very vulnerable to violence, whether physical violence, psychic violence, violence sexual even neglect of household. Or even men do not respect women in the realm of the outside or inside the dwelling. Result in a significant difference to gender equality itself. The most important and protected women's rights are freedom, being treated equally in the eyes of law, teaching and education is absolute, as well as health, legal certainty and justice and legal certainty. Social ethics arises in everyone, according to their nature and character. Human nature can be seen from their actions in treating and respecting others, especially treating the opposite sex, not in accordance with ethics and social sense, then the person is considered disrespectful to others. The literature study is the method used in this study is to have a purpose to know gender and its equality be the cause of violence against women, and its relation to social ethics. The result is a patriarchal culture that assumes that men as rulers, while women are in a weak position or are perceived as \"male\" owners, and social ethics greatly affect respect for women, where social ethics strongly determines one's behavior and how to respect and respect for women's rights.",

      "title": "Sex Differences in Affective Dysfunction and Alterations in Parvalbumin in Rodent Models of Early Life Adversity",
      "abstract": "The early life environment markedly influences brain and behavioral development, with adverse experiences associated with increased risk of anxiety and depressive phenotypes, particularly in females. Indeed, early life adversity (ELA) in humans (i.e., caregiver deprivation, maltreatment) and rodents (i.e., maternal separation, resource scarcity) is associated with sex-specific emergence of anxious and depressive behaviors. Although these disorders show clear sex differences in humans, little attention has been paid toward evaluating sex as a biological variable in models of affective dysfunction; however, recent rodent work suggests sex-specific effects. Two widely used rodent models of ELA approximate caregiver deprivation (i.e., maternal separation) and resource scarcity (i.e., limited bedding). While these approaches model aspects of ELA experienced in humans, they span different portions of the pre-weaning developmental period and may therefore differentially contribute to underlying mechanistic risk. This is borne out in the literature, where evidence suggests differences in trajectories of behavior depending on the type of ELA and/or sex; however, the neural underpinning of these differences is not well understood. Because anxiety and depression are thought to involve dysregulation in the balance of excitatory and inhibitory signaling in ELA-vulnerable brain regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus), outcomes are likely driven by alterations in local and/or circuit-specific inhibitory activity. The most abundant GABAergic subtypes in the brain, accounting for approximately 40% of inhibitory neurons, contain the calcium-binding protein Parvalbumin (PV). As PV-expressing neurons have perisomatic and proximal dendritic targets on pyramidal neurons, they are well-positioned to regulate excitatory/inhibitory balance. Recent evidence suggests that PV outcomes following ELA are sex, age, and region-specific and may be influenced by the type and timing of ELA. Here, we suggest the possibility of a combined role of PV and sex hormones driving differences in behavioral outcomes associated with affective dysfunction following ELA. This review evaluates the literature across models of ELA to characterize neural (PV) and behavioral (anxiety- and depressive-like) outcomes as a function of sex and age. Additionally, we detail a putative mechanistic role of PV on ELA-related outcomes and discuss evidence suggesting hormone influences on PV expression/function which may help to explain sex differences in ELA outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Seasonal dormancy (e.g. diapause, hibernation) is widely considered an adaptation for surviving life-threatening conditions during part of the year. However, the selective pressures acting on dormancy are poorly studied. An underestimated common aspect is the high survival rate during dormancy compared to the active period, perhaps due to the reduced risk of predation and competition. We hypothesize that dormancy phenology is influenced by a trade-off between the reproductive benefits of being active and the survival benefits of being dormant. Using a phylogenetic comparative method and more than 20 hibernating mammals, we find that the sex difference in hibernation phenology is explained by sex differences in physiological constraints that may influence this trade-off. Consistent with the trade-off hypothesis, the sex that spends more time in an activity directly associated with reproduction (e.g. testicular maturation, gestation) or indirectly (e.g. recovery from reproductive stress) spends less time in hibernation. Some of the tested parameters such as testes maturation or a late mating period during the active season also influence the sex difference in dormancy phenology among ectotherms (e.g. reptiles, invertebrates). We then gathered evidence that dormancy in non-life-threatening periods that are unfavorable for reproduction may be more widespread than previously thought.",

It has been further suggested that it is due to the stigmatization and feelings of isolation that are experienced by many gay adolescents. Much of the literature that has given support to these hypotheses has been conducted on uncontrolled nonrepresentative samples and its generalizability is open to question. An opportunity to examine the relationship in an unselected sample arose in a case control, psychological autopsy study of 120 of 170 consecutive suicides under age 20 and 147 community age, sex, and ethnic matched controls living in the Greater New York City area. Homosexuality was defined as having had homosexual experiences or having declared a homosexual orientation. Three teenagers and no controls met these criteria. The difference was not significant. The circumstances of death were examined and are described. In no instance did suicide directly follow an episode of stigmatization. All three suicides had evidence of significant psychiatric disorder before death. In spite of opportunities for biased reporting, it is concluded that this study finds no evidence that suicide is a common characteristic of gay youth, or that when suicide does occur among gay teenagers, that it is a direct consequence of stigmatization or lack of support.",

But women do not spend all (or, for some women, any) of their lives bearing children. The assumption was that even when they are not doing so, they must lead a domestic life under male protection, for they are not suited to independence. Women were seen as more emotional than men (a question still in dispute), more gullible, more likely to yield to impulse or desire, less rational - generally less in control of their reactions than men are. Much of this, to modern observers, is self-fulfilling prophecy.

      "abstract": "Abstract ‚ÄòSexual and romantic development, early parenthood, and emerging adulthood‚Äô explains that as adolescents start to become reproductively mature at puberty, interest in sexual behaviour and partnerships increases. From associating primarily with same-sex friends during middle childhood, there is typically an increased interest in relationships with the opposite sex from the early to mid-teens onwards. Some experience of same-sex sexual behaviours is also not uncommon, and a minority of adolescents will describe themselves as lesbian, gay, or bisexual. Intimate partnerships start to be formed, with sexual and romantic elements. The issues of dating violence, sexting, teenage pregnancies, and early parenthood are considered along with the extended period of development in emerging adulthood.",

      "abstract": "Asymmetries in subjective distress were observed among African American and white (N = 191) men and women who were asked to imagine a partner being emotionally and sexually unfaithful, and a partner committing other paired, gender-linked viola-tions-of-trust. More women than men were distressed by imagining a partner forming a deep emotional attachment to another person and more men than women were distressed by imagining a partner enjoying passionate sexual intercourse with another person. In addition, more men than women were distressed by male-linked violations, such as a partner no longer trying to look attractive, and more women than men were distressed by female-linked violations, such as a partner no longer wanting to work. The results contribute to a growing body of cross-cultural research reporting gender differences in distress to emotional and sexual infidelity. The results also provide cross-cultural validation of the extension of an evolutionary perspective to under-standing gender differences in subjective distress to other biologically relevant viola-tions-of-trust.",

In some cases, the homicide-suicide involves annihilation of an entire family or multiple people. The phenomenon is difficult to study in part because the perpetrator is dead and unavailable for psychiatric assessment. It is nonetheless crucial to attempt to advance our understanding of this tragic phenomenon. The literature review addresses demographic variables, proposes two classifications, one based on psychopathology, the other on the relationship between offender and victim. In attempting to understand the acts of homicide-suicide, inquiry into the following dimensions should be useful: Ego weakness. What type of psychopathology may have contributed to the homicidal-suicidal behavior? Stressors. What type of acute and chronic stressors did the individual experience leading up to this act? Vectors. Whom did the individual select to kill and why? As contribution to this phenomenon six cases of homicide-suicide had been analyzed in ten year period in the Osijek region.",

      "title": "Quantitative Description of Affiliative Relationships in Primates",
      "abstract": "Group-living primates are likely to spend a substantial amount of time grooming and resting with a small number of other group members. Such close and enduring relationships are regarded as affiliative. The properties of affiliative relationships are not fully understood and no consensus exists on how to quantitatively describe them. In this review, I explain the primate behaviors that are related to affiliative relationships and examine the means for using these behaviors to measure the relationship. Traditionally, affiliative relationships are defined by the frequency of proximity and grooming. Individuals with frequent proximity and grooming tend to perform altruistic behaviors for their partners without immediate return from them, groom each other in a reciprocal manner in the long-term, show distress and reconcile after agonistic interactions, and synchronize their behaviors with those of their partners. Thus, in addition to measuring the frequencies of proximity and grooming, these behavioral tendencies might be used as indices of affiliative relationships. Similarly, other questions concerning affiliative relationships remain unexplained. Some studies show that affiliative relationships increase reproductive success, but the mechanisms leading to fitness outcomes remain unclear. Although typically in primates, related individuals tend to form affiliative relationships, such relationships are also formed with unrelated individuals. Affiliative relationships could mitigate the negative effects of competition among individuals in large social groups and ensure that the individuals that form the relationship receive benefits from each other (e.g., agonistic support and collective mobbing). It is also unclear whether the affiliated relationships of nonhuman primates are equivalent to those of humans. Further research is necessary to elucidate similarities or differences in affiliative relationships between human and nonhuman primates.",

      "title": "A cooperative function for multisensory stimuli in the induction of approach behavior of a potential mate",
      "abstract": "Intrasexual competition is an important element of natural selection in which the most attractive conspecific has a considerable reproductive advantage over the others. The conspecifics that are approached first often become the preferred mate partners, and could thus from a biological perspective have a reproductive advantage. This underlines the importance of the initial approach and raises the question of what induces this approach, or what makes a conspecific attractive. Identification of the sensory modalities crucial for the activation of approach is necessary for elucidating the central nervous processes involved in the activation of sexual motivation and eventually copulatory behavior. The initial approach to a potential mate depends on distant stimuli in the modalities of audition, olfaction, vision, and other undefined characteristics. This study investigated the role of the different modalities and the combination of these modalities in the sexual incentive value of a female rat. This study provides evidence that the presence of a single-sensory stimulus with one modality (olfaction, vision, or ‚Äòothers‚Äô, but not audition) is sufficient to attenuate the preference for a social contact with a male rat. However, a multisensory stimulus of multiple modalities is necessary to induce preference for the stimulus over social contact to a level of an intact receptive female. The initial approach behavior, therefore, seems to be induced by the combination of at least two modalities among which olfaction is crucial. This suggests that there is a cooperative function for the different modalities in the induction of approach behavior of a potential mate.",

      "abstract": "Childhood parentification has been reported to have enduring effects on psychological, relational, and physical functioning across the life span. Few studies have examined the implications of race/ethnicity and gender on the levels of parentification. We examined racial/ethnic and gender differences in 977 American college students (81% female, 5% Latino/Latina American, 10% Black American, and 85% White American) who reported a history of childhood parentification. We also examined the extent to which current level of functioning (as indicated by self-rated depressive symptoms, well-being, and posttraumatic growth) is associated with parentification in the current nationwide sample (mean age = 21.39, SD = 5.84). Overall, we found differences in parentification scores based on race/ethnicity and gender. Males had significantly higher levels of parentification than females; this finding was consistent across all racial/ethnic groups. White Americans reported lower levels of parentification compared to Black Americans and Latino/Latina Americans, who shared similar parentification levels. Both gender and race/ethnicity affected some‚Äîbut not all‚Äîof the significant relations among study variables as well. Latino/Latina Americans appeared to receive positive psychological benefit from parentification, while this was not true of Black Americans and White Americans. Future researchers and family counselors should develop research studies and pose clinical questions that account for cultural differences in the assessment and treatment of parentification and its possible wide-ranging aftereffects. The results of the current study suggest that both the benefits and detriments associated with parentification should be considered equally in practice and research.",

It is possible that these low rates are because Asian Americans are less likely than other groups to develop developmental, motivational, and situational risk factors associated with sexual aggression. Moreover, an emphasis in Asian cultures on self-control of sexual and aggressive behavior may serve as a protective factor. Nevertheless, patriarchal aspects of Asian cultures may place some Asian Americans at risk for sexual victimization or perpetration of sexually aggressive behavior. Although Asian Americans may be at less risk for sexual aggression than other groups, interventions that counteract the patriarchal aspects of Asian cultures may further reduce risk.",

      "title": "Flying Solo at Midlife: Gender, Marital Status, and Psychological Well-Being",
      "abstract": "This study examines gender and marital status differences in psychological well-being across an extensive array of measures using data from a sample of non-Hispanic, White, midlife adult participants in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, 1992-1993 (N = 6,876). Evidence for how selection and social causation might account for differences also is evaluated. Multivariate analyses reveal several gender interactions, usually indicating a greater disadvantage for unmarried men than for unmarried women. Separate analyses by gender show a complex picture of both positive and negative effects of being single. Contrary to what the selection argument hypothesizes, single women have higher scores on relatively enduring personality characteristics associated with better psychological well-being than married women. Single men do not compare so favorably with married men. Overall, selection does not account for marital status differences in well-being. Household income and having a kin confidant mediate some of the remaining effects. Key Words: gender, marital status, midlife, personality, psychological well-being. Historically, researchers have found that married men and women report better psychological wellbeing than their unmarried peers (e.g., Gove, Hughes, & Style, 1983; Gove & Shin, 1989; Gove, Style, & Hughes, 1990; Lee, Seccombe, & Shehan, 1991). Yet despite a significant lengthening of life expectancy during this century for both men and women, younger birth cohorts of American adults are spending proportionately less of their adult lives married. This is due to historical trends toward a later age at marriage, a higher rate of nonmarriage, a higher rate of divorce, and a lower rate of remarriage (Schoen, Urton, Woodrow, & Baj, 1985). Larger proportions of younger birth cohorts are now more likely to be single (never married, divorced, or widowed) during their midlife and older years. Uhlenberg, Cooney, and Boyd (1990) project that almost one third of White women in the 1955-1959 birth cohort will be unmarried at midlife between the ages of 50 and 54, and one half will be unmarried when they enter young old age between 65 and 69. If marriage is associated with better mental health, do these demographic trends portend a proliferation of mental health problems in our future aging society? Or is there any additional evidence that might indicate that as adult single life becomes more common, it is also becoming less disadvantaged or at least not unequivocally problematic? Glenn and Weaver (1988), using data from separate national surveys conducted from 1977 through 1986, reported that the relation between being married and self-reported happiness declined during this time. Most of the decline appeared to be related to an increase in the happiness of never-married males and a decrease in the reported happiness of married females. The decline in differences in happiness between the married and the nonmarried was most obvious for younger adults (ages 19-24). Recent qualitative studies of single (both never-married and formerly married) midlife women (Anderson & Stewart, 1994; Gordon, 1994) also have suggested that mature single women are beginning to report advantages to single status, advantages such as personal autonomy and growth that have made flying solo a psychologically rewarding experience. Previous work evaluating gender, marital status, and psychological well-being has been limited by a narrow set of outcome measures. Measures of depression most commonly are employed, followed by one-item measures of life satisfaction or overall happiness. However, it has become increasingly clear that psychological well-being is multidimensional and that scoring high on both positive and negative outcome measures might be expected to occur because positive and negative psychological states are negatively correlated but are not a bipolar continuum (Bradburn, 1969; Bryant & Veroff, 1982; Ryff, 1989, 1995; Ryff & Essex, 1991; Ryff & Keyes,1995). ‚Ä¶",

Previous experience displayed a substantial effect, particularly in the upper portion of the hierarchy, with like-experienced groups showing marked similarity in their hierarchy patterns. Several significant gender-experience interactions were found regarding oral-genital behaviors, and a general trend was observed for females indicating negative appreciation from pre to postexperience. Males revealed positive appreciation from pre to postexperience on all but the most basic sexual behaviors. Conclusions were to the effect that while both variables influenced the hierarchy, effects were complex, and often mediated by additional factors.",

The probability decreases in the following order of relationships: brother/sister, best friend, acquaintance, stranger. Two hypothetical dilemmas were used to study the cultural and age differences in law-abiding orientation of 220 English adolescents and 47 English adults (mean ages in years were 15.50 and 25.83, respectively) in London, and 353 Chinese adolescents and 136 Chinese adults (mean ages in years were 16.81 and 21.24, respectively) in Hong Kong. The general findings supported the above hypotheses. Also (i) there was a positive relation between age and law-abiding orientation and (ii) the Chinese were more oriented to abide by the law than the English.",

      "title": "Anxiety increases sexual arousal.",
      "abstract": "Twelve male subjects who were trained to expect tolerance-level electric shocks viewed an erotic film under three different counterbalanced conditions. In one condition, subjects viewed erotic film in conjunction with a signal light indicating threat of shock. A second light indicated threat of shock if subjects did not achieve an erection of a certain size. A third light indicated no shock. Both anxiety-inducing shock-threat conditions increased penile response over and above np-shock-threat condition. Furthermore, shock threat contingent on size of erection produced more arousal than noncontingent-shock threat. There is an almost universal assumption that primary maintaining factor in male sexual dysfunction is anxiety, specifically, performance anxiety or fear of performance, and modal treatments employed have as a major goal reduction of this anxiety. Masters and Johnson (1970) note a number of initial etiological pathways to erectile dysfunction, such as alcohol abuse and unfortunate, early traumatic sexual experiences; but, in regard to subsequent maintaining factors, they observe that the prevalent roadblock is one of fear. Fear can prevent erections just as fear can increase respiratory rate or lead to diarrhea or vomiting (p. 196). Unfortunately, this is an assumption without evidence in either dysfunctional or normal subjects, an assumption that goes beyond careful observations that Masters and Johnson and other clinicians have made when dealing with sexual dysfunction. The few attempts to examine relationship between anxiety and sexual arousal have been puzzling. In 1977, Hoon, Wincze, and Hoon showed 2-minute film sequences that were either neutral in content or that were designed to produce anxiety (vivid scenes of auto' accidents) to normal women, These",

Hypotheses about the cause (or causes) of such behavior have ranged widely, from organic-genetic theories to the intrapsychic or interpersonal formulations proposed by psychosocially oriented therapists. These latter formulations, when applied to male homosexuality, have included such factors as unresolved oedipal problems, castration anxiety, fear of heterosexuality, fear of women, identification with the female, role confusion, and the problem of dependency.<sup>1,2</sup> There has been an increasing and presumably more sophisticated tendency to ascribe homosexual behavior to any one, or a combination, of these factors, rather than to insist upon a unitary hypothesis, eg, that all homosexual behavior is motivated by castration anxiety, or that all such behavior is an expression of psychic masochism.

      "title": "The Role of Sexual and Romantic Attraction in Human Mate Preferences",
      "abstract": "Sex differences in mate preferences are ubiquitous, having been evidenced across generations and cultures. Their prevalence and persistence have compellingly placed them in the evolutionarily adaptive context of sexual selection. However, the psycho-biological mechanisms contributing to their generation and maintenance remain poorly understood. As such a mechanism, sexual attraction is assumed to guide interest, desire, and the affinity toward specific partner features. However, whether sexual attraction can indeed explain sex differences in partner preferences has not been explicitly tested. To better understand how sex and sexual attraction shape mate preferences in humans we assessed how partner preferences differed across the spectrum of sexual attraction in a sample of 479 individuals that identified as asexual, gray-sexual, demisexual or allosexual. We further tested whether romantic attraction predicted preference profiles better than sexual attraction. Our results show that sexual attraction accounts for highly replicable sex differences in mate preferences for high social status and financial prospects, conscientiousness, and intelligence; however, it does not account for the enhanced preference for physical attractiveness expressed by men, which persists even in individuals with low sexual attraction. Instead, sex differences in physical attractiveness preference are better explained by the degree of romantic attraction. Furthermore, effects of sexual attraction on sex differences in partner preferences were grounded in current rather than previous experiences of sexual attraction. Taken together, the results support the idea that contemporary sex differences in partner preferences are maintained by several psycho-biological mechanisms that evolved in conjunction, including not only sexual but also romantic attraction.",

      "abstract": "Adolescents experience maltreatment at rates equal to or exceeding those of younger children. Recent increases in reported cases of maltreatment have occurred disproportionately among older children and adolescents. However, adolescents are less likely to be reported to child protective services and are more likely to be perceived as responsible for their maltreatment. Adolescent girls are reported as victims more often than boys, especially in sexual abuse. However, boys may be less likely to be identified or reported and often are abused by nonfamily members. Parents of adolescent victims have higher average income and educational levels and are less likely to have a parental history of abuse than parents of younger children. A wide range of serious adolescent risk behaviors is associated with maltreatment. These include increased risk of premature sexual activity, unintended pregnancy, emotional disorders, suicide attempts, eating disorders, alcohol and other drug abuse, and delinquent behavior. Incarcerated youth, homeless or runaway youth, and youth who victimize siblings or assault parents have been shown to have high rates of prior maltreatment. Signs of maltreatment are often ambiguous for adolescents. Screening questions have been effective in prompting self-disclosure of abuse. Adolescents also experience problems in the child welfare system that offers fewer and less appropriate services for this age group. Recommendations are made regarding screening of adolescents for maltreatment, the development of better services for adolescents, research on parenting to prevent maltreatment, and training of school staff to identify and refer victims of maltreatment.",

First-borns scored significantly higher in self-esteem than last-borns; only and middle-borns did not score differently from any nf the other groups. Only children exhibited a stronger internal locus of control and scored higher on the self-centeredness item than other groups. No relationship was found between sibling status and loneliness. In terms of achievement, firstand middle-borns scored more competitively than last-borns. Only and first-borns had higher aspirations than later-horns. No sibling status effects were found in the areas of mastery, willingness to work, or personal concern about the costs of achievement. Results suggest that the impact of gender and family size on these sibling status effects are areas in need of further assessment.

It may result from organic or psychological causes and can be classified as orgasmic, anorgasmic, and situational. Situational anejaculation may be present in intercourse type. This means existence of ejaculation by masturbation, but not during sexual intercourse. Performance anxiety, hostility toward the partner, dysfunctional psychosexual development, and unconscious desire to avoid pregnancy are the possible underlying conditions. We herein report situational anejaculation in 24-, 26-, 34-year-old males who presented with inability to ejaculate intra-vaginally since they got married. All of them were the sole males in their family, had a childhood in a conservative community, and had arranged marriages. Due to the negative aspects of psychosexual counselling in rural societies, it was not possible to continue the follow-up and treatment of patients. Despite this, the authors conclude that this clinical course of situational intercourse anejaculation suggests a psychological problem in these patients.",

The basic questions here are: do changes occur in sexual behaviour, sexual interest or responsiveness during the climacteric years? If so, what are the variations and how are they caused? Two variables used extensively as a measure of sexuality are coital frequency and orgasmic frequency. Kinsey et al. (1953) showed that the degree of sexual activity remained fairly constant in unmarried women up to 55 years of age. By contrast, sexual activity in unmarried men declined gradually from puberty onwards. For married men and women they found that the frequency of sexual outlets declined during the life span. Kinsey et al. emphasized that the decreasing frequency of sexual intercourse and orgasm in marriage does not prove that the sexual capacity of the woman is influenced by her own ageing but could instead be a result of her husband's ageing. These authors were of the opinion that there is little evidence of any ageing in the sexual capacity of the female until late in her life.",

Several epidemiologic studies have found no difference in the prevalence of conduct disorder in adolescence by sex. Correlates of conduct disorder in girls are similar to those in boys (including aggression and internalizing disorders), once base rates of the correlates are accounted for. A major problem in studying conduct disorder in girls is the lack of appropriate criteria; the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (3rd ed., rev.) criteria are not appropriate for girls. A case is made for sex-specific criteria for conduct disorder that take into account known differences in male and female childhood cultures and base-rate differences in aggression and criminality. Until basic issues of diagnosis and prevalence are resolved, other issues such as risk factors and developmental pathways cannot be successfully addressed.",

Three hypotheses regarding gender differences in subjective distress to sexual and emotional infidelity, and in the inferences linking the infidelities were tested. The results indicated that more men than women were distressed by imagining a partner enjoying passionate sexual intercourse with another person, and more women than men were distressed by imagining a partner forming a deep emotional attachment to another person. Asking another group of women and men to imagine a partner committing both infidelities at the same time, and then to indicate which component of the combined infidelity was the most distressing, produced the same sexual asymmetries. The prediction that men will infer from a partner's sexual infidelity the co-occurrence of emotional infidelity and that women will infer from a partner's emotional infidelity the co-occurrence of sexual infidelity was not supported. An evolutionary perspective, rather than an alternative analysis emphasizing the different inferences men and women draw from sex and love, provided a satisfactory explanation of the sexual asymmetries in the cues to jealousy.",

Minority stress theory, developed in the Global North, describes that LGBTQ people experience unique stressors (e.g., discrimination, violence, and identity concealment) that are linked to their sexual or gender identity. Although evidence suggests that these factors are important predictors of LGBTQ individuals‚Äô mental health around the world, additional studies from the Global South have shown other strong predictors of LGBTQ mental health. These factors are related to societal integration barriers, such as low social trust, unemployment, and lack of stable housing. The extent to which these barriers override or interact with minority stress to predict mental health problems remains unknown. Still, the degree to which LGBTQ individuals around the world are exposed to stigma-related stress and experience barriers to societal integration is dependent on structural factors such as discriminatory laws and policies and societal attitudes. To better assess the mental health burden of LGBTQ individuals and its determinants, higher-quality studies are needed that use representative samples of the full spectrum of LGBTQ populations from different parts of the world. Future research also must develop efficient means for distributing LGBTQ-affirmative treatments to LGBTQ populations that most need them.",

      "abstract": "Sexual minority men have consistently shown to be at-risk for adverse mental health outcomes due to minority stress, yet studies show some men successfully navigate these barriers. What is less known are the environmental and social/emotional factors to which minority stress is amplified (or attenuated). We comparatively investigate rural versus urban sexual minority men and how levels of 'outness' (the degree to which an individual discloses their sexual identity to others around them) interacts with gay-related rejection anxieties (a specific type of minority stress). Results broadly show that 1. higher levels of gay-related rejection are statistically associated with higher levels of loneliness, and 2. outness moderated this link in rural, but not urban men. In other words, higher levels of outness amplified the deleterious effects of gay-related rejection in the rural sample only. Although previous research shows mixed results in regards to how coming out affects the mental health of sexual minority men, our stratified results show that rural men may be at a higher risk for deleterious mental health with higher levels of outness. Implications from this study bolster the mental health field, particular mental health practitioners working with rural sexual minority men and the aftermath of coming out.",

      "title": "Spousal support and negative interactions among African Americans in long‚Äêterm marriages",
      "abstract": "Abstract As interventionists and policymakers aim to strengthen marriages and families, research on the nuances of romantic relationships, particularly among historically disadvantaged populations, grows more important. In its simplest form, the dynamics of a marriage consist of a combination of emotional highs and lows. Spousal support is generally a relational boon, capable of contributing to stability and happiness. On the other hand, negative interactions (e.g., criticism, unmet demands) can damage relationships and lead to instability or divorce. Although research has studied various correlates of spousal support and negative interactions, relatively little knowledge exists on these constructs among African Americans in long‚Äêterm marriages. To understand the correlates of spousal support and negative interactions among African Americans in long‚Äêterm (‚â•20 years) marriages, this study used data ( n = 200) from The National Survey of American Life Adult Reinterview (NSAL‚ÄêRIW). Our emphasis on long‚Äêterm marriages contributed to a sample that consists largely of older adults. Data analyses revealed that African Americans in long‚Äêterm marriages report high levels of emotional and instrumental spousal support and relatively low levels of negative interactions with their spouses. Gender, education, family income, and length of marriage were significantly associated with emotional and instrumental spousal support. Spousal negative interactions were associated with gender, family income, and marriage duration. Grounding policies and interventions in research that considers what strong couples have done well is an important first step toward building more strong, healthy relationships in underserved communities.",

The purpose of the study was to describe sexual interest and cohabiting relationships and to analyse the influence of personality and biological factors on these phenomena. An increased sexual interest or activity and frequent changes of cohabiting partners are two common characteristics of male alcoholics but these two phenomena are not interrelated. A decreased sexual interest is reported by only a minority of male alcoholics. The alcoholics with several previous cohabiting relationships stand out as being aggressive and hard drinking. The alcoholic with an increased sexual interest makes an opposite impression. He is non-aggressive, socially adjustable and unafraid of close interpersonal relations. When decreased sexual interest or activity occurs in male alcoholics, it is mainly a result of hormonal changes. Low levels of male and high levels of female sex hormones are common in these men.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This study was designed to determine whether or not equity considerations are important in couples' sexual relations. To answer this question, 53 newlywed couples were interviewed about their sexual relationships. Two main hypotheses were tested: (a) Men and women who feel their relationships are equitable will be more content (less distressed) than people who feel either overbenefited or underbenefited. (b) Men and women who feel equitably treated will have more satisfying sexual relations than those who feel either underbenefited or overbenefited. Some support for both hypotheses was obtained. Specifically, couples in equitable relationships were more content with their relationships and with their lives in general than other couples. In addition, equitably treated men and women were more satisfied with their sexual relationships overall than were other couples. They felt most loving and close after sex and assumed their partner felt that way too. While equitable couples did not say they felt more satisfied immediately after a sexual encounter than did other couples, they believed their partners were unusually satisfied. Reasons why these findings, though providing some support for the equity paradigm, must be interpreted with caution are discussed.",

For example, where a person lacks capacity to enter into sexual relations, the local authority may have to undertake very close supervision of the individual to ensure that the opportunity for sexual relations is removed. The common law test for capacity to consent to sexual relations was considered in X City Council v MB, NB and MAB. Pre-Act case-law also drew parallels with the test for capacity to marry in holding that capacity to consent to sexual relations is \"issue specific\", that is, it is a question directed to the nature of the activity rather than to the identity of the sexual partner. A decision that a person has the capacity to consent and engage in sexual relations may not necessarily be the end of the matter.",

      "abstract": "Structured interviews with 3.5-12-year-old children and their mothers were directed at documenting the development of 4 psychological categories of food rejection. The first to appear is rejection based purely on sensory characteristics, usually taste ( distastes ). Rejection based purely on anticipated harm following ingestion appears next (danger). Finally, the oldest children and adults show rejection based on the idea of what something is or where it comes from. This ideational type of rejection further differentiates into affectively laden rejections of substances that become offensive ( disgusts ) and more neutral rejections of substances as simply not food (inappropriate). A critical psychological feature of disgusting substances in adults is that they are \"contaminants\": they render an otherwise liked food inedible if present even in trace amounts, or if associated with a liked food. Contamination sensitivity is not present in the younger subjects, and appears gradually in the age range studied. Young children are unaware of the physical chemistry of solutions (e.g., diffusion and its lack of reversibility) and therefore do not show a \"contamination response.\"",

      "abstract": "The study is concerned in the first place with an investigation of evidence for clan exogamy during the period of the Brahmanas, an the allied question of relationship-terminology. In the second place it deals with an elucidation of the complex problem of the Vratyas. An intermediary chapter is devoted to a description of the social and functional groups. Finally, a discussion of the available evidence for 'sapinda' restrictions is added. With regard to clan exogamy the word 'Aril in the Rgveda is of particular significance. 'Jana' and 'jami in the Brahmanas have also been found to be of similar importance in as such as the former signifies the marriage- able exogamous group and the latter the non-marriageable group. In the context of relationship-terminology the words 'agredidhisu' (the woman wooed before) 'didhistrpatil (the husband of 'agredidhisu') 'parivitta' (the unmarried elder brother) 'parivividana' (the younger brother married while the elder brother remains a bachelor) 'anujavara' (the posthumous son, or the younger brother of inferior status) 'bhrarvya' (the brother-in-law) and 'sajata' (fellow-clansman), are analysed. Amon the social and functional groups the distinction between those of the 'Taksan' and the 'Rathakgra' has be-n noticed. In dealing with the problem of the 'Vratyast', firstly former contributions in this field have be n reviewed in detail. Secondly, previous suggestions in connection with the etymologioal explanation of the word Vratyal have been considered. Thirdly, it has been pointed out that the 'Viatya' book of the Atharvaveda is, in all probability, compiled from fragments of a lost Brahmana text. Fourthly, the references to the 'Vratyas' in the Tandya and Jaiminiya have been duly noted and inter-pretations hitherto proposed, scrutinised. Lastly, the conolusion is arrived at, that the 'Vratyas were non-Brahmanical Aryans, possibly similar to the Ksatriyas, and having alien ritual practices. In conclusion it has been conjectured that the passage in the Satapatha bearing on 'Sapiada' restrictions ex-presses diapproval of the marriage-practice to which it refers.",

The rather negative image of the menstrual cycle which prevails is incorrect, and obscures the benefits which it offers. The empirical work which now exists provides a rigorous basis for a changed perception of the whole cycle. Throughout the cycle there is evidence of biologically-determined fluctuations in nervous system activity, which in turn are related to psychological and behavioural changes. There are now findings which clarify the relationship between these natural fluctuations in nervous system activity on the one hand and, on the other, in changes in mood, social interaction, and perception of self and of personal problems. There are in addition studies which demonstrate how the less propitious arousal levels can be changed by, for instance, moderate exercise or muscle relaxation; also how optimal advantage can be taken of those fluctuations which predispose to positive outcomes. At a time of increasing applications of empirical findings to the improvement of health and well-being, the reproductive cycle can be seen as one vehicle for improving the quality of life of many women.",

      "abstract": "Our society normally regulates a certain range of activities; it is illegal to perform these activities unless one has received prior permission to do so. We require automobile operators to have licenses. We forbid people from practicing medicine, law, pharmacy, or psychiatry unless they have satisfied certain licensing requirements. These general criteria for regulatory licensing can certainly be applied to parents. First, parenting is an activity potentially very harmful to children. The potential for harm is apparent: each year more than half a million children are physically abused or neglected by their parents. Many millions more are psychologically abused or neglected not given love, respect, or a sense of self-worth. The results of this maltreatment are obvious. Abused children bear the physical and psychological scars of maltreatment throughout their lives. Far too often they turn to crime. They are far more likely than others to abuse their own children. Even if these maltreated children never harm anyone, they will probably never be well-adjusted, happy adults. Therefore, parenting clearly satisfies the first criterion of activities subject to regulation. This discussion is abhorrent and needs to be supplanted with a more child-centered view. Parents who hold this view may well maltreat their children. If these parents happen to treat their children well, it is only because they want to, not because they think their children deserve or have a right to good treatment. Moreover, this belief is manifestly at odds with the conviction that parents should prepare children for life as adults. Children subject to parents who perceive children in this way are likely to be adequately prepared for adulthood. Hence, to prepare children for life as adults and to protect them from maltreatment, this attitude toward children must be dislodged. As I have argued, licensing is a viable way to protect children. Furthermore, it would increase the likelihood that more children will be adequately prepared for life as adults than is now true.",

Depressive symptoms are highest among the never married, and differences from the married greatest, at the lowest levels of income. As income increases these differences are eliminated.

Women's emancipatory potential cannot be realized through accumulation of contrasting characteristics (e.g., emotionality vs. achievement orientation, etc.). The context of women's daily life in household, family, among friends and acquaintances and the professional work related to this sphere is usually not more closely analyzed, even though women (dissatisfied and protesting) clearly relate to this sphere and are oppressed by its everyday routine. The problems of the female role are neither made comprehensible nor explained sociologically through the contradictory structures of this sphere; rather, they are usually attributed to the specific socialization training process of the young female child, in which girls, as compared to boys, experience less encouragement to be independent, more parental care, less cognitive and social pressure to establish unique identities (independent of their mothers) and more hygienic training.",

So much so that you can be exposed to stress anytime, from home, business life, to the street, in traffic. This situation has made stress a part of modern life. Any situation or event, such as losing a close person, workplace stress, or even living in isolation at home during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, can also be a source of stress. Responses that occur in the organism to the stress stimulus are for the benefit of the organism up to a certain level. However, when the duration and intensity of the stress stimulus increase, pathological conditions occur in all physiological systems. Long-term exposure to stress may cause infertility in men by causing decreases in sperm parameters such as sperm quality, sperm concentration, spermatozoid count, and sperm percentage. Various substances are being researched to reduce these adverse effects of stress on the reproductive system. Studies have shown that melatonin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and so on. It shows positive efficacy in male infertility with various mechanisms.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Gender dysphoria (GD) is defined as a marked incongruence between their experienced or expressed gender and the one they were assigned at birth. Case summary: A 17-year-old male from low socioeconomic status presented with repeated inclinations to be dressed up and move like a female for the past 11 years and for past 3 months with sleep disturbance, low mood and loss of interest in surroundings, and occasional passive death wishes. There was no physical ambiguity regarding his male sex at birth. During early age, he preferred to play with girls and enjoyed the role, wearing their traditional clothes without getting any sexual pleasure in doing so. Due to this behavior, he was criticized continuously by his father and faced strong opposition from all his relatives when he expressed his wish to become a transgender. He was diagnosed with Gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults with mild depressive episode and treatment was initiated. Discussion: GD occurs when an individual strongly believes that he or she was born with the body of the wrong sex. People suffering from GD were prone to serious illnesses ranging from emotional distress, depression, isolation, and in worst cases, suicide. Hence, there is an urgent need to create awareness to perceive gender expression as a continuum reducing the burden of mental health problems associated with GD. Conclusion: GDD is a difficult condition to deal and treat, especially in individuals with orthodox and low socioeconomic backgrounds.",

      "title": "The problem of medical officer recruitment in agricultural industry.",
      "abstract": "All developing countries have difficulty in persuading doctors to opt for service in rural areas. This problem is shared by the agricultural industries. Two factors play a major role in this: isolation and the lack of a career structure. Isolation is an unavoidable accompaniment to rural practice. It can be considered as isolation from amenities, social isolation and professional isolation. The doctor in the rural area is often deprived of all urban amenities e.g. suitable shopping facilities, entertainment, cultural amenities and suitable leisure pursuits. Most of all, perhaps, he has major difficulties in educating his children. The maintenance of friendships and family connections is made difficult. There is a lack of suitable social intercourse for himself and his wife, a lack which very often leads to his wife's unhappiness and his own resignation. Professional isolation is serious and reflects adversely after a time on his professional ability. It may be that he only sees a colleague at long intervals and there is no stimulus towards keeping up to date professionally, and no opportunity to talk out professional and ethical problems. In many agricultural industries there is no career structure and therefore no scope for the good, ambitious doctor. This is particularly true of small, single-ownership plantations. It is clear that there is nothing to attract a good doctor to a place where he may remain at the same status for the rest of his professional career. It is suggested that only by the creation of a service structure within agricultural industries, which will create opportunities and within which means can be found to alleviate the effects of isolation, can a solution be found to the recruitment problem.",

From that point onward, however, the pattern of female sexual desire becomes increasingly consistent with the adaptation principle. What sets older women apart from younger women and men of all ages?

Fakultas Hukum Universitas Brawijaya Email: Rosanabila95@gmail.com Abstract KUHP tidak ada pengaturan perbuatan persetubuhan, namun ada kemiripan secara menyeluruh terkait pengaturan yang ada. Karena dalam pasal 292 masih terdapat batas usia untuk korban maupun tersangka dan tidak menyebutkan adanya perbuatan persetubuhan melainkan perbuatan cabul yang dilakukan sesama kelamin. Sedangkan dalam pengaturan lain, dalam Undang-Undang Qanun Jinayah Aceh No. 6 Tahun 2014 disebutkan dalam istilah Islam, yaitu istilah lain untuk homoseksual secara yuridis. Selain itu Qanun Aceh juga memiliki kesamaan dalam peraturan yang terdapat di Luar Negeri yaitu di Malaysia. Namun persetubuhan yang dilakukan oleh homoseksual yaitu dengan cara seks oral atau seks anal. Karena pasangan homoseksual hanya memperoleh kenikmatan saja dan tidak dapat menghasilkan keturunan. Atau yang berhubungan dengan badan seseorang misalnya : meraba-raba atau mencium-cium organ tubuh manusia. Kata Kunci: Kriminalisasi, tindak pidana, persetubuhan sesama jenis Abstract The Criminal Code does not regulate intercourse, but there is a general resemblance to the existing arrangements. Because in article 292 there is still an age limit for the victim and the suspect and does not mention the existence of the act of intercourse but the lewd acts committed by fellow sex. Whereas in other arrangements, in Aceh's Qanun Jinayah Law No. 6 Year 2014 is mentioned in Islamic terms, another term for homosexual juridically. In addition, the Aceh Qanun also has similarities in the regulations contained abroad namely in Malaysia. But copulation done by homosexual is by way of oral sex or anal sex. Because homosexual couples get only pleasure and cannot produce offspring. Or related to a person's body for example: groping or kissing human organs.

      "abstract": "This paper explores how people (n = 1,093) who identify as asexual or on the ace spectrum (i.e., graysexual, demisexual) define sex behaviorally using a list of 22 specific behaviors and assesses their lifetime behavioral histories and interest in future engagement in these activities. Lifetime behavioral history was also compared to each individual's personal definition of sex. Asexual, demisexual, and graysexual groups defined sex similarly. Although there were significant group differences in behavioral histories, almost all had engaged in behaviors included in their personal definition of sex. There was little interest in engaging in \"sex\" in the future (~4% asexual and graysexual groups, ~12% demisexuals, p < .004). Reasons for or against engaging in these behaviors in the future were explored qualitatively. The most common reasons were classified as \"Emotional connection,\" \"Partner interest,\" and \"Disinterest-Disgust,\" with significant group differences noted. Disinterest-Disgust was the most frequently cited reason for the asexual group (43%). Emotional Connection was the most frequent reason for the graysexual (40%) and demisexual (69.3%) groups. Findings highlight the heterogeneity of the ace community with regard to history of and interest in sexual behaviors and the importance of distinguishing between wanting and being willing to engage in sexual behaviors across the ace spectrum.",

      "abstract": "It is not well known how a person's sexuality and personality develop in tandem, especially throughout the critical years of adolescence when sexual behaviors in close relationships become increasingly widespread. In this paper, the researcher used a variety of longitudinal studies to examine the relationship between the maturation of a person's sense of self and their sexuality from childhood through young adulthood. Those who scored higher on the extraversion scale were also more likely to engage in traditional sexual behaviors, for instance, going out on dates. However, less conventional sexual behaviors were associated with less pleasant, less conscientious, and more neurotic personalities. In addition, the researcher uncovered evidence of correlative effects, with sexual experiences being associated with increases in extraversion and neuroticism and decreases in agreeableness. There was a genetic link between sexually typical behaviors and extroversion and a genetic link between sexually specific behaviors and affective personality traits. Common environmental influences predominantly accounted for correlations between sexually non-normative behaviors and personality and sexual behaviors and attributes linked to behavioral control. These findings draw attention to two personality processes that contribute to and shape adolescent sexual development: those governed by emotion regulation through genetics and those governed by shared environmental influences on behavioral regulation mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Background: As people live longer, there is increasing potential for mental disorders to interfere with testamentary distribution and render older people more vulnerable to ‚Äúundue influence‚Äù when they are making a will. Accordingly, clinicians dealing with the mental disorders of older people will be called upon increasingly to advise the courts about a person's vulnerability to undue influence.Method: A Subcommittee of the IPA Task Force on Testamentary Capacity and Undue Influence undertook to establish consensus on the definition of undue influence and the provision of guidelines for expert assessment of risk factors for undue influence.Results: International jurisdictions differ in their approach to the notion of undue influence. Despite differences in legal systems, from a clinical perspective, the subcommittee identified some common ‚Äúred flags‚Äù which might alert the expert to risk of undue influence. These include: (i) social or environmental risk factors such as dependency, isolation, family conflict and recent bereavement; (ii) psychological and physical risk factors such as physical disability, deathbed wills, sexual bargaining, personality disorders, substance abuse and mental disorders including dementia, delirium, mood and paranoid disorders; and (iii) legal risk factors such as unnatural provisions in a will, or provisions not in keeping with previous wishes of the person making the will, and the instigation or procurement of a will by a beneficiary.Conclusion: This review provides some guidance for experts who are requested by the courts to provide an opinion on the risk of undue influence. Whilst international jurisdictions require different thresholds of proof for a finding of undue influence, there is good international consensus on the clinical indicators for the concept.",

      "title": "Jealousy and Violence",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The evidence linking jealousy to violence is reviewed. The violence of jealousy is predominantly vented on the partner rather than the actual or supposed rival. Men are responsible for the majority of the killings and serious injuries resulting from jealousy, though this may reflect less a quality of male jealousy and more the qualities of male aggression. A number of the judgements constitutive of jealousy are associated with feelings and predispositions to behave which impel the jealous individual towards aggression. In morbid jealousies the risks of violence occurring appears to be increased. There is a tradition in Common Law courts of regarding jealousy either as a potentially mitigating factor or as laying a basis for both mental health defences and a defence of provocation. It should be remembered, however, that in those who resort to violence when jealous it is often not the quality of the jealousy which is critical but the individual's other characteristics such as impulsiveness, insensitivity and substance abuse. Keywords: jealousy, violence, aggression, morbid jealousy, legal defences INTRODUCTION Sexual Jealousy is part of the experience of most adults at some time in their lives, and for many it creates significant disturbance and distress. Jealousy is all too often associated with threats and violence directed at the suspected partner. This paper will address the problems created by the violence of jealousy. The contribution of jealousy to domestic violence and spousal homicide will be discussed but it is important to remember that violence usually emerges from a complex concatenation of influences in which jealousy may be prominent, but is rarely of itself sufficient. Jealousy is common and infidelity is common, but violence, though far too common, occurs in only a minority of such cases with killing as an extreme rarity. Jealousy may well be the prime motivation for an act of violence but this still leaves open why this individual, on this particular occasion, resorted to force. In considering the forensic implications of an offender's jealousy, it is not just a matter of establishing whether that jealousy is part of a mental disorder or considered morbid in it's own right, it is also a question of the relevance of such jealousy to the pleas being advanced. JEALOUSY & DOMESTIC VIOLENCE In a recent community study of jealousy 15% of both men and women reported that they had, at some time, been subjected to physical violence at the hands of a jealous partner (Mullen & Martin 1994). The role played by jealousy in both initiating domestic violence and in attempts by perpetrators to justify their violence cannot be overstated. In a study carried out in Scotland nearly half of the 109 battered women interviewed identified their partner's excessive possessiveness and sexual jealousy as the typical precipitant of violence (Dobash & Dobash 1980). Two thirds of the women at a refuge for battered women in the London area reported that their partner's excessive jealousy was the primary cause of the violence and that in many cases the partner's suspicions were entirely Without foundation (Gayford 1975, 1979). Studies from North America produced similar results with for example Hilberman and Manson (1977) reporting that extreme jealousy contributed to the violence in most of their group of 60 battered women; and Rounsaville (1978) noted similar findings with 52% of the battered women listing jealousy as the main problem and no less than 94% naming it as a frequent cause. Interesting in one of the few studies to ask men why they battered their partners, they most often nominated anger at supposed infidelity (Brisson 1983). Whitehurst (1971) reporting on 100 cases of spousal violence noted in newly every case, the husband appeared to be responding out of frustration at his inability to control the partner, and that the overt accusation was that the partner was sexually unfaithful. ‚Ä¶",

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper discusses lessons about sexuality and eroticism gleaned from those who engage in extraordinary sex, even though such relationships have typically been classified as pathological. What can clinicians learn from those who seek and attain uncommon sexual relations? Such individuals' sexual epistemology, goals, understanding of the nature and spectrum of sexual and erotic relations, communication strategies and ‚Äúoutcome‚Äù criteria can provide valuable lessons for those who treat sexual problems or aim to overcome sexual mediocrity. For example, while traditional sex therapy often focuses on what is on the surface, some SM participants are interested in the meanings that lie at a deeper level. Whereas conventional clinicians may focus on enabling particular sexual acts (especially heterosexual intercourse), SM participants are more apt to be concerned with the varied spectrum of underlying purposes motivating these acts. Whereas many couples are willing to settle for merely functional sex, SM practitioners may be more interested in contact that necessitates intense, erotic connection; sophisticated communication of subtle differences in intent; and eventuates in profound self-knowledge and transcendent levels of intimacy. Illustrative case examples are provided.",

      "abstract": "American mountain sheep are neotenic or paedogenic, depending on their sex. The rams have a juvenile (neotenic) period lasting 5 to 6 years after sexual maturation, during which they develop physically and mature behaviorally. Rams almost double in body weight after sexual maturation, increase their horn mass, grow darker in color, and lose the white fur on belly and legs, grow less gregarious, become more polished in the social behavior by increasing display patterns and reducing aggressive and sexual patterns, and act more \"brave\" with age. They reach ultimate development and maturation between 7 and 9 years of age. Females are paedogenic since they remain frozen in development at the level of sexually mature yearling rams. Females possess two behavioral states: in estrus they act like young males, but in anestrus they act like sexually immature sheep. Sheep attain strong sexual dimorphism as a consequence of the postpuberal growth of males. The slow behavioral maturation of rams, which is paralleled by physical development, suggests that the quantitative expression of social behavior is a factor of the rams' physical development; the quantitative similarities in behavior between young rams and estrous females suggest that this view is valid.",

However, upon reviewing the available empirical literature with respect to epidemiologic. post mortem, risk factor, follow-up, family, twin, adoption, biological, and therapy studies, this postulated close relationship could not be confirmed. Factors such as presence of any psychiatric disorder and personality traits such as impulsivity, aggressivity, addiction and suicide/suicide attempts in first degree relatives. as well as divorce, separation and parental discord, all seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of suicidal behaviour. Furthermore, treatment studies with antidepressants, ECT, and lithium have only been able to demonstrate an antisuicidal effect for lithium. It remains an open question whether these factors play a independent role from depression or whether these factors have to be seen as additional to the depression. as operating factors for the development of suicide ideas. suicide attempts and suicide.",

      "abstract": "Penelitian ini dilatarbelakangi oleh maraknya hubungan sejenis yang terjadi pada saat sekarang ini atau yang biasa disebut dengan LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Biseksual dan Transgender). Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mendeskripsikan bagaimana ciri-ciri dari perilaku homoseksual dan apa faktor yang menyebabkan perilaku itu bisa terjadi.\r\nPenelitian ini merupakan penelitian deskriptif kualitatif, yang terdiri dari informan kunci dua orang pelaku homoseksual, dan informan tambahan tiga orang, yaitu satu orang pasangan dari pelaku homoseksual dan dua orang lagi teman dari pelaku homoseksual. Data dikumpulkan melalui pedoman wawancara dengan analisis data, yaitu reduksi data, penyajian data, dan verifikasi.\r\nHasil penelitian mengungkapakan bahwa: (1) Ciri-ciri dari perilaku homoseksual adalah memiliki empati yang tinggi terhadap wanita, diperoleh hasil bahwa pria homoseksual akan merasa kasihan ketika melihat wanita yang sedang bersedih apalagi wanita yang disakiti oleh pria, hal tersebut terjadi karena pria homoseksual merasa jiwanya sama dengan wanita. Pria homoseksual selalu menggunakan pengharum tubuh yang aromanya memikat. Pria homoseksual menyukai fitnes karena mereka ingin membentuk tubuhnya agar terlihat indah. (2) Faktor penyebab perilaku homoseksual adalah faktor lingkungan pergaulan yang tidak baik. Pengalaman homoseksual pada masa remaja atau kecil merupakan faktor yang membuat mereka menjadi homoseksual karena sewaktu kecilnya mereka pernah mendapatkan pelecehan seksual oleh pria. Hasil penelitian ini direkomendasikan kepada para pelaku homoseksual, para remaja dan masyarakat, agar lebih berhati-hati bergaul dan memilih lingkungan pergaulan agar dapat terhidar dari perilaku penyimpangan seksual.",

Psychoanalysis has paid little attention to the meaning of defloration to either women or men, and virtually none to the hymen as a part of the female genitalia. The reasons for this disregard or avoidance are explored. Utilizing the few psychoanalytic writings, mythology, literature, and anthropological studies in addition to numerous clinical examples, the authors find that the unconscious meanings of the loss of virginity and the hymen emerge clearly. The common theme is that of negation, never, never again, never seen, known or named. Theoretical considerations regarding female sexuality are discussed. Technical implications for analyst-patient are presented.",

For both sexes, the mixed sex sibships had the most negative outcome at the conclusion of therapy, although differences were small. Control analyses indicated that sex is not independently related to any given measure of psychiatric impairment or outcome, nor is there any sex bias in the direction of high or low impairment when sibship type is controlled. Thus, the differences in psychiatric status observed in these data appear to be associated with the combination of sex and sibling sex distribution.",

      "abstract": "Kinship stands at the center of our very existence as human beings, and so does the language we use to refer to different forms of kinship. The Swedish language is strongly gendered in the area of family and romantic/sexual partnership, and based on a constructivist view of language the established vocabulary might contribute to the constitution and perpetuation of normative systems regarding gender and sexuality. The naturalization of heterosexuality and binary cisgender is strongly connected to linguistic practices on several different levels, one of them being individual words and phrases such as gendered pronouns and another being presuppositions manifested linguistically, such as: ‚ÄúWhat is his name?‚Äù when a woman mentions her partner. For my research article, I asked 35 Swedish-speaking persons currently living in Finland about their linguistic practices concerning personal reference to partners and family members, focusing on gendering. The informants all define either their relationship(s) or their family structure (or both) as not conforming to the normative, most of them being non-heterosexual women. Interestingly, genderneutral words were more commonly used than gendered ones when referring to a partner (although no one mentions a non-binary partner), something that may either manifest a tendency toward gender neutral language usage or a wish to avoid homophobic reactions. The act of ‚Äúcoming out‚Äù by gendered reference to a partner is mentioned several times. In family structures beyond the normative, the informants and their family members had developed their own ways of referring to each other when the vocabulary is insufficient, and a few of the parents discussed the issue of using gendered language in reference to children. Overall, the informants seemed used to linguistic problem solving as a consequence of their identities and everyday practices clashing with the Swedish language.",

      "abstract": "This chapter addresses four reasons for the neglect of the study of pleasure in sexology: conceptual complexity, physiological complexity, political complexity, and the medical model myth of the naturalness of sex. There is nothing about pleasure dysfunction in the official medical sexual nomenclature, for example, and there's nothing in university-level or medical sexuality texts about the physiological bases of pleasure, cultural differences in pleasure, or the psychological development of pleasure. Only some use the term \"pleasure\" to describe experiences such as slipping into cool water on a hot day or tasting a spoonful of a perfect flan or hearing a Mozart concerto or dancing the samba. As psychocultural history kicks in, experiences get hooked to meanings: and pleasures and can move far beyond the sensory or sensorimotor. Physiological sex research on people has necessarily used non-invasive methods and different endpoints, and some surprising results have emerged.",

      "abstract": "The factors of the educational environment that have a depriving effect on participants in the educational process of both sexes in the form of unequal treatment, harassment, restrictions, exclusions or preferences, hidden or overt discrimination, any manifestations of gender-based violence have been analyzed in the article. At the macrosocial level the subject of analysis of gender deprivation in education is gender perceptions as a reflection of the state gender policy in general and the educational level in particular has been revealed. At the level of intergroup interaction there are gender stereotypes, at the level of interpersonal relations there are gender guidelines, at the intraindividual level there is a gender identity. Gender relations of participants in the educational process are considered as real practices and models of intersex interaction, determined by gender perceptions, prejudices, stereotypes, social rules, which are reflected in the minds of subjects. Gender bias is analyzed as social rules with negative and distorted content, as a prejudised opinion towards the representatives of one or another sex, which reflects the common norms of gender-specific behavior. Three components in the structure of gender bias: cognitive which is unreasonably biased, irrational thoughts about men/women in general or about their ability to be successful in some areas or unsuccessful in others; affective which means rejection, humiliation, underestimation, negative feelings towards members of one or another sex; behavioral which is connected with destructive, negative behavior towards them have been distinguished. The need to study the gender deprivation in education from the standpoint of different psychological approaches in the context of a comprehensive analysis of deprivation conditions, deprivation factors, the consequences of being brought up or living temporarily in such conditions and ways of their resocialization and integration into society in the process of socio-psychological support has been emphasized. The importance of systematic monitoring and finding diagnostic indicators of gender deprivation in the education system in order to prevent the deprivation of subjects of the educational process and create a gender-sensitive educational environment has been established.",

      "title": "Social and Environmental Determinants of Health Among People With Disabilities",
      "abstract": "There is extensive evidence that people with disabilities experience significantly poorer health than their nondisabled peers. These are, in part, health inequities (differences in health status that are avoidable, unjust, and unfair) resulting from increased rates of exposure of people with disabilities to a range of well-established social (and environmental) determinants of poor health, including poverty, reduced access to effective education, lack of employment or employment under hazardous or precarious conditions, social disconnectedness, violence, discrimination, and poor healthcare. They also include environmental determinants of poor health that are a direct result of human activity (e.g., outdoor air pollution resulting from industrial processes and transportation). In addition, people with disabilities are often less likely than their peers to have access to many of the resources (power, wealth, social support, problem-solving skills) that have been linked to increased resilience in the face of adversity. As such, it would appear reasonable to expect that the health of people with disabilities is as likely, if not more so, to deteriorate, when exposed to social determinants, than the health of their nondisabled peers. Future research needs to focus on two key issues. First, given that most of the current evidence has been generated in high-income countries, it is critical for future research to focus on the situation of people with disabilities living in middle- and low-income countries. Second, more needs to be known about the determinants of the resilience and/or vulnerability of people with disabilities. Some significant limitations remain in the current evidence base, but it is clear that existing knowledge is sufficient to drive and guide changes in policy and practice that could reduce the health inequities faced by people with disabilities. These include (a) improving the visibility of people with disabilities in local, national, and international health surveillance systems; (b) making ‚Äúreasonable accommodations‚Äù to the operation of healthcare systems to ensure that people with disabilities are not exposed to systemic discrimination in access to and the quality of healthcare; and (c) ensuring that people with disabilities are included in and benefit equally from local and national strategies to reduce population levels of exposure to well-established social determinants of health.",

Some spoke enthusiastically of embracing sexual freedom and pleasure within a perceived changed culture, resulting in frequent partner change; however, many found themselves ‚Äòre-engaging‚Äô with their sexual careers within an unfamiliar gendered landscape. Lacking an (ageing) body confidence led to the prioritisation of intimacy over STI risk; condoms were viewed as being for birth control and therefore mostly unnecessary, or linked with casual sex and lack of trust. STIs were commonly considered to be a young person‚Äôs concern. <h3>Discussion/conclusions</h3> Information provision alone will not be enough to counter the complexities of navigating the dramatically different sexual landscape these older adults find themselves within compared to their youth, particularly those who have emerged from long-term relationships.

      "title": "THE GENDER SYSTEM AND INTERACTION",
      "abstract": "‚ñ™ Abstract The gender system includes processes that both define males and females as different in socially significant ways and justify inequality on the basis of that difference. Gender is different from other forms of social inequality in that men and women interact extensively within families and households and in other role relations. This high rate of contact between men and women raises important questions about how interaction creates experiences that confirm, or potentially could undermine, the beliefs about gender difference and inequality that underlie the gender system. Any theory of gender difference and inequality must accommodate three basic findings from research on interaction. (a). People perceive gender differences to be pervasive in interaction. (b). Studies of interaction among peers with equal power and status show few gender differences in behavior. (c). Most interactions between men and women occur in the structural context of roles or status relationships that are unequal. These status and power differences create very real interaction effects, which are often confounded with gender. Beliefs about gender difference combine with structurally unequal relationships to perpetuate status beliefs, leading men and women to recreate the gender system in everyday interaction. Only peer interactions that are not driven by cultural beliefs about the general competence of men and women or interactions in which women are status- or power-advantaged over men are likely to undermine the gender system.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Unwed pregnancy in young women was conceptualized as a motivated goal interactively determined by both personality and situational factors. The primary behavioral correlate indicat_-e of this predisposition is inadequate use of readily available birth control techniques (D.C.) for the sexually active female. In addition, sex frequency and the situational variable of degree of stability of the sexual relationship were also expected to be related to the_motivation for motherhood. If this model is appropriate, then significant interactive differences should be found in fantasies about having children as a function of these variables, with stronger motivation (more fantasy) expected in inadequate B.C. users, involved in higher sex frequency, in more stable relationships. In addition to the obvious fantasy effects, it was expected that motivational differences of the same sort would also be reflected by measures of sex role style and gender identification on a more unconscious level. Subjects were 129 sexually active unmarried college women. The evidence is supportive of the hypothesis that unwed pregnancy is a motivated event rather than simple bad luck. Conclusions also concern themselves with the possibility that situational events (stability of relationships) may change personality structure. (Author)",

Munculnya isu isu emansipasi perempuan, tuntutan atas kemitra sejajaran laki laki perempuan, juga didasarkan atas terjadinya, baik objektif maupun subjektif, ketidakadilan. Ketidakadilan yang dirasakan kaum perempuan, sehingga memunculkan isu feminisme, termanifesasi dalam hal: Pertama, adanya perbedaan sistem imbalan dan penghormatan atas pekerjaan berdasarkan perbedaan laki taki perempuan. Kedua, terjadinya sub ordinasi pada perempuan, di mana perempuan selalu diposisikan sekelas di bawah laki-laki atau bahkan hanya menjadi bagian dari laki laki. Hal ini tidak hanya terjadi pada kehidupan individu, bahkan sosial organisasi kemasyarakatan yang akhirnya berimplikasi dalam kehidupan yang lebih luas. Ketiga, terjadinya stereotype terhadap jenis kelamin tertentu sehingga menimbulkan diskriminasi dan ketidakadilan. Bahwa laki laki pasti atau setidak tidaknya cenderung mengandung nilai nilai positif sementara perempuan sebaliknya. Keempat, kekerasan terhadap perempuan, baik kekerasan fisik seperti perkosaan, pemukulan sampai ke bentuk yang lebih halus seperti pelecehan dan penciptaan ketergantungan. Kelima, keyakinan bahwa peran gender perempuan adalah mengelola rumah tangga, maka banyak perempuan menanggung beban kerja lebih banyak dan lama dibandingkan dengan laki laki. Penelitian ini bertujuan merumuskan wacana yang berkembang dalam Efika Sosial yang membahas peran otonomi perempuan sebagai manusia. Selanjutnya diteliti sejauhmana otonomi itu mempengaruhi penentuan peran perempuan selaku makhluk sosial. Terakhir dilakukan refleksi filsafati atas realitas peran perempuan yang sesungguhnya dalam masyarakat. Bahan atau material penelitian, bahan dari penelitian ini adalah kepustakaan yang meliputi buku buku dan artikel tentang etika sosial dan moral, tentang perempuan dan permasalahannya serta kasus kasus menyangkut masalah perempuan yang terclapat dalam buku buku, artikel majalah majalah, jurnal jurnal, surat surat kabar, serta kasus kasus aktual dan faktual di lapangan yang dapat ditemukan. Prosedur pelaksanaan, inventarisasi kepustakaan Menganalisis dan mensintesiskan antara konsep otonomi manusia sebagai sistem normatif moral ke dalam penentuan peran perempuan oleh yang bersangkutan dengan menggunakan. unsur unsur metodis dalam penelitian filsafat. Menulis laporan. Penelitian ini menggunakan model penelitian masalah aktual. Unsur unsur metode yang digunakan meliputi : (1) Interpretasi, (2) Koherensi intern, (3) Holistika, (4) Kesinambungan historis, (5) Heuristika, (6) Deskripsi. Hasil penelitian didapatkan penciptaan manusia berdasarkan jenis kelamin laki laki dan perempuan, merupakan rahasia alam dalam rangka mendukung hidup dan melangsungkan kehidupan manusia dalam arti khusus dan kehidupan alam semesta dalam pengertian yang luas. Laki laki dan perempuan bukan dalam pengertian konflik melainkan bersifat komplementer, saling berpasangan dan saling mengisi kekurangan. Nilai nilai universal yang menyangkut penciptaan manusia, martabat manusia, seringkali ditafsirkan oleh para laki-laki dalam masyarakat patriarkhi, sehingga seringkali terjadi bias yang merugikan jenis kelamin perempuan. Kalau masih dalam batas perbedaan kodrati, tidak memunculkan masalah serius. Namun yang banyak teradi justru muncul stigma baik buruk, benar salah berdasarkan jenis kelamin, sehingga muncul norma yang mendukung munculnya ketidakadilan. Penelitian ini masih merupakan hasil pembacaan buku atau literatur, diperlukan penelitian lapangan pada kondisi sosio kultural tertentu yang dapat mendukung hasil penelitian literatur. Diperlukan kesadaran akan otonomi manusia sebagai kualitas tertinggi kemanusiaan, sehingga manusia dapat hidup secara adil dan dapat membangun masyarakat manusia yang adil. Serta menghilangkan sikap tidak rasional dalain mensikapi perbedaan jenis kelamin.",

      "abstract": "Summary. Central conflicts in woman-to-woman psychoanalysis seem to harbour a higher aggression factor than in the case of man-to-woman analysis. This paper examines central aggressive conflicts between patient and analyst, situated in a field charged by tensions between the considerable potential for understanding ‚Äúfrom woman to woman‚Äù and the intense aggression engendered by transference and counter-transference. Exemplary case sequences from the author‚Äôs own practice are used to illustrate the various aspects of this issue. Some more recent psychoanalytical concepts regarding the mother-daughter relationship (but also Freud‚Äôs reflections on the same subject), with its characteristic features and difficulties form a theoretical framework for evaluating the clinical material. The hypothesis is put forward here that the specific intensity and quality of female aggression in analysis in which both participants are women sometimes manifests itself as soon as certain critical threshold situations or junctions in the mother-daughter relationship are revived. In pathological cases, this intensified aggression can be traced back to the specific illness constellation or to other influential factors, but even in the absence of a pathological constellation, the aggression derives above all from the specific character of the pre-oedipal mother-daughter relationship. The constellation of the ‚Äúlesbian complex‚Äù, moreover ‚Äê according to the author‚Äôs hypothesis ‚Äê does not contribute to an escalation of aggression but acts rather toward moderating its intensity.

Prior work has typically investigated essentialism regarding broad domains (e.g., gender rather than maleness/femaleness). Using the example of morality, the current work asked whether individuals view different components of 1 domain (goodness/badness) differently and whether such views might influence behavior. Five- to 8-year-olds reported more essentialism than adults; however, both children and adults viewed goodness in more essentialist terms than badness. Although views of morally relevant characteristics in general did not significantly predict generosity (Study 1), essentialist views of the recipient did influence generosity (Studies 2 and 3). Adults shared fewer resources than would be expected by chance with people whose badness was described in essentialist terms (and consequently more resources than would be expected by chance with people whose badness was described in nonessentialist terms), an effect that did not appear to be driven by demand characteristics and that persisted even when both descriptions explicitly noted that the character would always remain bad. Although adults reported less essentialism than children, essentialist descriptions appeared to influence their behaviors more. This work highlights the need to investigate essentialism regarding specific domain components (e.g., goodness/badness) in addition to the domain overall (e.g., morality), partially because essentialism impacts behavior differently across components. Findings also suggest that emphasizing situational factors contributing to wrongdoing and a transgressor's ability to change may benefit people when they have committed moral violations.

      "abstract": "Emerging adulthood is a developmental period characterized by the exploration, shaping, and negotiation of many aspects of identity, including religiousness and spirituality, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Such aspects of one‚Äôs identity have implications for psychological and sexual well-being. Previous research has indicated that religiousness/spirituality, sexual orientation, and gender identity may have implications for sexual well-being and sexual distress. However, the intersectional relationships between these aspects of identity and sexual distress among emerging adults have yet to be investigated. Accordingly, the current study examined the role of religiousness/spirituality, sexual orientation, and gender identity in predicting sexual distress in emerging adults. A sample of 266 adults aged 18‚Äì30 years old completed an online survey assessing sexual distress, various dimensions of religiousness/spirituality, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Multiple hierarchical regression analysis indicated that minority sexual orientation and four dimensions of religiousness/spirituality (daily spiritual experiences, forgiveness, religious and spiritual coping, and religious support) significantly predicted greater sexual distress. These results indicate that sexual distress is minimally influenced by sexual orientation, thus suggesting that specific aspects of religiousness/spirituality may be important for buffering against sexual distress among emerging adults.",

      "abstract": "Events that occur early in the life of birds greatly influence social and sexual preferences throughout the course of life. Traditionally, this is explained by a learning process known as imprinting. Young birds are thought to imprint to early stimuli, causing the development of permanent preferences for those stimuli. In the present study, imprinting is examined with respect to behaviors of an adult human-reared pigeon in several conditions. The subject was either presented with no stimulus, a conspecific stimulus, a novel stimulus, a human stimulus, or the human and novel stimuli simultaneously. Several phases within these conditions were employed to pinpoint the variables that produced the most social and sexual behavior. The results showed that while some conditions produced unclear behavior, other conditions produced very clear indications of sexual preference for humans and fear of conspecifics. The results suggest that the concept of imprinting may not be needed to explain the sexual preference of the subject, and that operant contingencies may play a large role in sexual behavior.",

What is at stake is brought out by considering certain objections to father‚Äêdaughter incest and certain features of taboos. The objections that matter do not depend on social ties and distinctions having a biological basis, but there is nonetheless a biological element in incest taboos. To see it, one must look to the nature of the Oedipus complex, and to the conditions for the development of the individual and of society. There may be prohibitions which are necessary (to morality, to society, to humanity) even though they may not be justifiable within a narrower conception (e.g. utilitarian) of morality and justification. And so taboos which are universal (occur, in one form or another, in every society), and absolute (allow no questioning), and impose strict liability (allow no excuse), may not be irrational: they may mark the boundaries that shape a way of life.",

      "title": "An immunoreactive theory of selective male affliction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Males are selectively afflicted with the neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders of childhood, a broad and virtually ubiquitous phenomenon that has not received proper attention in the biological study of sex differences. The previous literature has alluded to psychosocial differences, genetic factors and elements pertaining to male ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù and relative immaturity, but these are not deemed an adequate explanation for selective male affliction. The structure of sex differences in neurodevelopmental disorders is hypothesized to contain these elements: (1) Males are more frequently afflicted, females more severely; (2) disorders arising in females are largely mediated by the genotype; in males, by a genotype by environment interaction; (3) complications of pregnancy and delivery occur more frequently with male births; such complications are decisive and influence subsequent development. We hypothesize that there is something about the male fetus that evokes an inhospitable uterine environment. This ‚Äúevocative principle‚Äù is hypothesized to relate to the relative antigenicity of the male fetus, which may induce a state of maternal immunoreactivity, leading either directly or indirectly to fetal damage. The immunoreactive theory (IMRT) thus constructed is borrowed from studies of sex ratios and is the only explanation consistent with negative parity effects in the occurrence of pregnancy complications and certain neurodevelopmental disorders. Although the theory is necessarily speculative, it is heuristic and hypotheses derived from it are proposed; some are confirmed in the existing literature and by the authors' research.",

Measures of sexual nonrestraint and sexual expression are compared for boys and girls in childhood and adolescence. A measure of sexual freedom was created by summing sexual expression and sexual nonrestraint. The authors predict and show that measures of sexual behavior in childhood and adolescence will have a stronger correlation in societies where differentiation from childhood is low. Most societies impose more restraint in later childhood than in earlier childhood and in adolescence rather than in childhood matching restraint with physiological maturation of children. Most societies show no sex differences in sexual freedom but those which do generally show more freedom for boys than girls. Societies tend to have greater differentiation from childhood to adolescence for boys than for girls. In other studies not limited to adolescence sexual freedom in adolescence was highly correlated with measures of premarital sexual behavior.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Disorders of sex development (DSD) are relatively rare conditions with diverse pathophysiology, which usually present in the newborn or adolescent periods. These conditions are very heterogeneous and can present in a variety of different ways, most commonly with ambiguous genitalia noticed in the newborn period or delayed puberty in adolescents. The impact of these disorders on the lives of these patients and their families should not be underestimated. These clinical situations can often be difficult to manage, particularly in those cases where the sex of rearing is uncertain. The needs of each individual patient presenting with DSD conditions must be fully considered, along with the needs of their families and where appropriate, cultural practices. The multidisciplinary team should be involved from early in the diagnosis and ethical principles must be considered at all stages of management of the condition. Key Concepts: Disorders of sex development usually present in the newborn or adolescent periods. There are three broad groups of DSD: sex chromosome DSD; 46,XY DSD and 46,XX DSD. Where there is uncertainty about the sex of a patient, sex assignment should be delayed until appropriate investigations have been carried out. A multidisciplinary team should be involved from an early stage. The psychosocial implications of a diagnosis of DSD must be considered for the family and the patient.",

      "title": "Psychosexual problems.",
      "abstract": "Individual anxieties about sexuality remain surprisingly repetitive despite changing public attitudes toward sexuality. This discussion includes case histories which demonstrate the indirect presentation, using nonverbal and physical cues, adopted by some patients who experience difficulty in verbalizing their sexual problems. When seeking contraceptive consultation, the patient must have no conscious or unconscious anxiety about her desire for sexual pleasure without pregnancy and is entitled to assume, when seeking such advice, that the doctor who offers it has no such prejudices either. When the presenting symptom relates to otherwise illogical contraceptive difficulty, or otherwise invites examination of the genitals, one may suspect that the problem may be sexual and too difficult to express in other than the physical language the patient expects the physician to want. For a couple whose sexual life is comfortably confident and provides pleasure, any contraceptive method will serve its purpose of removing the fear of pregnancy. Such a couple may be advised on logical grounds. For the rest, an open-ended comment such as \"I wonder what the real worry is\" usually leads to the true anxiety. Yet, at this point, the doctor's anxiety often replaces the patient's since the management of psychosomatic disorders is not part of normal medical training. The temptation to send for the partner and advise a program of relearning, or to make referral to a sex therapy clinic which will do likewise, is strong for any busy doctor who has no psychosexual training. Skill in dealing with such common dilemmas in the context of the brief period allotted to each patient cannot be obtained from a short article, but it is worthwhile for a physician, confronted with a patient whose symptoms do not make sense, to ask what the symptom itself may indicate in terms of the unspoken problem at hand. Most family doctors who understand the training of the Institute of Psychosexual Medicine find their brief psychosomatic approach more appropriate to their everyday work than time-consuming behavioral sex therapy and more appropriate to patients who present their problems in the surgery. Such patients usually are troubled with their individual vision of their personal sexuality. Those who have no inclination for such training will make more accurate diagnoses if they are aware that nonverbal clues may say more than words and that referral to a colleague trained in psychosexual medicine may be more fruitful than one which only reinforces the patient's sense of inadequacy and abnormality.",

Self-disclosure was identified as a fundamental aspect of intimacy in interpersonal relationships and marriage. Expression of affection, compatibility, cohesion, identity, and the ability to resolve conflict were also considered important aspects of intimacy. Sexual satisfaction was considered less important than previous definitions of intimacy have suggested. The perception of his or her parents' level of intimacy was thought to influence the subject's own interpersonal relationships. Couples with marital maladjustment and/or psychiatric illness were less aware of aspects of their marriage which influence intimacy. They more frequently disagreed that sexuality influenced their level of intimacy. The study suggests that self-disclosure and parental interpersonal intimacy may be fundamental factors in marital adjustment which merit further research.",

      "abstract": "The relational patterns and behaviors that are experienced during adolescence and young adulthood are influential for reproductive health outcomes and set the stage for future family formation choices and behaviors. In order to better understand the extent to which the relational context influences behavior within relationships, it is imperative that researchers first explore these relationships in a more comprehensive manner than has been done previously. Using the retrospective sexual relationship histories of young adults from the most recent wave (2001-2002) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), this paper provides a detailed description of young adults‚Äô nonmarital sexual relationships and explores young adults‚Äô relationship histories. Findings suggest that the characteristics of the nonmarital sexual unions that are formed during the early life course are quite diverse. The type of relationship (defined as cohabiting, exclusively dating, frequently but not exclusively dating, dating once in a while, and having sex only) and other features of these sexual relationships (e.g., duration, age difference between partners) differ depending on the gender, race/ethnicity, and age of the young adult. Additionally, some patterns of associations across racial/ethnic groups and age categories differ for women and men. Moreover, the features of these sexual relationships vary across the different relationship types. Finally, a number of individual-level sociodemographic characteristics are associated with having experienced certain types of relationship histories. In particular, there are enduring effects of family background and religious denomination during adolescence that differ for women and men.",

In some respects, the most surprising aspect of the scientific study of sex is the fact that it has taken place at all, that theories have been formulated and tested, and that empirical data have accumulated in a rapidly accelerating fashion over the last century. Human sexuality may be interwoven with love and many other splendored things or with hate and other totally nonsplendored things, but in either event it also remains a matter of some quite specific physical structures and functions. If biosexology can be characterized as emphasizing the similarities across species and among individuals, sociosexology takes a different conceptual set and emphasizes the differences.

Further, different ways of looking at marriage are reflected in the use of particular content themes. A typology of content themes was derived from transcripts of conversations and the typology was used to code the discussions of married couples. The content themes of different marital types (i.e., traditional, separate, and independent) and more and less satisfied spouses were compared. As expected, traditional couples emphasized communal themes, such as togetherness, and separate couples emphasized individualistic themes, such as personality and separateness. Although the effects of marital satisfaction were not consistent, satisfaction tended to be positively associated with communal and impersonal themes and negatively associated with individual themes.

      "abstract": "Although early sexual initiation and childbearing are major barriers against the upward social mobility of American adolescents, particularly those who belong to a low socioeconomic status (SES) and racial minorities such as Blacks, less is known on how SES and race correlate with adolescents‚Äô sex hormones. An understanding of the associations between race and SES with adolescents‚Äô sex hormones may help better understand why racial, and SES gaps exist in sexual risk behaviors and teen pregnancies. To extend the existing knowledge on social patterning of adolescents‚Äô sex hormones, in the current study, we studied social patterning of sex hormones in a national sample of male and female American adolescents, with a particular interest in the role of race and SES. For this cross-sectional study, data came from the baseline data (wave 1) of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, a national longitudinal prospective study of American adolescents. This analysis included 717 male and 576 female non-Hispanic White or Black adolescents ages 9‚Äì10. The dependent variables were sex hormones (testosterone for males and estradiol for females). Independent variables were age, race, family marital status, parental education, and financial difficulties. For data analysis, linear regression models were used. Age, race, parental education, and financial difficulties were associated with estradiol in female and testosterone levels in male adolescents. Associations were not identical for males and females, but the patterns were mainly similar. Low SES explained why race is associated with higher estradiol in female adolescents. Marital status of the family did not correlate with any of the sex hormones. Being Black and low SES were associated with a higher level of sex hormones in male and female adolescents. This information may help us understand the social patterning of sexual initiation and childbearing. Addressing racial and economic inequalities in early puberty, sexual initiation, and childbearing is an essential part of closing the racial and economic gaps in the US.",

Participants were informed that both men were cat persons, dog persons, heterosexual, adopted, or gay, or were unlabeled. Participants rated the men less masculine when cat persons than when dog persons or unlabeled, and less masculine and more feminine when gay than when anything else or unlabeled. The more masculine man received lower feminine ratings when a dog person than when a heterosexual, and higher masculine ratings when a dog person than when unlabeled. Labels did not affect likability. Overall, the gay label consistently promoted cross-gender attributions, the dog person label encouraged somewhat heightened gender-appropriate attributions, and the cat person label allowed for normative attributions.",

Ada beberapa tahapan pada masa remaja, salah satunya adalah remaja akhir. Pada tahap remaja akhir terdapat banyak perubahan yang akan muncul sebagai bentuk pengembangan diri, diantaranya mengenal lawan jenis, jatuh cinta, dan mulai berkembangnya alat reproduksi. Salah satu faktor terjadinya pernikahan dini di Bangka Belitung disebabkan oleh seks pranikah. Teknik pengumpulan data pada artikel ini menggunakan studi kepustakaan. Dengan menggunakan perspektif psikodinamika dan teori psikoseksual yaitu adanya dorongan dan kebutuhan seksual yang harus terpenuhi, serta pengaruh emosional yang menjadi faktor utama seseorang melakukan dan menyalurkan aktivitas seksualnya. Hal ini berkaitan dengan hasil penelitian yang mengungkapkan bahwa perilaku seks bebas tidak hanya disebabkan oleh faktor lingkungan tetapi juga didorong oleh diri sendiri. Selain itu, individu yang melakukan hubungan seks pranikah cenderung mengalami kerentanan dan mengganggu fungsi sosial. Adolescence is a very vulnerable period. At the adolescent stage, individual personalities and characters begin to form. There are several stages in adolescence, one of which is late adolescence. At the late adolescence stagemany changes will appear as a form of self-development, including knowing the opposite sex, falling in love, and starting to develop reproductive organs. One of the factors in the occurrence of early marriage in Bangka Belitung is premarital sex. The data collection technique in this article uses a literature study. By using a psychodynamic perspective and psychosexual theory, namely the existence of sexual urges and needs that must be met, as well as emotional influences which are the main factors for a person to carry out and channel sexual activity. This is related to the results of research which reveals that free sex behavior is not only caused by environmental factors but is also driven by oneself. In addition, individuals who have premarital sex tend to experience vulnerability and interfere with social functioning.",

      "title": "Explanations of pedophilia: review of empirical research.",
      "abstract": "This article reviews empirical research to discover what support exists for theories that attempt to explain why adults become sexually interested in and involved with immature children. These theories are first organized into four basic categories: (1) congruence-why the adult has an need to relate to a child; (2) sexual arousal-why the adult could become sexually aroused by a child; (3) blockage-why alternative sources of sexual and gratification are not available; or (4) disinhibitionwhy the adult is not deterred from such an interest by normal prohibitions. The review shows (1) that the best experimental research has been directed toward establishing that pedophiles do show an unusual pattern of sexual arousal toward children, although no good evidence yet exists about why this is so; (2) a number of studies have concurred that pedophiles are blocked in their social and heterosexual relationships; (3) the use of alcohol is well established as a disinhibiting factor that plays a role in a great many pedophile offenses; (4) at least one study gives support to the emotional congruence idea that children, because of their lack of dominance, have some special meaning for pedophiles; and (5) there is evidence that many pedophiles were themselves victims of pedophile behavior when they were children. The article also demonstrates that pedophilia research is, in general, characterized by some serious theoretical and methodological flaws. As a result, caution should be exercised in generalizing findings until more careful research is undertaken. This article reviews the empirical evidence concerning theories of pedophilia. Many theories have been proposed,l-4 but there exist few comprehensive reviews of the problem that have looked at these theories in the light of empirical research, a gap that this article will try to remedy.",

Furthermore, this perspective proposes that sexuality includes diverse sexual behaviors and cognitions. The normative perspective informs understanding of adolescent sexual milestones. Most individuals first engage in sexual behaviors, which may include anything from kissing to penetrative sex, during adolescence. In addition to these behaviors, sexual self‚Äêconcept, including sexual identities and sexual desire, usually develops during this same period. These components of sexuality have implications for physical, mental, and relationship health. Although adolescents may be at higher risk for experiencing negative outcomes of sexual behavior than younger and older individuals, many adolescents also experience positive outcomes, including better‚Äêquality relationships and less psychological distress. Understanding normative sexual development has led to policy shifts in sexual education, including recent trends away from abstinence‚Äêonly education in favor of more comprehensive programs.",

      "abstract": "This article systematically reviews the characteristics of child maltreatment among Asian Americans and provides a theoretical explanatory framework. The reported rate of child maltreatment among Asian Americans is disproportionately low. A high rate of physical abuse and low rates of neglect and sexual abuse are found among Asian American victims. Some protective factors (e.g., the emphasis on family harmony and reputation and the indulgence to infants and toddlers) may lead to low probability of child maltreatment among Asian Americans. Some others (e.g., parental authority and beliefs in physical punishment) may be risk factors of child maltreatment, especially physical abuse. Meanwhile, many other coexisting factors (e.g., children's obedience to parents and families' invisibility to authorities) may prohibit child maltreatment from being disclosed. Therefore, the overall low reported rate of child maltreatment among Asian Americans may be a combination of low incidence and underreporting. Implications for practice and research are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Romantic partners often regulate their emotions and affection to achieve certain goals, but research has yet to explore how partners regulate their expression of sexual desire during sex and its implications for couples' well-being. In two multi-part dyadic diary studies of primarily mixed-gender couples in longer-term relationships residing in North America, we examined three questions. First, is amplifying desire and suppressing disinterest during sex associated with both partners' daily sexual and relationship satisfaction? Second, do these associations differ by level of sexual desire and gender? Third, tested in our second sample, can these associations be explained by feelings of sexual inauthenticity? Across both samples (Ntotal = 225 couples, 450 participants), amplifying desire was associated with lower sexual satisfaction, while suppressing disinterest was not associated with daily satisfaction. Importantly, sexual desire played a role in the links between desire regulation during sex and satisfaction: on days when people were low in sexual desire, amplification was associated with both partners' lower sexual satisfaction, while suppression was associated with a partner's higher relationship satisfaction. In addition, amplification (on low desire days) and suppression (regardless of desire level) were associated with lower sexual authenticity which, in turn, was linked to lower relationship satisfaction. The findings suggest that desire regulation during sex plays an important role in couples' daily sexual satisfaction and relationship satisfaction-in part because it feels sexually inauthentic-with the implications of this regulation being particularly strong when people feel low sexual desire.",

      "abstract": "Criminal behavior undermines both social and individual security. Exploring the motivational process in criminal acts focuses on searching for the sources of these acts and determining the factors that sustain criminal activity. Crime is not a homogeneous phenomenon, which makes the motives for crime diverse and complex.&#x0D; Criminological theories explore the causal factors of crime such as biological (including genetic), sociological (social), and psychological. A criminal act can be caused by an unformed drive, frustration, and be learned, including through following others. In the process of determining the motives for criminal behavior, it is not enough to point to direct motives because motivation should be approached as a process, which indicates the possibility of the development of motives over a certain time, and even many years. Thus, it is necessary to take into account socialization, personality traits (the level of aggressiveness, directiveness, and dominance), psychological needs (especially those unmet), and values, which, in a sense of responsibility, often can be considered anti-values.&#x0D; The major crimes against health and life are homicide, fights, and battery. In addition to ordinary murder, the Polish Penal Code lists aggravated murder (e.g., with extraordinary cruelty or as a result of motives deserving special condemnation) and privileged murder (committed under the influence of strong agitation justified by the circumstances), which can also be referred to as murder of passion. Fights and battery can be committed with or without the use of a dangerous object.&#x0D; A review of the literature indicates the following motives for homicide: robbery (economic), sexual, emotional, delusional, revenge, threat, insult, sense of harm, and jealousy. Perpetrators of fights and battery may be characterized by component factors of antisocial personality disorder as specified by DSM-5, such as non-compliance with legal and social norms, impulsivity, irritability, aggression, irresponsibility, and lack of guilt.&#x0D; In the case of crimes against life and health, it seems reasonable to identify several motives for the act. Motives are assessed primarily by a clinical interview. However, it should be taken into account that the perpetrators of these acts, for a variety of reasons, may obstruct justice.",

      "abstract": "A self‚Äêfulfilling cycle, in which negative stereotypes of aging create environments where the physical and psychological decline of aging develops and perpetuates the stereotypes, is proposed to occur. Seventy‚Äêtwo individuals were presented with written descriptions of an elderly person who did or did not have control over relocation to a family member's home or an institution. It was predicted and found that subjects did not hold negative attitudes to aging per se but such attitudes were influenced by negative environmental conditions (un controllability and institutionalization) associated with aging and which have been found to actually promote physical and psychological decline. Negative attitudes toward aging may not merely reflect the aging process, but may be determinants of both the experience of aging and general attitudes toward the aged.",

As a socio-cultural being, the female actor is consciously and/or unconsciously responsive to this condition. This responsiveness can affect her focus on the performance, and in turn, inhibit the performance body. In other words, if the female actor is overly concerned about securing the wellbeing of her socio-cultural body by taming her performance body, she may not be able to reach her potential in the artistic treatment of the character. In most cases, the female actor attempts to defend her socio-cultural body during a performance and as a result of this, generate signs that are not congruent with the role/situation.",

      "abstract": "Healthy sexual functioning plays pivotal role in maintaining the harmony and happiness in marital life. It provides a media to express love, strength, happiness of mind and it is the base for all activities. In Kama Sutra, Acharya Vatsayana has given more importance to fore play, before actual sexual intercourse.¬† The success of happy sex life in males depends on a desire to indulge into an act that cultivates into sexual arousal, penile erection and effective foreplay, followed by the sexual congress for a considerably long satisfactory duration. If all sequenced well the act ultimately results into the ejaculation coupled with organism that gives an individual a sense of physical as well as emotional wellbeing. A man who is full of stresses of life and lost his manhood is accepting his failure and undergone depression resulting into divorce. Man is surrounded by various types of diseases as a result of industrialization and modernization. If these conditions coupled with disturbed sleep and habits like cigarette smoking and tobacco chewing are identified as risk factors for sex related disorders and unhealthy conditions which are becoming more and more common now-a days. Male sexual dysfunction affects 10-25% of middle-aged and elderly men. It is estimated that in 1995 there were over 152 million men worldwide who had Erectile Dysfunction and in 2025 the number of men will be approximately 322 million, an increase of nearly 170 million men. Demographical changes, the popularity of newer treatments and greater awareness of sexual dysfunction by patients and society have led to increased diagnosis and associated health care expenditures for the management of this common disorder. The search for a perfect aphrodisiac drug specially a herbal formulation mentioned in Bhaysajya Ratnawali, an Ayurvedic Samhita was prepared, which consist of Aswagandha ( Withenia somnifera Linn), Vidarikanda ( Pueraria tuberosa DC) and Shatavari ( Asperagus racemosus Wild) churna mixed with equal quantity to evaluate the clinical effect in 68 male diagnosed pateints of klaibya (Group A) and Placebo was given to 32 male diagnosed patients of Klaibya (Group B). Total 100 patients Klaibya completed the full course both Group A & Group B. The result of this herbal formulation showed statistically significant improvement in sexual symptoms (by IIEF Questionnaires) and hormonal parameters in randomized double blind placebo control study.",

There is limited knowledge of whether this difference is driven by biological sex or gender identity. Transgender individuals, whose birth sex and gender identity are incongruent, provide a unique opportunity to address this question. We tested whether the genital responses of 25 (female-to-male) transgender men followed their female birth sex or male gender identity. Depending on their surgical status, arousal was assessed with penile gauges or vaginal plethysmographs. Transgender men‚Äôs sexual arousal showed both male-typical and female-typical patterns. Across measures, they responded more strongly to their preferred gender than to the other gender, similar to (but not entirely like) 145 cisgender (nontransgender) men. However, they still responded to both genders, similar to 178 cisgender women. In birth-assigned women, both gender identity and biological sex may influence sexual-arousal patterns.",

Using a sample of youth formerly in the foster care system (n = 219), this study compared the sexual well-being, sexual identity development, and negative sexual health outcomes of racial/ethnic minority and non-racial/ethnic minority youth and found that racial/ethnic minority and non-racial/ethnic minority youth did not differ in overall levels of sexual well-being and had no significant differences in their levels of sexual identity development. There were differences in incidence of the youth or a partner having an STI/STD. These results indicate that there are few differences in sexual well-being, negative sexual health outcomes, or sexual identity development between racial/ethnic minority and non-racial/ethnic minority youth formerly in the foster care system. All four domains of sexual identity development predicted sexual well-being for non-racial/ethnic minority youth, but sexual orientation identity uncertainty did not predict sexual well-being for racial/ethnic minority youth, emphasizing the importance of sexual identity development. Attention to the sexual development and sexual health of youth in the foster care system continues to be lacking and should be expanded.",

      "title": "Sex Offenders and the Free Exercise of Religion",
      "abstract": "In a variety of ways, sex offenders in the United States find themselves in a difficult position. One of the lesser-known ways relates to the free exercise of religion. Sometimes by categorical statute, and sometimes by individualized parole, probation, or supervised-release condition, sex offenders can find themselves legally barred from places where children are present (or likely to be present). Because children are usually present at religious services, sex offenders can find themselves unable to attend them altogether. And this hardship has a bit of irony in it too. Back in prison, sex offenders could worship freely with others; now ostensibly free, they can no longer do so. \r\n\r\nThis simple problem has real scope‚Äîtens (maybe hundreds) of thousands of people barred from essentially all religious services, sometimes for decades, sometimes for life. Moreover, these prohibitions are often vague and overbroad‚Äîand so restrictive that low-level administrators (like sheriffs and probation officers) are often pushed into softening or waiving them. But this ends up creating a kind of licensing scheme, whereby low-level government officials make‚Äîon their own, without any formal criteria‚Äîad-hoc and practically unreviewable decisions about who gets to go to church and under what conditions. Risks of selective enforcement, discrimination, and abuse are obvious.\r\n\r\nThese rules have come into being as if concerns about the free exercise of religion have no weight at all. But this is not the case. And, in fact, a robust body of law protects the free exercise of religion, requiring exemptions from religiously burdensome laws. Now this does not mean that sex offenders should be universally exempt from any and all restrictions regarding church attendance. There are probably some people who pose such a threat to children that they should be kept away from churches. Courts will have to answer tricky questions‚Äîwho should be barred, who should decide who is barred, and on what criteria?‚Äîthat require nuanced and elaborate answers. Yet informed by analogies from other areas of law (like freedom of speech) where courts have wrestled with similar issues, this Article offers some recommendations that are analytically rigorous, practically realizable, and judicially manageable.",

      "abstract": "While a few studies have investigated the sexual fantasies of adults reporting sexual attraction to minor, none, to the best of our knowledge, have focused on the specific types of content of these fantasies. In this qualitative study, we conducted content and thematic analyses of the sexual fantasies reported by an international sample of 112 adults reporting sexual attraction to minors recruited online. Seven themes were found: Minor-focused fantasies, Other paraphilic fantasies, Unrealistic fantasies, Incestuous fantasies, Adult-focused fantasies, Promiscuous fantasies, and Group sex fantasies. The sexual fantasies of adults reporting sexual attraction to minors exhibited diversity both in terms of the individuals involved and in the range of sexual practices imagined. However, much of the sexual fantasy content shared by participants was predominantly of a paraphilic nature. Approximately one-third of the fantasies involved minor as sexual partners, romantic partners, or featured participants imagining themselves as minors. Additionally, nearly half of the disclosed sexual fantasies referenced other paraphilic sexual interests, such as violence, fetishism, exhibitionism/voyeurism, body fluids, and zoophilia. Results of our research highlight the possibility of co-occurring paraphilic interests in adults reporting sexual attraction to minors.",

      "title": "Historical Views of Homosexuality: Ancient Greece",
      "abstract": "Ancient Greece featured at least five different varieties of same-sex relations: (a) pederastic relations, typically between adolescent boys and adult men who were not yet married; (b) relations between male youths of approximately the same age; less frequently (c) homosexual relations between fully adult men; (d) age-differentiated relations between females; and (e) relations between adult females. The origins of pederasty appear to be related to the relatively late age of marriage for males, which evolved as a response to needs to limit population growth in the scarcity-driven economy of the 7th century <sc>bce</sc>. The contexts of pederastic socialization (athletics, military comradeship, hunting, cockfighting, and intellectual/musical performance at elite symposia) point toward masculinizing pedagogy and mentorship as key social functions. However, social attitudes toward pederasty were not uniform throughout all Greek city-states in all periods. Evidence from several domains suggests that as Athens became more democratic and saw greater distribution of prosperity throughout all social classes, the age of male marriage declined; larger families became socially desirable, while non-procreative alternatives to marital sexuality became less fashionable and even morally dubious. What had always been characterized as an elite habitus during the archaic period and first half of the 5th century no longer seemed at home in a political system where appeal to the common man defined success and popularity. Some philosophical texts from the 4th century <sc>bce</sc> characterize physical sex between males as <italic>para physin</italic> (‚Äúbeyond nature‚Äù), whereas others recognize the possibility that it is determined through natural processes grounded in anatomy or spiritual heredity. Of most interest for modern politics is the question of what Greek historical evidence can tell us about the ability of adolescent boys to consent to intimate relations with adult men. Modern jurisprudence, especially in the United States, assumes a universal inability to provide informed consent until well after the onset of puberty, and even voluntary relations between adolescent boys and men are heavily sanctioned in the criminal justice system. Although classical Athens featured a robust tradition of criticizing pederasty for a number of reasons, the notion that pre-adult sex with an older partner was psychologically harmful to boys was not among them. The Greeks viewed adolescent (and even younger) boys as inherently sexual, and the widespread practice of nudity in athletic exercise and daily life conditioned Greek boys to a greater degree of frankness and physical disinhibition. Both iconographical and textual evidence show that Greek adolescents were quite capable of rejecting adult suitors or discontinuing relationships that no longer pleased them.",

It can display a narcissistic dimension, an objectal dimension (object-libido) turned toward others or/and an identity dimension. Two clinical case reports were used here to (i) illustrate all these aspects of infertility suffering, (ii) to evidence the difficulty for infertile men to speak about their infertility and (iii) underlie the importance for professional of medical assisted reproduction to be attentive to this suffering that many men keep silent. An empathetic attention to infertile men may give a way to express this suffering and thus allow the beginning of a psychoanalytic approach which is necessary in infertility and especially for infertile men who do not easily express their suffering. La souffrance de l‚Äôinfertilit√© chez l‚Äôhomme peut prendre plusieurs aspects. Elle peut avoir une dimension narcissique. Elle peut avoir une dimension objectale, √™tre tourn√©e vers l‚Äôautre.

      "abstract": "Drug misuse and juvenile delinquency share overlapping aetiologies that are complex and multifaceted and include parental, social, psychological, environmental, and economic aspects. Initiation, maintenance, and even escalation of drug use and criminal behaviour in an individual are heavily influenced by social factors like culture, neighbourhood, and family. Juvenile delinquency can be influenced and sustained by factors such as family structure and functioning, broken homes, absent or unsatisfactory interpersonal relationships, unbalanced parenting, lack of guidance, economic instability, substance abuse or addiction in the family or among peers, access to addictive substances, exposure to physical, sexual, emotional abuse or trauma violence, and peer pressure. Psychological factors that can result in drug use and criminal behaviour include high stress, personality traits like high impulsivity or sensation seeking, depression, and anxiety. People who develop substance use disorders have excessive dependencies, which may initially be reinforced because they lower stress and lift spirits. The belief that drugs can provide solace and help lift one above all misery, which underlies continued drug use, is associated with this reduction. There has also been evidence of an association between early violent behaviour, impulsivity, and problems with concentration or attention.",

With respect to masculinity and femininity, females' impressions of their male partners corresponded with males' perceptions of self-in-general, while males' impressions of their female partners corresponded more with females' perceptions of self-with-partner. Higher levels of femininity and lower levels of masculinity in the descriptions of self-with-partner were associated with more relationship satisfaction. Further, descriptions of self-with-partner reflected more feminine and less masculine attributes than descriptions of self-in-general. These findings suggest that people behave in a more feminine way toward their intimate partner than toward others, and that this is beneficial for an intimate relationship.",

      "abstract": "The term 'Honour Killing' is conventionally used to denote a specific category of extralegal killings where the act of murder is seen to have been motivated by pre-modern affiliations/sentiments of some sort. Acts of violence committed against people for marrying outside of caste/religion/ethnicity or other similar infringements where they are seen by their actions to have besmirched the honour of the family and the larger community come under the broad rubric of honour crime. Implicit in using the term are assumptions that mark it as different from other crimes. Honour is defined in terms of women assigned sexual and familial roles as dictated by traditional family ideology. Thus, adultery, premarital relationships (which may or may not include sexual relations), rape, and falling in love with an \"inappropriate\" person may constitute violations of family honour. 'Crimes of honour' as a form of violence against women does not imply that men also are not subjected to such crimes. In cases of forced marriage or interference with the right of choice and whom to marry, pressure from older family members over younger members will apply to men as well as to women. However, women remain the victims and survivors of 'crimes of honour' and have fewer available remedies.",

      "title": "Relationship Dissatisfaction and Partner Access Deficits",
      "abstract": "Abstract In this chapter, we discuss how partners‚Äô feelings about relationship inequity (i.e., unequal access to relationship resources, such as sex, emotional investment, finances, and family-size decisions) can cause relationship dissatisfaction. Individuals may initiate a romantic relationship with the desire to create a long-term committed relationship that is emotionally and sexually fulfilling. However, romantic relationships do not always fulfill both partners‚Äô needs and desires, and couples often experience conflict and dissatisfaction when this happens. In this chapter, we explore both the proximate and ultimate reasons for why individuals experience dissatisfaction in their relationships. Proximate reasons include issues such as finances, cultural backgrounds, and ascribed sex roles whereas ultimate causes encompass issues of sexual conflict with others, reproduction-related conflict, and jealousy. Further, we also survey a promising area of research that suggests dissatisfaction in a romantic relationship may arise from a deficit in emotional and sexual access for one of the partners in the relationship. We conclude by suggesting that researchers explore how relationship deficits affect couples who identify as LGBTQ, pursue consensual nonmonogamy and investigate how relationship access deficits affect couples from non-WEIRD samples. Additionally, we suggest that future research examine how relationship access deficits affect abuse in relationships because such research may help deter or end abuse.",

      "abstract": "The effects of anticipated interaction on liking were examined, with the person being evaluated sometimes being presented as a member of a negatively stereotyped group. The stereotype studied was that associated with male homosexuals. The standard effect of anticipated interaction causing increased liking was obtained when females rated either a homosexual or a non‚Äê homosexual male and when males rated a nonhomosexual male. When males anticipated interacting with a homosexual male, however, they rated him less favorably than did males who did not anticipate interacting with him. It was also found that both males and females liked the stimulus person less and attributed stereotypic traits to him more when he was homosexual than when he was not. These latter effects were stronger for males than for females.",

      "abstract": "Existing quantitative research on sexual orientation and life satisfaction uses models with control variables that do not have a clear rationale. With a correct understanding of what control variables do, no controls are necessary to estimate the consequences of sexual orientation on life satisfaction. An analysis constructed from this perspective reveals gay and bisexual men in the UK and Australia are less satisfied with their lives (relative to heterosexual men). Bisexual women in both countries are less satisfied as well. Lesbians in Australia are less satisfied (relative to straight women) ‚Äì but lesbians in the UK do not have lower satisfaction. These conclusions hold also in an analysis that considers the possibility that some non-heterosexual people might be unwilling to disclose their sexual orientation on surveys.",

      "title": "MINORITY STRESS AND LONELINESS IN A LIFESPAN SAMPLE OF SEXUAL MINORITIES",
      "abstract": "Abstract Marginalized individuals often experience social isolation (i.e., loneliness), which is a risk factor for diminished health, especially for older sexual minorities (i.e., LGB+) who were socialized in a period with less social recognition and overt stigmatization (i.e., minority stress). Although it is known that minority stressors contribute to loneliness, little is known about the contextual factors that predict this relationship, such as age/cohort. First, we examined cross-sectional baseline data from a lifespan sample of sexual minorities (N=333, ages 18-90) to investigate the relationship between seven different minority stressors and loneliness. Compared to their younger peers, older sexual minorities reported lower levels of loneliness and minority stress; however, age moderated the links between internalized homonegtaivity (B=.01, p&amp;lt;.01), anticipated stigma (B=.02, p&amp;lt;.01), and family-directed stigma (B=.01, p&amp;lt;.05) on loneliness, respectively. Secondly, daily experiences of minority stress and levels of loneliness were examined across a 21-day period (N=1,878 days) from a subsample of the baseline study (N=112, ages 19-79). There was higher daily loneliness on days when participants concealed their identity and had higher internalized homonegativity. Conversely, loneliness was lower when participants disclosed their identity. We further explored lagged-effects and found that loneliness was significantly higher following high internalized homonegativity (B=-.02, p&amp;lt;.001) from the prior day and that this change was moderated by age. These findings underscore the importance of considering age and cohort when examining minority stress. They also highlight the need for interventions that address minority stressors in this population to prevent poorer well-being and higher levels of loneliness.",

      "title": "Men Who Kill",
      "abstract": "Throughout history and in all cultures, men are measurably more prone than are women to engage in killing other persons, whether in self-defense (justifiable homicide), misperceived threat, or murder (unlawful homicide). There are compelling reasons for this disparity of aggression, related to our evolution as a species. This article focuses on the nature aspect of the nature‚Äìnurture interaction, which has greater explanatory power for the male ‚Äúexcess‚Äù of aggression and killing. Neuroendocrine (especially, testosterone-related) and neurophysiological factors (those relating to the emotions of rage and lust) underlay this sexual dimorphism. Viewed in this light, killing‚Äîparticularly murder‚Äîby men may be understood as exaggerations of otherwise adaptive tendencies directed at the preservation of the group, and at the retention of one's social status and of one's mate. Particular attention is paid to several types of killing by men. Uxoricide (the killing of one's wife) may be prompted by such motives as jealousy (directed at the threat of losing one's wife) or lust (killing one's wife so as to be free to mate with another woman) or greed (related to the desire to retain or improve one's social status by gaining insurance money or inheritance). The threat of social exposure and humiliation (by a wife who knows embarrassing secrets) is yet another motive. Additional topics are also addressed, such as serial sexual homicide‚Äîan exclusively male phenomenon‚Äîand stalking, which is often aimed at coercing an otherwise unwilling woman to become one's sexual partner. The final section addresses the increase in recent years for certain men‚Äîof a particularly callous nature‚Äîto commit murders of striking depravity, even at a time when the murder rate in general is decreasing.",

      "abstract": "Pioneering research suggested that sexual afterglow (lingering sexual satisfaction following an act of sex) lasts 2 but not 3 days and predicts subsequent relationship satisfaction. Nevertheless, recent research highlights the importance of considering the differential impacts of sexual acceptance and rejection. We used 2-week, daily-diary data from 576 participants to demonstrate that sexual afterglow lasted at least 1 day on average, particularly following partner-initiated and mutually initiated sex, and did not depend on individual differences in the importance of sex or sexual rejection, though negative aftereffects of sexual rejection lasted 3 days. Furthermore, lingering sexual (dis)satisfaction often predicted subsequent relationship satisfaction. Mini-meta-analyses of the current data with all published data suggest sexual afterglow lasts at least 1 day and predicts relationship quality whereas sexual rejection did not reliably produce aftereffects. Conclusions focus future research on other factors that may contribute to differences in sexual afterglow and reactions to other discrete events.",

Thematic analyses focused on individuals who recalled a specific age and event in early childhood in which they became aware of their gender and sexual identity versus individuals who did not recall a specific age tied to their awareness of their sexual and gender identities. Results showed that five participants gave non-specific ages (e.g., ‚Äúalways‚Äù and ‚Äúat an early age‚Äù) when their gender identity became particularly salient, the remaining 6 participants reported a specific age and typically a specific event when their gender identity became particularly salient. Findings are discussed in the context of intersectionality, gender and sexual identity development, and the coming out process. Findings suggest that experiences related to gender identity and expression and sexual orientation are non-linear processes that vary widely, and that there is no one ‚Äúmaster narrative‚Äù. Implications for mental health and the need for ongoing support services are also highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Asexuality is overlooked in the philosophical literature and in wider society. Such neglect produces incomplete or inaccurate accounts of romantic life and harms asexual people. We develop an account of asexuality to redress this neglect and enrich discussion of romantic life. Asexual experiences are diverse. Some asexual people have sex; some have romantic relationships in the absence of sex. We accept the common definition of asexuality as the absence of sexual attraction and explain how sexual attraction and sexual desire differ by giving an affordance‚Äêlike account of sexual attraction. Armed with that distinction, we show that asexuality is clearly different from celibacy or disorders of desire and that some existing philosophical theories of sexual desire struggle to accommodate asexual sexuality. We then build on asexual testimony about the diversity of non‚Äêsexual attractions to answer two common objections levelled at asexual romance: that romantic relationships require sexual attraction or that sex in the absence of sexual attraction is insufficiently focused on someone as an individual. Finally, we describe some of the ways asexuality has been erased or denigrated in society, and the specific injustices and harms that result.",

This study presents a qualitative analysis of adolescents' comments after reading a teen-friendly article on sexual consent as part of a web-based sexual health promotion intervention. The sample was comprised predominantly of female adolescents recruited from a Midwest urban region in the United States. Adolescents varied with respect to self-efficacy to request, provide, and deny consent, as well as the perceived need to ask for consent in the context of established relationships. Many adolescents perceived that nonverbal methods of communication were sufficient to request, provide, or deny sexual consent. Factors that make it difficult to discuss sexual boundaries and say \"no\" to unwanted sex included low self-efficacy and an underlying desire to nurture or preserve a relationship. Cultural norms must be changed to support verbal, affirmative sexual consent. In addition, adolescents must be aided in the development of skills to request sexual consent, say \"yes\" to specific activities, and say \"no\" to others. Without supportive norms and skills to enhance self-efficacy, adolescents may be unwilling to engage in verbal communication about sexual consent and boundaries.",

      "abstract": "Sexual responses are thought to be controlled by a brain module called the sexual module. Sexual strategies of males and females vary to a great extent, and sexual responses of males and females may be affected by their sexual strategies. However, the current view of the sexual module is that of a unisex module. This might be questionable since brain modules are defined as evolved cognitive mechanisms to solve adaptive problems which are different for males and females. We hypothesize that the sexual module responds differently in the presence of complex (high-order) contextual cues that are related to gender-dimorphic sexual strategies in males and females. We conducted a priming experiment in which stimuli related to sexual strategies were disentangled from their sexual meaning. Nonsexual priming pictures related to either economic resources or social interactions preceded a sexual-target picture in order to test whether the primes were able to modulate the subjective sexual response to the sexual target. In a control condition, priming pictures without relation to mating preferences but with similar emotional impact were presented. In males, sexual responses were similar in the experimental and control conditions. In females, however, primes related to economic resources or social interactions modulated sexual arousal significantly more than the control primes. Our findings suggest that brain modules dedicated to process the experimental primes were functionally connected with the sexual module in females more than in males, making females‚Äô sexual responses more prone to the impact of high-order cultural cues than males‚Äô sexual responses. A gender-dimorphic connectivity of the sexual module may be the way in which gender-dimorphic sexual strategies are implemented in the human mind.",

These range from sexual ethics issues narrowly understood to consideration of the claims of any spouse or children and indeed, of gender-discordant younger people who may follow one's example. As with intersex conditions, not all crossdressing or use of cross-sex hormones is excluded absolutely. Detransition, for example, could be rightly deferred for various reasons. However, as illustrated by the analogy of an infertile woman wanting to present as the pregnant mother of a child she plans to adopt, there is a significant social value in accurate bodily and other outward communication of one's actual/predominant sex (and occupancy of key allied roles).",

The period of adolescence, a period in which an emotional and bihevioral\r\n independence from ones parents is established, as well as the time when some stonger bonds\r\n with peers are formed, is stated as the period of change and developmental tasks which is\r\n assumed to be the most suitable time for the occurence of loneliness. There are many\r\n classifications of loneliness, but the most famous one is considered to be Weisses. His\r\n classification of loneliness divides it into social (which occurs when a person is excluded from a\r\n social network) and emotional (caused by the lack of intimacy in interpersonal relationships).\r\n Loneliness can manifest in many ways, and in the most recent of times the most famous ones to\r\n be considered are affective manifestations which can lead to a state of anxiety, unrest and\r\n tension. In many situations it is very difficult to recognize the difference between the behaviours\r\n which directly led to the state of loneliness and behaviours which are the result of loneliness in\r\n adolescence.

However, little attention has been given to the impact of participating in this online sexual marketplace for MSM of color, despite race and ethnicity as frequently used selection criterion in personal ads or profiles. Six focus group discussions (n = 50) and 35 in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with African American, Latino, or Asian and Pacific Islander MSM in Los Angeles, which included discussion of their use of Internet sites to meet or interact with other MSM. Men reported race and ethnicity as a pervasive and powerful factor in facilitating or derailing Internet-mediated sexual encounters. The racialized interactions that MSM of color reported ranged from simple expressions of race-based preferences, to blatantly discriminatory or hostile interactions, and often demeaning race-based sexual objectification. Experiences of rejection and a perceived hierarchy of value in the sexual market based on race had definite costs for these MSM using these online sites. Furthermore, the private and solitary nature of seeking partners online meant that there was little to buffer the corrosive aspects of those negative experiences. These online dynamics have implications for the power balance in Internet-mediated sexual liaisons, including sexual decision making and sexual risk.",

      "abstract": "Sexual aggression in dating is now a widespread social phenomenon. The present study was designed to examine interpretations in a sexual disagreement situation within young dating couples. Forty-five heterosexual couples classified into one of three distinct stages of involvement were asked to complete several questionnaires requesting background and sexual information, and respond to six brief scenarios describing dating situations. It was hypothesized that the respondent's sex, couple's dating stage, woman's type of \"No\" response, and the level of intimacy were related to the following: a man's reaction to his date's refusal of unwanted sexual advances, and any future consequences to the couple's dating relationship. Results from MANOVAs and ANOVAs indicated that while many men, in general, would comply with a date's refusal, a substantial percentage of men would use some type of coercion to continue advances after a woman refused. Each man's compliance was found to be influenced by the particular dating stage and intimacy level in which he and his partner were involved. These findings indicate the dating situation is highly complex and susceptible to misinterpretation.",

      "abstract": "Research into the psychological resources that benefit health and well-being have increased dramatically in recent years. The latest data from highly rigorous and controlled studies show some of the benefits that produce positive states and affects, as well as optimism and well-being, among other positive states in physical and psychological health. In spite of this evidence, there is little information about the mechanisms and variables related to the processes of well-being, optimism and positive affects. In addition, there is no real consensus regarding the psychological and/or neurophysiological mechanisms that explain the relation to positive states and their benefit for health and mainly with respect to the causal or etiological variables of well-being. The scientific evidence about the benefits of positive states like optimism, happiness and mainly well-being is reviewed. A conceptual causal model is proposed which suggests that the level of subjective and psychological well-being is previously influenced by the level of optimism. This way, and based on the prior literature and evidence, it is proposed that optimism, being a condition learned from childhood, may stimulate the greatest number of positive experiences and positive emotions. These positive affect states would then mediate the relation between optimism and well-being and their consequences.",

However, the aging process does bring with it certain changes in the physiology of the male and the female sexual response, and these along with a number of medical problems that become more prevalent in the mature years, play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the sexual disorders of the elderly. The typical patient over 50 has only a partial degree of biological impairment, which has, however, been escalated into a total sexual disability by a variety of cultural, intrapsychic, and relationship stressors. Fortunately, these problems are frequently amenable to an integrated psychodynamically oriented sex therapy approach that emphasizes the improvement of the couple's intimacy, and the expansion of their sexual flexibility.",

Abuse is defined as an act of commission and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care leading to potential or actual harm. Neglect may include inadequate health care, education, supervision, protection from hazards in the environment, and unmet basic needs such as clothing and food. Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. Physical abuse may include beating, shaking, burning, and biting. The threshold for defining corporal punishment as abuse is unclear. Rib fractures are found to be the most common finding associated with physical abuse. Psychological abuse includes verbal abuse, humiliation, and acts that scare or terrorize a child, which may result in future psychological illness of the child. Sexual abuse is defined as ‚Äúthe involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable to give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles.‚Äù Some cases of sexual abuse do not need to involve oral, anal, or vaginal penetration and may include exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and genital fondling. A significant amount of child abuse cases frequently are missed by healthcare providers. For the diagnosis of child abuse to be made, there needs to be a high index of suspicion.",

Subjective judgments may mask stereotyping effects, whereas objective judgments may reveal stereotype-consistent patterns. We examined whether gender stereotypes about parenting lead judges to rate women and men as equally ‚Äúgood‚Äù parents while objective judgments favor women and whether parenting performance moderates this pattern. Participants evaluated a mother or father who successfully or unsuccessfully performed a parenting task. Subjective judgments of parent quality (‚Äús/he is a good parent‚Äù) revealed no parent gender effects, but objective estimates of parenting performance favored mothers. In a hypothetical divorce scenario, participants also favored mothers in custody decisions. However, this pro-mother bias decreased when the mother failed at the parenting task (through her own fault). Performance did not affect custody decisions for fathers. We suggest parenting quality matters more for evaluations of mothers than for fathers because negative performance violates stereotyped expectations.",

      "title": "Early Influences on Development: Fact or Fancy?.",
      "abstract": "level can forsee the deviancy disappearing at other ages or in other contexts. Hyperactivity, for example, can be seen as both normal and abnormal depending on whether the child is a pre-schooler or an adolescent. The mother who can appreciate the discontinuous nature of her child's behavior is better equipped to make qualitative changes in her treatment of the child as the child's activities and requirements change with development. The mother who is restricted to more primitive levels of viewing her offspring enmeshes the child at later stages in obsolete social and affective relationships formed during infancy. From the low levels of social cognition found in large segments of our society (Chandler, 1973; Looft, 1972) one might expect a much higher proportion of severe caretaking casualties than appears to be the case. Possibly, the same kinds of self-righting tendencies that Wad dington (1966) postulated for biological development are operative at the psychological level. One of these self-righting tendencies might exist in the transactions between parent and child. The mother has little difficulty viewing the infant from a sensorimotor level of cognition while the infant is in the sensorimotor period. However, as the child progresses through his own development, his caretakers are forced to view him from different perspectives, potentially causing a restructuring of their view of the child. At each new level the child makes interactional demands at higher levels of complexity, frequently surprising parents by this emerging precocity. This content downloaded from 157.55.39.235 on Fri, 07 Oct 2016 06:09:55 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Early Influences on Development A second major self-righting tendency might be found at the societal level. To the extent that the scientific and educational es tablishment are limited to a concrete view that perceives developmen tal deviancy as foreordained by poor genes or perinatal complications, there is little in the way of therapy to offer mothers with problems. To the extent that society as a whole can move from a main-effect to a transactional model of development a new context is provided for educating mothers toward understanding the intricate interplay between organismic and environmental factors in the determination of developmental outcomes. To summarize, disorders in development have been retrospectively attributed to a variety of early constitutional or environmental factors. When these predisposing factors have been studied prospectively little support is given to their causal role or their predictive value for later deviancy. Evidence for qualitative continuities and stabilities in development appear to be artifacts of an incomplete analysis of the child in its environment. When the two are examined in combination, complex reciprocal transactions are found which reduce or amplify ear ly problems in behavior. Developmental outcomes must be interpreted as the products of a child's characteristics, his material environment and the cognitive levels and values of his social milieu. Where the social environment fosters rigidity, stereotyping, and concreteness in thought and behavior, early deviancies can become resistant to the normal restruc turing implicit in development. Where flexibility, openness, and adap tability are fundamental characteristics of the environment, early problems are dissipated as the child advances in his construction and organization of both his cognitive and social world.",

Sex offenders commit nonsexual crimes and male batterers assault others who are unrelated to them. Many criminals show a preference for certain antisocial acts. Sometimes scholars begin with dissecting the criterion behavior or the criminal act and developing theories to explain the offense. There are theories of white-collar crime, vandalism, and serial killers. The chapter describes relatively common groups among offender populations (male batterers) to the more infrequent (sex offenders) and then to the rare (stalkers, serial killers). The stalkers and serial killers are exceptional because they truly distinguish themselves from the mainstream by their bizarre and violent behavior. These criminal subtypes represent extreme groups with little in common. Sometimes there are more similarities than there are differences.",

If conceive of the psychobiological development of a woman as a growth of mental and physical capacities, will recognize that there must be a unification of functions in the mental and physical realms. The components must be developed harmoniously if there is to be ease of activity. In modern civilization, a new problem has been presented to women in the breaking down of old economic and social barriers and the opening up of new opportunities.

The unconscious desire for a child, vis-a-vis the conscious knowledge of the problems such a child may create, plays a fundamental role in the emotional life of a woman. Men can complicate the problem; they often identify sexual potency with reproductive power, and refuse contraception for their female partners. The role of a physician in such situations is very important, very difficult and delicate. He is the one who knows, who advises, who prescribes, and who must, above all, understand. Information on contraception should be more widespread and more accurate, and every young couple should be convinced that contraception will help resolve many demographic problems, create a more responsible sexuality, improve the affective and economic situation of a family, and diminish maternal and perinatal morbidity.",

      "abstract": "Sex is of the utmost importance in voluntary abortions, because it is the cause of the procedure and because it is always a subject at the time of the abortion. Abortion practitioners are conscious of the woman's sexuality and of sexual techniques. The sexual dimension in abortion is more acute than in other medical acts. Abortion announces the existence of sexual desire, the complexity of sex, and the uncontrollable aspect of sex. The public procedure of abortion removes the intimacy from sex. It is an oversimplification to believe that proper use of contraception could obviate all abortions, that good sex is sex with contraception and bad sex is sex with abortion. Such an attitude neglects the role of desire and the subconscious in sex. \"Resistance\" to contraception should be understood to mean subconscious defense against contraception which deprives one of one's sex or reduces it to impotence. Abortion exists because sex is not rational. The 1st request for an abortion usually does not cause any problems among practitioners, but requests for subsequent abortions tend to cause resentment and recourse to the domain of psychiatry for explanations. Multiple abortions may however not be a symptom but a sign that desire exists and is not codifiable. Abortion exists outside of the usual medical sequence of illness-treatment-cure and is not comprehensible in the usual medical terms. Abortion raises questions of life, death, and the very nature of men and women that are largely unanswerable. Women undergoing abortion admit to ambivalence and to suffering during the experience. The 1 thing to understand is that all persons should decide individually what course they would follow; there are no ideal responses, only personal solutions. The ideology that dictates that all pregnancies must be warmly welcomed just reduces women once again to their fertility. Contraception and abortion can increase freedom, and especially the right to sexual pleasure. Society should not fall into the insidious and pernicious trap of observing pleasure through the lens of contraception and regarding all abortion as pathology. Contraception is not a duty, and abortion is a right; they are 2 different ways in which women experience their sex.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The general consensus of previous studies dealing with heterosexually married homosexuals is that the outcome is a rather poor and unhappy marriage, or divorce. The subjects in previous studies, for the most part, had not disclosed their sexual orientation to their marriage partner or were divorced at the time of the study. Presented are five case studies of heterosexual marriages where disclosure co the spouse is evident. Fxamined are the coping mechanisms involved when such marriages do not end in divorce. A three-phase heuristic model is offered for understanding and aiding individuals in such marriages.",

      "abstract": "Juvenile delinquency is a complex problem through the ages, and the tendencies toward delinquency basically appears, to a great extent, to be influenced by and learned simultaneously from the environment. The primary environment is the family. Within the family the adolescent ie interacting mainly with his parents, but in many cases also with other family members. obtains the material of values from his environment, moving from heteronomous to autonomous morality. When the socialization process of the Ego strength and the Superego does not develop adequately, it tends to create more opportunities for the adolescent to act delinquency. The tendencies toward delinquency and the actual delinquent behavior are partly related to the psycho sexual aspects of personality development at various phases during childhood, and also to the choice of libidinal object. The environment may facilitate or hamper the a-chievement of excellence, which in turn may influence the formation of morality. To be sure if the moral norms are inconsistently experienced they may induce the development of tendencies toward delinquency. In a complex pattern of social interactions the adolescent may not be able to acquire his self identity. In the process of social inter -action various physical conditions may contribute to the tendency toward delinquency",

      "abstract": "Le speed-dating est un mode de rencontres rapides amicales ou amoureuses. Idealement, lors de ces soirees, un nombre egal de femmes et d'hommes se rencontrent sur des creneaux de sept minutes. Toutes les rencontres qui s'effectuent sur le meme creneau commencent et finissent au meme moment. A la fin de chaque rencontre, les hommes se deplacent de maniere a rencontrer une nouvelle personne, alors que les femmes restent assises. Il arrive souvent que les deux populations soient de tailles differentes ou que certaines rencontres soient interdites car les participants se sont deja rencontres lors d'une soiree precedente. De plus, certains participants arrivent en retard. Tous ces evenements perturbateurs engendrent des attentes pour les participants ne pouvant ainsi pas enchainer toutes leurs rencontres. L'objectif considere ici est la minimisation du nombre maximum d'attentes des participants. Nous nous interessons a la version statique du probleme dans laquelle toutes les donnees (retards des participants, rencontres interdites) sont connues a l'avance. Nous avons demontre que le probleme general de speed-dating est NP-difficile au sens fort [2]. Pour resoudre ce probleme, nous proposons de developper une limited discrepancy search [1]. Le schema et la strategie de branchement sont bases sur une heuristique de liste donnant priorite aux rendez-vous des participants qui ont le plus de creneaux d'attente pour la solution partiellement instanciee. Cette heuristique nous a deja donne d'assez bons resultats. Afin d'optimiser le parcours de l'arbre de recherche, nous exploitons des proprietes de symetrie du probleme permettant d'eviter la creation de n≈ìuds domines ou redondants. Par exemple, on introduit une regle de dominance visant a casser les symetries entre les participants possedant les memes caracteristiques (meme date d'arrivee et meme liste de rencontres). Les resultats obtenus par cette methode sont compares avec ceux obtenus par une approche exacte (PLNE). References [1] W.D. Harvey and M.L. Ginsberg. Limited discrepancy search.

This under representation of the problem makes planning for the future difficult. There were communication difficulties between many professionals and clients with associated differences in the perceptions of need. Professionals tend to work within their own ivory towers and do not communicate with professionals of other disciplines. This leads to patchy and uneven services. Low ratings of satisfaction were awarded to some groups of professionals, and these low ratings were often associated with communication difficulties. High ratings of satisfaction on the other hand tended to be awarded where the client had: an on-going relationship, with the same named person, who is an expert in the field, all three of these inter-linked factors being necessary for client satisfaction. The dynamics of family life are disturbed and disrupted by the diagnosis of blindness and the rearing of a severely visually impaired child in the majority of instances. Passage through crisis, however, does not inevitably lead to family breakdown and it is worthy of note that a number of the families studied, although severely tested, appeared to emerge from the crisis, not merely intact but actually strengthened.",

This includes inappropriate touching (clothed or unclothed), penetration using an object, forcing sexual activity between children, or asking a child to view, to read, or to pose for pornographic materials. l Most children being evaluated for sexual abuse will not have significant physical findings on examination. However, a thorough physical and genital exam is necessary. A practitioner with expertise and specialized skills should do these examinations with children and adolescents. Many parents and caregivers do not realize that the pediatric genital exam is very different from that performed on adults. In fact, only in rare cases will the experienced examiner perform an internal exam or use a speculum.",

Given the stereotype, it is not surprising that some men with androgenetic alopecia (AGA) appear to have a lower self-image, depression resulting in increased introversion, and increased feelings of unattractiveness. Ours is a culture that places a premium on physical appearance. In this context, appearance-altering conditions can be psychosocially insidious, especially conditions such as AGA with an uncertain course and a negative social meaning. To date, little or no data have been available regarding the psychosocial and quality-of-life aspects of AGA in a representative sample of community men. It is unknown whether AGA is a causal factor in the development of low self-esteem, depression, introversion, and feeling of unattractiveness, or whether there are underlying problems in certain patients prior to hair loss. Longitudinal studies will be important to investigate the temporal relationships between the degree of hair loss and psychosocial variables associated with AGA. A patient with male pattern baldness will be better treated and consequently more satisfied (better quality of life) if he receives effective anti-alopecia agents and simultaneously is evaluated and treated, if needed, for his psychological disorder.",

The prominent symptom of male climacteric - reduced sexual drive is well defined by Ayurvedic scholars as the state of Jaravasthajanya Klaibya.

Such a way of life led to excessive liberalization regarding the freedom of behavior of individuals, which was used for a series of actions and activities that have a delinquent sign. Thus, individuals become perpetrators of some of the criminal acts. The old norms of behavior were rejected, and modern trends were accepted, in which the rules apply primarily: ‚Äúthe end justifies the means‚Äù. This implies the fact that it is important to reach a certain goal, but the way in which that goal was reached or the means used are not important at all, i.e. it is irrelevant whether it is a permitted or illegal way and with the use of permitted or illegal means. In the light of contemporary social events, even though in one historical period the development of criminology as a science was slowed down, and even stopped. It certainly left a mark on the development of the theory of routine activities and the problems it deals with, i.e. contemporary aspects of society that have significance for the overall events that fall within the domain of studying criminology and the theory of routine activities from the aspect of criminal behavior and its prevention.",

The sexual instinct has hitherto been predominantly auto-erotic; it now finds a sexual object. Its activity has hitherto been derived from a number of separate instincts and erotogenic zones, which, independently of one another, have pursued a certain sort of pleasure as their sole sexual aim. Now, however, a new sexual aim appears, and all the component instincts combine to attain it, while the erotogenic zones become subordinated to the primacy of the genital zone. 1 Since the new sexual aim assigns very different functions to the two sexes, their sexual development now diverges greatly. That of males is the more straightforward and the more understandable, while that of females actually enters upon a kind of involution. A normal sexual life is only assured by an exact 18convergence of the affectionate current and the sensual current both being directed towards the sexual object and sexual aim. (The former, the affectionate current, comprises what remains over of the infantile efflorescence of sexuality.) 2 It is like the completion of a tunnel which has been driven through a hill from both directions.",

After all, genital stimulation, whether by a man or a woman, sends the same sensory signals to the brain. Yet somehow the sex, appearance, and identity of the person providing the stimulation are all critical determinants of whether or not the stimulation is perceived as pleasurable. Many people, heterosexual and homosexual alike, are strongly attracted to only one of the two sexes. And, all things being equal, most people would prefer an attractive partner to an unattractive one. Even then, whether or not pleasure is experienced is significantly influenced by who the attractive, appropriately sexed pleasure-giver is, not to mention the context in which the stimulation occurs. Certain partners, such as family members, arc taboo. Others arc considered undesirable, or even repulsive, for whatever reason.",

      "abstract": "Previous research has demonstrated that stigmatization of people with disabilities (PWDs) has\nnegative consequences for their romantic opportunities. It has been well established that the\ncognitive task of perspective-taking of another person has the capacity to alter perceptions of\nvarious minority groups for the better. Acknowledging or mentioning a disability has also been\nshown to have positive social consequences. The present study explored the possibility that\nromantic or sexual attraction to someone with an observable physical disability could potentially\nbe enhanced through these two processes‚Äîperspective-taking and mentioning. A statistically\nsignificant interaction emerged between prior interaction experience with people who have\ndisabilities, gender of the target, and perspective-taking. The nature of this interaction was such\nthat participants who did not have experience with people with disabilities and who engaged in\nperspective-taking with a female target rated her more sexually/romantically desirable than\npeople who rated a male target, regardless of whether they took his perspective, had disability\nexperience, or both. However, because this effect was small and no other analyses revealed\nsignificant effects of perspective-taking, caution is warranted when interpreting these results.\nPerspective-Taking and Mentioning\nUnexpectedly, mentioning one‚Äôs disability actually reduced romantic desirability for the target,\nalthough this effect was also small. Limitations and suggestions to improve upon this\nmethodology in future research are discussed along with commentary on the use of perspective taking\nmanipulations more generally.",

      "title": "Dyadic analyses of chronic conditions and distress within marriage : a gendered perspective",
      "abstract": "Chronic conditions negatively impact well-being, and the negative impact of a chronic condition can extend beyond the diagnosed person to his or her spouse. This association may be further influenced by gender, as gender can shape how individuals experience their own chronic conditions-including what conditions they develop-and how they react to the conditions and distress of their spouses. In my dissertation, I examine how one spouse‚Äôs chronic conditions are related to the other spouse's psychological distress over time. I address this using quantitative analysis of the Health and Retirement Study and qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews. In my quantitative analysis, I find that the association between one spouse‚Äôs chronic conditions and the other spouse‚Äôs distress differs by gender, number of conditions, whether one or both spouses have chronic conditions, and type of condition. Regarding number of conditions, a husband‚Äôs number of chronic conditions increases his wife‚Äôs distress more so than a wife‚Äôs number of chronic conditions increases her husband‚Äôs. These associations are mitigated by the chronically ill spouse‚Äôs own distress and functional limitations. Additionally, this gender difference is more pronounced if both spouses have chronic conditions compared to if only one has chronic conditions. Regarding type of condition, lung disease and stroke are the most negatively impactful for spouses‚Äô distress, whereas high blood pressure, cancer, and arthritis are not related to spouses‚Äô distress. All conditions, except for stroke, relate to husbands‚Äô and wives‚Äô vii distress similarly, but a husband's stroke increases a wife's distress initially whereas the wife's stroke increases the husband's distress over time. In my qualitative analysis, I find that when women are chronically ill, they continue to emotionally care for their husbands, which likely protects their husbands from psychological distress but exacerbates women‚Äôs own distress. My results point to the importance of promoting the psychological well-being of both spouses during periods of chronic conditions. This is especially critical for spouses of people with more than one condition, chronically ill women whose husbands are also chronically ill, and spouses of people experiencing stroke and lung disease.",

Definisi masyarakat akan\r\napa yang normal, layak, benar dan alami memiliki pengaruh besar atas bagaimana\r\nperasaan warial tentang orientasi seksual mereka. Stereotip sosial yang semacam\r\nitu tidak sejalan dengan fakta bahwa di sekitar kita terdapat individu-individu\r\ndengan orientasi seks yang berbeda. Orientasi seks yang berbeda ini seringkali\r\nmendapatkan kritik yang negatif dari lingkungan tanpa memperhitungkan bahwa\r\nstigma negatif yang diberikan ini juga melukai mereka.\r\nTerkait dengan fenomena waria, perlu kita ketahui bahwa terbentuknya\r\norientasi seksual seseorang dipengaruhi oleh beberapa hal antara lain sistem\r\nhormonal, neurofisiologi, sosiokultural (termasuk budaya, keluarga, perbedaan\r\nsosioekonomi, dan pendekatan religiusnya), serta faktor psikologis lainnya\r\n(seperti pengalaman seksual dan juga trauma seksual individu). waria bisa\r\nterbentuk karena adanya faktor pendorong dari luar individu yang sama sekali\r\ntidak ada hubungannya dengan keturunan, bisa jadi karena lingkungan tempat\r\ntinggal, pola asuh, pengalaman masa lalu yang dalam hal ini pelecehan seksual.\r\nsebagian besar kaum waria memiliki pengalaman dilecehkan, diperkosa, dan\r\nmenjadi korban kekerasan di masa kanak-kanaknya.

      "abstract": "Curiosity is a psychological response to uncertainty that facilitates learning and other benefits, but little is known about how highly curious people interpret and process uncertainty differently from their less curious counterparts. We investigated the relationship between curiosity (both interest- and deprivation-type) and a variety of attitudes towards uncertainty. An adult sample from the United Kingdom (N = 398) completed an online questionnaire measuring dispositional interest- and deprivation-type curiosity, positive attitudes towards uncertainty, intolerance of uncertainty, and tendencies to focus on potential positive or negative outcomes. A higher score on interest was associated with finding uncertainty more enjoyable and focusing on positive possibilities. A higher score on deprivation was associated with being more intolerant of uncertainty and focusing on negative possibilities. The connections between curiosity and attitudes towards uncertainty differ according to the type of curiosity experienced. Interest may reinforce learning by promoting a fascination with the unknown and a focus on positive discoveries. Deprivation may reinforce learning by promoting discomfort with the unknown and a focus on negative discoveries that one wishes to be reassured of or prepared for.",

However, childhood sexual abuse perpetrated by siblings, cousins, or peers receives relatively little attention from either researchers or practitioners. In the present article, the literature on sibling child sexual abuse is critically reviewed, and particular attention is focused on defining sibling sexual abuse, and determining its scope and effects. Clinical Implications are derived as well. Although the article focuses on sibling sexual abuse, the concepts considered here also apply to other forms of same-age (or near same-age) child sexual relationships.",

These narratives of separation and divorce explain and clarify why couples break-up, how they negotiate their break-up, and with what consequences. Research is based on heterosexual marriages. I interviewed 12 individuals, 6 males and 6 females, who are separated or divorced. 2 of the 12 respondents were divorced twice, so there is a total of 14 cases, which were then divided into four groups: male and female initiators and non-initiators of separation/divorce. The different voices of divorce reflect both these variables, but also the quality of the courtship, rather than the duration, the relationship with the children and the financial consequences. My findings included that men were in general happier after divorce than the women, the women received custody of the children in all cases, but two cases of parental alienation syndrome were recorded, that happiness after divorce was affected by whether the individual initiated separation or not, that the quality of the sex related to divorce was plural, that the financial consequences for women depended on whether they initiated the separation or not. The voices are so different that further research is necessary.",

      "title": "Insomnia Disorder: Gender Issues Over the Lifespan",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is the most common sleep disorder in the general population, with higher prevalence in women. Three specific periods in a woman's life-puberty, pregnancy and menopause-seem to be associated with marked gender differences in insomnia prevalence. Puberty is a critical stage for the development of insomnia, with an increase in its prevalence among girls after menarche. During pregnancy and the postpartum period, women also report a rise in insomnia symptoms. Various factors, including hormonal, physiological, relational, emotional and environmental ones, can affect sleep during these sensitive times. Furthermore, the transition to menopause tends to exacerbate gender differences in insomnia prevalence, as it is associated with the emergence of physiological and psychological symptoms (e.g., hot flashes, sleep disturbances and mood changes) that can impair sleep. Thus, biological and psychosocial factors seem to explain gender differences in insomnia prevalence and characteristics throughout the lifespan. Considering this framework, this review aims at summarising and deepening the existing empirical literature on gender differences in sleep physiology, insomnia prevalence and clinical characteristics, and predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factors for insomnia disorder, in different ages throughout the lifespan. Attention is also given to sexual minority groups, providing a snapshot of sleep difficulties and insomnia symptoms among transgender people. Although the topic is relevant, available literature is still quite scarce. The investigation of gender differences in insomnia disorder could be useful to better understand its prognosis and outline an appropriate and personalised treatment.",

      "title": "Hormetic sexuality and eroticism promote healthy ageing",
      "abstract": "Eroticism in later life is, on the whole, a taboo subject, and the stigma attached to expressions of sexual intent by older people is widespread in most cultures. However, sexuality and eroticism have an important role to play in maintaining healthy ageing. Sexuality is an essential aspect of our biology and its effects have repercussions in systems and organs other than the sexual. In this chapter I review the importance of developing a sexual-erotic element in later life, an element that is intimately coupled with the phenomenon of hormesis. In hormesis, there is biological benefit following exposure to a mild stimulus or challenge, whereas exposure to a higher dose of the same stimulus becomes detrimental. Innovative sexual stimulation can be seen as a hormetic opportunity to initiate beneficial effects on the entire ageing human organism. The intention is to show that, health benefits may be obtained not only through physical (exercise), nutritional, mental or pharmacological challenges, but also through sexual stimulation of the appropriate magnitude and quality. By enhancing erotic stimulation, it may be possible to experience many other benefits spanning several domains such as the endocrine, immune, circulatory and neurological. In addition, within an increasingly information-rich world, sexuality may play a part in improving adaptation to various cognitive external stimuli originating from our technological ecosystem.",

More importantly, is it wrong to rely on the output of AI tools whose input includes factors such as race or sex? And is it wrong to rely on the output of AI systems when it is correlated with factors such as race or sex (whether or not its input includes such factors)? The answers to these questions are controversial. In this paper, I argue for the following claims. First, since factors such as race or sex are not morally significant in themselves, including such factors in the input data, or relying on output that includes such factors or is correlated with them, is neither objectionable (for example, unfair) nor commendable in itself. Second, sometimes (but not always) there are derivative reasons against such actions due to the relationship between factors such as race or sex and facts that are morally significant (ultimately) in themselves. Finally, even if there are such derivative reasons, they are not necessarily decisive since there are sometimes also countervailing reasons. Accordingly, the moral status of the above actions is contingent.",

      "abstract": "Pregnancy is a very specific and complex period in a woman‚Äôs life. The accompanying changes are observed not only on the biological/physiological plane but also in her psychological and social functioning. Altered psychological functioning can occur from the very beginning to the end of pregnancy, including the postpartum period. During pregnancy, visible changes occur in the body's appearance, as well as in femininity, affections, and sexuality, whereas the woman's position and role are gaining new qualities. To a greater or lesser degree, every expectant mother experiences psychological am¬≠bivalence, frequent mood changes from exhaustion to exaltation, emotional disturbances, and/or mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. In addition, pregnancy causes a number of specific apprehensions concerning the course and outcome, which makes the woman particularly vulnerable and requires adequate treatment, depending on the adaptive capacities of her personality. Furthermore, from a psychosocial aspect, pregnancy could be considered a specific highly emotional state, which may be a potent stressor. Perinatal maternal stress can lead to different complications that may have far-reaching consequences for both somatic and psychic functioning of the newborn. This review considers pregnancy as a complex psychological phenomenon and explores multiple changes in the woman's psychological functioning in both normal and psychologically complicated courses of pregnancy.",

Hookups occur particularly frequently on US college campuses; they are, however, not limited to that context. Most college students have experienced at least one such interaction during their college years. Students perceive their peers as more comfortable with hookups than they are as individuals. The hookup label is elastic and allows for considerable variation in meanings. Although typically defined as occurring between strangers or brief acquaintances, in many cases hookups occur between friends and former (or potential) romantic partners. Hookups generate a variety of positive and negative outcomes, but appear to provide the former more than the latter. Finally, the college‚Äêaged cohort (i.e., emerging adults) is likely drawn to hookups because the nonrelational sex appeals to their life goals of personal exploration and sexual experimentation.",

Our data collected on 111 female and 48 male respondents indicated that Machiavellian antagonism and agency were the best predictors of adulterous behaviour, thus highlighting its 'nothing personal' dimension. No indices of subclinical sadism proved their incremental predictive power in the regression model, thus challenging the 'very personal' approach to the underpinnings of infidelity. In addition, there was no evidence of sex-related differences in proclivity to infidelity.",

      "abstract": "Many previous studies have reported robust sex differences in olfactory perception. However, both men and women can be expected to vary in the degree to which they exhibit olfactory performance considered typical of their own or the opposite sex. Sex-atypicality is often described in terms of childhood gender nonconformity, which, however, is not a perfect correlate of non-heterosexual orientation. Here we explored intrasexual variability in psychophysical olfactory performance in a sample of 156 individuals (83 non-heterosexual) and found the lowest odor identification scores in heterosexual men. However, when childhood gender nonconformity was entered in the model along with sexual orientation, better odor identification scores were exhibited by gender-nonconforming men, and greater olfactory sensitivity by gender-conforming women, irrespective of their sexual orientation. Thus, sex-atypicality, but not sexual orientation predicts olfactory performance, and we propose that this might not be limited to olfaction, but represent a more general phenomenon.",

      "abstract": "Gender diversity refers to gender expressions and/or gender identity experiences that vary from the common experiences of gender. Gender-diverse people may be gender nonconforming, gender nonbinary, gender fluid, gender exploring, transgender, and so forth. Some gender-diverse individuals experience gender dysphoria and/or gender incongruence and may require gender-affirming supports, including gender-affirming medical interventions. The co-occurrence of autism and gender diversity has been highlighted in a series of studies internationally as well as through rich community expressions. Studies in gender-referred individuals reveal high rates of autism traits as well as high rates of existing autism diagnoses. Studies in autistic populations reveal greater gender diversity characteristics. The long-term course of gender diversity in autistic individuals is poorly understood. Clinical guidelines have been developed for adolescents with the co-occurrence, but much work remains: No gender-related measures have been developed and tested for use in neurodiverse populations, no programs exist to support gender-diverse neurodiverse adults, and little is known about co-occurring mental health profiles, risks, or protective factors for people with the co-occurrence. The inclusion of this chapter on co-occurring autism and gender diversity within a book on ‚Äúco-occurring psychiatric conditions‚Äù is problematic, because gender diversity is not a ‚Äúpsychiatric condition,‚Äù but instead a form of human diversity. The diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria is useful only insomuch as it allows individuals to obtain necessary gender-related supports. The authors‚Äô choice to include this chapter in this book reflects a compromise, motivated by the need for educating both autism and gender specialists in this common co-occurrence.",

      "abstract": "Using an Attachment Theory conceptual framework, associations were investigated among positive paternal and maternal relationships, and recent problem behaviors among 501 currently homeless and runaway adolescents (253 males, 248 females). Homeless and runaway youth commonly exhibit problem behaviors such as substance use, various forms of delinquency and risky sex behaviors, and report more emotional distress than typical adolescents. Furthermore, attachments to their families are often strained. In structural equation models, positive paternal relationships significantly predicted less substance use and less criminal behavior, whereas maternal relationships did not have a significant effect on or association with either behavior. Positive maternal relationships predicted less survival sex behavior. Separate gender analyses indicated that among the females, a longer time away from home was significantly associated with a poorer paternal relationship, and more substance use and criminal behavior. Paternal relations, a neglected area of research and often not addressed in attachment theory, should be investigated further. Attachments, particularly to fathers, were protective against many deleterious behaviors. Building on relatively positive relations and attachments may foster family reunifications and beneficial outcomes for at-risk youth.",

      "title": "An Exploration of the Relations Between Self-Reported Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation in an Online Sample of Cisgender Individuals",
      "abstract": "The present study explored the relations between self-reported aspects of gender identity and sexual orientation in an online sample of 4756 cisgender English-speaking participants (1129 men) using the Multi-Gender Identity Questionnaire and a sexual orientation questionnaire. Participants also labeled their sexual orientation. We found a wide range of gender experiences in the sample, with 38% of the participants feeling also as the \"other\" gender, 39% wishing they were the \"other\" gender, and 35% wishing they had the body of the \"other\" sex. Variability in these measures was very weakly related to sexual orientation, and these relations were gender-specific, being mostly U shaped (or inverted-U shaped) in men and mostly linear asymptotic in women. Thus, in women, feeling-as-a-woman was highest in the exclusively heterosexual group, somewhat lower in the mostly heterosexual group, and lowest in the bisexual, mostly homosexual, and exclusively homosexual groups, which did not differ, and the reverse was true for feeling-as-a-man (i.e., lowest in the exclusively heterosexual group and highest in the bisexual, mostly homosexual, and exclusively homosexual groups). In men, feeling-as-a-man was highest at both ends of the sexual orientation continuum and lowest at its center, and the reverse was true for feeling-as-a-woman. Similar relations were evident also for the other aspects of gender identity. This study adds to a growing body of literature that questions dichotomous conventions within the science of gender and sexuality. Moreover, our results undermine the tight link assumed to exist between sexual and gender identities, and instead posit them as weakly correlated constructs.",

      "abstract": "Almost all languages of the world have nominal classification devices in their grammar. The most widespread are linguistic genders (also referred to as noun classes) ‚Äì grammatical classes of nouns based on core semantic properties such as sex (female and male), animacy, humanness, and also shape and size.

Numeral classifiers ‚Äì the most widely represented type ‚Äì categorize the nominal in terms of its inherent nature, animacy, shape, and form, and occur next to a numeral or a quantifier. Numeral classifiers divide into sortal and mensural. Noun classifiers accompany a noun and categorize it in terms of its inherent properties. Possessive classifiers categorize a noun with a possessive construction. Or the nature of the nominal can be reflected in a classifier on the verb, or a suppletive classificatory verb. Each type of nominal classification devices has its preferred semantic parameters. Nominal classification systems tend to reflect social relationships. Grammatical gender is prone to reflect the stereotypes associated with social gender ‚Äì the social implications and norms associated with being a man, or a woman, or a further gender category.",

      "title": "Adolescent School Failure: Failure to Thrive in Adolescence",
      "abstract": "Success in school is an excellent marker for general adolescent well-being; school failure in adolescence is a powerful indicator of other high-risk behaviors, such as delinquency, substance abuse, and pregnancy. It is estimated that about 17% of White non-Hispanic children in the United States are at high or very high risk for these behaviors compared with 51% of African-American children and 45% of Hispanic children.It is difficult to consider any one of these high-risk behaviors in isolation because all can be antecedents to or consequences of any of the others. Lower grades, for example, are associated with substance abuse and early childbearing, and truancy and disruptive behavior at school are related to substance abuse and delinquency. Although there are many complex mitigating factors and pressures, most adolescents initially try hard drugs, commit a first delinquent act, or engage in unprotected intercourse as a personal decision at a given time and place.In contrast, school failure is more insidious, resulting from an array of forces, many of which are outside the control of the adolescent. It occurs at the end of a long process rather than at its initiation. Because school progress frequently is measured through grades and group achievement testing, there are many opportunities for preventive interventions. The ultimate marker of school failure is dropping out. In a sense, school failure and dropout can be viewed as failure to thrive of adolescence. Many of the etiologies for adolescent school failure can be viewed in both public health and medical model frameworks.Successful programs and interventions for adolescent high-risk behaviors largely address the antecedents to these behaviors rather than the behaviors themselves. The antecedents of school failure and subsequent dropping out, which are virtually the same, have been described by Dryfoos (see Suggested Reading) and are summarized in Table 1. Children who are 1 year older than classmates (behind 1 modal grade) have a 20% to 30% greater chance of dropping out of school, even when achievement, social status, and gender are controlled for. This should make clinicians skeptical of endorsing any recommendation for retention. Race and ethnicity cease to become factors in school dropout when social status is controlled for.In addition to the factors listed in Table 1, low self-concept and an external locus of control (believing that the\"winds of fate\" control one's destiny rather than the individual being able to bring about change) are significant predictors of school failure. Children and adolescents who have low self-esteem about their academic ability should be provided with individualized successful academic experiences. Youths who have an external locus of control can be provided with mentored learning experiences that demonstrate the relationship between their positive behaviors (such as sticking to a structured study schedule)and academic outcomes (including getting more work turned in and better test scores).The epidemiologic research (Table 1) cites conduct problems and \"behavior\"‚Äîreferred to in the biobehavioral literature as externalizing behavior problems‚Äîas major predictors of school failure. At the same time,\"psychological factors,\" including stress and depression, are characterized as predictors that only are \"cited in selected sources\" in the literature. This may be explained by reporting bias. Externalizing behavior problems (oppositional and defiant behavior and conduct problems) are easily recognizable in the classroom and affect the ability of teachers to teach and learners to learn as well as the\"social ecology\" of the entire classroom. Internalizing behaviors(anxiety and depression), on the other hand, are not easily identified by teachers and peers and do not often interfere with general classroom functioning. It is strongly incumbent on clinicians to ask about and identify any internalizing behavior problems in adolescents who are performing poorly in school because the health-care system may be the only professional interface outside of school used by adolescents and their families that is prepared to diagnose and treat these symptoms.The relationship between household composition and school failure is inconsistent. For example, it is unclear whether single-parent households are correlated with higher rates of school failure or dropping out.Children from disadvantaged homes have been found to succeed in excellent schools. On the other hand, some schools are so inadequate that success is the exception. In one recent survey, almost 70% of adolescents who had dropped out of school stated that they might have stayed if\"teachers paid more attention to students\" and if \"we were not treated like inmates.\"Effective programs that prevent school failure and dropout share three major attributes: Early intervention programs such as Head Start and Early Childhood Special Education have focused successfully on the prevention of learning and developmental problems and educating parents in child development. Successful school-age programs have maintained a focus on basic academic skills and recognized the primary importance of a healthy school climate.Several years ago Dr Michael Rutter studied students making the transition from primary schools to middle schools in London. He found that the best students often did poorly when moved into the worst schools, while the poorer students often did well when placed in the best schools. The \"best\" schools could be characterized as emphasizing academics; allowing teachers autonomy to meet the educational needs of individual students; and having programmatic flexibility,systems of incentives and rewards for students, and systems that allow students to take responsibility for their own behaviors. In the United States, Dr James Comer has established a model school-based management approach in inner-city New Haven, Connecticut, and other cities. These schools have advisory councils consisting of the principal,teachers, teacher aides, and parent groups. They also have school-based mental health teams, paid parent participation programs, and a flexible academic program.Programs such as these provide for individualized attention and instruction for students and attract committed teachers who have high expectations. Links between learning and working (such as working in a nursing home and keeping a daily journal of this experience) have been found to be extremely effective in many programs. Some high-risk students require intensive, sustained counseling before they can take full advantage of these programs.Adolescents who are successful despite extremely high-risk profiles have been found to have specific interests and been supported in pursuing them; often have had some mentoring relationship that has encouraged them to believe in themselves; and have been described as self-aware, self-directed, and committed to interpersonal relationships.State-mandated promotion policies that rely solely on testing results are ineffective. Raising school standards without raising the quality of the schools simply encourages failure and dropout. Grouping classes by\"ability\" has uncertain benefits for the lowest achieving students at a potentially enormous psychological cost. Being labeled as \"below average\" can have a tremendously negative effect on students' self-concepts. Teachers often have low expectations of these students, and this can become self-fulfilling. Early intervention or basic skills programs without follow-up are often unsuccessful. Programs in which adolescents are \"scared straight\" or\"moralized to\" almost always fail. The question should be: \"How do schools fail adolescents?\" rather than \"How do adolescents fail school?\"Factors contributing to school failure are among the most frequent problems presenting to primary care clinicians who see school-age children and adolescents. The public health model reviewed previously provides an important overview that is particularly helpful when formulating public policy. Although this model also can suggest some important areas to be pursued, it lacks the analysis of pathogenesis that is most helpful to clinicians in making a diagnosis and planning effective intervention for individual adolescents and their families. A differential diagnostic model for school failure in adolescents is presented in Table 2. Infants exposed to prenatal drugs and alcohol have an increased potential for school failure,particularly secondary to attentional disorders and lowered cognitive abilities. The same holds true for significant exposure to toxins such as lead. Serious hearing or vision impairment, particularly when unrecognized, can result in poor achievement and subsequent behavior problems. Chronic illness can result in significant school absence,as can \"functional disorders\" such as chronic recurrent abdominal pain or headaches. Neurologic disorders such as seizure disorders,neurodegenerative diseases, static and toxic encephalopathies, and post-traumatic disorders may be accompanied by cognitive and attentional limitations.In addition, certain medications,including some anticonvulsants and asthma medications, can lead to cognitive slowing and attentional problems in school. Adolescent substance use and abuse certainly can lead to school failure and truancy. Teenage pregnancy is another marker for all of the high-risk behaviors of adolescence. All of these conditions are likely to come to the attention of clinicians who care for adolescents, and a careful school history should be an integral part of these medical/neurologic evaluations.Biobehavioral disorders are associated with impaired production in school work, mild-to-severe learning problems, socialization and communication difficulties, and disruptive behavior in the classroom.ADHD is the most prevalent biobehavioral disorder of childhood and adolescence. The current DSM-IV formulation for ADHD is two-dimensional and has three subtypes:predominantly inattentive,predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. The latter two types are often brought to the attention of parents by teachers and subsequently to the attention of clinicians. The predominantly inattentive type often remains undetected. It manifests primarily through difficulties with school achievement and a slow work production speed and often occurs concomitantly with symptoms of anxiety or depression. The number of children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD is largely a function of the diagnostic criteria used. In a clinical sample,15% more children and adolescents meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD than met the former DSM-III-R criteria. In an epidemiologic sample(Wolraich), a comparison of teacher ratings of the same students on DSM-III-R and DSM-IV scales resulted in a 57% increase in diagnoses of ADHD, primarily due to identification of children who met the criteria for inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive types of ADHD. ADHD presents differently in adolescence than it does in early and middle childhood. Hyperactivity often is diminished, and the condition is characterized more by continued impulsivity, poorer school performance, and school failure in adolescence. Previous social skills deficits are magnified as poor peer relationships become more obvious and prominent at a developmental stage where peer group acceptance increases in significance. Because of continuing impulsivity, the high-risk behaviors of childhood become the extraordinarily high-risk behaviors of adolescence. The challenges to minor rules or parental limit setting of early and middle childhood now become substance abuse, delinquency,early and unprotected sexual activity,and repeated antisocial behavior.Diagnosing and treating attention disorders in adolescents is associated with several complicating factors. Because of the process of separation and adolescent individuation, parents may no longer be good sources of information about their adolescents. Feedback from and communication with teachers often is complicated by a student having multiple teachers, none of whom may know the student in the detail required to formulate specific learning needs. Finally, the signs and symptoms of attentional disorders usually are not evident during routine office visits.Medication management of attentional disorders also may be more complicated and problematic with adolescents. Dosing is more variable among patients. Stimulant medications take on \"street value.\"Afternoon and early evening doses of stimulant medications increase in importance as demands for producing school work increase. Adolescents who attributed little value to taking medications in early and middle childhood now may refuse to take them, which can lead to increased parent-adolescent conflict as well as escalating school failure.Factors that support a favorable outcome for adolescents who have ADHD include: early evaluation and intervention; self-understanding and acceptance of problems and issues; a supportive family; an understanding and developmentally attuned school system; appropriate individual educational plans (IEPs) if indicated;and a willingness to engage in appropriate counseling, mentoring relationships, and \"coaching\"surrounding production and completion of work. High-risk factors for negative outcomes include: delayed diagnosis; an ongoing cycle of failure; serious behavior problems in school (oppositional, defiant, and conduct problems); significant substance abuse; medication refusal;and damaged self-esteem resulting from the adolescent's problems being viewed as \"characterologic disorders\" rather than as biobehavioral issues that are amenable to systematic interventions.Learning disabilities generally are defined on a discrepancy model:significant discrepancies between cognitive skills (intelligence quotient[IQ]) and achievement, between achievement in different areas(eg, mathematics and reading),or between an individual's achievement and that of grade-mates. The DSM-IV recognizes learning disabilities in reading, mathematics,and written expression as well as communication disorders involving expressive language and mixed receptive and expressive language. Criteria for special educational services based on these disabilities vary from state to state.Learning challenges and demands change significantly during adolescence. Demands on attention in adolescence require more consistent and sustained mental energy, more efficient processing of information, and a significantly increased ability to produce school work. Adolescents need more techniques for remembering, recalling, and summarizing new information, such as mnemonic devices and visual associations. New visual/spatial challenges include increased demands for nonverbal reasoning, visualizing strategies,and familiarity with interpretation and production of graphic representations of information.At this developmental stage, it is assumed that sequential skills include the abilities to stage work appropriately, preview what is required to do the work, make realistic schedules for accomplishing long-term assignments, and organize school work in the context of a busy life with increased social demands and outside activities. Language demands require a greater emphasis on abstract language, learning of a second language, more complex verbal reasoning, and a considerably increased demand for fluency in written language. Neuromotor skills call on abilities for speed-writing,note-taking, and keyboarding. If writing is not automatic or too slow, work production may be impaired severely. Increased cognitive demands include abilities in advanced problem-solving skills and a greater ability to handle abstract concepts.The majority of students who are mentally retarded (IQ <69 with commensurably delayed adaptive functioning) or have autism and more severe autistic-like disorders (PDD) should have been evaluated, diagnosed, and placed in special school programming well before adolescence. Adaptive programs that optimize life and vocational skills and minimize physical, emotional, and sexual exploitation should be well under way for these individuals by the time they reach mid-adolescence.However, adolescents who have borderline intellectual functioning (IQ of 70 to 85) may not have been detected or may have been labeled as \"slow learners.\" They may not qualify for special help in the school system because their academic achievement is not significantly discrepant from their cognitive abilities (IQ). These adolescents are particularly vulnerable to school failure when success demands a greatly increased ability to organize, plan, complete, and turn in work and depends on accessing and using many higher level cognitive skills.Milder forms of PDD, including \"high-functioning autism,\"Asperger syndrome, and nonspecific forms of PDD, also may not have been detected previously. Adolescents who have these disorders are at risk for increasing emotional trauma and rejection as their social awkwardness among peers becomes more evident and relationships take on increased significance.The disruptive behavior disorders are defined in the DSM-IV as ADHD, ODD, and CD. ODD is characterized by losing one's temper; arguing with adults; defying adult requests and rules; blaming others for one's own mistakes; using obscenity; and being touchy or easily annoyed, angry, resentful, spiteful,and vindictive. During adolescence these attributes may lead to increased conflict at school and at home as developmental individuation becomes prominent. With parents less able to exert control over behavior and issues such as homework production, school failure becomes more likely.CD is characterized by stealing, running away from home, setting fires, lying,breaking into homes or cars, and physical and sexual aggression. Although patterns of CD may be well established before adolescence, during the adolescent years the behaviors are likely to be more serious and have more serious consequences. The prognosis for ADHD in adolescents is much poorer when CD is also present. Further, CD can be exacerbated by impulsivity,especially when it occurs concomitantly with ADHD. These adolescents may be easily influenced to become involved in delinquent acts when they succumb to peer pressure. CD may be helped by the same measures used to treat ADHD:stimulant medication, behavioral techniques, and cognitive-behavioral training.Conduct-disordered behavior that is premeditated is much more difficult to treat, carries a much worse prognosis, and may be seen in adulthood as an antisocial personality disorder. Adolescents who exhibit conduct-disordered behavior are at significant risk for major depressive disorder, and this always should be ruled out or treated as indicated.The disruptive behavior disorders are usually obvious at home and interfere significantly with classroom functioning. For these reasons, they often are brought to the attention of clinicians by parents and teachers. In contrast,the internalizing behavior disorders, depression and anxiety, often are unrecognized by parents and teachers and may present as nonspecific school failure and/or social isolation. The primary care clinician may be in a unique position as the only professional outside of the school system to interact with adolescents and their families about school-related issues. Symptoms and signs may not be apparent during an office visit, and adolescents may be reluctant to discuss these issues spontaneously. Depression and anxiety should be considered routinely whenever the issues of suboptimal school performance or school failure arise.The clinician can link the public health and medical models for adolescent school failure. A format for planning an evaluation for school problems, failure, and dropout is presented in Table 3. It is important to recognize that the biobehavioral and behavioral/emotional diagnoses cannot withstand the rigors of the more \"medical model\"diagnostic approach. For example, ADHD and depressive disorders can be quite difficult to distinguish from each other by using any clinical data other than the diagnostic criteria. In addition, multiple diagnoses are more often the rule than the exception. For this reason, it may be more fruitful to generate a problem checklist based on functional limitations than to use a more formal diagnostic approach. This allows the generation of evidence-based treatment interventions for problems where an adolescent's behavior is significantly interfering with optimal functioning.Evaluation of school-related problems can present a challenge. The gathering of information can be time-consuming, and insurance coverage for these labor-intensive and often lengthy evaluations generally is suboptimal. Although it can be argued that early and comprehensive evaluation and treatment should be extremely cost-effective, this remains an unexamined and highly neglected area of clinical research.Most of the target behaviors related to the etiology of school failure are not evident in the office and may require multiple measures, information from multiple observers, and at times, a multidisciplinary approach. Many rating scales that have been devised to help gather information efficiently also have been normed for reliability and validity (Table 4). Most scales cannot be used to make diagnoses, but they can be extremely helpful in gathering structured information from various sources in a manner that allows for quantitative comparison of adolescents with their peers. Recent reviews by Aylward and Kutcher of these and other rating scales can be found in the Suggested Reading.Primary care clinicians should develop or use previously developed structured histories that can be filled out by parents and teachers before an initial evaluation visit and reviewed by the clinician prior to the visit. By using rating scales and prereviewed structured histories, a primary care evaluation visit that includes observations and interviews with parents and adolescents usually can be conducted in less than 1 hour of direct clinical time. The use of rating scales and structured histories allows the clinician to focus on the most important questions for a particular adolescent during the evaluation visit. Parent-adolescent dynamics and conflicts and affective responses of the adolescent to family issues and other specific questions can be observed only during an effective interview.In the clinical setting, private discussions should be initiated with preadolescents. A primary goal is to foster self-esteem and to promote self-efficacy and ownership of both strengths and vulnerabilities through education and support. Adolescents generally should be seen alone and identified as the \"patient\" where developmentally appropriate. They should participate in making decisions and take increasing responsibility for all interventions. However, clear communication with parents or guardians is also essential.Problems with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (the ADHD\"triad\") can be confirmed with a careful history, interview, and use of normed and validated rating scales. Physical and routine neurologic examinations usually are not helpful unless otherwise indicated. Neurodevelopmental findings can support the diagnosis of attentional disorders(particularly difficulties with short-term and active working memory and sequential organization) and suggest the presence of coexisting developmental and learning style problems, such as motor and language delays or processing difficulties. Examining general learning style issues, rather than problems related only to inattention and impulsivity, is critical.The neurodevelopmental examination of an adolescent typically includes an examination of fine motor, gross motor, and grapho-motor skills; language;visual-perceptual-motor functioning; temporal-sequential organization abilities; cognitive speed; and short-term memory skills. The role of computerized tests of attention (continuous performance tasks) in the evaluation and management of attentional disorders remains controversial. These tests never should be used alone for diagnosis, although they can be helpful in distinguishing the group of adolescents at highest risk for attentional disorders. Typical false-negative rates range from 15% to 35%, and false-positive rates are about 2%.Interventions for the ADHD triad of symptoms include education about and demystification of the symptoms, medication management with stimulants or other agents such as certain antidepressants or alpha-2-adrenergics as indicated, and interventions related to specific learning style issues.Disruptive behavior disorders also can be evaluated with a careful history and interview as well as normed and validated rating scales. Interventions include behavioral parent training for parents and the introduction or enhancement of behavioral management programs at school.Underachievement can be evaluated by cognitive (IQ) and achievement testing performed by the school or a community child psychologist. An optimal assessment includes an analysis of where in the process of reading, writing,or mathematics the learning breaks down. Adolescents in whom there are significant findings are entitled to and should request a formal Individual Education Plan (IEP) through the school system.The internalizing behaviors of depression and anxiety can be screened for by history, interview, and normed and validated rating scales. Screening tools include multidimensional rating scales such as the Child Behavior Checklist(Achenbach) and the Behavioral Assessment Scales for Children (BASC) as well as the more specific (but not truly categorical) scales of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Referrals then can be made as indicated by results of screening. Adolescents at risk should be referred for appropriate evaluation. Interventions include medication management and psychotherapy.Family functioning always should be assessed as part of the evaluation for school failure. Again, evaluation consists of a careful history and interview and may be enhanced using normed and validated scales for family stress and perceptions concerning family functioning. The primary intervention for significantly impaired family functioning is family therapy. Some families often cannot take advantage of the more behaviorally oriented parent training until they engage in family therapy.Adolescent social functioning and the ability to self-modulate behavior adequately can be evaluated through history, interview, and rating scales. Effective interventions center on cognitive-behavioral (self-talk)techniques.However substance abuse is addressed, a drug screen is strongly recommended. This can be performed ethically only with the adolescent's consent.Assessing the match between the adolescent and the school and/or teachers is difficult for most primary care clinicians providing care to a geographically diverse population of adolescents. However, if a decline in school performance has been precipitous or it cannot be accounted for by the rest of the evaluation, a school/teacher and adolescent mismatch may be significant.Because school-related problems are multidimensional, it is very helpful to primary care clinicians to develop a community referral network or become part of a community-based assessment team that might include a clinical psychologist (for evaluation of adolescents at risk for depression, anxiety,and other emotional concerns as well as provision of family and individual psychotherapy), an educational or school psychologist (for psychoeducational assessment), and school professionals, with additional consultants as indicated. Within this context, primary care clinicians should be able to diagnose attentional disorders and medically related problems and be able to screen for other problems and disorders.The role of the primary clinician in dealing with school failure can be critical by linking the epidemiological with the clinical and encompassing the pediatric/adolescent life span. It includes components of social and public health advocacy, preventive medicine, evaluation, education, treatment, and referral. The most effective interventions are early and multifaceted. The primary care role includes: community advocacy; counseling about prenatal drug and alcohol abuse; early detection and treatment for attentional disorders,underachievement, and learning disabilities; interviews addressing multiple risk factors, grades, school attitudes, behavior, and friends; anticipatory guidance; education about individual learning style and good \"learning hygiene\"; early referral and intervention for preadolescent conduct problems and parent-child conflict; early referrals for family distress; and prevention of substance abuse and adolescent pregnancy.",

In one recent survey, almost 70% of adolescents who had dropped out of school stated that they might have stayed if‚Äúteachers paid more attention to students‚Äù and if ‚Äúwe were not treated like inmates.‚ÄùEffective programs that prevent school failure and dropout share three major attributes: Early intervention programs such as Head Start and Early Childhood Special Education have focused successfully on the prevention of learning and developmental problems and educating parents in child development. Successful school-age programs have maintained a focus on basic academic skills and recognized the primary importance of a healthy school climate.Several years ago Dr Michael Rutter studied students making the transition from primary schools to middle schools in London. He found that the best students often did poorly when moved into the worst schools, while the poorer students often did well when placed in the best schools. The ‚Äúbest‚Äù schools could be characterized as emphasizing academics; allowing teachers autonomy to meet the educational needs of individual students; and having programmatic flexibility,systems of incentives and rewards for students, and systems that allow students to take responsibility for their own behaviors. In the United States, Dr James Comer has established a model school-based management approach in inner-city New Haven, Connecticut, and other cities. These schools have advisory councils consisting of the principal,teachers, teacher aides, and parent groups. They also have school-based mental health teams, paid parent participation programs, and a flexible academic program.Programs such as these provide for individualized attention and instruction for students and attract committed teachers who have high expectations. Links between learning and working (such as working in a nursing home and keeping a daily journal of this experience) have been found to be extremely effective in many programs. Some high-risk students require intensive, sustained counseling before they can take full advantage of these programs.Adolescents who are successful despite extremely high-risk profiles have been found to have specific interests and been supported in pursuing them; often have had some mentoring relationship that has encouraged them to believe in themselves; and have been described as self-aware, self-directed, and committed to interpersonal relationships.State-mandated promotion policies that rely solely on testing results are ineffective. Raising school standards without raising the quality of the schools simply encourages failure and dropout. Grouping classes by‚Äúability‚Äù has uncertain benefits for the lowest achieving students at a potentially enormous psychological cost. Being labeled as ‚Äúbelow average‚Äù can have a tremendously negative effect on students‚Äô self-concepts. Teachers often have low expectations of these students, and this can become self-fulfilling. Early intervention or basic skills programs without follow-up are often unsuccessful. Programs in which adolescents are ‚Äúscared straight‚Äù or‚Äúmoralized to‚Äù almost always fail. The question should be: ‚ÄúHow do schools fail adolescents?‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúHow do adolescents fail school?‚ÄùFactors contributing to school failure are among the most frequent problems presenting to primary care clinicians who see school-age children and adolescents. The public health model reviewed previously provides an important overview that is particularly helpful when formulating public policy. Although this model also can suggest some important areas to be pursued, it lacks the analysis of pathogenesis that is most helpful to clinicians in making a diagnosis and planning effective intervention for individual adolescents and their families. A differential diagnostic model for school failure in adolescents is presented in Table 2. Infants exposed to prenatal drugs and alcohol have an increased potential for school failure,particularly secondary to attentional disorders and lowered cognitive abilities. The same holds true for significant exposure to toxins such as lead. Serious hearing or vision impairment, particularly when unrecognized, can result in poor achievement and subsequent behavior problems. Chronic illness can result in significant school absence,as can ‚Äúfunctional disorders‚Äù such as chronic recurrent abdominal pain or headaches. Neurologic disorders such as seizure disorders,neurodegenerative diseases, static and toxic encephalopathies, and post-traumatic disorders may be accompanied by cognitive and attentional limitations.In addition, certain medications,including some anticonvulsants and asthma medications, can lead to cognitive slowing and attentional problems in school. Adolescent substance use and abuse certainly can lead to school failure and truancy. Teenage pregnancy is another marker for all of the high-risk behaviors of adolescence. All of these conditions are likely to come to the attention of clinicians who care for adolescents, and a careful school history should be an integral part of these medical/neurologic evaluations.Biobehavioral disorders are associated with impaired production in school work, mild-to-severe learning problems, socialization and communication difficulties, and disruptive behavior in the classroom.ADHD is the most prevalent biobehavioral disorder of childhood and adolescence. The current DSM-IV formulation for ADHD is two-dimensional and has three subtypes:predominantly inattentive,predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined. The latter two types are often brought to the attention of parents by teachers and subsequently to the attention of clinicians. The predominantly inattentive type often remains undetected. It manifests primarily through difficulties with school achievement and a slow work production speed and often occurs concomitantly with symptoms of anxiety or depression. The number of children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD is largely a function of the diagnostic criteria used. In a clinical sample,15% more children and adolescents meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD than met the former DSM-III-R criteria. In an epidemiologic sample(Wolraich), a comparison of teacher ratings of the same students on DSM-III-R and DSM-IV scales resulted in a 57% increase in diagnoses of ADHD, primarily due to identification of children who met the criteria for inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive types of ADHD. ADHD presents differently in adolescence than it does in early and middle childhood. Hyperactivity often is diminished, and the condition is characterized more by continued impulsivity, poorer school performance, and school failure in adolescence. Previous social skills deficits are magnified as poor peer relationships become more obvious and prominent at a developmental stage where peer group acceptance increases in significance. Because of continuing impulsivity, the high-risk behaviors of childhood become the extraordinarily high-risk behaviors of adolescence. The challenges to minor rules or parental limit setting of early and middle childhood now become substance abuse, delinquency,early and unprotected sexual activity,and repeated antisocial behavior.Diagnosing and treating attention disorders in adolescents is associated with several complicating factors. Because of the process of separation and adolescent individuation, parents may no longer be good sources of information about their adolescents. Feedback from and communication with teachers often is complicated by a student having multiple teachers, none of whom may know the student in the detail required to formulate specific learning needs. Finally, the signs and symptoms of attentional disorders usually are not evident during routine office visits.Medication management of attentional disorders also may be more complicated and problematic with adolescents. Dosing is more variable among patients. Stimulant medications take on ‚Äústreet value.‚ÄùAfternoon and early evening doses of stimulant medications increase in importance as demands for producing school work increase. Adolescents who attributed little value to taking medications in early and middle childhood now may refuse to take them, which can lead to increased parent-adolescent conflict as well as escalating school failure.Factors that support a favorable outcome for adolescents who have ADHD include: early evaluation and intervention; self-understanding and acceptance of problems and issues; a supportive family; an understanding and developmentally attuned school system; appropriate individual educational plans (IEPs) if indicated;and a willingness to engage in appropriate counseling, mentoring relationships, and ‚Äúcoaching‚Äùsurrounding production and completion of work. High-risk factors for negative outcomes include: delayed diagnosis; an ongoing cycle of failure; serious behavior problems in school (oppositional, defiant, and conduct problems); significant substance abuse; medication refusal;and damaged self-esteem resulting from the adolescent‚Äôs problems being viewed as ‚Äúcharacterologic disorders‚Äù rather than as biobehavioral issues that are amenable to systematic interventions.Learning disabilities generally are defined on a discrepancy model:significant discrepancies between cognitive skills (intelligence quotient[IQ]) and achievement, between achievement in different areas(eg, mathematics and reading),or between an individual‚Äôs achievement and that of grade-mates. The DSM-IV recognizes learning disabilities in reading, mathematics,and written expression as well as communication disorders involving expressive language and mixed receptive and expressive language. Criteria for special educational services based on these disabilities vary from state to state.Learning challenges and demands change significantly during adolescence. Demands on attention in adolescence require more consistent and sustained mental energy, more efficient processing of information, and a significantly increased ability to produce school work. Adolescents need more techniques for remembering, recalling, and summarizing new information, such as mnemonic devices and visual associations. New visual/spatial challenges include increased demands for nonverbal reasoning, visualizing strategies,and familiarity with interpretation and production of graphic representations of information.At this developmental stage, it is assumed that sequential skills include the abilities to stage work appropriately, preview what is required to do the work, make realistic schedules for accomplishing long-term assignments, and organize school work in the context of a busy life with increased social demands and outside activities. Language demands require a greater emphasis on abstract language, learning of a second language, more complex verbal reasoning, and a considerably increased demand for fluency in written language. Neuromotor skills call on abilities for speed-writing,note-taking, and keyboarding. If writing is not automatic or too slow, work production may be impaired severely. Increased cognitive demands include abilities in advanced problem-solving skills and a greater ability to handle abstract concepts.The majority of students who are mentally retarded (IQ <69 with commensurably delayed adaptive functioning) or have autism and more severe autistic-like disorders (PDD) should have been evaluated, diagnosed, and placed in special school programming well before adolescence. Adaptive programs that optimize life and vocational skills and minimize physical, emotional, and sexual exploitation should be well under way for these individuals by the time they reach mid-adolescence.However, adolescents who have borderline intellectual functioning (IQ of 70 to 85) may not have been detected or may have been labeled as ‚Äúslow learners.‚Äù They may not qualify for special help in the school system because their academic achievement is not significantly discrepant from their cognitive abilities (IQ). These adolescents are particularly vulnerable to school failure when success demands a greatly increased ability to organize, plan, complete, and turn in work and depends on accessing and using many higher level cognitive skills.Milder forms of PDD, including ‚Äúhigh-functioning autism,‚ÄùAsperger syndrome, and nonspecific forms of PDD, also may not have been detected previously. Adolescents who have these disorders are at risk for increasing emotional trauma and rejection as their social awkwardness among peers becomes more evident and relationships take on increased significance.The disruptive behavior disorders are defined in the DSM-IV as ADHD, ODD, and CD. ODD is characterized by losing one‚Äôs temper; arguing with adults; defying adult requests and rules; blaming others for one‚Äôs own mistakes; using obscenity; and being touchy or easily annoyed, angry, resentful, spiteful,and vindictive. During adolescence these attributes may lead to increased conflict at school and at home as developmental individuation becomes prominent. With parents less able to exert control over behavior and issues such as homework production, school failure becomes more likely.CD is characterized by stealing, running away from home, setting fires, lying,breaking into homes or cars, and physical and sexual aggression. Although patterns of CD may be well established before adolescence, during the adolescent years the behaviors are likely to be more serious and have more serious consequences. The prognosis for ADHD in adolescents is much poorer when CD is also present. Further, CD can be exacerbated by impulsivity,especially when it occurs concomitantly with ADHD. These adolescents may be easily influenced to become involved in delinquent acts when they succumb to peer pressure. CD may be helped by the same measures used to treat ADHD:stimulant medication, behavioral techniques, and cognitive-behavioral training.Conduct-disordered behavior that is premeditated is much more difficult to treat, carries a much worse prognosis, and may be seen in adulthood as an antisocial personality disorder. Adolescents who exhibit conduct-disordered behavior are at significant risk for major depressive disorder, and this always should be ruled out or treated as indicated.The disruptive behavior disorders are usually obvious at home and interfere significantly with classroom functioning. For these reasons, they often are brought to the attention of clinicians by parents and teachers. In contrast,the internalizing behavior disorders, depression and anxiety, often are unrecognized by parents and teachers and may present as nonspecific school failure and/or social isolation. The primary care clinician may be in a unique position as the only professional outside of the school system to interact with adolescents and their families about school-related issues. Symptoms and signs may not be apparent during an office visit, and adolescents may be reluctant to discuss these issues spontaneously. Depression and anxiety should be considered routinely whenever the issues of suboptimal school performance or school failure arise.The clinician can link the public health and medical models for adolescent school failure. A format for planning an evaluation for school problems, failure, and dropout is presented in Table 3. It is important to recognize that the biobehavioral and behavioral/emotional diagnoses cannot withstand the rigors of the more ‚Äúmedical model‚Äùdiagnostic approach. For example, ADHD and depressive disorders can be quite difficult to distinguish from each other by using any clinical data other than the diagnostic criteria. In addition, multiple diagnoses are more often the rule than the exception. For this reason, it may be more fruitful to generate a problem checklist based on functional limitations than to use a more formal diagnostic approach. This allows the generation of evidence-based treatment interventions for problems where an adolescent‚Äôs behavior is significantly interfering with optimal functioning.Evaluation of school-related problems can present a challenge. The gathering of information can be time-consuming, and insurance coverage for these labor-intensive and often lengthy evaluations generally is suboptimal. Although it can be argued that early and comprehensive evaluation and treatment should be extremely cost-effective, this remains an unexamined and highly neglected area of clinical research.Most of the target behaviors related to the etiology of school failure are not evident in the office and may require multiple measures, information from multiple observers, and at times, a multidisciplinary approach. Many rating scales that have been devised to help gather information efficiently also have been normed for reliability and validity (Table 4). Most scales cannot be used to make diagnoses, but they can be extremely helpful in gathering structured information from various sources in a manner that allows for quantitative comparison of adolescents with their peers. Recent reviews by Aylward and Kutcher of these and other rating scales can be found in the Suggested Reading.Primary care clinicians should develop or use previously developed structured histories that can be filled out by parents and teachers before an initial evaluation visit and reviewed by the clinician prior to the visit. By using rating scales and prereviewed structured histories, a primary care evaluation visit that includes observations and interviews with parents and adolescents usually can be conducted in less than 1 hour of direct clinical time. The use of rating scales and structured histories allows the clinician to focus on the most important questions for a particular adolescent during the evaluation visit. Parent-adolescent dynamics and conflicts and affective responses of the adolescent to family issues and other specific questions can be observed only during an effective interview.In the clinical setting, private discussions should be initiated with preadolescents. A primary goal is to foster self-esteem and to promote self-efficacy and ownership of both strengths and vulnerabilities through education and support. Adolescents generally should be seen alone and identified as the ‚Äúpatient‚Äù where developmentally appropriate. They should participate in making decisions and take increasing responsibility for all interventions. However, clear communication with parents or guardians is also essential.Problems with attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity (the ADHD‚Äútriad‚Äù) can be confirmed with a careful history, interview, and use of normed and validated rating scales. Physical and routine neurologic examinations usually are not helpful unless otherwise indicated. Neurodevelopmental findings can support the diagnosis of attentional disorders(particularly difficulties with short-term and active working memory and sequential organization) and suggest the presence of coexisting developmental and learning style problems, such as motor and language delays or processing difficulties. Examining general learning style issues, rather than problems related only to inattention and impulsivity, is critical.The neurodevelopmental examination of an adolescent typically includes an examination of fine motor, gross motor, and grapho-motor skills; language;visual-perceptual-motor functioning; temporal-sequential organization abilities; cognitive speed; and short-term memory skills. The role of computerized tests of attention (continuous performance tasks) in the evaluation and management of attentional disorders remains controversial. These tests never should be used alone for diagnosis, although they can be helpful in distinguishing the group of adolescents at highest risk for attentional disorders. Typical false-negative rates range from 15% to 35%, and false-positive rates are about 2%.Interventions for the ADHD triad of symptoms include education about and demystification of the symptoms, medication management with stimulants or other agents such as certain antidepressants or alpha-2-adrenergics as indicated, and interventions related to specific learning style issues.Disruptive behavior disorders also can be evaluated with a careful history and interview as well as normed and validated rating scales. Interventions include behavioral parent training for parents and the introduction or enhancement of behavioral management programs at school.Underachievement can be evaluated by cognitive (IQ) and achievement testing performed by the school or a community child psychologist. An optimal assessment includes an analysis of where in the process of reading, writing,or mathematics the learning breaks down. Adolescents in whom there are significant findings are entitled to and should request a formal Individual Education Plan (IEP) through the school system.The internalizing behaviors of depression and anxiety can be screened for by history, interview, and normed and validated rating scales. Screening tools include multidimensional rating scales such as the Child Behavior Checklist(Achenbach) and the Behavioral Assessment Scales for Children (BASC) as well as the more specific (but not truly categorical) scales of the Child Depression Inventory (CDI) and the Revised Children‚Äôs Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Referrals then can be made as indicated by results of screening. Adolescents at risk should be referred for appropriate evaluation. Interventions include medication management and psychotherapy.Family functioning always should be assessed as part of the evaluation for school failure. Again, evaluation consists of a careful history and interview and may be enhanced using normed and validated scales for family stress and perceptions concerning family functioning. The primary intervention for significantly impaired family functioning is family therapy. Some families often cannot take advantage of the more behaviorally oriented parent training until they engage in family therapy.Adolescent social functioning and the ability to self-modulate behavior adequately can be evaluated through history, interview, and rating scales. Effective interventions center on cognitive-behavioral (self-talk)techniques.However substance abuse is addressed, a drug screen is strongly recommended. This can be performed ethically only with the adolescent‚Äôs consent.Assessing the match between the adolescent and the school and/or teachers is difficult for most primary care clinicians providing care to a geographically diverse population of adolescents. However, if a decline in school performance has been precipitous or it cannot be accounted for by the rest of the evaluation, a school/teacher and adolescent mismatch may be significant.Because school-related problems are multidimensional, it is very helpful to primary care clinicians to develop a community referral network or become part of a community-based assessment team that might include a clinical psychologist (for evaluation of adolescents at risk for depression, anxiety,and other emotional concerns as well as provision of family and individual psychotherapy), an educational or school psychologist (for psychoeducational assessment), and school professionals, with additional consultants as indicated. Within this context, primary care clinicians should be able to diagnose attentional disorders and medically related problems and be able to screen for other problems and disorders.The role of the primary clinician in dealing with school failure can be critical by linking the epidemiological with the clinical and encompassing the pediatric/adolescent life span. It includes components of social and public health advocacy, preventive medicine, evaluation, education, treatment, and referral. The most effective interventions are early and multifaceted. The primary care role includes: community advocacy; counseling about prenatal drug and alcohol abuse; early detection and treatment for attentional disorders,underachievement, and learning disabilities; interviews addressing multiple risk factors, grades, school attitudes, behavior, and friends; anticipatory guidance; education about individual learning style and good ‚Äúlearning hygiene‚Äù; early referral and intervention for preadolescent conduct problems and parent-child conflict; early referrals for family distress; and prevention of substance abuse and adolescent pregnancy.",

      "title": "Overview of infertility",
      "abstract": "Having a child is an innate trait in animals, including humans, and is required for the continued existence of all animal species. Therefore, for most women, the inability to conceive or to do so in a timely fashion - termed infertility - to enable the continuation of the family line can be emotionally distressing. The definition of infertility is controversial because of its separation into primary and secondary. This is further complicated by the loosely used term subfertility, which relates to couples who have reduced ability because they take longer than the natural time to conceive, as opposed to those who are infertile and are entirely unable to conceive after 6 to 12 months, depending on age. Infertility evaluation requires a thorough male and female history, physical examination of both partners, and targeted investigation to determine the cause of infertility in a particular couple. Various treatments apply to infertile couples depending on the age of the female partner, the results of investigations, the reason for infertility, the presence of inheritance of abnormal genes, the pregnancy rates the couple is happy with, the resources available, how desperate the couple is to achieve a live birth, and how much they want to commit to treatment. Infertility treatment could include counseling and expectant management only, intrauterine insemination in a natural or stimulated cycle, and IVF and or ICSI. Men with azoospermia will need surgical options to retrieve sperm for IVF/ ICSI, but rarely for IUI. This review overviews infertility's etiology, diagnosis, investigations, and treatment.",

Loneliness often occurs in conjunction with social isolation, but a person can be socially isolated without feeling lonely and can feel lonely without being socially isolated. In contrast with social isolation, loneliness is more closely related to the perceived quality than quantity of social relationships. Historically, emotional loneliness, defined as deficiencies in relationships with a close other such as a spouse, has been distinguished from social loneliness, defined as deficiencies in social networks or feelings of belonging (Weiss, 1973). Recent empirical evidence supports three distinct dimensions of loneliness reflecting perceived deficits in intimate, relational, and collective connections. Thus, not being married, having few friends and relatives and/or little contact with them, and not taking part in any voluntary groups are examples of specific risk factors for intimate, relational, and collective loneliness, respectively (Hawkley, Browne, &amp; Cacioppo, 2005).",

Five broad statuses or prototypic styles of resolving the issues of this stage are proposed using combinations of (a) an individual's level of vital involvement, or active concern for the growth of the self and others, and (b) an individual's tolerance of different ideas, traditions, and values, which, by extension, determines the scope of caregiving concern. The Generative status is characterized by high vital involvement and tolerance, and represents the most positive psychosocial outcome. The Pseudogenerative-Agentic status is high in vital involvement and tolerance for self but not for others, while Pseudogenerative-Communal is high in vital involvement and tolerance for others but not for self. The Conventional status, high in vital involvement for both self and others, is low in tolerance across the board. Stagnant reflects the poorest psychosocial outcome, and is low in vital involvement and tolerance generally.

The authors also tested predicted mediators, finding that men‚Äôs social dominance orientation (a competitive intergroup ideology) mediated the avoidance to hostile sexism link. In addition, romanticism (an idealized interpersonal ideology) mediated attachment insecurity to BS links: (a) Avoidant men tended to reject romanticism (i.e., were cynical about romance) and, in turn, were likely to reject BS, whereas (b) anxious men tended to endorse romanticism (i.e., were idealistic about romance) and, in turn, likely to endorse BS. The authors conclude that men‚Äôs sexism stems in part from dispositional attachment working models, both directly and through the interpersonal and intergroup ideologies they generate.",

      "title": "Normative Beliefs Regarding Aggression in Emerging Adulthood",
      "abstract": "Abstract Few studies have examined the nature of aggression in emerging adulthood (ages 18‚Äì25), a unique developmental period wherein relationships become increasingly important and intimate. Consistent with a greater emphasis on relationships, relationally manipulative forms of aggression may be particularly salient during this time period. Based on content analysis of perceptions of 134 undergraduate students, this study documents a significant spectrum of normative aggressive behaviors among emerging adults. Participant responses were coded into categories reflective of current aggression research. Findings indicate that perceptions of salient aggressive strategies vary by gender of both the aggressor and the victim. For example, male aggression was most often described as being verbal or directly physical in nature, especially in same‚Äêsex dyads. In contrast, female aggression was most often described as being indirectly relational, verbal, or non‚Äêverbal (ignoring/avoiding) across dyads. However, direct relational aggression was also fairly prominent in perceptions of female aggression toward males.",

Hence, it is important to understand how and when individual differences in multiple domains of self‚Äêconcept begin to stabilize and whether individual differences remain stable throughout childhood and adolescence and into early adulthood. Methods We assessed individuals‚Äô ( N = 372) scholastic, social, athletic, and physical appearance self‚Äêconcepts at five waves over 20 years from age 4 to age 24. Results In general, stability was large, but medium‚Äêsized estimates were obtained for some domains over longer (e.g., 6‚Äêyear) intervals. Indirect effects from preschool to early adulthood were small, but from age 14 to 24 were medium to large. Stabilities maintained significance independent of family socioeconomic status and global self‚Äêworth. Stability estimates were similar for boys and girls except over adolescence for scholastic self‚Äêconcept, which was more stable for girls than boys. Conclusions Multiple domains of self‚Äêconcept constitute stable individual‚Äêdifference characteristics, independent of global feelings of self‚Äêworth. Individuals who have high or low self‚Äêconcepts early in development tend to maintain their relative standing into early adulthood suggesting points of intervention.",

This cross‚Äênational study assesses the effects of social risks on adjustment of racially similar groups of 306 African American and 625 South African 6‚Äêyear‚Äêolds. Poverty and gender were confirmed as risk factors but single female headship was not. Moreover, poverty and gender posed less risk for South African than for African American children. Poverty placed children at risk for immaturity, hyperactivity, and difficulty in peer relations. Boys were more likely to have behavior problems than were girls. African Americans exhibited higher rates of emotional symptoms but lower rates of bullying, destructiveness, and social rejection than did South Africans. African Americans, particularly the males, scored higher on the opposition and hyperactivity scales than did South Africans. Distinctive social contexts and cultural resources may account for differences in adjustment.",

However, spousal support does not have to be unanimously positive. In fact, very little is known about covariations in spousal affect and aches as couples engage in their daily routines and environments. Up to 27 simultaneous, momentary assessments from 49 older adult married couples ( M age = 72 years [60‚Äì83]; M relationship duration = 42 years) were used taking into account the perspective of both partners. This study shows that social support within marriage was associated with reduced overall levels of negative affect (NA) but unrelated to positive affect (PA). Interestingly, high spousal support was both associated with reduced overall NA means but also with an increased covariation in NA between partners. No similar covariations were observed for aches and PA. Spousal support may be a double-edged sword; it is associated with reduced overall NA, but it may also lead to more permeable boundaries between spouses that seem to be specific to NA.",

Biologically, sex hormones and nucleus accumbent neurotransmitters (mainly testosterone and dopamine) govern human desire. Working, family, mentality, and stress might affect libido. Medical disorders, drugs, lifestyle, relationships, and age might affect libido (e.g., puberty). Hypersexuality is having frequent or suddenly increased sexual impulses; hyposexuality is the opposite. In psychoanalytic thought, libido is a mental drive or energy, connected with sexual instinct but is also present in other innate urges. A man may want sex but not be able to act on it, or may not for medical, moral, or religious reasons. Repressing or sublimating an urge is psychological. One can participate in sexual activity without a sire. Stress, illness, and pregnancy affect sperm drive. Testosterone, estrogen, progesterone, oxytocin, and norepinephrine act as serotonin This book chapter talks about how functional foods such as spinach, dark chocolate, peppers, green tea, oysters, crab, and pumpkin seeds, which contain neurotransmitters, affect libido.",

This study tested two conflicting sets of predictions concerning divorce patterns in the United States: a socioeconomic set and a biocultural set. The socioeconomic perspective predicts that the addition of one or more children to a marriage would increase the husband's (as compared with the wife's) motivation to petition for a divorce. The biocultural perspective posits that a man-to-child affiliative bond would add to a man's adherence to his child(ren) and, in turn, would lower his motivation (as compared with the woman's) to petition for a divorce.

Research suggests that sexual consent is frequently expressed nonverbally and indirectly. In fact, many people seem to indicate consent passively by doing nothing (i.e., not refusing or resisting). For these reasons, it can be difficult to interpret when consent has, or has not, occurred. Further, consensual sex is not always wanted sex; research has found that individuals often consent or agree to engage in sex that they do not want or desire. Traditional expectations for men's and women's roles in sexual encounters (e.g., the expectation that men will initiate sex and women will act as ‚Äúgatekeepers‚Äù) may influence how consent is communicated by men and women in heterosexual interactions.",

      "abstract": "Based on 2 1/2 years of field research between 1961 and 1970 Heider describes and attempts to explain the extraordinarily low sexual activity particularly the long postpartum abstinence of a small group of Grand Valley Dani men in the central highlands of Irian Jaya Indonesia (West New Guinea). Characteristics of the postpartum sexual abstinence include: 1) 4-6 years of abstinence 2) consistent observation by the Dani of the abstinence 3) lack of explanation of the custom or the enforcement of sanctions by the Dani 4) lack of other sexual outlets in the society such as masturbation homosexuality beastiality or overt polygymy and 5) no signs of unhappiness or stress. The behavior and attitudes of the postpartum abstinence are described in detail. Low levels of emotional energy invested in sexuality are also observable in other activities of the Dani such as the rate of birth extramarital sex homosexuality child-rearing practices initiation rites use of the penis sheath or gourd teenagers play interpersonal interaction intelligence as reflected in abstract thinking and the expression of art and adaptation to change and health. In all but one of these activities e.g. teenagers play there is always a low expression of energy; teenagers songs drawings and string figures often illustrate explicit sexual actions. In comparison of the two views of sexual energy the relativistic and the more common Freudian ones Heider concludes that the Danis sexual behavior is culturally derived and fits closely with the view of Dani society as a low level energy system. Using comparative examples causes of low energy sexuality are suggested to be a result of the lack of seasonality in the region or more likely the low stress and stimulation of infants. However no causal factors seem sufficient enough to explain the phenomena of low level sexuality.",

Although it has been shown to be correlated with certain negative adjustment outcomes for adolescents, little is known about the ways in which factors such as coping style and ethnicity/culture are related to the extent to which adolescents co-ruminate. In the present study, students from one all-male (n = 445) and one all-female (n = 432) parochial high school responded to questionnaires that assessed co-rumination, coping style, and ethnicity/culture. Co-rumination was positively correlated with involuntary engagement coping and negatively associated with voluntary disengagement coping for both males and females. It was positively correlated with involuntary disengagement coping for females only and positively correlated with primary control engagement coping and negatively correlated with secondary control engagement coping for males only. Asian American/Pacific Islander females reported significantly greater co-rumination than did African American and Hispanic/Latin American females; ethnicity/culture was not related to co-rumination for males. Implications for future research on the mechanisms by which coping and culture are associated with co-rumination are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Psychopathy is characterised by profound deficits in the human tendency to feel and care about what other people feel, often known as 'affective empathy'. On the other hand, the psychopath often has intact 'cognitive' empathy skills, that is, he is able to describe what and why other people feel, even if he does not share or care about those feelings. Despite a rapidly advancing neuroscience of empathy, little is known about the developmental underpinnings of this psychopathic disconnect between affective and cognitive empathy.The parents of N = 2760, 3-13-year-olds reported on the levels of empathy, callous-unemotional traits (CU), and antisocial behaviour (AB). Consistent with current theory and measurement practice, an index of 'psychopathic traits' was derived from the CU and AB measures.There are important gender and developmental differences in empathy deficits related to psychopathic traits. As expected, psychopathy is associated with severe deficits in affective empathy across all ages for males; however, no such deficits were found for females. Contrary to adult findings, psychopathic traits are associated with deficits in cognitive empathy in childhood for both sexes; however, males with high psychopathic traits appear to overcome these deficits in cognitive empathy as they move through the pubertal years.In contrast to cognitive empathy, low affective empathy does not appear to be associated with psychopathic traits in females. The characteristic disconnect between cognitive and affective empathy seen in adult male psychopathy crystallises in the pubertal years when they appear to learn to 'talk the talk' about other people's emotions, despite suffering severe deficits in their emotional connection (affective empathy) to others.",

But some of people are born with imperfect physique conditions, with multiple genital organs (penis and vagina), or have an imperfect genitals (have one sex but there are organs the sex is not perfect, so the sex is not clear). Though the clarity gender has a certain legal consequenses. In this case they motivated to do genital surgery. The genital surgery that tend to Tashih or Takmil (repair or refinement) is permitted but sex change is prohibited. This is because people born with abnormal genitals can experiencing psychological and social disorders so that they can be excluded and isolated from the lives of normal people and sometimes to find their own way, like prostitute themselves as transvestites or commit homosexuality and lesbianis.",

      "abstract": "There is now good evidence from several prospective studies that antenatal maternal stress, anxiety or depression can have long term consequences for the development of the fetus and the child. There can be a wide range of effects and both behavioural and cognitive outcomes can be altered. Such fetal programming is independent of the postnatal environment, although the nature of maternal care may have a modifying influence. The effects are clinically significant; about 15% of behavioural problems such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder may be attributable to prenatal stress. Not all children are affected, and those that are can be affected in different ways. Presumably there is an interaction with the genetic predisposition, but this has not yet been studied. There is little agreement about the gestational windows of vulnerability, which are probably different for different outcomes. Also we do not know the nature of the stress which is most harmful, although there is some evidence that stress due to a bad relationship with the partner is damaging, and anxiety has greater influence than depression. In animal models there is good evidence for the mediating effects of the HPA axis in both mother and fetus. In humans the evidence is less clear. Several studies have found little or no association between anxiety or depression and maternal cortisol in later pregnancy. However we have found an inverse association between amniotic fluid cortisol and child cognitive ability at 17 months, which is only apparent in insecurely attached children.",

      "abstract": "Interracial couples experience stressors that can negatively impact their relationship quality, such as racial discrimination. In dyads in which one partner identifies as White and the other identifies as Black or Hispanic, the stress due to racial discrimination is associated with differential alternatives: The White partner can end the relationship to stop their experience with the stress of racial discrimination, but Black or Hispanic partners cannot. As such, the White partner is a ‚Äúweak link‚Äù in such relationships, and understanding processes that can mitigate discrimination-induced stress for White partners could be beneficial for interracial relationship longevity. In this study, we examined perspective-taking as a process to reduce momentary, discrimination-based stress. White partners in interracial relationships ( N = 292) were randomly assigned to engage in perspective-taking (or remain objective) when imagining their partner experiencing discrimination (or a common aversive situation). We predicted, and found, that momentary stress was lower for White partners who took their partners‚Äô perspectives while thinking about them experiencing racial discrimination than for those who objectively recounted the details of their partners‚Äô experiencing racial discrimination. In turn, lower momentary stress predicted greater commitment and relationship satisfaction. This indicates that perspective-taking can reduce the momentary stress a White partner experiences during an event of racial discrimination, which may strengthen interracial relationships.",

      "abstract": "Cases where BDSM practitioners have been discriminated against have been well documented, alongside a wealth of innumerable anecdotal accounts of discrimination and prejudice. This has partially contributed to the culture of silence where some practitioners choose to remain closeted, or are at least very selective about disclosure. While presumably it may not be in many BDSM practitioners' interests to broadcast their sexual proclivities, this silence could contribute to an internalised sense of shame, guilt and isolation, and can become a barrier for people in abusive relationships to seek assistance ‚Äì feeling they may have to interact with unsympathetic and/or ignorant law enforcement officials and counsellors, and may attract unwanted media attention in the process. The most common forms of prejudicial treatment that BDSM practitioners encounter in their daily lives ‚Äì or what BDSM practitioners fear the most should their proclivities be made publicly known ‚Äì are jeopardising their careers and losing child custody battles, due to the conflation of BDSM with mental illness, sexual lasciviousness and violence. Some practitioners who identify more strongly with, or practise with greater frequency, the sadomasochistic aspect of BDSM may also be hesitant to seek professional medical advice, fearing any potential misunderstandings and misguided assumptions that their healthcare provider may derive from their bruises, welts and scars. Preliminary results from a public opinion survey administered to local non-BDSM practitioners ‚Äì which uses the Attitudes about Sadomasochism Scale (ASMS) to assess their attitudes and opinions about BDSM and BDSM practitioners ‚Äì suggest that overall, non-practitioners may not have as negative of a perception as practitioners believe. While there can be no doubt that, as with any other minority group, BDSM practitioners will continue to face discrimination in a heteronormative-conforming world, attitudinal changes about BDSM may begin to challenge the perceived necessity of practitioners having to conceal their 'unconventional' desires.",

      "title": "Paraphilia Induced Suicide: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Paraphilia is a term used to describe different sexual deviations involving unconventional methods of sexual gratification. Paraphili as indulged in abnormal and orthodox sex play by using objects as parts of the body or fantasies in which complete satisfaction is sought and obtained without sexual intercourse. Perversions are acts that are socially prohibited or unacceptable, or biologically undesirable. In sexual paraphilia, usually, person psychopaths suffer from mental aberrations and conflicts, socio-sexual maladjustments, psychosexual imbalance, and abnormalities. Paraphilia-induced suicide is a type of anomic suicide, and anomic suicide is due to a lack of social regulation that occurs during high levels of stress and frustration. Paraphilia may induce suicide even though paraphilia is not punishable. It is just due to fear of social defamation and social taboo. Case presentation: A 59-year-old male committed suicide on the railway track, and thenthe body was sent to the mortuary room for an autopsy examination. History was taken from the police and relatives. He was a widower for the last 15 years. Conclusions: Paraphilia is the form of the insertion of foreign bodies in the rectum, and when a person cannot remove foreign bodies himself, attending a hospital is very humiliating. To prevent the social integrity or selfesteem, the person committed suicide. Where this type of paraphilia is not listed as a crime in India, for sexual gratification, a person may use it by any means, which may be natural or unnatural form. Many unnatural forms of paraphilia are used by many people, which is not punishable. Sexual gratification is done by most of normal people and a few abnormal psychiatric people by any sexual perversion. All paraphilia that is not punishable by the law should not be considered a social taboo.",

As a story about sex it is (possibly) salacious and will reveal things about me that some may regard as private, better left unsaid and unsuitable in an academic essay. Except that I am not an academic and this is not an academic essay but a story of someone usually identified as a (transsexual) woman. Except I don‚Äôt identify myself as a binary transsexual woman but as a non-binary assigned male at birth (AMAB) person. In writing about my sex life I want to ask a few questions about (my) gender, sexuality, identity and deception. \r\nSex, at least for me, can be risky in more ways than one. I‚Äôm anally receptive but sexual risk for me is not all about possible exposure to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), it is also whether a sexual encounter might leave me as a victim of ‚Äútrans panic‚Äù: will the next person who fucks me perhaps beat me senseless before claiming I deceived them and they didn‚Äôt know I was AMAB until it was too late? Am I at more risk, and also more deceptive, if a partner thinks I‚Äôm a cis-gender woman or a binary transsexual woman? Just where does the line between being ‚Äúout and proud‚Äù, passing and deception lie for me as a non-binary AMAB surviving in a largely binary world? \r\nIn this essay, I thus wish to explore how issues of sex and deception might interact and raise questions for me as a non-binary, AMAB person. In doing so I will attempt to interweave a critical analysis of some media stories of sexual deception with an autoethnographic account of sex. I am not wise enough to have answers to my questions, however, but instead hope that others may do so.",

      "title": "The unmarried adolescent parent.",
      "abstract": "Factors contributing to illegitimate adolescent pregnancies are examined in the hopes of providing a basis for establishing preventative and remedial approaches to the problem. Most of the information comes from previously published material. 7 nonsexual impulses which can be expressed in sexuality often leading to illegitimate pregnancy are 1) feelings of inadequacy; 2) a wish to be loved; 3) a wish to mother; 4) a wish to have a gift for the mother; 5) competition with the mother; 6) a wish to have a baby to identify with; and 7) hostility toward men. Studies indicate that somewhere along the line both the mother and father of an unwed mother have failed. Often the girls feel unloved and are not taught how to deal with and control their emotions. Many come from broken homes and have difficulty relating with other people. They appear to have a strong desire for self-punishment. The unwed mother is not usually promiscuous but her knowledge of sex and contraception often is very limited. A profile of the putative father generally does not reveal a sexual exploiter. Often he is very involved with his partner and willing to marry her. But he is immature and lacking in responsibility. He often does not have a strong masculine identity. Illegitimate pregnancies create social and financial problems to both the mother and the child. Those who give up their babies for adoption were found to be more stable intelligent and mature and to feel the stigma of illegitimacy more strongly. Many unwed mothers eventually marry the putative father; those who dont can pose serious problems related to economic support education child care and health. One way to cut down on the number of illegitimate children is to educate and provide contraceptives for girls who have already had an illegitimate pregnancy since about half of all illegitimate births are to mothers who already have 1 or amore illegitimate children.",

      "title": "Early childhood sexual abuse increases suicidal intent",
      "abstract": "Childhood sexual abuse has been consistently associated with suicidal behavior. We studied suicide attempt features in depressed individuals sexually abused as children. On average, sexual abuse started before age 9. It frequently coexisted with physical abuse. Suicide attempters more often had personality disorders and had endured abuse for longer, but did not differ in terms of other clinical characteristics from non‚Äêattempters. Earlier onset of sexual abuse and its duration were associated with more suicide attempts. However, when personality disorders were included in the regression model, only these disorders predicted number of attempts. The severity of sexual abuse and the coexistence of physical abuse were correlated with age at first suicide attempt. However, only severity of sexual abuse was marginally associated with age at first suicide attempt in the regression model. Finally, the earlier the age of onset of sexual abuse, the higher the intent, even after controlling for age, sex and personality disorders. This suggests that the characteristics of childhood sexual abuse, especially age of onset, should be considered when studying the risk for suicidal behavior in abused populations.",

      "abstract": "Working with religious issues in therapy is essential for those clients whose belief system is the basis for their difficulty. The foundation of sexual health is frequently hindered by the attitude of traditional religious understanding and teachings about sexuality. Religious beliefs often contribute to the formation of sexual difficulties, and can also interfere with the progress of therapy. Religious belief systems can broadly be categorized as fixed, or absolute, and process, or evolving. Each has a set of core values that influence conscience and behavior. Formation of conscience becomes difficult without guidelines for decision-making. The areas of scripture, tradition, reason, and experience are explored to gain a sense of where the authority for teaching and decision-making lies. Clinical examples illustrate the importance of understanding the role of religion-induced anxiety in interfering with the sexual response cycle and contributing to sexual dysfunction in both men and women. Homosexuality is explored with a special reference to biblical themes.",

The principle, which we all share, is that all persons are equal and none are less equal than others. No disability, however slight, nor however severe, implies lesser moral, political or ethical status, worth or value. This is a version of the principle of equality. The three fallacies exhibited by some or all of my critics are the following: (1) Choosing to repair damage or dysfunction or to enhance function, implies either that the previous state is intolerable or that the person in that state is of lesser value or indicates that the individual in that state has a life that is not worthwhile or not thoroughly worth living. None of these implications hold. (2) Exercising choice in reproduction with the aim of producing children who will be either less damaged or diseased, or more healthy, or who will have enhanced capacities, violates the principle or equality. It does not. (3) Disability or impairment must be defined relative either to normalcy, \"normal species functioning\", or \"species typical functioning\". It is not necessarily so defined.",

      "abstract": "Solitude is a frequently cited motive for visiting parks, forests, and wilderness areas. But while visitors frequently say they achieve their solitude goals, most visit in groups of two or more, suggesting a conception that differs from the classical ideal of being profoundly alone with the universe. Moreover, solitude often can be experienced negatively, surrounded by feelings of loneliness and depression. In this paper, we explore both positive and negative solitude experiences as mental states rather than physical conditions. Results suggest that both states occur frequently, perhaps two or three times per week, and both tended to occur while the person was alone, although this was not a requirement. Both were preceded by a sense of stress, and were likely to occur in environments close to home. Women were more likely to experience solitude at home, while men were more likely to achieve it outdoors.",

B y assuming a causal order among a range of individual attributes, this paper applies multivariate analysis to 1983 data to suggest some causes of dissatisfaction between partners. The main causes appear to be a lack of shared attitudes towards moral standards and sex, moral standards being the predominant factor for women, sex the predominant factor for men. Perhaps surprisingly, socioeconomic status is of lesser importance, more income reducing dissatisfaction, a better occupation increasing it. Finally, religiosity reduces dissatisfaction for women, but has little importance for men.",

      "abstract": "One or a combination of age, period or cohort effects may drive changes in trends over time, for example, producing a widening or narrowing of socioeconomic differences in an outcome or leading to an increase or decrease in an outcome for one socioeconomic group alone. Age effects mean that the change occurs in all individuals at a particular age irrespective of when they were born or the current time period. For example, an increase in socioeconomic differentials occurring at the age of retirement (irrespective of what time period is being examined or which birth cohort individuals were born in) would be described as an age effect. A cohort is a group of people defined by a particular attribute (or set of attributes). In the context of age-period cohort effects, ‚Äòcohort‚Äô refers to birth cohort. Thus, the group (cohort) are defined by the period (usually the year) in which they were born. Cohort analysis is the tabulation and analysis of data, such as morbidity and mortality rates or educational outcomes, in relation to the birth cohorts of the individuals concerned. Cohort effect (also known as generational effect) refers to variations in health status that arise from the different causal factors to which each birth cohort in the population is exposed. Every birth cohort is exposed to different social and environmental circumstances that coincide with its life span. Because the meaning of socioeconomic measurements varies by birth cohorts (for example, a female who was born in 1910 obtaining a university degree is likely to have been from a different social stratum to a female born in 1975 obtaining a university degree) cohort effects are important to consider when examining the association of socioeconomic position (SEP) with health and other outcomes.",

Sexuality is the capacity to have erotic experiences and responses. According to Masters and Johnson, the human sexual response cycle consists of four phases: excitement, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. The World Health Organization's International Classifications of Diseases defines sexual problems as ways in which an individual is unable to participate in a sexual relationship as he or she would wish. There are four major categories of sexual problems: desire disorders, arousal disorders, orgasmic disorders, and sexual pain disorders. Sexual arousal disorder in men, erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction (ED) or impotence is sexual dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis during sexual activity.Orgasmic disorders In men, premature ejaculation Premature ejaculation (PE) occurs when a man experiences orgasm and expels semen soon after sexual activity and with minimal penile stimulation. Sexuality has been explained in the Ayurveda classics in detail along with the various disorders related to desire, arousal, orgasmic and sexual pain disorders. The various formulations have been explained in classics to relieve these disorders and help the man to enjoy their sexual life.Considering these issues the need of hour this conceptual study has been carried out to help, support and provide enhanced sexual life with readily available pure botanicals which are time tested evidenced based and 100% safe and effective.",

Why does failing to do any of these things make us distressed or unhappy? These experiences make us happy because,directly or indirectly,they have been linked to,and not having them has presented obstacles to,survival and reproductive success in our evolutionary past.The positive emotions collectively known as happiness are in turn selected by nature to motivate us to continue to pursue these fitness enhancing activities.So has the desire to seek happiness been selected to motivate living.An evolutionary psychological explanation of happiness focuses on the functions of the concerning experiences which are ultimately related to reproductive success including survival to reach reproductive success.",

Predictors of development of complicated grief after prenatal loss include lack of social support, pre-existing relationship difficulties, or absence of surviving children, as well as ambivalent attitudes or heightened perception of the reality of the pregnancy. Risk of complicated grief was found to be especially high after termination of a pregnancy due to fetal abnormality. Studies have revealed that men and women show different patterns of grief, potentially exacerbating decline in a relationship.

      "abstract": "The menstrual cycle starts on the first day of the menstrual period and ends the day before the next period begins, and the average length of the menstrual cycle is 28 days. In different phases of the cycle there are different hormone levels. At the beginning of the cycle, the level of both estrogen and progesterone rises. Then, just before ovulation,the level of estrogen reaches the top. After that, the level of estrogen starts to fall but progesteron rises. In the luteal phase the progesterone level is higher than estrogen. Then, the level of both hormones is low and it is time for menstrual bleeding. Also, depending on different phases of menstrual cycles, fertility changes, and also some aspects of human behaviour and experince. For example, a woman is the most fertile during ovulation, and that is why she feels most attractive then, to increase her chances to find a partner, according to evolutionary theory. The body image is a subjective representation of one's own physical appearance that reflects the perception, thinking and feelings of a person related to her body. So, as the level of hormones/fertility changes, the feeling of attractiveness also changes in different phases of the cycle, which is why we can assume that also the perception of body also will. So, the purpose of this research was to determine whether satisfaction with appearance changes depending on different phases of the menstrual cycle. The subjects were 49 women, students older than 18 years of age. The average age was 21. Participants of research were women who have regular menstrual cycle, don't use contraceptive pills and don't have any reproductive or endocrine disease diagnosed. The research was conducted in two phases of measurement: ovulation and luteal phase of menstrual cycle, in which subjects filled The Body-Esteem Scale (BES; Franzoi i Shields, 1984). The BES consists of three subscales: Sexual Attractiveness, Weight Concern and Physical Condition. The results of this research show that there is no significant difference in satisfaction with body appearance in different phases of menstrual cycle, luteal (infertile) and ovulation (fertile) phase.",

      "abstract": "Um grande percentual de mulheres sofre com a dificuldade de obter um resultado satisfatorio no ato sexual. Este fato ocorre pela ligacao direta entre os aspectos biopsicossociais e o desenvolvimento do individuo. A mulher foi vitima de uma sociedade que, por muito tempo, nao considerou a import√¢ncia do seu prazer na relacao sexual, ja que tal teria como o intuito a reproducao. Essa dificuldade afeta a saude mental, resultando numa baixa autoestima ou ate questionamentos quanto a sua sexualidade. Deste modo, o presente estudo tem como objetivo conceituar termos de saude mental e saude sexual, a fim de elucidar influencias biopsicossociais na construcao de bloqueios sexuais e identificar praticas que auxiliam no tratamento de disfuncoes sexuais. A metodologia utilizada e descritiva e exploratoria, com uma abordagem qualitativa, atraves de artigos que focassem na teoria de Wilhelm Reich e a teoria inicialmente clarificada por Arnold Kegel (1948). A saude mental e considerada um estado pleno de bem-estar fisico, mental e social, nao apenas sendo uma mera ausencia de doenca ou enfermidade. A saude sexual faz uma juncao a outra, destacando a sexualidade e seus relacionamentos, que envolvem a possibilidade de experiencias livres de discriminacao (OMS, 2001). A causa do bloqueio sexual foi assunto de estudo na perspectiva de reichiana em sua psicologia do corpo, atraves de conceitos como as couracas musculares e bloqueio emocional. Estes sao aspectos relacionados a vivencias traumaticas e repressoras resultantes da sociedade e funcionam como uma defesa contra o meio externo que vai se consolidando no decorrer do desenvolvimento do individuo, de acordo com Castro (2016). Para dissolve-la, segundo Reich citado por Shiavan e Sposito (2009), e preciso a descarga bioenergetica, trabalhando mente e corpo simultaneamente no processo terapeutico. Filho et al (2013) cita exercicios elaborados pelo ginecologista Kegel, assim como Fontanella (2011) menciona o pompoarismo, com sua origem na India. Estes consistem em uma ginastica intima que proporciona varios beneficios para a saude e sexualidade feminina. A partir destas constatacoes, conclui-se que a vida sexual da mulher e um assunto pouco discutido ainda nos tempos atuais, onde estudos estao gradativamente crescendo, o que faz refletir o quao o prazer sexual de uma mulher ainda e um assunto desinteressante para uma sociedade com ponto de vista sexista",

      "abstract": "We consider a variant of the Stable Marriage Problem where preference lists of man/woman may be incomplete, may contain ties and may have bounded length in presence of a notion of social stability.In real world matching applications like NRMP and Scottish medical matching scheme such restrictions can arise very frequently where set of agents (man/woman) is very large and providing a complete and strict order preference list is practically in-feasible.In presence of ties in preference lists, there exist three different notion of stability, weak stability, strong stability and super stability.The most common solution is to produce a weakly stable matching.It is a fact that in an instance of Stable Marriage problem with Ties and Incomplete list (SMTI), weakly stable matching can have different sizes.This motivates the problem of finding a maximum cardinality weakly socially stable matching.In this paper, we find maximum size weakly socially stable matching for a special instance of Stable Marriage problem with Ties and Incomplete bounded length preference list under Social Stability.The motivation to consider this instance is the known fact, finding maximum size weakly socially stable matching in any larger instance of this problem is NP-hard.",

A relationship will, on the other hand, be called ‚Äúclosed‚Äù against outsiders so far as, according to its subjective meaning and its binding rules, participation of certain persons is excluded, limited, or subjected to conditions. Whether a relationship is open or closed may be determined traditionally, affectually, or rationally in terms of values or of expediency. It is especially likely to be closed, for rational reasons, in the following type of situation: a social relationship may provide the parties to it with opportunities for the satisfaction of spiritual or material interests, whether absolutely or instrumentally, or whether it is achieved through co-operative action or by a compromise of interests. If the participants expect that the admission of others will lead to an improvement of their situation, an improvement in degree, in kind, in the security or the value of the satisfaction, their interest will be in keeping the relationship open. If, on the other hand, their expectations are of improving their position by monopolistic tactics, their interest is in a closed relationship.",

      "abstract": "It seems vital to address the problem of extramarital relationships or marital infidelity, which is a traumatic issue for families and spouses and a common issue in counseling and treatment for mental health therapists. This social problem is also very common, however, due to its crucial and personal aspect, accurate information about its prevalence is not available in Iran. Infidelity refers to any concealment of a spouse about an extramarital affair. In fact, secrecy is an important part of an illegitimate and romantic relationship. Types of infidelity include sexual, emotional, and virtual (Internet) infidelity. Men react more strongly to sexual infidelity and women to emotional infidelity. An important point to note is that dissatisfaction with marriage can lead to infidelity, but a successful marriage is no guarantee that it will not happen. Despite its prevalence, not much research has been done in this area. In a US study, integrative intervention therapy was used for couples with such problem and it was found that this integrated treatment model had a good effect on the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Some tudies have been conducted in Iran despite the sensitivity of the issue. In a systematic review conducted in Mashhad to investigate the causes of infidelity in married women, four causes of individual-personality, cultural-social, family-educational, and religious-belief were more effective than other causes. In another study, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) was performed in Tehran to reduce anxiety and depression among women with extramarital affairs and it was observed that this treatment clearly reduces the mentioned symptoms.",

We investigated the relationship between three behaviors (physical aggression, relational aggression, and prosocial behaviors) and three social outcomes (peer rejection, acceptance, and reciprocal friendships) in thirdand sixth-grade girls and boys. Significant gender differences in physical aggression and prosocial behaviors were found at both grade levels. Regression analyses demonstrated the gender-specific role of relational ag gression. Among girls, but not boys, relational aggression explained variance in rejection beyond that explained by overt aggression.

In addition, the women's original family environments, state‚Äîtrait anxiety levels, body images and gender role identities were assessed. Both women and husbands were found to have some problems related to sexual satisfaction in general. Although the husbands seemed to have no problems about sexual relations, it was noted that the women did not have sexual contact frequently, tended to avoid sex and were not very sensual during the sexual interaction. They had fears of pain, physical harm or death during coitus and delivery. Most of the couples evaluated their marriages as satisfctory. Trait anxiety level, wives' evaluations of their husbands as undependable, and authoritarian‚Äîoppressive attitudes of the parents were found to be the predictive variables of vaginismus.",

      "abstract": "Manipulation of the anus can produce sensations that are perceived to be pleasurable by certain individuals and may be interpreted as sexual sensations. Anal erotic activities have been noted in the professional literature and in popularised sex manuals, but a detailed accounting of these activities and statistics on their prevalence have not been well quantified. Much of the literature tends to generalise anal sexuality into anal intercourse, resulting in few publications on other anal activities. Because of the perceived cultural unpleasantness of the subject, researchers and subjects are reluctant to discuss more than cursory references to any such activity; however, recent social surveys have indicated that there may a higher level of interest in these activities than might be suspected. Anal manipulation, also known as anal masturbation, may be performed either as a prelude to other sexual activities or may be enjoyed as an activity in itself. It may be performed with a sex partner or as a form of autoeroticism, either independently or in conjunction with genital masturbation. This paper reviews anatomical, physiological and psychological aspects of anal masturbation. Methods include manipulation by the fingers, dildos and vibrators, and the insertion of small objects into the anus and rectum. Some of these activities are potentially hazardous, producing either internal physical damage or the introduction of pathogenic organisms. An extensive list of references on all these topics is included for readers to explore further aspects of the subject. (author abstract)",

The logic of psychotherapy (cure of illness) is incompatible with the logic of couple counselling. The primary purpose is love. The chosen language has to fit love. The neutrality requirement is indispensable for couple counselling. Men and women conceive their life plans in a certain time, a certain epoch, in a social stratum or simply in a certain culture. Their life plans developed in this culture are woven into partnerships. The dissolution of partnerships therefore always leads to a turning point in life plans. Customers, specialist literature, literature on love of men and women and their own lives have led us to the following conclusion: All statements and allegations made are contingent and temporary. In couple counselling only change remains a stable factor.",

Adultery refers to a violation of sexual fidelity within marriage. Infidelity is defined more broadly as a betrayal of the commitment to sexual or emotional exclusivity in a relationship without the partner's consent. Infidelity is also known by other terms, such as affair, cheating, unfaithful, extramarital sex, and extradyadic relationship. Infidelity applies to a variety of relationships such as dating, cohabiting, heterosexual, homosexual, and marriage. Contemporary technological advances have created new avenues for cheating, such as the Internet, cell phones, and social media. Although most societies and nearly all major world religions have standards that discourage infidelity, there are cultural variations in terms of attitudes and behaviors. Additionally, there are historical and cultural differences between the attitudes and behaviors of men and women regarding infidelity.",

Although the phrase language deprivation syndrome may be new, the observation, that deficits observed in some deaf people's life skills might be due not to sensory deprivation or to social impoverishment, but specifically to deprivation, is not. Language deprivation is often the unintended outcome of well-intentioned efforts to promote a child's development. The existence of deprivation is a corollary to the existence of a critical period for learning one's first language. The most severe cases of deprivation therefore follow a child's not being exposed to consistent and fully elaborated during the entire critical period, approximately the first five years of life. Language deprivation persists in large part because it crosses the boundaries of multiple professional disciplines, none of which is solely responsible for a child's outcome.",

      "title": "Principles of Toxicology: A Clinical Review",
      "abstract": "Toxicology can be defined as that branch of science that deals with poisons, and a poison can be defined as any substance that causes a harmful effect when administered, either by accident or design, to a living organism. In short, it is the study of toxic kinetics and toxic dynamic. Poison is a quantitative concept, almost any substance being harmful at some doses but, at the same time, being without harmful effect at some lower dose. Between these two limits there is a range of possible effects, from subtle long-term chronic toxicity to immediate lethality. Vinyl chloride may be taken as an example. It is a potent hepatotoxic at high doses, a carcinogen with a long latent period at lower doses, and apparently without effect at very low doses. The measurement of toxicity is also complex. Toxicity may be acute or chronic, and may vary from one organ to another as well as with age, genetics, gender, diet, physiological condition, or the health status of the organism. Exposure of humans and other organisms to toxicants may result from many activities: intentional ingestion, occupational exposure, environmental exposure, as well as accidental and intentional (suicidal or homicidal) poisoning. The toxicity of a particular compound may vary with the portal of entry into the body, whether through the alimentary canal, the lungs, or the skin. The initial approach to a person who has been poisoned should be to assess the airway, breathing, and circulation, and to take a thorough history. Less than 1 per cent of poisonings are fatal; therefore, management in most cases is supportive unless a specific antidote is available. Treatment for poisoning depends on the type of exposure (e.g., ingestion, inhalation), the specific toxin (poisonous substance), and the severity of the person's condition. Childhood poisoning that involves a foreign object (e.g., small toy, battery) may require surgery to remove the object. This review article gives you an overall view on toxicity, its principles, management and treatment.",

The clinical features of eating disorders (EDs) in men and women have many similarities but also some interesting and important differences. Men with eating disorders face persistent stigmatization because of the stereotype that EDs are ‚Äúfemale‚Äù conditions. Most structured risk assessment tools for AN/BN likely reinforce gender stereotypes by better reflecting female symptoms. Moreover, gender similarities and differences in EDs have received scant investigation. Clearly, this form of disordered eating can put men in danger of experiencing a wide range of negative outcomes. Due to this lack of knowledge, these patients usually go undiagnosed and undertreated for ten or more years. These clinical differences are evident in the processes related to treatment initiation, retention, completion, and outcomes. Therefore, we discussed how the manifestation and progression of male eating disorders can be influenced by social context, including family and work relationships, interactions with social institutions. Treatment recommendations are discussed in the context of gender-based physiological differences, behavioral differences, comorbidities, and men-specific conditions.",

      "abstract": "While domestic violence and child abuse are known to be highly correlated, several related areas of functioning of children are not well researched on and have implications for the provision of services. A complex pattern of results documented high levels of abuse and associated trauma disorders in children. Being exposed to violence in the home during war increases risk of developing problems in mental health and psychosocial wellbeing (MHPSW), a small but robust evidence base shows that. Studies reveal that living with domestic violence can cause physical and emotional harm to children and young people in the following ways: Ongoing anxiety and depression, emotional distress, eating and sleeping disturbances. Conversely, this evidence shows that supportive parenting can be a protective factor against the demonstrated negative effects of war on children¬¥s mental health. Evidence from multiple sources increasingly shows that exposure to war alone cannot account for how children exposed to similar war events experience different mental and psychosocial states and trajectories. Other factors, including home life, provide complementary, at times even better, explanations In fact, in many cases, factors that traumatize children stem not only from war events, but also from everyday hardships. Home life can be a moderator, and potentially a mediator, of the effects of war.",

      "abstract": "Public health concern regarding depression has recently increased as a result of the rise in the rate of adolescent suicide, with a probable concomitant rise in the rate of depression in this age group. The rise appears to be both a period effect, in that increased rates are now observed across age categories, and a cohort effect, in that being born after 1960 also contributes to the increase. The clinical phenomena and epidemiology of depression in adolescence are reviewed. Diagnostic criteria for depressive mood and depressive syndrome are similar to those in adults. However, the predictive value of a depressive episode in adolescence, and whether the occurrence of depression in adolescence is a transient developmental experience or whether it predicts a particular subtype of future depression, are at present unknown. The familial, social and personal risk factors for adolescent depression are reviewed, The major factors are: parental history of affective illness, childhood experience of parental loss, and female gender. Other factors, such as birth order and sibling factors, socio-economic status, race, religion, geography, concomitant medical illness, intelligence, career aspirations, substance abuse and life events, are reviewed, although their relative contributions as risk factors are less clear-cut. It is proposed that cross-sectional, retrospective and longitudinal studies are required to clarify important areas of uncertainty.",

      "title": "Sex/Gender Differences in Addictive Disorders",
      "abstract": "Addictive disorders are characterized by a decrease in functionality, leading to significant disruptions in daily life, due to the excessive use of certain substances or behaviors that initially induce pleasure, but ultimately result in a loss of control. There are sex/gender differences in the pathophysiology, clinical symptoms, and treatment of addictive disorders, since these disorders are caused by an interplay of biological and socio-environmental factors. It is crucial to take these differences into account in both research and clinical practice. From a neurobiological perspective, women may exhibit a faster progression toward addictive disorders, due to their reward circuit's heightened sensitivity when exposed to addictive substances. Additionally, they may be more prone to relapse because of their increased sensitivity to stress and withdrawal symptoms. The prevalence of alcohol and drug use disorders is higher in men, but in Korea that belongs to Asia, alcohol use disorder is now more common among women in their 30s than among men of the same age group, reflecting an increase in prevalence among women over the last 10 years. Gaming disorders are more prevalent among men, while social media overuse is higher among women, who have a stronger emotional and interpersonal orientation than men. In treating addictive disorders, it is necessary to implement specialized programs for women. However, these programs should not perpetuate bias, while given the rising number of women with addictive disorders, we need strategies to improve their access to these programs.",

      "title": "TRANSFORMASI SOSIAL DAN PERILAKU REPRODUKSI REMAJA",
      "abstract": "Perkembangan perilaku reproduksi atau perilaku seks remaja dalam suatu masyarakat ditentukan oleh berbagai faktor sosial. Masuknya kebudayaan yang merubah tata nilai, antara lain disebabkan oleh komunikasi global dan perubahan/inovasi teknologi. Sebaliknya faktor kreativitas internal yang berbentuk perubahan intelektual merupakan faktor penting dalam menentukan perkembangan perilaku reproduksi. Setiap bentuk perilaku memiliki makna tertentu yang ditujukan untuk kebutuhan tertentu. Remaja dapat memiliki variasi perilaku yang ditujukan untuk tujuan hidup yang beragam.Perilaku reproduksi terwujud dalam hubungan sosial antara pria dan wanita. Hubungan antara pria dan wanita tersebut dalam waktu yang lama menyebabkan munculnya norma-norma dan nilai-nilai yang akan menentukan bagaimana perilaku reproduksi disosialisasikan. Berbagai bentuk perilaku yang diwujudkan lazimnya sejalan dengan norma-norma yang berlaku. Ada perilaku yang diharapkan dan sebaliknya ada perilaku yang tidak diharapkan dalam hubungan sosial masyarakat; begitu pula hubungan antara pria dan wanita dalam perilaku reproduksi. Perilaku reproduksi dalam hal ini adalah mengacu kepada perilaku seks pranikah di kalangan remaja. Perilaku seks remaja dipengaruhi oleh berbagai faktor.Secara garis besar faktor-faktor yang berpengaruh terhadap perilaku reproduksi remaja terdiri dari faktor di luar individu dan faktor di dalam individu. Faktor di luar individu adalah faktor lingkungan di mana remaja tersebut berada; baik itu di lingkungan keluarga, kelompok sebaya ( peer group ), banjar dan desa. Sedang faktor di dalam individu yang cukup menonjol adalah sikap permisif dari individu yang bersangkutan. Sementara sikap permisif ini sangat dipengaruhi oleh lingkungan. Dalam suatu kelompok yang tidak permisif terhadap perilaku reproduksi sebelum menikah akan menekan anggotanya yang bersifat permisif. Dengan demikian kontrol sosial akan mempengaruhi sikap pemisif terhadap kelompok tersebut.",

In addition, a possible mechanism that may underlie a birth order/sexual orientation relationship‚Äîsibling sexual activity/influence‚Äîwas examined in these data. As in previous studies, men with same‚Äêsex attraction were born later relative to men with opposite‚Äêsex attraction, and there was no birth effect in women. In addition, no evidence was found that sibling sexual activity/influence (e.g., mutual sexual play/activity among brothers) underlies the birth order effect in men. These results suggest that existing birth order/sexual orientation findings are reliable, despite recent sampling problems in other research areas on sexual orientation development, and that future research needs to concentrate on other theories of the birth order effect, particularly on gender‚Äêspecific (i.e., male only) developmental mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Social anxiety refers to an excessive fear of a person that he or she will be embarrassed and/or that will be scrutinized and rejected by other people, and according to the diagnostic criteria, this is one of the basic characteristics of socially anxious people. There is a strong desire for presenting a desirable image of themselves to other people, accompanied by considerable uncertainty that it can be done. Harmonious and deep relationships with family members, friends and romantic partners are very important for every person, but for socially anxious people they are a source of stress. A number of studies have shown that social anxiety disrupts interpersonal relationships. On the one hand, socially anxious, like most people, want social acceptance and intimacy and they have a desire to achieve satisfying relationships with other people. But, on the other hand, their beliefs and strategies prevent them from participating in social encounters and the disaffiliation makes them lonely and depressed. Their inhibitory and avoiding behaviors have negative consequences for developing and maintaining close relationships. Socially anxious people have strong conflict between need for affiliation and need for avoidance other people. Studies have also shown that although socially anxious people are characterized by an avoidant style of interaction there is evidence that they also develop a dependent interpersonal style.",

      "abstract": "The aim of the study was to elucidate ambivalence in relation to legal abortion by studying emotions, attitudes, motives for abortion and ethical reasoning in a-strategic sample of women and men who, 1 year after abortion, expressed both positive and painful feelings in relation to the abortion. The study shows that social perspectives legitimate the decision to have an abortion whilst ethical perspectives complicate the decision. Nearly all women and men described having the abortion as an expression of responsibility. Almost one-half also had parallel feelings of guilt, as they regarded the abortion as a violation of their ethical values. The majority of the sample expressed relief while simultaneously experiencing the termination of the pregnancy as a loss coupled with feelings of grief/emptiness, in spite of the ambivalence, only one woman regretted the abortion. For the vast majority, the impact of the abortion had led to increased maturity and deepened self-knowledge. Thus, ambivalence might be regarded not only as problematic but also as indicating openness to the complexity of the abortion issue. Since incompatible values clash in connection with abortion, experiences of ambivalence become both logical and understandable.",

      "title": "STABILITY IN MATCHING PROBLEMS WITH WEIGHTED PREFERENCES",
      "abstract": "The stable marriage problem is a well-known problem of matching men to women so that no man and woman, who are not married to each other, both prefer each other. Such a problem has a wide variety of practical applications, ranging from matching resident doctors to hospitals, to matching students to schools or more generally to any two-sided market. In the classical stable marriage problem, both men and women express a strict preference order over the members of the other sex, in a qualitative way. Here we consider stable marriage problems with weighted preferences: each man (resp., woman) provides a score for each woman (resp., man). Such problems are more expressive than the classical stable marriage problems. Moreover, in some real-life situations it is more natural to express scores (to model, for example, profits or costs) rather than a qualitative preference ordering. In this context, we define new notions of stability and optimality, and we provide algorithms to find marriages which are stable and/or optimal according to these notions. While expressivity greatly increases by adopting weighted preferences, we show that in most cases the desired solutions can be found by adapting existing algorithms for the classical stable marriage problem.",

      "abstract": "The concept of reproductive health refers to phenomena related to biological reproduction and includes not only health problems related to reproduction itself, but those related to the exercise of sexuality and the prevention of undesired pregnancy. Reproductive health problems of the Mexican population include maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, adolescent pregnancy, abortion, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases, and the negative consequences of some reproductive technologies. Most research in the area has been conducted from a biomedical or epidemiologic perspective, although there has been significant demographic research on fertility and family planning. Qualitative studies of the subjective processes and interpersonal relations including sexuality that underlie many reproductive health problems are increasing. But systematic studies of reproductive health issues from the social science perspective are lacking, and researchers in the field are few. Various social and cultural processes influencing reproductive health have been identified, but their mechanics are poorly understood. Important influences of this type include conditions of social inequality, differential access to health and family planning services, gender relations including domestic and sexual violence, and the design of population and health policies and functioning of the corresponding services. Laws and their application, development strategies, and changes in social spending and labor markets also have effects on reproductive health. Social scientists must become more involved in revealing the links between these phenomena and reproductive health, in order that reproductive health problems may be more effectively controlled.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The affiliative interaction patterns of the immature members of a group of rhesus monkeys at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center reflected a strong bias toward matrilineal kin, although this effect was modified by age and sex variables. Association with kin decreased with age, particularly for males. Juvenile males showed less of a kin bias in their behavior than did juvenile females, especially for grooming. Juvenile males also exhibited a preference for interaction with other males. The diminished association with kin and the same‚Äêsex bias may be reinforced in adolescence as adult males begin to aggressively target adolescent males involved in agonistic encounters with females or immatures. Adolescent males did not decrease their levels of social interaction relative to those of adolescent females; however, these males preferentially associated with other males (predominantly their own age‚Äêsex class) and specifically avoided females and younger animals, both kin and nonkin. Avoidance may diminish conflicts with females or immatures which could result from association, thereby decreasing the potential for selective aggressive interference by adult males. Juvenile and adolescent females maintained strong ties with their kin and preferentially associated with other females and immatures. The breadth of interaction of females with other females may facilitate the establishment of dominance relationships as females mature. Familiarity and predictability may also decrease the necessity of more severe agonistic interaction.",

India is a home to almost 19% of world‚Äôs children. More than one third of the country population around 440 million is below 18 years However in India, which has the largest number of child population in the world, nearly 40% of the its population 69% of Indian children are victims of child abuse .According to WHO: ‚Äò‚ÄôChild abuse or maltreatment Constitutes all forms of physical and/or emo- tional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent Treatment or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual or potential harm to the child‚Äôs health . Child abuse includes, physical violence 75%, sex- ual molestation 20%, mental and emotional 5%, maltreatment with negligence, deprivation and lack of opportunity . A recently conducted survey revealed shocking facts pertaining to child abuse in India. More than 53% su ered with sexual abuse, while 54% with physical and 48% with emotional abuse at the hands of par- ents and family members. Sexual abuse is one of the most devastat- ing type of child maltreatment and estimates that it has increased significantly during past decade. According to a 2007 survey sponsored by the Ministry of Women and Child Development over 53% of the children have been sexually abused . Children between 5 and 12 years old are the most vulnerable age group and boys out number girls with 52.94% reporting abuse. In February 2011, the times of India re- ported that every 2.5 hours a child below 16 years of age and every 13 hours a child below 10 years of age is raped in India making it the country with the highest number of child sexual abuse of any country. The global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 19.7% for females and 7.9% for males according to a 2009 study pub- lished in Clinical Psychology .According to the study done by Chithra M (2011), regarding mothers knowledge regarding child abuse re- vealed that majority of mothers (82%) have inadequate knowledge child abuse. The mother is the primary care giver for the child hence has a major role to play in this arena. This prompted the researcher to undertake this study focusing on mothers. Language: en",

      "title": "De lustbalans van liefde en seks. Ontwikkelingen sinds de seksuele revolutie.",
      "abstract": "The Lust Balance of Sex and Love: Developments since the Sexual Revolution.\nWhile the desires for lasting intimacy and for sex are related, a tension grows between them as time passes. In this century, the processes of emancipation and informalization have been accompanied by a sexualization of love and an erotization of sex, but since the sexual revolution, the traditional balance of a male lust-dominated sexuality and complementary female love-dominated sexuality has been under attack. Many people have sought a new equilibrium between desexualized love and depersonalized sexual contact, wishing to find different answers to the question of what kinds of relationships and eroticism are allowable and desirable. Difficulties accompanying the relational and psychological processes in the dominant perceptions of both genders (with emphasis on women) are identified in terms of what makes up a more satisfying lust balance. A literature review of Dutch empirical studies shows that women's liberation has intensified both erotic and sexual awareness, as well as desire for both intimacy and sex. Thus, ambivalent emotions have increased, with the lust balance increasingly experienced as a tension balance. 89 References. Adapted from the source document.",

      "abstract": "Worldwide studies on psychological results of both male and female sterilization are reviewed. Although acceptance is increasing in both sexes, female sterilization is more common. Of the sterilized women, 90% report better health and marital or socioeconomic adjustment. The type and time of operation affects the final attitude. Hysterectomy, not so traumatic as believed except in insecure women, prevents future pathology or dissatisfaction with minor discomfort such as menstruation. Unsatisfied maternal feelings or changed family circumstances can be tolerated with adjustment unless the woman is unstable. Nearly all vasectomized men report some or better health and sexual satisfaction. Some studies find increased \"masculine role behavior\" in compensation for infertility; others note stigma of deviancy in some societies. Other factors that affect acceptance are coersion, motivation, social class, adequate briefing, and sympathetic handling by significant persons during decision.",

      "abstract": "This article is about semantic features of gender lexical units in modern linguistics. In everyday speech, the word ‚Äúgender‚Äù is associated with the biological and social differences between women and men. In addition, people might know that languages can have masculine and feminine words. It may seem that grammatical gender is a reflection of natural gender in grammar. We know that in everyday language, gender is not talked about, not even mentioned. In other words, it is not the type of information that is predicated of a referent. It is not often uttered such statements as: ‚Äòshe‚Äôs a woman‚Äô or ‚Äòmy computer is a thing‚Äô. These sentences are perfectly grammatical of course, and they make sense, but they are not uttered. Or if they are gender nous such as ‚Äòwoman‚Äô or ‚Äòman‚Äô are not used to convey information about gender but some implicature, often close to stereotype: ‚ÄòShe spends a fortune on perfume. ‚Äì Well, what do you expect, she‚Äôs a woman‚Äô. In texts we find such utterances as ‚ÄòShe was an extraordinary woman‚Äô (where the noun is preceded by an adjective) but not ‚ÄôShe was a woman‚Äô. In the first of these two clauses the noun ‚Äòwoman‚Äô is only there to support the extra specification of the adjective (‚Äòextraordinary‚Äô).",

Con la aparicion de diferentes tratamientos destinados a la curacion de las alteraciones sexuales y su difusion por los medios de comunicacion, se han hecho mas frecuentes las consultas de los pacientes en torno a este tema. Por otra parte, hemos asistido a una prolongacion considerable de nuestras expectativas de vida lo que conlleva una actividad sexual mas prolongada. Estos sujetos que ven alargada su vida tambien enfrentan una mayor frecuencia de enfermedades cronicas, muchas de las cuales limitan el ejercicio ed la actividad sexual, o bien se ve tan solo limitada por los tratamientos medicos o quirurgicos a que se ven sometidos. Objetivo: Es por lo anterior que se hace necesario tomar conocimiento de estas patologias que comenzaran a presentarse en nuestros pacientes.

      "title": "The brain at play: neural substrates of social play behaviour in adolescent rats",
      "abstract": "The period between weaning and sexual maturity (i.e. childhood and adolescence in humans, roughly equivalent to the juvenile and adolescent stages in rodents) has received widespread attention because of its importance for behavioural development, and conversely, because of the emergence of certain psychiatric disorders during this period. During adolescence, substantial changes occur in brain and behaviour. In particular, there are profound changes in social behaviour, including increased complexity of the social repertoire and a remarkable increase in peer-peer interactions. For a large part, these peer-peer interactions take the form of social play behaviour. Social play behaviour is one of the earliest forms of non-mother directed social behaviour in mammals, although it can also be observed in other species, e.g. reptiles, invertebrates, and avian species. Social play behaviour during adolescence is thought to be important for proper social and cognitive development. Indeed, abnormalities in play behaviour have been observed in childhood psychiatric disorders such as autism and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. In addition, childhood social trauma may have long-lasting repercussions, that last well into adulthood. Therefore, in view of its importance for behavioural development, and its relevance for child and adolescent psychiatry, it is essential to identify the neural substrates underlying social play behaviour, which was the aim of this thesis. Several neuronal networks and neurotransmitters systems were investigated. This thesis indicates that the neuronal networks and neurotransmitters involved include those important for cognition, emotion, and motivation. Together with previous studies, the results from this thesis serve as to further delineate a potential ‚Äòplay‚Äô network in the rat brain. This ‚Äòplay‚Äô network plausibly consists of several cortical and subcortical systems that work together to establish the appropriate behavioural components of social play behaviour. Key regions in this network are the prefrontal cortex, striatum, thalamus, habenula, VTA, and amygdala, as well as the monoamine neurotransmitter systems. As a result, this ‚Äòplay‚Äô network establishes the proper behavioural acts in response to social and environmental cues to ensure that the appropriate behaviour is expressed considering the temporal and contextual setting, i.e. proper expression of social play behaviour. Therefore, the studies described in this thesis provide new clues considering the neural underpinnings of social play behaviour.",

      "title": "Effects of social conditions during adolescence on courtship and aggressive behavior are not abolished by adult social experience",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Social experience during adolescence has long‚Äêlasting consequences for adult social behavior in many species. In zebra finches, individuals reared in pairs during adolescence start to court females faster, sing more courtship motifs to females and are more aggressive compared with group‚Äêreared males. We investigated whether such differences are stable during adulthood or can be abolished by novel social experience after adolescence by giving all birds extensive experience with group life during adulthood. Courtship and aggressiveness increased in all males, but pair‚Äêreared males still had a higher motif rate and were more aggressive than group‚Äêreared males. Males no longer differed in courtship latency. In addition to the stable treatment differences, individual differences in behavior remained stable over time. Our results show that differences in behavior acquired during adolescence are preserved into adulthood, although adults still change their social behavior. Adolescence can thus be seen as a sensitive period during which social conditions have a lasting effect on adult behavior. ¬© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc . Dev Psychobiol 57: 73‚Äì82, 2015.",

      "abstract": "It is known that, over time and for various reasons, part of a community chooses, expresses or accentuates a certain status (political, economic, religious, sexual etc.), gradually losing its general-community identity and individualizing one's own. Viewed and perceived as new socio-cultural constructions within the basic structure (community matrix), both inter-dependently and dependent on the majority, this minority acquires (or will be assigned!) new directions of evolution/involution, far away from the general pattern, in time stalking or even posturing a new identity and consciousness. Charged or fined by the majority community, sometimes tolerated, sometimes categorically rejected. There are many cases, both old and new, of such segmentations, enclavings or exclusions with an economic, cultural or racial nature, generated by the imagination and/or authoritarianism of the majority: homo sapiens will use slowly but surely and irreversibly the tyranny of the majority and progress on less advanced technological-cognitive relatives, neanderthals and denisovans (plus several other subspecies of hominids, contemporary with homo sapiens); over the time, Christians will anathematize, enclave and/or kill the Jews for improbable deeds or on the basis of arrogant ethical/moral superiorities; the ancient or feudal masters disposed of the lives and possessions of the slaves they had, as they pleased; those who did not conform to official dogmas became instantly heretics and liable to all sorts of punishments (see the actions and justifications of the Inquisition); the prejudices regarding skin color, sexual orientation, ethnic or political affiliation, sometimes aggressively (apartheid in South Africa or racial segregation in the US) have determined certain defensive behaviors of these minorities, marginalized or excluded. Examples can easily be multiplied (talking about minors, the marginalized or excluded ones culturally, economically, racially, medically etc. for almost every country), but this is not the desideratum of the present study. Functionally and adaptively, the norms of a traditional community such as the Romanian one, repeatedly violated and corroborated with the refusal of alterity, led to a cultural-negative perception and to the location outside of the limits set by the community of such socio-cultural categories. Such marginals (called gueux in France, rogue in England, abenteurer in Germany, or picaras in Spain) are often mentioned at the level of fantastic Romanian fairy tale even if the details are meteoric or extremely lapidary. As the fantastic Romanian fairy tale illustrates, it is established and legitimated first of all the ideal of purity, beauty and superiority (social, economic, moral); still there are mentions of the problematical interethnic relations, cultural conflicts, failures of social adaptation to the generally accepted system; finally, as we do not have such a study about these social categories, I find it appropriate to approach this topic. My approach will be a structural-functional one, dialectically speaking, most of the mentions about these social categories being found in the anthologies of fairy tales, juxtaposing, overlapping or complementing the three categories (marginal, minority, excluded) conceptually.",

Some cases of elder homicide result from chronic abuse and/or neglect, while others appear to be sudden, with no pertinent history. The research and literature of elder homicide are lacking, making the investigation of each case difficult; the typical victim perpetrator scenario and cause of death are not known. Components of homicide such as sexual assault and toxicology also lack study. We analyzed all elder deaths over a 20-year period. Cases included those with victims greater than or equal to 65 years of age. These deaths totaled 2137; natural = 1506, accident = 344, suicide = 139, homicide = 127, and undermined = 21. Focusing on homicides, variables analyzed were age, race, gender, cause of death, location of death, time of year, motive, perpetrator, toxicology and sexual assault component. By identifying the typical victim-perpetrator scenario and autopsy findings, these cases can be more completely investigated and possibly prevented.",

      "title": "El impacto psicol√≥gico de los sucesos vitales en personas mayores: el papel del pensamiento rumiativo, la evitaci√≥n experencial y el crecimiento personal",
      "abstract": "La investigacion sobre el efecto de los sucesos vitales en la salud mental no es nueva en psicologia, si bien el numero de estudios realizados con personas mayores no es elevado. De la misma manera, la literatura cientifica ha encontrado evidencias de que estrategias como la rumiacion o la evitacion experiencial son desadaptativas, al asociarse a consecuencias negativas para la salud mental y fisica de las personas. Por el contrario, la literatura sobre el crecimiento postraumatico sugiere que esta variable puede contribuir a facilitar la adaptacion y superacion de las consecuencias negativas de las situaciones traumaticas. A pesar de estas cuestiones, hasta donde sabemos no se ha estudiado en que medida la utilizacion de estrategias de regulacion emocional especificas para sucesos vitales concretos contribuye a explicar el malestar de las personas mayores. Especificamente, desconocemos si estas variables pueden influir en la relacion entre los eventos vitales y el malestar psicologico mediando esta relacion o si ejercen efectos directos. Por otra parte, y teniendo en cuenta que el fallecimiento de personas queridas es un acontecimiento estresante que tiene mayores probabilidades de ocurrencia en la vejez, el diseno y evaluacion de una intervencion psicologica dirigida a favorecer la utilizacion de estrategias de regulacion adaptativas para el afrontamiento de la perdida de un ser querido supone un objetivo de interes tanto clinico como social, por los beneficios que puede aportar a la poblacion mayor. El trabajo que se presenta consta de dos estudios, uno de caracter correlacional transversal, en el que participan 393 personas mayores, y otro de intervencion, en el que 8 personas mayores son distribuidas al azar a un grupo de intervencion y a un grupo control. En ambos casos se evaluan, siguiendo el modelo de estres y afrontamiento, variables relativas a caracteristicas sociodemograficas de las personas mayores, estresores (acontecimientos vitales), variables mediadoras (pensamiento rumiativo y crecimiento asociados a acontecimientos vitales, evitacion experiencial y rumiacion general, entre otras) y variables de resultado (sintomatologia depresiva y bienestar psicologico). Dependiendo del estudio, las tecnicas de analisis de datos que se utilizan son variadas, abarcando desde analisis descriptivos hasta analisis de ecuaciones estructurales, pasando por regresiones jerarquicas y analisis de conglomerados. Para los analisis de eficacia de la intervencion se utilizan criterios estadisticos tradicionales (cambio pre-post) mas indicadores de tamano del efecto y evaluacion de la implementacion de la intervencion. La tesis doctoral aporta como resultado las escalas de evaluacion del impacto psicologico de sucesos vitales pasados, que constan de 3 subescalas: ocurrencia de sucesos vitales negativos y positivos, pensamiento rumiativo sobre los eventos y crecimiento asociado a la ocurrencia de los eventos. Estas escalas presentan buenas propiedades psicometricas, evaluadas mediante indicadores de validez y fiabilidad. Los analisis posteriores confirman que la evaluacion de estas dimensiones contribuye de manera significativa a la explicacion del malestar de las personas mayores, aumentando la varianza explicada por otras dimensiones tradicionalmente consideradas en los modelos de estres. La consideracion de estas dimensiones, junto con otras variables como la evitacion experiencial, permite identificar perfiles de personas mayores en situacion de vulnerabilidad psicologica para el padecimiento de problemas psicologicos. Finalmente, el programa de intervencion descrito tiene efectos positivos y significativos sobre la disminucion de estrategias de regulacion emocional desadaptativas y el aumento de la utilizacion de estrategias de regulacion emocional adaptativas en las personas que participan en la intervencion. El programa consigue reducir significativamente los niveles de malestar de los participantes, lo que permite concluir que la intervencion basada en la Terapia de Aceptacion y Compromiso puede ser eficaz para ayudar a personas mayores que mantienen niveles significativos de malestar asociados a la perdida de un familiar en un intervalo temporal que sugiere que presentan un duelo complicado.",

In the past decade research based on a social-relational perspective has emerged. We summarize recent work from both perspectives. In addition to the effects of disease on sexual functioning of men and women over the age of 50, this review emphasizes sexual expression among older couples, newly emerging topics such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the older adult, and older lesbian and gay sexuality. Sexual functioning in both males and females continues in later life, while sexual satisfaction within their relationships is dependent upon individual responses to age-related changes. As the life course continues, some older married couples begin to desire emotional intimacy, stability, and continuity in addition to or instead of penetrative sex. This also appears to be characteristic of relationships involving two (older) women. As the world's population over 50 continues to grow there is an increasing interest in older adult's sexuality. This signals progress toward understanding healthy sexual relationships.",

      "title": "Sex determination in invertebrates",
      "abstract": "Invertebrates display a great variety of different sex-determining mechanisms. While sex determination may be quite conserved in some taxa, in others it differs between closely related species or even between different populations of the same species. Sex determination and sex allocation tend to evolve interactively through the common medium of sex ratio selection. However, sex ratio conflicts can occur due to differential selection upon genes acting in different individuals (e.g. parent versus offspring) or with different transmission patterns (e.g. nuclear versus cytoplasmic). Sex ratio selection, especially when there is conflict, is probably of key importance in generating the turnover of sex-determination systems to produce the great diversity observed. Most sex-determining mechanisms can be classified as primarily genetic (GSD) or environmental (ESD) but in some cases both influences are important. In addition, cytoplasmic sex factors may be present (Chapter 9). Selection for adaptive sex ratio patterns may sometimes achieve similar endpoints using different raw material. For example, patterns of association between offspring gender and patch quality may be achieved through zygotic ESD or via genes influencing maternal behaviour in certain GSD cases. At a different level, common GSD systems, such as male heterogamety, are known to be underpinned by different molecular mechanisms.",

      "title": "Emotional Sequelae of Abortion: Implications for Clinical Practice",
      "abstract": "Without ambivalence, psychotherapy would be unnecessary; however there is a great deal of ambivalence about abortion so it is a therapy issue. In our society abortion decision are made in an ambivalent environment. Even when a woman makes a free decision to have a legal abortion, an emotional sequelae can ensue. This article reviews literature and relates professional experience about the psychological problems and treatment of women before and after having an abortion. A feeling of relief is the typical reaction to an abortion for the woman. The issues involved in the decision process are the woman's own health and happiness as well as that of her future family. The issues include medical and interpersonal ones and often present a moral crisis. Issues such as education, occupation, and relationships must be considered. Three major types of reactions seem to follow an abortion. The 1st is a positive feeling of happiness and relief. The 2nd and 3rd are negative, one being socially based guilt and the other being individually based guilt. Identifying abortion related issues in psychotherapy is not always easy, since they are no usually directly presented to the therapist. They often manifest themselves as symptoms of other problems. Research suggests that unmarried young women without children have a harder time resolving all the issues involved in making an abortion decision. One effective method of discovering emotional problems is to determine the reasons for delaying an abortion. If a woman is having problems making the decision is must be for an important reason. Just as important is the aftermath of the abortion. Attempts should be made to discover as much information about the procedure itself, the recovery time and any repercussions of the procedure. Neither research nor clinical experience has shown that abortion related psychotherapy is different than other forms of treatment. Griefwork, educational approaches, reviews of the decision making process and even rituals of self-forgiveness are all possible effective treatments.",

      "title": "Nonconsensual Insemination: Seminally Transmitted Diseases as Intimate Partner Violence",
      "abstract": "Some men use sex to damage women. These men willfully, i.e., intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or wantonly, transmit sexually transmitted diseases (STD‚Äôs) to their partners as an act of intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is heavily correlated with patriarchal attitudes that govern both partners, and especially men. Women or gay partners who subscribe to feminine sex/gender roles may be victimized by patriarchal. (This group of women and men will be denoted as ‚ÄúWM‚Äù in this article). Society and the justice system are influenced by two false patriarchal beliefs. The first is that condom use correlates with consensual sex and feminine sexual agency. The second is that unprotected sex indicates that insemination is consensual. Even though some states have criminalized the knowing transmission of specific STD‚Äôs and some states have only criminalized the transmission of HIV, the law has failed to deter what psychologists and criminologists have observed for decades, which is that often, men willfully contaminate an intimate partner with a sexually transmitted disease (STD) as an act of intimate partner violence (IPV). Irrespective of whether WM consent to unprotected sex, men who knowingly transmit STD‚Äôs to WM through ejaculation (‚Äúseminal transmission‚Äù) should be held criminally liable unless, 1) their partners specifically consented to being inseminated, and, in addition, 2) the partners assumed the risk of transmission. It is the first prong of this test that is novel with respect to current jurisprudence and social attitudes about condom use, consent, coercion, and the cycles of intimate partner violence. Using Dr. Lenore Walker‚Äôs retelling of the Cassandra myth as an analogy, first, this paper will analyze the systemic context of coercion in which WM become inseminated. In the first section, this paper presents psychological and criminological data to explain how patriarchal perspectives influence and infect society and justice. Next, this paper analyzes current seminal transmission laws, current perspectives on those laws, and how those laws fail to punish patriarchal IPV. Finally, this paper will propose a new law that recognizes nonconsensual insemination and seminal transmission as possible acts of IPV and domestic violence (DV). The proposed law suggests a penalty that empowers the victim.",

The various sexual problems encountered at this time are not so different from those occurring earlier in life, but in the final life-stage, they arise in a context of involution. Those not involved in relationships may still have problems relating to sexuality‚Äîchanges in body image and regrets at never having reproduced are common themes. Consideration is given to the impact of a premature or surgical menopause and to whether ‚Äòstorm and stress‚Äô in the perimenopause are necessary or functional for continuing sexual health into old age. The short- and long-term effects of oestrogen withdrawal and the option for replacement therapy are discussed, particularly in relation to the demographic trend towards an increasing proportion of post-menopausal women in the UK.",

      "abstract": "Masculine men are more likely to idealise being tall, muscular, and lean. Feminine men, on the other hand, are more likely to idealise leanness. At the trait level, masculinity and femininity have been linked with an unhealthy striving for these idealised traits and body dissatisfaction. However, it is unclear how feeling masculine or feminine in the moment might be associated with body satisfaction. Is feeling masculine and/or feminine associated with a boost in body satisfaction? In the first large-scale experience sampling study of masculinity and femininity (nobservations=25,133; Nparticipants=530), we find that state masculinity and femininity, but not trait, are associated with increased body satisfaction among sexual minority men. We also find a gender congruence effect whereby the positive associations between state masculinity/femininity on body satisfaction are more pronounced when these feelings align with trait levels of masculinity/femininity. Exploratory analyses revealed a moderating effect of eating disorder history. The associations between masculinity and femininity on body satisfaction were amplified for people who had been diagnosed with an eating disorder. This study presents the first evidence that the links between masculinity and femininity and body satisfaction can be delineated based on whether they are measured as traits or states.",

      "title": "Incentives, fertility control, and research.",
      "abstract": "Psychologists have the unique expertise of accumulated knowledge concerning incentive manipulation of behavior that they can bring to the research issue of incentives and fertility control. Equal or greater resources need to be invested in other approaches to the question of how to control fertility in addition to the usual solution of family planning. Any programs seeking to control fertility without the use of coercive or repressive means must be concerned with environmental aspects that influence the number of children a family has. It becomes necessary to identify the total range of contingencies in the environment of a given population that influence family size and then alter those contingencies in order to increase birth limitation behavior and decrease average family size. The issue of public sensitivity regarding family size ethical responsibility and efficiency of programs designed to control fertility all affect any research approach to the problem of fertility control. A practical approach to a research study of fertility control is that behavior is maintained by its consequences. Incentives can be positive or aversive relative to birth limitation and birth facilitation. They are anticipated or observed consequences of a behavior that tend to either increase or decrease the frequency of occurrence of that behavior. A conceptual framework is needed to guarantee that no major incentives are disregarded in the research. Lipe and Jung have developed such a framework. It divides the types of incentives into stimulus and response incentives. The stimulus incentives include material social secondary and vicarious incentives; feedback of consequences; and aversive incentives. Response incentives can be any of the existing high probability activities of the target couples themselves. The target population would include all adults of a community who are in their fertile years with the focus on the group for whom birth limitation is most relevant. Mode of incentive delivery and timing of reinforcements along with the nondelivery of certain incentives are all part of the framework.",

Usually it is the external genitalia that are abnormal, and little or nothing is known about gonadal status, for most reported cases are in children. Moreover, the spectrum of defects in sexual development recorded herein must be considered in proper perspective because many case studies, especially those reporting partial or segmental trisomy or monosomy, are derived from patients with various translocations-the implication being that the phenotype may be variable to some extent, depending on the reciprocal chromosome(s) involved.

      "abstract": "thoroughout most of a woman's life. The restrictions range from generally held beliefs that menstrual blood is somehow dangerous through a wide vari? ety of limitations on personal behavior, requirements that men and male things be avoided, and, in some cases, physical seclusion in a hut or segregated area. In their long-term and periodic aspect they differ from initiation ceremonies that occur once in a lifetime, although there is considerable overlap in the content of the customs. Moreover, menstrual taboos are not obviously directed toward the enhancement of the individual as are most initia? tion ceremonies. In their degrading aspect they are closer to the customs of social separation and abasement imposed on ethnic groups and low-caste persons, except, of course, that the latter apply at all times. Actually, the periodicity of menstrual taboos, while helpful for a prelimi? nary operational definition, is a secondary problem. It may be that some of the restrictions apply at all times and are simply not reported. It may be also that menstruation is not the only signal for the observance of restrictions on female behavior. At any rate, there is no necessary relationship between the physical facts of menstruation and the taboo customs, as is demonstrated by the widespread nonoccurrence of the latter. Like skin color, the particular stimulus is used to hang the customs on, but another cue might conceivably just as well have been found.",

Building on the growing literature that considers the subjective experience of being physically active, we explored the meanings that older Canadian men attributed to physical activity broadly defined. Thus, we examined their experiences and perceptions of exercise, sport and/or leisure-time physical activities. Data are presented from qualitative interviews with 22 community-dwelling Canadian men aged 67‚Äì90. Our analysis resulted in three overarching categories that subsumed the men's understanding of physical activity. ‚ÄòI do it for my health‚Äô described how the men stated that their primary reason for engaging in exercise was to maintain their health and body functionality so that they could age well and continue to participate in sport and leisure. ‚ÄòIt feels good‚Äô referred to the various ways that the men derived pleasure from being active, including the physical sensations, psychological benefits and social connections they derived from their participation. ‚ÄòIt gets tougher‚Äô detailed the ways that the men were finding physical activity to be increasingly difficult as a result of the onset of health problems, declining body functionality and the social realities of ageing. We discuss our findings in light of the extant literature concerning age relations, ageism, and the third and fourth ages.",

      "abstract": "The possible association between heavy drinking and intoxication with aggression and violence has been debated for centuries. A select and concise review of some of the evidence on this topic will be presented. This seeks to draw some general conclusions from an extensive, flawed and often contradictory literature. The main focus of this review is on social and contextual factors. Experimental evidence suggests that alcohol consumption probably does increase the propensity for aggression in men, but less so for women. The effects of drinking depend upon the alcohol consumed, the drinker and the setting in which consumption occurs. Most drinking occasions do not result in aggression or violence, and drinking is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause violence. Heavy and inappropriate drinking is associated with both violent and nonviolent crimes; heavy and problem drinkers are at risk of being violent or of being the victims of violence. Experience of violence (including sexual abuse) in childhood or later in life are associated with the development of heavy or problem drinking. The risk of exposure to violence is influenced by a host of demographic, lifestyle and contextual factors. Responses to alcohol-related violence at the societal level involve a number of harm minimization strategies. At an individual level it has been shown that treatment for problem drinking can lead to reduced risk levels (for both perpetrators and victims of violence).",

      "abstract": "Despite their increasing knowledge and the availability of contraceptives and sex education programs teen-agers often do not use contraceptives. Factors affecting their nonuse of contraception include the following: 1) conscious or unconscious desires of young women to become pregnant without necessarily wanting a child; 2) the confirmation of masculinity for a young man by impregnating a woman; 3) the desire for security achieved by gaining peer support and feeling like 1 of them; 4) the feeling particularly of young women that planning for sex acknowledging its possibility and arranging for birth control makes them calculating loose and possibly immoral; 5) the impulsiveness and intensity of feelings of adolescents; 6) the widespread pressure to have sexual intercourse; 7) the myths and misconceptions about contraceptives; and 8) the difficulties in making information counseling and contraceptives easily available. If the use of a contraceptive is opposed by prevailing adolescent norms or represents a conflictual declaration of sexuality by the teen-ager the problem of contraceptive use increases. If contraceptives are offered without any examination or counseling problems also arise for the methods may be used incorrectly or may constitute an ecouragement of sexuality which the teen-ager may not be ready to handle. What the teen-ager often wants is help in sorting out feelings about a relationship or sex. Sometimes she/he may be asking for help in saying no because of ambivalence anxiety or a sense of not being ready. In relationships between young men and women it is often unclear as to who is to take responsibility for contraception. A psychiatrist can help the teen-ager develop the capacity to deal with her/his feelings and to predict behavior maximizing the possibility of planning. It is also important that the psychiatrist focus on family influences and issues without suggesting punitive or critical implications.",

      "abstract": "For African Americans, issues of discrimination, oppression, and belonging to a minority group may significantly impact their identity formation, and their cognitive and subjective beliefs regarding racial issues. Racism-related stress as it affects African American adolescents has become an area of concern for African American researchers. Racism related stress can be characterized as the negative psychological or physiological response to a perceived instance of a racism related attitude or behavior. African American adolescents, because of their race, continue to be subjected to various social stressors that lead to negative stress that depletes them of their abilities to cope in response. Without the ability to effectively cope with threatening life episodes African American adolescents experience more stressful and negative lifestyles. This study examined: (a) whether there are gender differences with regards to race related stress, (b) the association of SES and race related stress, (c) the association of the type of neighborhood one live in and race related stress, and (d) the association of which parent(s) the adolescent lives with and race related stress. Independent samples T-tests and Analysis of Variance were conducted to determine if there was a difference in gender with regard to race related stress. A significant difference was found with regards to the overall stress measure, as well as on the individual and collective subscales. Pearson-product moment correlations coefficients were conducted to determine the relations among demographic variables and race related stress. A significant positive relation was found between SES and family dynamic and race related stress. Race Related Stress vi ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS iii Abstract v Chapter I",

Adequate coexistence of hunger and satiety brings health and wellbeing and inadequacy in food intake can threaten the health and survival. Eating behavior is a complex phenomenon compounded by interplay of central nervous system, endocrine and gastrointestinal systems linked with numerous neural pathways [1]. To put anything in mouth is a discernible human behavior and governed by hunger, hormones, emotions, and desires. Numerous life events may claw the normal eating behavior leading to aberrant eating pattern, if prolonged can result in Eating Disorders (ED). Anorexia nervosa, bulimia or binge eating are common eating disorders which affects millions of people of all ages, men, women particularly teenage girls. Major causes of ED were associated with physical and emotional destructions due to psychological and socio-cultural factors. New researches are indicating its link with genetic and neurochemical pursuits. In most cases of anorexia, the victims have high self-image and want to protect oneself from body shaming. ED victims are often entrapped in fancy images of their bodies in social and media circles and are either unaware or refuse to accept their problem and its adverse consequences. ED is a manifestation of anxiety and trauma of self-image stirring to the extent of hospitalization and fatal stage.",

This essay briefly describes foundational research on the influence of dyadic structural variables, relationship dynamics, and sibling influences on adjustment; outlines cutting‚Äêedge research within the field on the contexts of family ethnicity, developmental period, and important processes and influences on relationship dynamics; and discusses key issues for future research such as expanding to under‚Äêstudied ethnic groups (e.g., Native American and Asian‚ÄêAmerican families), family structures and contexts (e.g., adoption, single‚Äêparents by choice, gay/lesbian parents), and mechanisms for relationship influence. Expanding the field to incorporate such research questions will likely require sibling researchers to examine findings from research on other important, close relationships, as well as collaboration of researchers from a variety of psychological disciplines as well as in the fields of sociology, neuroscience, genetics, anthropology, and human development and family studies.",

      "abstract": "On the basis of an ethnographic strategy and individual-scale sociology, we analyse the organizing principles of the social sexual relationships of a couple living a multiple-partner relationship ‚Äì by engaging in swing activities with other couples or finding more or less temporary ‚Äòboyfriends or girlfriends‚Äô. Multiplepartner relationships are eroticized and colonize the sexual imaginary but remain under-theorized. Our analytical interest is in change and normative processes in sexuality; in other words, in the relationship between routine and escape attempts with regard to intimate life, on the one hand, and eroticism, on the other. Stereotypically, there is a section of our lives where we may feel temporally removed from monotony, this is sex. Our erotic and intimate life becomes important when it is cultivated as a free area. But apparently transgressive practices must obey more rigid codes of conduct. The erotic scenario of a multiple-partner relationship organizes socially constructed plots for sexual behaviour and expression, turning out to be a ritualistic and controlled dimension of the everyday life of repetition.",

      "title": "Interventions for preventing abuse in the elderly",
      "abstract": "Elder abuse is a global problem with an estimated 10% of older people experiencing some form of abuse although many cases remain unreported and/or not referred to social services. As such, the true extent of elder abuse is relatively unknown, and this poses significant challenges given recent demographic changes with people living longer. Maltreatment of older people, commonly referred to as elder abuse, is multidimensional and includes psychological, physical, sexual abuse, neglect and financial exploitation. Elder abuse exists within a socio-ecological context with influences at the level of the individual, families, communities and society. The complex interplay between factors influencing elder abuse is challenging. Elder abuse may involve one or more types of abuse and may occur as a single or repeated act. A confounding problem is that those who carry out the abuse are often someone the older person knows well, such as partners, family members and friends. It may also be carried out by service providers who older people rely on in institutional and health care settings. In institutions or health care settings, elder abuse is most likely if staff lack education and training and/or there are inadequate resources to meet the care and support needs of older people. The outcomes from elder abuse are numerous and may result in poorer health, physical injuries, psychological morbidity and premature death. Due to the significant morbidity and premature mortality which may result from elder abuse, the physical, psychosocial and economic costs of elder abuse are considerable. Primary, secondly and tertiary interventions exist to address elder abuse. However, it is unclear what are the most effective interventions to prevent or reduce elder abuse across the diversity of settings. Given the wide range of possible elder abuse interventions and the lack of population knowledge about these, it is important to assess their possible benefits, effectiveness and any implications. The overall aim was to establish the effectiveness of primary, secondary and tertiary intervention programmes to prevent and/or reduce the occurrence of elder abuse in any setting (organizational, institutional and/or community settings). A further objective was to identify whether the interventions' effects were modified by types of abuse, types of participants, setting of intervention or cognitive status of older people (Baker, Francis, Hairi, Othman, & Choo, 2016). Participants in randomized controlled trials, cluster-randomized trials, and quasi-RCTs, before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series were older people (age over 60) and those who care for them. Studies eligible for inclusion included methods of preventing or reducing re-occurrence of elder abuse and required to have a minimum of 12 weeks of follow up. Elder abuse interventions were classified as any strategies intended to avoid potential abuse or its re-occurrence in home, communities and institutions. Examples of these interventions included those designed to improve the quality of care and living situations of older people and those designed to improve long-term care. Interventions included those which sought to increase detection of abuse, raised awareness of elder abuse amongst the public and professionals, provided victim support and delivered training for care providers. The researchers also sought to determine whether programmes of a greater intensity were more effective. Seven studies, four from the United States, one from Taiwan and two from the United Kingdom (all classed as high income countries) were included. A total of 1942 older participants and 740 other people (e.g., family carers and staff) were involved. Three studies focussed on education and prevention interventions for health care professionals and caregivers. One study aimed to improve the mental health of carers in order to reduce abuse in persons with dementia, and one study focussed on the detection of abuse compared with a control arm focused on preventing elder abuse. One offered a psychosocial group intervention to support victims of abuse and one examined a multi-agency/public health approach. There was some evidence of increased knowledge and improved attitudes to elder abuse; however, results were mixed, whether these strategies were successful in detecting and preventing elder abuse. Overall, there was uncertainty as to the effectiveness of these interventions in reducing the occurrence or recurrence of elder abuse due to the heterogeneity in the settings, measures and effects reported in the seven included studies. The teaching of coping skills appeared helpful to reduce anxiety and depression of family member carers, although it was unknown whether this led to less abuse. Interventions targeting re-occurrence may possibly result in a detrimental effect. Of the four interventions deemed as higher intensity, only one low quality study showed some effect. Review authors were unable to draw any firm conclusions as to the effects of elder abuse interventions on any of the main outcomes compared with control/standard care. The seven studies were of low methodological quality with only one study judged to have no domains at low risk of bias. Although raising awareness of elder abuse, it is unclear if educational interventions can aid detection and prevent elder abuse. Blending education and support for victims may improve reporting but the evidence was equivocal. The reviewers identified some potential for service planning interventions to improve awareness of the need for meticulous assessment and documentation of elder abuse. Teaching coping skills to family members of the elderly with dementia is a promising approach. Programmes need to be carefully evaluated, as there is a risk for inadvertent harm. The present evidence does not support the approach of simply doing more of a program, or more in combination. More research is required as the current evidence base offers little guidance for nurses as to the best approaches to prevent and detect elder abuse. The review identified forthcoming research, but even so, given the breadth of the definition of elder-abuse and possible strategies, the evidence remains scarce. Elder abuse is a societal problem which can take various forms, may be carried out by those whom older people are reliant on and can be invisible. The findings of this review suggest that education interventions may improve attitudes to elder abuse but there is little evidence that such interventions have a positive impact on the prevention or reduction of elder abuse. A significant challenge for nurses is that elder abuse may be carried out by people well known to the older person or colleagues. Therefore, nurses need to be alert to the possibilities of elder abuse and have a duty of care to investigate if they have concerns. Nurses in the community or institutional care provide care for older people. They are therefore well placed to be alert to the possibility of elder abuse. Building a relationship with the older person and their family alongside impeccable assessment is important. Given education and training has been shown to change attitudes such training is important and staff need to be aware of policies around elder abuse. From an organizational perspective, the knowledge that the pressures of inadequate resources also positively correlate with an increase in elder abuse should be considered in the management of organizational risk. Given that family members often struggle with caring for elderly people with dementia, teaching coping skills appears a promising approach. Each situation should be evaluated to ensure that the actions are not resulting in detrimental effects. Furthermore, this review highlights the need to consider not only the responsibilities of individuals and organizations but also that of wider society in preventing and tackling the issue of elder abuse. In the absence of robust research evidence, it is recommended that primary, secondary and tertiary interventions continue to be funded, provided and engaged with in order that they may be fully evaluated.",

      "abstract": "Since each individual female sexual dysfunction is complex, it is necessary to subtype them in addition to dividing them into life-long or acquired disorder. The complexity of women's sexual arousal necessitates appreciation of a number of different types of arousal disorders that vary not only in etiology but also in management. The coexistence of sexual arousal and sexual desire, which develops during a sexual experience, explains the frequent comorbidity of arousal and desire disorders. Subtyping of hypoactive sexual desire disorder allows analysis of lack of receptivity and of any marked loss of the traditional markers of sexual desire over and beyond a normative lessening with relationship duration. Dyspareunia and vaginismus require further analysis prior to any definitive therapy. The definition of orgasmic disorder needs to include loss of orgasmic intensity and the possibility of coincident arousal disorder.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Marriage is the only legitimate means for building a household and giving birth to offspring, in line with human nature. (Indra, 2004). The purpose of marriage by a husband and wife is to form a happy family, the presence of the baby in the family is placed at the very top level of marital duties, namely to damage the side of the family. In reality, not all couples can easily obtain offspring as expected. The situation of couples who have been married for more than six years without contraception and do not have it is called infertility. Conditions of childless marriages often result in conflicts between husband and wife. The wife / woman is more often accused of being the main cause because the process of conceiving and giving birth is attached to the nature of women. Women who are always blamed will result in psychological problems in the form of stress or depression, feelings (low self-esteem) and negative thoughts about God. The purpose of discussing this case is to find out what psychic programs the wife has yet to obtain and that efforts are being made to overcome them. To obtain the data needed in this study, researchers used a reality approach, the subject of this study was a wife who did not have offspring who were married for more than six years. The results of this discussion follow the process of counseling thoughts, feelings and behaviors to receive&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "When individuals are asked whether they will someday own their own home, enjoy a productive career, or develop a myriad of diseases, many are optimistic. Generally, they think they will experience more good than bad outcomes in life and they view themselves as more likely than similar others to experience the good things and less likely than others to experience the bad things. In the area of health behavior and communication, there are three primary types of optimism that have been defined and operationalized: (1) Dispositional optimism is the generalized positive expectancy that one will experience good outcomes. (2) Comparative optimism refers to the belief that one is either more likely than others to experience positive events or less likely than others to experience negative events. (3) Unrealistic optimism refers to an underestimation of one‚Äôs actual risk of experiencing some negative event. Although the three types of optimism may be correlated, their associations may be modest. Also, unlike dispositional optimism, which is an individual difference, comparative and unrealistic optimism are often risk perceptions about specific events and therefore can be defined as accurate or inaccurate. For this reason, the latter two types of optimism have sometimes been labeled the <italic>optimistic bias</italic>. Research on all three varieties of optimism affords opportunities to understand how optimism influences information processing in a health message or one‚Äôs behavioral intentions following the message.",

These 145 societies were in turn divided into 4 categories on the basis of their cultural complexity: not agricultural horticultural intensive agriculture and extensive agriculture. There was a statistically significant negative correlation between sexual freedom and cultural complexity for the total sample of 145 societies. Within each category however the negative correlation was smaller and not significant. Moreover high sexual freedom was associated with the following customs: 1) presence of an adolescent initiation ceremony for boys and girls in the most complex category of societies but the absence of such ceremonies for girls in the least complex (not agricultural) societies; 2) marriage outside the local community in less stratified societies with intensive agriculture; 3) matrilineal descent in horticultural societies; and 4) monogamous marriage in the simplest category of societies. These cross-cultural findings help to identify the changes that have contributed to the increase in premarital sexual freedom in industrial societies.",

There are conditions, of course, like anencephaly and dysraphism, which are commoner in females; but for the most important neurodevelopmental disorders-mental retardation, autism, hyperactivity, dyslexia, epilepsy, dysphasia, cerebral palsy, and conduct disorders-the sex differential works unequivocally to male disadvantage. This phenomenon is largely unexplained. Though the biology and psychology of sex differences has been an attractive area of recent scientific concern, the issue of selective male affliction seems to have generated neither broad interest nor systematic research. In its ubiquity and breadth, the phenomenon compels an explanation that is couched, somehow, in the biology of sex differences. According to C. Ounsted and D. C. Taylor, the increased variability expressed in males is at least in part a consequence of the function of the Y chromosome. In the neurodevelopmental disorders, sex differences cause a dissociation between the elements of frequency, or incidence, and intensity, or severity.",

This relationship is generally assumed to be a product of low financial resources or greater stress associated with low SES that promotes unhealthy diets and lifestyles. We demonstrate here that the mere subjective experience of being lower in SES relative to others is alone sufficient to causally elicit behaviors that may risk obesity (e.g., preference, selection, and intake of greater calories), independent of actual economic deprivation or stress from being subordinated. Among social species, the physiological/psychological systems regulating hunger may have been adapted to be sensitive to perceived deprivation of critical social, material, and symbolic resources that underlie social class in addition to caloric deprivation.",

      "abstract": "As romantic relationships begin and evolve, it is sometimes the case that partners are discrepant in their attraction to, love for, and commitment to each other. Data were collected from 460 undergraduates who completed a 40 item Internet survey on the various types of discrepancies and outcomes for their respective relationships. Results revealed that half of participants had been in a discrepant relationship in which they were more attracted to, in love with, and committed to their partner and half were less attracted, in love and committed than a partner in a current or past relationship. Men were significantly more likely than women to report that they had been in a discrepant relationship in which they were more in love with their partner. Being more attracted and less attracted, in love with, and committed was positively associated with infidelity. Depression was positively associated with being more or less attracted to, in love with and committed. Alcohol/drug use was positively associated with being more attracted and in love with a partner, as well as being less attracted and committed to a partner. Of discrepant relationships that ended, 45% were by the respondent, 20% mutually, and 11% by the partner. Of discrepant relationships that continued, 44% of the respondents reported that the discrepancies did not matter and that the respondents were happy despite the discrepancies.",

      "abstract": "In workplace interactions, professionals who are demographically different from the majority of others in their profession (e.g., one of a few African Americans in a predominately White group of doctors) often experience ‚Äúidentity ambiguity‚Äù‚Äîthe sense and feeling that one‚Äôs claims to a professional identity are questioned or not fully accepted in an interaction because of one‚Äôs atypical demographic background. We assert here that identity ambiguity can have meaningful psychological and behavioral effects on the demographically atypical professional. We offer a model which explores how such experiences of identity ambiguity evoke identity threats and negative emotions. In turn, we describe how these reactions can impact work role engagement and in-role and extra-role performance for demographically atypical professionals. We discuss the implications for organizations and for individuals who have trouble claiming and/or being granted an identity in work interactions.",

      "abstract": "Sexual identity fails to adhere to the dichotomous models, transcending to a more fluid quality than normative compulsory heterosexuality. The present study investigates the experience of bi-curiosity, focusing on its initiation among young women residing in urban India. Bi-curiosity, a sexual orientation questioning marked by exploratory experiences, is a possible but not a necessary precursor to bisexuality. This qualitative study explores on the psychological and social factors contributing to a bi-curious orientation. It focuses on the subjective processes of development and maintenance of sexual identity questioning. Three organizing themes emerged from the Reflective Thematic Analysis: (a.) Affective Indicators, (b.) Social Experiences, and (c.) Intimacy in friendships. While sexual identity questioning was propelled by more psychological factors, like physical attraction, fantasy, experienced jealousy toward men, and comfort with the same sex, social and environmental factors contribute significantly. Individual experiences with patriarchy, social attitudes toward same-sex relationships, and their representation on media platforms often reinforce the process. Another important contributor was women's close friendships with the same sex, which are sites for physical closeness, emotional intimacy, and personal growth, and share these characteristics with romantic relationships. These factors emerged as important reinforcers to the development and maintenance of sexual identity questioning.",

      "title": "Fear, anxiety, and mental health",
      "abstract": "The emotions of fear and anxiety that we examine in this chapter are closely linked with aggression, the subject of the previous chapter. Similar environmental conditions often produce fear, aggression, or both (Archer, 1988; Berkowitz, 1962). These emotions feature among the stereotypic traits associated with men and women, men being seen as more aggressive and women as more ‚Äòemotional‚Äô or fearful and anxious. Viewed in this way, ‚Äòemotional‚Äô excludes anger (chapter 2). Stereotypically, women who are overtly aggressive are seen as lacking femininity. Men who cry, seem afraid, or betray other negative emotions, are viewed as unmanly. Bravery, being able to endure pain and suffering without much overt distress or complaint, has traditionally been viewed as a masculine virtue. Throughout the world, manhood is regarded as something to be achieved by courageous actions ‚Äì those that disregard the possibility of danger and physical pain (Gilmore, 1990). There are strong social pressures on men not to show the negative emotions of fear and anxiety, but women are permitted to do so, and even encouraged in such expressions, which is consistent with patriarchal notions of femininity. These social prescriptions have a long developmental history ‚Äì boys are taught to avoid ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô behaviour very early in life (chapter 4).",

To explore the extent to which these findings generalize to nonmarital relationships, college students in long-distance dating relationships were followed over one semester to determine sex differences in adjustment to physical separation and breakup. Breakups increased men's distress but decreased women's. Women adjusted better than men to both physical separation and breakup. Frequency of contact prior to separation did not show a consistent pattern of effects on adjustment. Men, but not women, adjusted better to breakup if they had initiated it. The most distressed subjects were men whose partners initiated the breakup, most likely because they were less prepared for it. Many of the sex differences found here for dating relationships parallel those found in marriage.",

They may lead to an undesired and undesirable marriage. Deterioration of the self-image may initiate marital conflict and recrimination inimical to conjugal harmony.

      "title": "Lessons Learned from Child Sexual Abuse Research: Prevalence, Outcomes, and Preventive Strategies",
      "abstract": "Until recently, there was much disagreement as to what should be included in the definition of CSA [1]. In some definitions, only contact abuse was included, such as penetration, fondling, kissing, and touching [2]. Noncontact sexual abuse, such as exhibitionism and voyeurism, were not always considered abusive. Nowadays, the field is evolving towards a more inclusive understanding of CSA that is broadly defined as any sexual activity perpetrated against a minor by threat, force, intimidation, or manipulation. The array of sexual activities thus includes fondling, inviting a child to touch or be touched sexually, intercourse, rape, incest, sodomy, exhibitionism, involving a child in prostitution or pornography, or online child luring by cyberpredators [3,4]. CSA experiences vary greatly over multiple dimensions including, but not limited to: duration, frequency, intrusiveness of acts perpetrated, and relationship with perpetrator. Although sexual activity between children has long been thought to be harmless, child on child CSA experiences, such as those involving siblings, is increasingly being recognized as detrimental for the emotional well-being of children as adult on child CSA [5-7]. While adult-to-child interactions in which the purpose is sexual gratification are considered abusive, sexual behaviours between children are less clear-cut as there is no universal definition of sexual abuse that differentiates it from normal sex play and exploration [8]. Although a 2to 5-year age difference between children was first suggested as necessary to consider sexual behaviours between siblings to be incest [9], this criterion is being questioned as studies have shown this age difference to be much lower in many substantiated cases of child-to-child abuse [10]. This formulation of CSA is in keeping with the recommendations from the 1999 World Health Organization Consultation on Child AbusePrevention, where CSA is defined as any activity of a sexual nature 'between a child and an adult or another child who by age or development is in a relationship of responsibility, trust or power, the activity being intended to gratify or satisfy the needs of the other person'. That said, some definitional issues have not yet been resolved in the field. First, much disparity exists regarding age for sexual consent, or age for sexual maturity, which has an influence on the extent to which statutory sex offenses are considered CSA. Sexual activities that involve a person below a statutorily designated age fall under the large umbrella of CSA; however, the age of consent varies greatly across countries, from as young as 12 or 13 (e.g. Tonga, Spain) to 17 or 18 years of age (e.g. some states in the US, Australia). In virtually all European jurisdictions, sexual relations are legal from age 16 onwards, but some countries have set the age for sexual consent at 14 or 15 [11]. In other words, when no coercion or force is used, cases that involve sexual activities between an adult and, for example, a 14-year-old teenager, will be either perceived as a consensual sexual relationship or criminalized and defined as sexual abuse, depending on the legal statutorily designated age of the country where the event occurred. In Canada, a bill was recently adopted to change the age of consent from 14 to 16, a premiere in Canada's history, which emphasizes the impact governmental decisions can have on definitional issues of CSA in societies over time [12]. Second, although coerced sexual activities that occur in dating or romantic relationships is recognized as a form of sexual violence by the World Health Association (see for example a WHO multicountry study from Garcia-Moreno and colleagues [13]), the extent to which this form of interpersonal violence is socially recognized and acknowledged in different legislations around the world is unclear.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Throughout the reproductive years, from around age 13 to about 5o, the menstrual cycle provides continual, mainly positive, changes in the internal environment of women. This cycle of change is an integral and influential part of normal existence. Knowledge of the reproductive cycle and of its effects is essential to a full understanding of women. This paper describes each phase of the cycle in terms of broad psychological and physiological changes. Although personal and social events will clearly affect each woman's experience, it is clear that a background climate is set by the cycle which predisposes towards certain feelings and behaviour.With information and advice, not only can there be great benefit from the whole menstrual cycle, but any distress in the premenstrual days can be alleviated. More serious menstrual disorder should be appropriately investigated, preferably with continued counselling support.The counsellor must first discover whether any menstrual disorder is a central problem, or possibly an exacerbating factor. Occasionally the cycle is made a focus for problems which have a quite different basis. In all cases the counsellor can help women to turn to good account a biological cycle which is predominantly favourable.",

      "abstract": "The quotes are proved by unjust and inhumane action of killing in the name of false pride. Honour killings or crime against humanity has risen to prominence in recent years and is a global phenomenon. The punishments for cases obviously vary from society to society as per the nature and extent of the defiance and dishonour. Honour killing is the result of¬† socio-psychological milieu of cynical societies where some acts of the behavior of human beings especially of the females are recognized as making dishonour to their families and communities and the lost honour is recovered by killings them. Honour killing is the homicide of a member of a family or social group by other members due to the perception of the perpetrators that the victim has brought dishonour upon the family or community. The pseudo dishonour is generally the result of the unaccepted behaviors or the suspicion of such behaviors like desiring to terminate or prevent an arranged marriage or inter-caste marriage, inter-religion marriage, ‚Äòsagotra‚Äô marriage, desiring to marry by own choice or against the wishes of their family especially if to the member of a society deemed inappropriate, engaging in hetero-sexual acts outside marriage, adultery and engaging in homosexual acts etc. It is the menacing phenomena of repressive social practices in the name of honor triggering violent reaction from the influential members of community who are blind to individual autonomy. The ‚Äòhonour killings‚Äô or ‚Äòhonour crimes‚Äô are not peculiar to our country. It is an evil which haunts many other societies also and a global problem. Honour killings, for whatever reason needs immediate attention. Law needs to be used as a weapon to curb social evil. What is needed is a firm decision by the government for a separate law. There is paucity of research studies in this area. The networking of the police, judiciary, government, NGOs, human rights activists, sociologists, social workers, and psychologists is to be done in order to mitigate this social evil. Honour killing cannot be accepted in the name of culture or tradition. Honour killing is unjust and inhumane action. It is crime against mankind. The paper analyses the menace of honour killing, causes and legal framework.",

      "abstract": "Psychopathy has historically been conceptualized as conferring relative immunity to suicidality due to low anxiety and reduced self-conscious emotions (e.g., shame, guilt). The Interpersonal‚ÄìPsychological Theory of Suicide is a promising heuristic for clarifying complicated and potentially contradictory findings within the literature. On one hand, the development of active suicidal ideation requires a perception of oneself as a burden on others with no meaningful connections to others. The callousness, unemotional personality, and manipulative interpersonal style inherent in individuals with high core (Factor 1) psychopathic traits may render them less likely to develop suicidal desire due to an indifference to enduring and meaningful relationships and/or inability to perceive problematic interpersonal interactions. In individuals with elevated Factor 2, but normative or low Factor 1, however, the combination of normative affect and interpersonal interactions and exposure could lead to both enhanced suicidal desire and capability. Rather than thwarted belonging or perceived burdensomeness, an individual high in core psychopathic traits may realize that his chances for \"success\" in an endeavor have suddenly been drastically reduced and may seek the feeling of power associated with \"going down in a hail of glory\" or cheating law enforcement out of exacting justice.",

It refers to the maintenance of fixed beliefs and attitudes of male superiority, associated with overt or covert depreciation of women. Challenging chauvinist attitudes often results in anxiety or other symptoms. It is frequently not investigated in psychotherapy because it is ego-syntonic, parallels cultural attitudes, and because therapists often share similar bias or neurotic conflict. Chauvinism was found to represent an attempt to ward off anxiety and shame arising from one or more of four prime sources: unresolved infantile strivings and regressive wishes, hostile envy of women, oedipal anxiety, and power and dependency conflicts related to masculine self-esteem. Mothers were more important than fathers in the development of chauvinism, and resolution was sometimes associated with decompensation in wives.",

      "abstract": "For prepubertal youth, sexual stimuli elicit disgust and avoidance, yet in adolescence this avoidance shifts to sexual approach. One explanation could be that disgust declines in adolescence. This project examined whether disgust is indeed lower in adolescence compared to preadolescence, and whether this difference across age groups would be restricted to sex-relevant disgust elicitors. We also examined whether the strength of disgust would depend on familiarity between participant and source. To examine disgust responses in youths, two cross-sectional studies (N = 248, ages six to 17 years) were conducted using scenario-based measurements. Disgust was overall higher in early adolescence than in preadolescence and relatively weak when the source of disgust was a familiar person. Specifically, when parents were the source, sex-relevant disgust was higher in the groups of early and middle adolescents than in the group of preadolescents. Sex-relevant disgust elicited by a stranger or best friend, however, was lower in middle than in early adolescence. The latter is consistent with the view that repeated confrontation with disgusting stimuli might attenuate disgust, which could contribute to healthy sexual functioning. The heightened sex-relevant disgust in middle adolescents when parents were the source might reflect a functional avoidance mechanism of inappropriate sex mates.",

Se han utilizado como instrumentos de recojo de informaci√≥n fichas, y como t√©cnicas la observaci√≥n, el an√°lisis, y la s√≠ntesis, el m√©todo seleccionado fue el deductivo. Se revisaron 15 investigaciones realizadas en diversos pa√≠ses referidas a la sexualidad del adulto mayor. Resultados: Se han encontrado algunas descripciones sobre actitudes sexuales, en diversos pueblos con anterioridad al a√±o 100 Antes de Cristo, y reci√©n en el siglo XX se empieza a investigar la sexualidad desde el punto de vista cient√≠fico, con los aportes de Balzac, Jung (1969) y Sigmund Freud (1856-1939). Existen factores y mitos que afectan y est√°n relacionados con la sexualidad del adulto mayor. La existencia de un declive gradual con la edad, en la actividad e inter√©s sexual, en el caso de los varones se produce a partir de los 60 a√±os, la actividad sexual m√°s frecuente son las caricias y tocamientos, seguidas del coito, tambi√©n se observa una mayor actividad sexual en las mujeres mayores que han tenido intensa actividad sexual en la juventud. Un alto n√∫mero (74% hombres, 42% mujeres) practican la masturbaci√≥n, la relevancia del sexo decae a partir de los 56 a√±os de edad, llegando a considerarse como nada o poco importante en el 57% de las personas mayores de 65 a√±os. Conclusiones: La sexualidad incluye todas las formas de expresi√≥n, desde la aproximaci√≥n, el tacto, la intimidad emocional, la compa√±√≠a, la masturbaci√≥n y no solamente el coito. Es un aspecto importante que en la vejez debe continuar siendo una fuente de placer y no una fuente de inquietud y frustraci√≥n.",

Among 189 low-income men (44% African American, 56% Caucasian) who underwent rigorous assessments of family behavior and social context longitudinally across 20 years, those men with the low activity MAOA allele who experienced more punitive discipline at ages 1.5, 2, and 5 years showed more antisocial behavior from ages 15 through 20 years. Effects of punitive discipline on antisocial behavior differed by caregiver and age at which it occurred, suggesting sensitive periods throughout early childhood in which low MAOA activity elevated boys‚Äô vulnerability to harsh parenting and risk for antisocial behavior. This genetic vulnerability to punitive discipline‚Äîand not just extreme, maltreatment experiences‚Äîmay generalize to other male populations at risk for antisocial behavior.",

The quantitative and qualitative results of the current study, the first to investigate the perspectives of parents of early adolescent sons, provide evidence for this taboo. For example, parents rarely reported that they had communicated with sons about first ejaculation, and when they were asked if they had future plans to communicate their most frequent response was neither ‚Äúyes‚Äù (35%) nor ‚Äúno‚Äù (12%), but ‚ÄúI've never thought about it‚Äù (54%).

There are many aspects to this question over and above the legal aspects of such a person's rights, obligations, doing business, etc. What is the Halachic approach to a mentally ill person in general? Is this person subject to the code of Jewish law the same as the normal Jew? Should we make an effort to help this type of person fulfil the commandments and prevent him or her from transgressing them or perhaps since such a person is incapable of controlling his or her behaviour, there is no purpose in these efforts? Marriage and divorce are other serious issues to which the Jewish law gives special attention in this context. Marriage must be entered into by a rational and judicious person or the act will not be valid. A very serious problem arises when a husband is mentally ill and due to that halachically cannot divorce his wife and she remains an Agunah. The situation is more complicated as the definition of mentally ill encompasses a broader spectrum of cases. Which psychiatric disorders come under the definition of a mentally ill person who is unable to control his or her behaviour? Which symptoms attest the inability of a person to enter into marriage or to grant a divorce? The Talmud discusses these matters in several places and the Halacha bases its rulings on their conclusions.",

Essa discuss√£o √© decorrente de uma etnografia on-line, no contexto brasileiro, entre os anos de 2004 a 2007, considerando as novas possibilidades da internet, de trocas de experi√™ncias e encontros er√≥ticos, como √© o caso das comunidades do Orkut. Distintas modalidades de barebacking (e barebackers) parecem coexistir atualmente, demonstrando que m√∫ltiplos aspectos e situa√ß√µes est√£o implicados no sexo desprotegido. Uma dessas modalidades diz respeito √† sua forma mais extensiva e de maior contato, ou seja, √†s formas mais extremas ou transgressivas em busca de prazer. Entretanto, todos os praticantes parecem ter em comum um discurso sobre o prazer mais livre e intenso no sexo sem camisinha, ainda que, para alguns, esse prazer esteja estreitamente vinculado a uma experi√™ncia mais excessiva ou transgressiva, inclusive por desafiar o v√≠rus, a doen√ßa e os limites da pr√≥pria vida",

      "title": "Individual Differences in Sexual Psychology",
      "abstract": "Much of evolutionary psychology has focused on species-typical behavior or sex differences. However, recent attention has turned to considering the role of individual differences in shaping human behavior, in particular in the realm of sexual strategies. While some research still focused broadly on sex differences, there is a growing body of work that examines within-sex differences in sexual strategies. This work includes genetic and environmental influences on individual differences factors including flexible responses to ecological contingencies such as sex ratio and mortality rates. These within-sex individual differences can be divided into directly selected individual differences in mating strategies (genetically influenced biases toward developing longer-term or shorter-term mating relationships), indirectly selected individual differences in mating strategies (variations in mating strategy that might be influenced developmentally by individual differences in strategically relevant traits), indirectly selected individual differences in mating strategies that are influenced developmentally by external environmental contingencies (which could include environmental unpredictability or resource scarcity), and combinations of all three acting concurrently in one individual. This chapter will examine all three options and some of the evidence collected to date on their role.",

      "title": "Behavioural Changes At Adolescence in Chimpanzees",
      "abstract": "Male chimpanzees experience puberty (marked testicular growth and ejaculation) when they are about 9 years old and just over half adult weight. They reach adult weight at 14-15 years. Females start small sexual swellings at about 8 years, mate with adult males when they are about 10.5 years and have their first infants when they are about 12 years. Males reduce their constant association with their mothers when they reach puberty and associate more with adult males and cycling females. Some males form strong, long-lasting associations with particular adult males. Females remain with their mothers until first oestrus,and then associate with adult males either in their natal community or a new community during oestrus. The decline in association with the mother is more closely correlated with pubertal stage than with chronological age in both sexes. Immatures of all ages spend 3-13% of their time in social grooming, but grooming partners change during adolescence. Juveniles of both sexes groom their mothers and siblings most, but males groom individuals outside their maternal unit more than do females. Juveniles receive over 90% of their grooming from mothers and siblings. Adolescent males groom less with their mothers and more with cycling females and adult males. While early adolescent males start to be groomed by females only late adolescent males receive any grooming from adult males. Adolescent females without mothers groom little except with adult males when they are in oestrus. Social play is most frequent with individuals aged 2-9 years and individuals play most with others of their age. Time spent playing by both sexes declines markedly during adolescence. Juveniles and early adolescents of both sexes have friendly interactions with infants, but late adolescents rarely interact with infants. Males show frequent sexual behaviour with oestrous females from an early age. Males spend more time with oestrous females as they get older but frequency of copulation declines gradually through adolescence. Early adolescent males try to take females on consort, but only late adolescent males succeed. One female rejected the sexual advances of a male once he reached puberty. Rates of interference in copulations by males decline during adolescence and males become more cautious of copulating in the presence of adult males. Females show little sexual behaviour until they start getting large oestrus swellings. Males receive increased aggression from adult males during adolescence. They become tense in the presence of adult males and even late adolescents are peripheral to grooming clusters of adult males. Males start to challenge adult females in adolescence but are often attacked, and are not able to dominate them all until late adolescence. Male juveniles perform elements of charging displays without hair erection more frequently than females. The freqency of this declines in adolescence while the frequency of charging displays with hair erection by males increases in adolescence and displays become increasingly more adult-like in length and form. Males show the shoulder hunch for the first time in early adolescence. Males pant hoot more than females and rates of pant-hooting increase with age in both sexes.",

Male subjects viewed a series of word pairs in which sexuality and dominance terms were paired equally often with each other and with neutral control words. High-LSH subjects were more confident in their recognition of the sexuality-dominance pairs and estimated having seen them more frequently than low-LSH subjects.

      "title": "A Study of Anxiety Among English and American Boys",
      "abstract": "ANXIETY is frequently a basic factor in adjustment to problem situations. If the anxiety evidenced is not disproportionate to the objective situation and if adjustment can be achieved by rational behavior, the anxiety factor is termed normal, or adaptive. On the other hand, if the anxiety exhibited is disproportionate to the objective situation and adjustive behavior involves repression and the development of symptoms, the anxiety factor is thought of as abnormal, or neurotic anxiety. 1 Thus the individual's definition of the situation determines the kind of anxiety generated. It seems doubtful that this distinction between normal and abnormal anxiety should be utilized in reference to nationality groups or social classes. However, the comparative frequency of expression of generic anxiety by individuals composing a group or class can be ascertained and inferences may be drawn about existing differences in their definitions of objective situations. term anxiety as used in this study does not imply pathology (although anxiety may have been present in some individuals). Rather, it refers to an emotional expression of uncertainty, unusual concern, or apprehension. In this generic sense, it is assumed that the response worried me a lot to a check-list item indicates the presence of some degree of anxiety in the respondent. respondents were samples of English and American thirteenand fourteen-year old boys, thus permitting comparisons to be made by nationality groups as well as by social class. English sample consisted of 600 boys from selected Grammar and Secondary Modern Schools in greater London. United States sample was taken from the same age group in high schools in Seattle and Spokane, Washington, and numbered 744. In selecting the samples in both countries, an attempt was made to approximate representativeness in terms of the occupations of the boys' fathers. After study of the ecology of the cities and with a general knowledge of the socio-economic characteristics of various school populations in each city, a selection of schools was made. All thirteenand fourteen-year old boys in attendance when the questionnaire was administered constituted the samples.2 Each nationality group was divided into three social-class groups upon the basis of the prestige of the occupations of the boys' * Paper read at the annual meeting of the American Sociological Society, August, 1955.

More than 90% of adults in the United States will marry at some point, and cohabitation is increasingly common among unmarried adults. Intimate relationships are arguably the main way that we fulfill our fundamental need for connection. In the United States and many other countries, for individuals in a committed monogamous romantic relationship, the relationship itself becomes one of the key contexts for mental health. The association between relationship distress and various forms of psychopathology is as strong as many other well-known predictors of mental illness. In this article, I discuss how relationships that become unsatisfying, distressed, or conflicted are a precursor to the experience of mental illness. I also discuss how the romantic relationship may trigger a diathesis for psychopathology. That diathesis may be biological (e.g., genetic) or psychological (e.g., cognitive, emotional).",

      "abstract": "Dating violence is characterized by any form of violence or threat from one partner to the other within a romantic relationship. This type of violence can be identified in any dating relationship regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. Females are more often the targets of dating violence than males, especially in regard to severe physical and sexual violence. Dating violence includes physical, psychological, and sexual abuse. Young females may be more vulnerable to sexual violence for a number of reasons. They may avoid talking to family members in the belief that their family will not listen to their issues, or may prefer to talk to their peers, who often show sympathy but have little life experience. The situation of victims from minority cultural groups may be even worse because violence in a dating relationship may be combined with racism, sexism, and discrimination. Family members, friends, teachers, school counselors, police officers, and religious leaders can play a key role in preventing this type of violence before it occurs or in helping survivors of dating violence. Feminist scholars have played a significant role in making the academic community and the public aware of violence in romantic relationships as a result of the hierarchical form of male power and control over the lives of women. In the United States, many policy programs and projects have been successfully developed and implemented in order to prevent dating violence and support its survivors.",

      "title": "SUBJECTS OF ENVY AMONG YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN: CONTEXTS OF DEVIANT BEHAVIOR",
      "abstract": "This article explores the propensity for deviant behavior and the objects of envy among young men and women. Specifically, it examines the following aspects: Appearance: Young individuals often experience jealousy regarding each other's physical appearance, clothing, hairstyle, and more. Envy of attractive attributes may drive both genders to engage in deviant behaviors, such as resorting to drug use or alcohol abuse to achieve these attributes. Social Status: Envy can also revolve around social status, encompassing factors like popularity, academic or athletic success, and group affiliations. Envious feelings related to these aspects may lead to deviant behaviors, including the use of violence or manipulation to attain desired status. Material Goods: Material possessions can be a focal point of envy, motivating young people to engage in theft, deceit, or illicit activities to acquire them. Power and Control: Envy of power and control may serve as another motivator for deviant behavior. For instance, the desire to wield power can lead to attempts to control others or resort to violence to achieve personal objectives. Deviant behaviors often stem from envy, as individuals may seek to obtain desired objects or statuses through wrongful means. For instance, a young man envious of a successful classmate may resort to grade forgery or cheating to attain similar success. Jealousy can also trigger conflicts and violence among individuals. For example, two girls envious of each other's attractiveness or popularity may engage in efforts to undermine each other's lives or even resort to physical aggression. The primary objective of this article is to identify the principal psychological and legal characteristics of envy among male and female students within the context of deviant behavior. The article's objectives include assessing the level of envy among male and female cadets and exploring gender-specific relationships between deviant behavior and envy across various subject areas. It is essential to note that envy alone is not the sole cause of deviant behavior; rather, it is one of several factors influencing young individuals and motivating them to engage in unlawful acts. Additional factors, such as inadequate social support, low self-esteem, or negative environmental influences, also significantly contribute to the development of deviant behavior. In conclusion, this study underscores that envy is not a moral sentiment and highlights the centrality of feelings of inferiority in the experience of envy. Moreover, gender differences in envy, prevalent among youth, tend to diminish as individuals mature.",

      "abstract": "Abstract For female mammals, the rewards of aggression (such as increased rank) rarely outweigh the costs (injury or death). These costs exert a stronger effect on natural selection in females than males because offspring survival depends more strongly on maternal than paternal survival. To support the proposal that greater avoidance of aggression (and other risky activities) by women is mediated by a more reactive fear system, experimental, psychometric, hormonal, and neuroimaging studies are reviewed. Evidence suggests that monogamy, characteristic of the Homo line for over a million years, has resulted from sexual conflict (reproductive advantage accruing to women more than men) rather than sexual selection (within‚Äêsex advantage to men who remained with a single mate). However, monogamy means that women as well as men must compete for the best mates. This competition is usually expressed through intersexual strategies in which women advertise those traits favored by men or through low‚Äêrisk indirect forms of within‚Äêsex aggression (e.g., stigmatizing, ostracizing). Ecological factors including age, early menarche, operational sex ratio, extreme variance in male resources, and local cultural norms can decrease the threshold for women's use of direct physical aggression.",

Regardless of the emotional circumstances that surround the actual experience and the way in which they take place, an aggressive, even violent fantasy is very frequently associated with the 'first time'. This fantasy can complicate or hinder access to a shared sexuality with a partner. This article links such fantasies, on the one hand, to the Oedipal disappointment often experienced when a young person takes their initial step into genital sexuality, and, on the other, to the revival of an infantile sexuality endowed with a sense of separation. The exploration of the violent fantasies and death drive in therapy may facilitate the advent of a more consensual form of engagement with the other.",

      "title": "Human trafficking as a form of organized crime: Main phenomenological features",
      "abstract": "Human trafficking is a complex socio-pathological phenomenon based on (historical) institutions of slavery and exploitation, i.e. on treating a man as goods or a thing, in order to exploit his labor power, knowledge and skills, bodily and sexual integrity in order to satisfy one's own or someone else's instinct, health or emotional needs or in order to gain direct or indirect material profit for oneself or somebody else. Certain forms of slavery and exploitation of persons known from ancient times can be seen today in identical form (public selling of victims, working exploitation in agricultural and home sector, sexual exploitation, forced participation in armed conflicts) or in modified forms (working exploitation in industrial sector, illegal adoption), and there are completely new forms (trafficking in bodily organs or parts, performing medical experiments, forced pregnancy, and similar). On the other hand, manifesting forms of trafficking do not differ in practice from some other similar phenomena primarily smuggling of migrants, prostitution and work of illegal migrants in so-called black economy sector. This is why it has been pointed to the main features of this phenomenon. The conclusion is that trafficking is a multi-manifesting phenomenon, and this is why it is very difficult to come to a comprehensive, generally accepted classification of its manifesting forms. The offered classification of forms of trafficking according to the degree of social danger, geographical level of implementation, physical and biological characteristics of victims and relation of victim to his/her position, in principle, does not exclude the possibility of some other classification. The cases of trafficking in practice can almost always be identified as some of possible combination of previously mentioned forms and types. In addition to being a multi-manifesting, trafficking is also a multi-structural phenomenon. The process of its realization, in principle, consists of four stages with many sub-stages within each of them. The dominant moments in realization of trafficking are certainly recruiting of victims, their transport, exploitation and elimination. Finally, trafficking is exceptionally developed and represented activity of organized criminal groups, more and more oft en transnational in scope. Excessive demand for sexual services increased the excessive demand for the victims of trafficking, but also the division of jobs among criminal organizations, their specialization and tendency to create monopole position at human market, which is more and more characterized by marketing, work of agencies, rules of business operations and other epithets of modern economic management. There are huge possibilities of profit since the victims can be exploited in many various ways. The knowledge of the main characteristics of certain forms of trafficking is an important condition to identify these complex and dynamic phenomena in practice, then to distinguish the trafficking from other similar security problems as well as to identify active and passive subjects in trafficking.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Kama or sexuality is the root of procreation. Every married couple‚Äôs dream of getting their own progeny is initiated, mediated, and formulated through this Kama. This is possible when the anatomical structures and physiological functions of sex organs of both partners are intact. Otherwise, the whole intention becomes in vain. In nutshell, Kama affects in sexual gratification and better progeny to lead happy life, which is perturbed in the absence of the same. Kama is the third pursuit of the man (purushartha) also. The inability to procreate, i.e., infertility is such a condition, which severely affects the couple‚Äôs psychological harmony, sexual life, and social stigma and ultimately leads to separation from life partner and many a time to suicide. According to Ayurveda, Shukra should possess such a potency so as to conceive a lady. The impact of defective Shukra is infertility. Although, in Ayurveda, many effective remedies for this disease are mentioned without any known side effects, a major drawback attribute to these remedies is that they involve laborious treatment procedures such as Shodhana procedures, where the patient has to be hospitalized and they have to follow strict diet and regimen during these procedures and these procedures are more time consuming also. Materials and Methods: In the present study, the subjects were randomly selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, specifically designed, and were randomly placed into two Groups, namely Group A and Group B containing 15 subjects each. Subjects of both Groups were given internally Hareetakyadi Choorna for Mala Shodhana and till the Nirama Lakshana was obtained. Later, the subjects of Group A and Group B were given Ashwagandhadi and Shatavaryadi Choorna, respectively, for 2 months along with Ksheera as Sahapana internally. The follow-up period for both the groups was 2 months. Results: The assessment was done before the treatment, soon after the completion of the course of the treatment and after the follow-up period, and thus, the total assessment was done based on the change in improvement observed, before and after the treatment. Conclusion: On seeing the comparative efficacy of Group A and Group B, it is found that Group A is much effective on parameters such as Dourbalya, Mukhashosha, Shrama, Sadana, Pandu, Sperm Count, Liquefication time, and sluggish sperms whereas Group B is more effective on parameters such as volume, motile sperms, and non-motile/dead sperms.",

This investigation was conducted with the part of the A. Rokach‚Äôs questionnaire ‚ÄúExperiences of loneliness‚Äù which is related to the causes of loneliness. A questionnaire was administered to 484 subjects aged 16-90 years. The sample consisted of 261 woman and 223 man. The aim was to examine the structure of causes of loneliness, as well as age and gender differences. Principal factor analysis was used, and seven interpretable factors were extracted. These factors were named as: Replacement, Disrupted intimate relationships, Loss, Disrupted relationships in parent‚Äôs family, Emotional and social inadequacy, Traumatic experiences, and Disrupted relationships in own family. A series of one way analysis of variance showed that there are no age differences only in the factors named Emotional and social inadequacy and Traumatic experiences. Factors named Replacement, Disrupted intimate relationships, Emotional and social inadequacy, and Disrupted relationships in own family are more significant as causes of loneliness for women. It might be possible that the life situation of older people (widowhood, loss of well known environment) makes older people more vulnerable to loneliness, as well as that developmental changes have more significant impact on adolescents. Men attribute causes of their loneliness to uncontrollable experiences, while women attribute causes of their loneliness to their own behaviour, to their relationships and to their own characterological shortages.",

      "title": "Can Violence cause Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "The origin and course of eating disorders and nutrition have a multifactorial etiology and should therefore take into consideration: psychological factors, evolutionary, biological and socio-cultural (Juli 2012). Among the psychological factors we will focus on violence (in any form) and in particular on the consequences that they have on women, which vary in severity. Recent studies show that women get sick more than men, both from depression and eating disorders, with a ratio of 2:1; this difference begins in adolescence and continues throughout the course of life (Niolu 2010). The cause of this difference remains unclear. Many studies agree that during adolescence girls have negative feelings more frequently and for a longer duration caused by stressful life events and difficult circumstances, such as abuse or violence. This results in an increased likelihood of developing a symptom that will be connected to eating disorders and/or depression. As far as the role of food is concerned in eating disorders, it has a symbolic significance and offers emotional comfort. Eating means to incorporate and assimilate, and even in an ideal sense, the characteristics of the foods become part of the individual. Feelings that lead to binges with food are normally a result of feelings related to abuse or violence and lead to abnormal behavior which leads to binging and the final result being that the person is left feeling guilty and ashamed. Research confirms that 30% of patients who have been diagnosed with eating disorders, especially bulimia, have a history of sexual abuse during childhood. Ignoring the significance of this factor can result in the unleashing of this disease as the patient uses the disorder as his expressive theater (Mencarelli 2008). Factors that contribute to the possibility of developing an eating disorder are both the age of the patient at the time of the abuse and the duration of the abuse. The psychological effects that follow may include dissociative symptoms and symptoms of an Eating Disorder.",

The present work examined this theory of jealousy as a specific innate module in 196 adult men and women of homosexual and heterosexual orientations. As in previous work, heterosexuals' responses to a forced-choice question about hypothetical infidelity yielded a gender difference. However, no gender differences were found when participants recalled personal experiences with a mate's actual infidelity. Men and women, regardless of sexual orientation, on average focused more on a mate's emotional infidelity than on a mate's sexual infidelity. Responses to hypothetical infidelity were uncorrelated with reactions to actual infidelity. This finding casts doubt on the validity of the hypothetical measures used in previous research.",

Absolute economic deprivation is associated with high levels of psychological distress, some forms of psychoses, and interpersonal violence, although not with relatively minor forms of crime and neurosis. The mechanisms through which these disorders arise have not been isolated, however. Economic loss, particularly as a result of unemployment, is related to high rates of psychological distress and suicide but not to elevated amounts of psychoses or crime. Some research associates long-term rates of economic growth with rising levels of alcohol consumption, increased utilization of mental health facilities, and higher crime and imprisonment rates, but the reasons for these associations have not been established either. Finally, there is no reliable correlation between absolute rates of economic change and the incidence of any form of pathology. Studies suggest that the relationship between the economy and social pathology is mediated by a number of factors including the stage of the life cycle, gender, social class, levels of social support, and personality. Several promising directions for further research are indicated.",

Additionally, many doctors are uncomfortable with the patient's questions about sexuality and feel uneasy about broaching the subject themselves. In some cases, they feel that such questions are an intrusion on the patient's privacy, even though they realize that bowel and drug habits, cigarette and alcohol use and reproductive status are also private matters. In other cases, they believe that the patient's sexual concerns are not of medical significance or that their own ability to treat such concerns is limited.

      "abstract": "There has been previous research on a large number of workplace hazards. There are two types: these are generally considered as ‚Äòwhite-collar‚Äô stressors (i.e. those arising from the psychosocial environment, that is the interaction between the psychology of the individual and the social environment of work) and ‚Äòblue-collar‚Äô stressors (i.e. those due to exposure to stressors of a physical nature such as noise or fumes or potentially deleterious organisation of the hours of work such as night-, shift-work or excessively long hours). For the most part the nature and effects of such stressors have been considered in isolation. Such an approach is not likely to be representative of the real-life situation where employees are often exposed to multiple hazards (i.e. both white-collar and blue-collar stressors). For example, individuals are very unlikely to work in a noisy environment that does not also expose them to other stressors that have considerable potential to harm. There is limited information on the combined effects of these hazards on health and performance efficiency. Indeed, there has not even been any systematic reviews of the existing literature; no attempt to produce a coherent framework for studying these factors has been offered and a dearth of studies using multi-methods to investigate the topic have been undertaken. This investigation aims to redress these issues. The information currently available on combined effects will be reviewed; following this a variety of methods will be used to investigate the combined effects of occupational health hazards. Achievement of these two objectives is an essential first requirement for the advancement of this area of research.",

Using a standardized measure of immediate word recall, we assess whether people in each non-married status have worse cognitive function than their married counterparts, and the extent to which these associations vary across settings. We theorize that the practices around marriage in each setting, as well as the social stigma attached to marital dissolution, will reveal differing associations between marital status and cognition. Results suggest that, among women, being in a widowed marital status is associated with lower cognitive function in each setting except Mexico (after accounting for education and employment), while being separated/divorced or never married is associated with lower cognitive function only among women in the U.S. and Mexico. Among men, being widowed is associated with lower cognitive function relative to being married in each setting except South Africa (after accounting for education and employment), and being never married is associated with lower cognitive function in the U.S. and China (but not in South Africa or Mexico, after accounting for education and employment). Men also face relatively lower cognitive function if separated/divorced in the U.S. and South Africa. We discuss possible reasons for these associations across settings.",

      "abstract": "# S09.1 FEMALE ALCOHOLISM, CLINICAL DIFFERENCES AND DIFFERENCES IN THERAPY {#article-title-2}\n\nAlcohol abuse and alcoholism are among the major medical problems afflicting both men and women. While men display a higher prevalence for alcoholism, it is women who suffer a much greater risk for alcoholism-associated bodily damage. Although women generally consume less alcohol compared to men, females usually suffer more severe brain and other organ damage following binge or chronic alcohol abuse. Aim of this work was to search for clinical differences between male and female alcoholism. Main methods and key findings are: although many biological (i.e., genetic risk and neurological abnormalities) and psychosocial (i.e., impact of positive drinking expectancies, personality characteristics and deviance proneness) factors appear to impact men and women equally. These factors especially social and environmental, physiological, genetic and neurobiological ones have been demonstrated to contribute to the sex difference in response to alcohol intake, as well as the development of alcoholic complications. A number of neurotransmitters and growth factors may be partially involved in these differences between men and women. The mesolimbic dopamine system is implicated in the development of addictive behaviors. Differences in dopamine receptor density are found between sexes where gonadal steroid hormones may play a role. Differences in some gene polymorphisms were found in subgroups of patients due to Lesch typology (particularly MAOA) with respect to gender. Females were mainly type II and III alcoholics regarding Lesch typology of alcoholism; therefore they need different treatment.\n\n# S09.2 GENDER DIFFERENCES IN ALCOHOL-ASSOCIATED BRAIN ATROPHY {#article-title-3}\n\nBackground. Alcohol dependence is unequally distributed across gender (1/3 women versus 2/3 men), though the percentage of women with alcohol dependence seems to be growing. Little is known whether alcohol affects men and women differently.\n\nMethods. A first step to assess gender-related differences of alcohol dependence is to compare structural differences as well as neurocognitive function in alcohol-dependent women and men.\n\nResults. Though women start to develop an alcohol disorder later in life (Escribano & Parra, 2007), they move more rapidly from abuse to dependence (Walter, 2003) and suffer from the same detrimental effects of alcohol on cognitive, neurologic and internal function as men (Nixon et al., 1995).\n\nOn a structural level, several studies have reported gender differences in alcohol-related brain atrophy. Mann et al. (1992) found an enlarged size of the ventricles in alcohol-dependent women compared to alcohol dependent men. Other groups found a more pronounced loss of hippocampus volume in women (Agartz et al., 1999), or gender-associated size of the corpus callosum (Hommer et al., 1996). However, another study only found differences of brain volume when comparing alcohol dependent men to healthy controls (Pfefferbaum et al., 2001).\n\nConclusions. Future studies will have to assess whether there are functional correlates of these structural differences between men and women, using e.g. functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or connectivity analyses. One could address the question why women progress much faster from abuse to dependence, or whether there are profound gender differences in response to alcohol stimuli or suffering a relapse.\n\n# S09.3 GENDER RISK IN ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE: INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT SETS OF GENES {#article-title-4}\n\nIntroduction and Aim. Results from non-marker genetic studies, like twin studies, indicate that the genetic influence on alcohol dependence risk is different in women and men. The aim of this analysis of a large, multi-centre case-control study in alcohol-dependent individuals is to investigate several gene variants in alcohol-dependent women and men separately.\n\nPatients and Methods. more than 2000 alcohol-dependent individuals (530 females) from three addiction treatment centres and over 2000 controls (1026 females) were included. Characteristics of AD and related phenotypes were obtained using standardized structured interviews. All subjects were genotyped for several candidate gene variants, including the GABA, Glutamate, Serotonin and Dopamine system.\n\nResults. While in the total sample, ADH4, GABAergic, Dopaminergic and Serotonergic gene variants were associated with alcohol dependence; males and females had a different set of gene variants influencing alcohol-dependence.\n\nConclusions. This study confirms that different sets of genes influence alcohol dependence risk in males and females and may provide evidence for gender-specific treatment strategies.\n\n# S09.4 DIFFERENCES IN SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR AMONG MALE AND FEMALE ALCOHOLICS {#article-title-5}\n\nBackground. The lifetime risk of a suicide attempt in alcohol-dependent individuals is high, estimated for 7-15%. Similarly to general population, the risk of suicidal death has been shown to be significantly higher in males, while prevalence of suicide attempts ‚Äì in female alcoholics. However, other differences in suicidal behavior among male and female alcoholics have not been satisfactory studied. Material and methods: In two outpatient and two residential alcohol treatment programs in Warsaw, Poland, 113 patients who reported a suicide attempt during their lifetime were interviewed. The data concerning demographics, severity of suicide attempts, course of alcohol dependence and psychopathology with special interest to impulsivity was collected. The groups of male and female alcoholics were compared.\n\nResults. Among alcohol dependent patients with a history of at least one suicide attempt, men were significantly more impulsive than women in stop signal task (p = 0.02). Men appeared to have more severe course of alcohol dependence, with higher scores in Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (p < 0.00005) and Short Inventory of Problems (p = 0.036). No differences in social support (p = 0.31), general psychopathology (p = 0.43), or education (p = 0.37) were found. Those patients whose most serious attempt was during a heavy drinking episode were more likely to be males (82.3% vs 47.1%). In addition, violent suicide attempts were significantly more frequent in men than in women (p = 0.0005).\n\nConclusions. Suicide attempts in male alcoholics were more violent and more dangerous than in female alcoholics, which may be related to higher impulsivity and to intoxicating effects of alcohol.",

      "abstract": "Emotions have an influential value in life, control on emotions is essential for prosperous life. A person who fails to control their emotions faces lot of problems in day to day life. Even emotional stability results happy and adjustable life therefore emotional stability is an important aspect of human life. Emotional stability is the process in which the personality is continuously striving for greater sense of emotional health, both intra-physically and intra-personally. Emotionally stable individuals are calm and happy, they are satisfied with their life; they deal with the situation in perfect way and solve their problems easily. As population aging becomes more and more pronounced, the concern for mental health and wellbeing of older people is also increasing. With the unprecedented increase in the number of oldest adults, several studies have paid attention to centenarians and their lives exploring factors related to longevity, such as health, generic influences, general life style etc. However, till date in India, research on aging was primarily confined to socio-demographic profiles, problems of and services to the aged etc. As a result certain issues related to the problems of elderly have received in sufficient and one such area is elderly well-being, self-esteem and mental health. Even speculation about the nature of the problem has been difficult because of invisibility and sensitiveness of the problem. The elderly often experience mental health issues and mental disorders. The present study focuses on the emotional stability of the elderly people. The study is descriptive in nature. 102 elderly people were selected for the study. Purposive sampling method is used for collecting data.",

      "abstract": "Social contagion concerns, which are defined as heterosexuals‚Äô fears about being misidentified as gay/lesbian, can lead to avoidant and hostile responses toward gay men/lesbians. I argue that fear of becoming the target of sexual advances from gay men or lesbians, if misidentified, contributes to contagion concerns. I further hypothesized that the overperception of sexual interest from gay/lesbian individuals leads to heightened fears of sexual advances by same-sex gay/lesbian individuals if misidentified. Consistent with these predictions, in two studies fear of sexual advances was identified as a strong, independent predictor of social contagion concerns (Study 1a & 1b). An additional study (Study 2) showed people who are higher in trait contagion concerns thought their gay/lesbian interaction partner displayed more sexual interest in them, compared to those lower in trait contagion concerns. However, contagion concerns did not influence the interpretation of sexual interest from a heterosexual interaction partner. Additionally, when paired with a gay/lesbian partner high trait contagion participants were more concerned about being misidentified as gay/lesbian, more anxious about the upcoming interaction, and more interested in avoiding the interaction. Finally, perceptions of sexual interest and concerns about sexual advances mediated the indirect effect of the partner sexual orientation X contagion concerns interaction on concerns about being misidentified during the interaction. High contagion participants with a gay/lesbian interaction partner perceived more sexual interest from their partner, which was associated with increased fear of sexual advances from their partner, which then predicted increased concerns about being misidentified as gay/lesbian during the interaction.%%%%A Dissertation submitted to the Department of Psychology in partial fulfillment of the Doctor of Philosophy.%%%%Summer Semester 2017.%%%%July 12, 2017.%%%%Overperceptions, Prejudice/Stereotyping, Sexual Advances, Sexuality/Sexual Orientation, Social Contagion Concerns%%%%E.

      "abstract": "In a study on fertility control and small families it was found tha t data were unavailable to test the hypothesis that a feeling that children interfere with personal freedom motivates fertility control and small families. Only among couples who have remained childless does the desire to avoid restriction of personal freedom seem to have been a motivating factor. An alternative hypothesis was proven: Among couples with children a feeling of restriction develops from the difficulties and hardships experienced. Women seem to feel more restricted by children in all socioeconomic groups than do men. The feeling of restriction increases with unsuccessful fertility number of children and low socioeconomic status. Having 3 or more children correlated highly with feelings of personal restriction. It is speculated that the feeling of restriction experienced by couples of high socioeconomic status relates to different values regarding family building and not to economic difficulties. The factors that were experienced (lack of success with family planning actual number of children or the objective difficulties related to economics) were less important to the couples feelings than was the subjective interpretation of the experiences.",

The present 3.5-year longitudinal study of newlywed couples used survival analysis to investigate whether the match between participants‚Äô ideal preferences and the traits they perceive in their partner predict the likelihood of divorce. Results depended entirely on whether the match was conceptualized as a match in level (e.g., high ideal preference for a trait with the presence of the trait in the partner) or in pattern (e.g., the within-person correlation of ideals with a partner‚Äôs traits across all traits). The match between the pattern of ideals and traits negatively predicted divorce with an effect size larger than most established divorce risk factors. However, the match in level was unrelated to divorce, suggesting that perspectives emphasizing ideals for the level of traits may encounter predictive validity problems.",

      "abstract": "All over the world young people are stigmatised and discriminated against in relation to their sexual and reproductive health. Stigma discrimination and the violation of human rights are intimately connected reinforcing and legitimising each other. Their manifestations are varied occurring in families and communities in health services at places of work and in schools. Across a range of settings young people may be stigmatised and discriminated against for being sexually active before marriage or for engaging in forms of sexuality which are considered by their communities and wider society to be non-normative such as homosexual or transgendered practices. In addition in settings where premarital sexual activity among young people is stigmatised the signs of unprotected sexual activity such as unplanned pregnancy having a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or being HIV-positive may themselves be highly stigmatised. This may seriously limit access to good quality sexual and reproductive health services. This stigmatisation of young people‚Äôs sexuality and sexual behaviour has serious consequences. In particular it can lead to young people feeling that they have to conceal their sexual activity from significant adults in their lives including parents teachers and health workers. The secrecy and shame that stigma often brings can deny young people access to the resources they need in order to make and implement informed decisions about their sexuality and sexual health. Where resources are available - or inappropriately framed - they may be inadequate to address young people‚Äôs needs. (excerpt)",

      "abstract": "Long-term relationship is associated with decreasing sexual desire, frequency and satisfaction in both men and women. As well, relationship length is associated with increased risk of sexual dysfunction. The increase in sexual motivation resulting from the addition of a novel sexual partner has been the focus of a large number of animal studies including male rodents, chimpanzees and fruit flies. Experimental studies in humans showed consistently habituation of sexual arousal to erotic material. Repetitive display of a single erotic slide resulted in less subjective and physiological sexual arousal than exposure to different and novel slides. The presence of novel sexual partners in sexual fantasies, and the frequency with which extra-marital relationships occur, is also consistent with the importance of novelty in sexual desire. On the other hand, most men and women by the age of 40 will be married, in order to achieve safety, permanence, a better care for offspring and pooling resources. Such a social monogamy is generally accompanied by the expectation of sexual monogamy. Is it possible to combine a happy long-term marriage that keeps sexuality alive? The role of the dopaminergic reward system, attention, psychiatric disorders and socio-cultural factors will be discussed.",

In the first place, except for masturbation, sex necessitates collective action; and all collective action requires communication. Mutually understood signals must be conveyed, intentions expressed, and the action sustained by reciprocal encouragement. A second problem arises from the cultural conditioning of Western man. Both the appeal and the danger of ephemeral sex are increased because the partners are usually strangers to one another. In the positioning and signaling phases of the game, the players have already indicated their intentions. This stage, then, merely formalizes the agreement and sets the terms of the payoff. Another type of action that tends to swell the volume of sexual acts in a given facility is the simultaneous encounter, in which more than one sexual act is in process at the same time.",

Perceived social support has been shown to abate the negative outcomes of sexual assault among cisgender individuals, yet little is known about this association among TGD people, especially which provider of support (i.e., family, friends, or significant others) may be most beneficial. To that end, 191 TGD adults were recruited through Amazon‚Äôs Mechanical Turk to examine perceived social support as a potential moderator of the association between sexual assault victimization and post-sexual assault trauma symptomology. Results showed an interaction trending toward significance between sexual assault and support from a significant other. Decomposition of this interaction demonstrated that sexual assault was associated with post-assault trauma symptoms when support from a significant other was low (√ü = .25, p &lt; .05) but not high (√ü = .10, p = .089). The interaction between sexual assault and perceived social support was not significant for perceived support from friends ( p = .133) or family ( p = .954). Findings highlight the need for additional research on perceived social support as a potential buffering mechanism between sexual assault and post-assault symptomology in TGD people.",

      "title": "Review: Early life predisposing factors for biting in pigs",
      "abstract": "The pig industry faces many animal welfare issues. Among these, biting behaviour has a high incidence. It is indicative of an existing problem in biters and is a source of physical damage and psychological stress for the victims. We categorize this behaviour into aggressive and non-aggressive biting, the latter often being directed towards the tail. This review focusses specifically on predisposing factors in early life, comprising the prenatal and postnatal periods up to weaning, for the expression of aggressive and non-aggressive biting later in life. The influence of personality and coping style has been examined in a few studies. It varies according to these studies and, thus, further evaluation is needed. Regarding the effect of environmental factors, the number of scientific papers is low (less than five papers for most factors). No clear influence of prenatal factors has been identified to date. Aggressive biting is reduced by undernutrition, cross-fostering and socialization before weaning. Non-aggressive biting is increased by undernutrition, social stress due to competition and cross-fostering. These latter three factors are highly dependent on litter size at birth. The use of familiar odours may contribute to reducing biting when pigs are moved from one environment to another by alleviating the level of stress associated with novelty. Even though the current environment in which pigs are expressing biting behaviours is of major importance, the pre-weaning environment should be optimized to reduce the likelihood of this problem.",

Studies indicate that sibling sexual abuse is more prevalent than other types of intra-familial sexual abuse. Due to the mostly close relationship and physical proximity between siblings, sibling sexual abuse is considered an opportunistic form of abuse. Abusive siblings are often displaying problematic sexual behaviours or developmentally inappropriate behaviours that may be the result of victimisation they have encountered themselves‚Äîeither witnessed or experienced. Abused siblings often do not disclose being abused due, among other things, to fear of not being believed, fear of upsetting parents, or confusion over their role in the abuse. Current therapeutic frameworks suggest providing counselling for the whole family.",

      "abstract": "Literature devoted to understanding the experiences of individuals who do not fit the cultural mold‚Äîthose who belong to minority, stigmatized, or underrepresented groups‚Äîdemonstrates that nonnormative status goes hand in hand with a range of negative outcomes. The current research considers a heretofore unstudied correlate of nonnormative status: existential isolation (the feeling of being alone in one‚Äôs subjective experience), which differs from feelings of interpersonal isolation (feeling alone with regard to the quantity or quality of one‚Äôs relationships). Normative, or mainstream, society may not acknowledge the experiences of those holding a nonnormative status, rendering such individuals at risk of developing heightened feelings of existential isolation. Across Studies 1a and 1b, we found consistently higher trait levels of existential isolation (but not interpersonal isolation) among people with a nonnormative group status than among their normative counterparts. This effect appeared whether we looked at nonnormativeness with regard to race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, citizenship, native language, body weight, religious affiliation, or socioeconomic status. Study 2 highlights one correlate of the existential isolation that accompanies nonnormativeness: decreased certainty with respect to judgments of racism. Implications and suggestions for future research are discussed, including addressing the correlational nature of this research and testing potential mechanisms to explain the link between nonnormative status and existential isolation.",

      "abstract": "THE kind of prejudice which will concern us here is limited to the irrational, negative, or hostile attitude, more or less intensely held and/or expressed by one individual or group toward members of another group, and elicited primarily by the fact of their group membership. The understanding of prejudice has in recent years become one of the major concerns of social science. Numerous studies undertaken during the past decade have considerably increased comprehension of the phenomenon. The earlier notion that the cause of prejudice was to be sought in the nature of its object has all but disappeared. It is sometimes still encountered, but chiefly as a conciliatory gesture to stimulus-response theory (if a response exists, some stimulus must have called it forth) or, almost apologetically stated, as a variant of Merton's (33) self-fulfilling prophecy (minority groups develop certain characteristics as defenses against prejudice or because of limitations imposed upon them). Early studies of prejudice were mostly statistical or descriptive-how many people in a given group showed prejudices, in what areas, against which groups. More recent research has dealt largely with personality correlates of prejudice, its development in children, and to a lesser extent with social, cultural, and situational factors which lead to its growth or favor its expression. As one consequence of these investigations, prejudice has come to be recognized as a symptom in a total personality configuration or syndrome, appearing under given social and historical conditions, as the review by Van Til and Denemark (50) indicated.",

Social isolation and loneliness (SI&amp;L), which represent both objective and subjective experiences of social disconnection, have emerged as two key constructs that affect people's health and are particularly relevant to the physical and mental health and longevity of the elderly. The aim of this review is to assess the frequency of SI&amp;L among the elderly, factors related to SI&amp;L, as well as their impact on the quality of life and health of the elderly and the role of nurses/technicians in their healthcare. We performed a search of PubMed database using keywords \"loneliness\", \"social isolation\" and \"elderly\". The prevalence of SI&amp;L among the elderly is from 10% to 28%. Significant factors related to SI&amp;L are female gender, unmarried status, older age, poor income, lower level of education, living alone, low quality of social relationships, poor self-assessment of health and poor functional status. Increased frequencies of dementia, depression, coronary heart disease and stroke have been found among old people with SI&amp;L Health education interventions carried out by nurses/technicians should promote the social inclusion of the elderly.",

      "title": "Willingness to physically protect, independent of the ability to do so, guides social decision-making",
      "abstract": "Physical violence was a recurrent selection pressure in ancestral social environments. The psychology of partner choice may have partially been shaped by this. Here, we investigate whether people prefer partners who are willing and able to protect them from violence. In a series of 7 studies (N = 4,508), we systematically varied the willingness and ability of a date or friend to physically protect you from a violent attack, compared to scenarios in which you do not have this information. Independent of their physical strength (ability to protect), discovering that a person is willing to protect you greatly increased their attractiveness as a partner; this held for both women and men, and when evaluating both opposite- and same-sex partners of both sexes. In fact, partners who were willing to protect you were attractive even if they tried to do so but failed, and even if you were harmed because of their failure. Discovering that a partner is unwilling to protect you decreased their attractiveness. However, this effect varied with the sex of raters (greater decrease for women versus men) and targets (greater decrease for male than female targets); moreover, the decrease was greater for dates than friends. Indeed, discovering that a male date was unwilling to protect them was a deal-breaker for women. We found only weak evidence that ability to physically protect, independent of willingness, increases the attractiveness of a date or friend. We discuss the implications of this ancestrally evolved psychology for social decision-making in the modern world.",

      "abstract": "Although true promiscuity, or highly indiscriminate sexual participation, is rare in human history, plural sexuality in a somewhat casual manner has been part of the American scene since Colonial days and is still very much with us. At the present time, nonmonogamous indulgence appears to be increasing, especially on the part of educated and middle-class females; and the pronounced feelings of anxiety, guilt, and depression that once resulted from premarital and extramarital promiscuity are being considerably reduced. A recent development has been the advocacy and practice of group love as well as group sex relations by certain segments of our population. Several important factors have encouraged American sexual promiscuity during the last decade‚Äîincluding technological advances, marital disillusionment, sociopolitical alienation, increasing libertarianism, and the involvement of many individuals in intensive psychotherapy. While some authorities feel that promiscuous sex is thoroughly incompatible with mental health, others take the view that it is not. There seem to be both healthy and disturbed reasons why certain individuals freely engage in a variety of sex-love affairs. Though sexual promiscuity in America will probably not grow by leaps and bounds in the near future, there are indications that a slow advance to new levels of sane and enlightened sexual freedom is likely to occur.",

      "title": "Sexual selection: the handicap principle does work ‚Äì sometimes",
      "abstract": "Zahavi‚Äôs ‚Äòhandicap principle‚Äô proposes that females prefer males with handicaps (mating characters that reduce survival chances) because handicaps are indicators of heritable viability. It is shown here that there are conditions under which the ‚Äòhandicap principle‚Äô causes the runaway exaggeration of male handicaps and female mating preferences. The conditions required are ( a ) that the fitness effects of the handicap and ‚Äòviability‚Äô genes combine non-multiplicatively (Zahavi‚Äôs handicap), and/or ( b ) that the handicap should directly reveal the presence or absence of genes for high viability (the revealing handicap). The ‚Äòhandicap principle‚Äô by itself cannot initiate increases in female preference when the handicap is rare. It only works when a threshold value of female preference is exceeded, and Fisher‚Äôs feedback process operates. When Fisher‚Äôs feedback process occurs alone, a line of equilibria exists, where for each intensity of female preference there is a corresponding equilibrium development of the male mating character. When the ‚Äòhandicap principle‚Äô also operates, the internal line of equilibria is eliminated, and only boundary equilibria persist (i. e. fixation or loss of the handicap). All populations at what were previously internal equilibria, or in which the intensity of female preference is above threshold, increase in a runaway to fixation of the handicap; therefore, handicapping male mating characters are more likely to be exaggerated when they are also indicators of viability.",

Like homosexuality and bisexuality, asexuality is recognised as a minority sexual orientation, with approximately 1.05% of the population (70 million) believed to be asexual. Recent research suggests that asexual people experience heightened levels of anxiety and depression when compared to both their heterosexual (i.e., straight) and non-heterosexual (i.e., lesbian, gay and bisexual) peers. This may be as a result of negative attitudes held towards asexual people, and a lack of recognition of asexuality as a legitimate sexual orientation. My research comprises of the steps taken to develop a psychometric tool to identify aspects of asexual identity development and internalisation. This will provide a theoretical foundation to inform sex education as well as the application of theory and knowledge within clinical settings to better evaluate the processes contributing to such heightened levels of depression and anxiety amongst asexual individuals.",

      "title": "Sexual Feelings in the Psychotherapy Room: Comparing Their Occurrence in Patients With Unipolar Depression, Bipolar Disorder, and Neither of These",
      "abstract": "We read with interest the paper by Yaghmaei et al. [1], which highlights the significant impact of sexual challenges faced by individuals with bipolar disorder on their quality of life, as well as on their families. Their research underscores the need for early family-tailored sexual health interventions and the importance of recognizing these issues in both diagnostic and therapeutic contexts. We agree with Yaghmaei et al. and wish to extend the discussion to another crucial aspect of the lives of these patients: the psychotherapeutic context. Changes in the sexual patterns of psychiatric patients are evident not only within their families but also profoundly influence the therapeutic environment and dynamic. For example, behaviors such as innuendo, unsolicited sexual advances, changes in couture and make-up, and even sexual exhibitionism are notable, particularly during certain stages of bipolar illnesses. From its very beginning, the realm of psychotherapy is not immune to these erotic undertones. Most psychotherapists, at various points in their career, will experience romantic or sexual overtures from their patients. In certain situations, these advances can even evoke reciprocal feelings in the therapist. When not properly managed, such dynamics can jeopardize the therapeutic relationship, hinder treatment progress, and, in extreme cases, result in breaches of professional conduct. Although the literature suggests is it not the most common ethical violation providers are sanctioned for [2], sexual misconduct is a serious and recognized issue in the field. Herbert Strean's 1994 publication, \"Therapists who have sex with their patients,\" continues to be an enlightening read. Pooled data indicate that more than 4% of surveyed mental health professionals surveyed have admitted to crossing sexual boundaries with one or more of their patients [3]. Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge that the prevalence and types of ethical violations can vary significantly by region, cultural context, therapist's unresolved personal problems, and the specific group of mental health professionals studied [4]. A pressing question remains: Are erotic behaviors in therapy sessions more prevalent among patients with bipolar disorder compared to those with other diagnoses? The forthcoming, original data seek to shed some light on this pivotal issue. The data presented herein are from a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study aimed at developing and preliminarily validating a self-report inventory that assesses patients' perceptions and affective reactions to their therapists during psychotherapy sessions [5]. The sample comprised 701 adults diagnosed with psychiatric disorders, all of whom underwent individual psychotherapy and resided in the United States. Participants were recruited from March through April 2022 through two national registers for clinical research funded in part by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS): ResearchMatch and Research for Me. Most were women (80%), and the predominant age groups were 18‚Äì29 years (40%) and 30‚Äì39 years (19%). Comprehensive details on the aim, rationale, methodology of the broader study, and sample characteristics are provided elsewhere [5]. No information on the type of individual psychotherapy participants were receiving has been collected. Nonetheless, it is important to note that patients' romantic and sexual feelings toward their therapists occur across various types of psychotherapy [6]. Participants were asked to rate a series of statements describing how they felt toward their therapist during their most recent therapy session. Three statements addressed, respectively, the feelings of (a) romantic attraction to the therapist (RA), (b) sexual attraction to the therapist (SA), and (c) perceived sexual attraction from the therapist (PA). For the purpose of this report, the patients were categorized into three primary diagnostic groups: unipolar depression (54%), bipolar disorder (17%), and neither of the above (29%). Regarding comorbidity with personality disorders that may exhibit sexualized boundary testing, 21% of patients with bipolar disorder, 4% of those with depression, and 3% of individuals in the third group were diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Additionally, only one patient from the \"other\" category was diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder. As the main study did not focus on bipolar disorder, information on the specific phase of bipolar illness was not collected, representing a significant limitation of this report. It can be hypothesized, however, that bipolar patients undergoing psychotherapy would likely be in a state of remission. The prevalence rates of RA, SA, and PA were the following: 5%, 8%, and 1% for unipolar depression, 10%, 11%, and 7% for bipolar disorder, and 9%, 10%, and 6% for those without any mood disorder (see Figure 1). Univariate and multivariate regression analyzes (adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidity with personality disorders) consistently showed significantly higher odds of PA in patients with bipolar disorder (OR: 5.87; aOR: 4.80) or without any mood disorders (OR: 4.82; aOR: 4.25) compared to patients with unipolar depression. No significant differences were identified for RA and SA. Male patients had higher odds of RA (aOR: 3.90), SA (aOR: 5.90), and PA (aOR: 3.30). Considering that the research frame focused only on the very last therapy session, this suggests a relatively high prevalence of erotic feelings toward the therapist among patients in psychotherapy. However, these feelings do not appear to be more frequent in patients with bipolar disorder than in patients with a different psychiatric diagnosis. The only exception was the odds of perceiving the therapist as sexually attracted to the patient, which was significantly lower in people with unipolar depression. It is important to note that our study did not obtain data on the specific phase of bipolar illness in which patients were at the time, although it is reasonable to hypothesize that bipolar patients engaged in psychotherapy would be mostly in remission. Distinguishing between the illness phases would likely reveal significant differences in the outcomes measured. Consistent with our findings, we hypothesize that depression suppresses sexual interest, resulting in a loss of interest during the depressive phases of bipolar disorder, which is subsequently counterbalanced by increased sexual interest during hypo/mania. The higher odds found in male patients is clinically relevant when considering that recent findings indicate that dealing with a male patient increases the odds that the therapist experiences romantic attraction [2]. Furthermore, prior work found that dealing with a patient suffering from a mood disorder (83% of the sample was composed of patients with unipolar depression) increased the odds of feeling romantically attracted to them [3]. This could place the therapeutic dyad on a slippery slope toward boundary violation. The clinical importance of patient sexuality within the therapeutic setting is paramount and is overlooked at the provider's peril. Future research should not only examine the prevalence of these attitudes and behaviors and their correlations with specific mental disorders and current symptoms. It is equally vital to explore the varied clinical meanings associated with different types of mental disorders. Furthermore, there is a pressing need to explore the potential to craft disorder-specific approaches to managing sexuality within the therapeutic context. The authors have nothing to report.
