      "title": "Sexual pain disorder",
      "abstract": "Sexual pain disorder, combining the terms dyspareunia, vaginismus, genitopelvic pain, and penetration disorder, is common in women of reproductive and postmenopausal age worldwide (up to 34-45%) and is more often manifested as recurrent acute pain. A diagnosis of genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder (GPPD) is made when at least one of the following symptoms is present: persistent or recurrent difficulty with vaginal penetration; marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during vaginal intercourse and attempts of vaginal penetration; marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain in anticipation, during or as a result of vaginal penetration; marked tension of the pelvic floor muscles during attempts of vaginal penetration. Additional criteria include the presence of the listed symptoms for at least 6 months, resulting in significant sexual distress that causes serious problems in the relationship and is not related to the effects of any substance or any other medical condition. The mechanisms of sexual pain are determined by a wide range of biological, psychiatric and social factors, which explains the difficulty in diagnosing and treating it, as well as the negative impact on sexual functioning in the couple. Timely multidisciplinary care for women suffering from a sexual pain disorder can effectively alleviate the condition and ensure marital sexual harmony in the couple. The modern range of treatment options includes both conservative and surgical treatment methods, the rational choice of which can significantly improve patients’ quality of life.",

      "title": "Sexual Dysfunction in Women: A Practical Approach.",
      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction in women is a common and often distressing problem that has a negative impact on quality of life and medication compliance. The problem is often multifactorial, necessitating a multidisciplinary evaluation and treatment approach that addresses biological, psychological, sociocultural, and relational factors. Criteria for sexual interest/arousal disorder require the presence of at least three specific symptoms lasting for at least six months. Lifelong anorgasmia may suggest the patient is unfamiliar or uncomfortable with self-stimulation or sexual communication with her partner. Delayed or less intense orgasms may be a natural process of aging due to decreased genital blood flow and dulled genital sensations. Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder includes fear or anxiety, marked tightening or tensing of the abdominal and pelvic muscles, or actual pain associated with attempts toward vaginal penetration that is persistent or recurrent for at least six months. Treatment depends on the etiology. Estrogen is effective for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Testosterone, with and without concomitant use of estrogen, is associated with improvements in sexual functioning in naturally and surgically menopausal women, although data on long-term risks and benefits are lacking. Bupropion has been shown to improve the adverse sexual effects associated with antidepressant use; however, data are limited. Psychotherapy or sex therapy is useful for management of the psychological, relational, and sociocultural factors impacting a woman's sexual function. Clinicians can address many of these issues in addition to providing education and validating women's sexual health concerns.",

      "abstract": "Pelvic insufficiency during pregnancy, pelvic girdle relaxation, is defined as a condition with pain at the pubic symphysis and/or the sacroiliac joint developing in connection with pregnancy or delivery. No unambiguous criteria for the diagnosis of pelvic girdle relaxation exist but the following findings occur: Direct tenderness at the pubic symphysis and/or sacroiliac joint, waddling gait, pain on change of position, positive Trendelenburg's sign, iliac compression test, iliac gapping test and sacral pressure test. The frequency is 7.6-18.5 per 1000 deliveries. The incidence is increased in multiparae and women with occupations which strain the back. Recurrence occurs in 41-77%. The condition appears for the first time usually in the 5th-8th months of pregnancy. The majority of patients recover shortly after delivery but in some a condition of prolonged pain persists. The cause of pelvic girdle relaxation is unknown. Hormonal and biomechanical factors are considered to be of significance. No increased mobility in the pelvic joints nor general hypermobility have been demonstrated. Treatment is symptomatic and consists of information, instruction in relief and psychosocial support. Exercises and a trochanter belt may be useful. No controlled investigations of the value of treatment are available.",

      "abstract": "Climacteric is a physiological transition period in a woman’s life during which the reproductive system involutive processes against the age-related changes are dominated in the body, and characterized by reduction of menstrual and generative function due to genetically programmed cessation of ovarian function.There are 4 periods of menopause: menopausal transition period, menopause, perimenopause and menopause.This document provides an overview of existing diagnosis and treatment methods of menopausal disorders in women, proposed algorithms for diagnosis and treatment of this disease to prevent heart diseases, osteoporosis and improve the quality of ukrainian women life.No need for hormonal laboratory research to diagnosis of perimenopause and menopause for most healthy women aged over 45 with the following features: vasomotor symptoms on a background of irregular menstruation in perimenopause; absence of menstruation for the last 12 months or appearance of menopausal symptoms after hysterectomy at menopause.The most common symptoms of menopause are vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats, palpitations, labile blood pressure); psychological (emotional lability, depression, anxiety, irritability, sleep disturbances, poor memory and concentration); general physical symptoms (asthenia, headache, pain in muscles and joints, skin discomfort); urogenital and sexual (vaginal itching, burning, dryness and dyspareunia, frequent and urgent urination, decreased libido).The only pathogenetically effective method for the correction of menopausal disorders is menopausal hormone therapy. For this therapy are used natural estrogen (17β-estradiol, estradiol valerate, estriol) in combination with progestins (dydrogesterone) or androgens. It is possible parenteral (injections), transdermal, vaginal and oral hormone introduction.To correct the climacteric syndrome, urogenital disorders are used short courses of menopausal hormone therapy (for 1–5 years). For the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis menopausal hormone therapy lasts over 3 years if necessary, in combination with a bisphosphonate.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Uterine enlargement is prevalent in a woman's reproductive life. It is most commonly found as a result of leiomyomas, aside from pregnancy. Leiomyomas, often known as fibroid, are benign muscle fibres neoplasms that primarily arise from the myometrium due to their fibrous structure. They can be detected during a normal pelvic examination in asymptomatic women or they can cause symptoms. Pain, pressure sensations, dysmenorrhea, and irregular uterine bleeding are all common concerns. Although surgery for uterine fibroid management is accessible to satisfy the patient's acute needs, there are still obstacles in establishing a suitable complementary medical treatment.\r\nMain symptoms and/or important clinical findings: A 65 years Old female was admitted in AVBRH on date 11/02/2021 with abdominal discomfort, heavy menstrual blood in the last four months, pelvic tension or pain, frequent urination over the last four months, difficulty emptying the bladder, constipation, backache, or muscle pain as.  Obstetric history- Patient had bad obstetric history of two abortion. The main diagnoses, therapeutic interventions, and outcomes: After physical examination and investigation, this case was diagnosed having fibroid uterus. Patient had previous history of LSCS. Patient was treated with antihypertensive drugs. Present case was stable but ultrasonography revealed sign of stage I- fibroid growth. Nursing perspective: Fluid replacement i.e. DNS and RL, monitoring vital sign. Conclusion: Because most women with fibroids are asymptomatic, they receive less medical care, and uterine malignancies go untreated frequently.",

      "title": "Restoring Intimacy in Relationships Affected by Cancer",
      "abstract": "Existing medical treatments for men diagnosed with prostate cancer have a number of distressing side effects, which can include erectile ­dysfunction, leakage of urine with orgasm, dry ejaculation, penile shrinkage, loss of libido and responsiveness to sexual visual cues, urinary incontinence, bowel dysfunction and rectal bleeding, hot flashes, weight gain, fatigue, loss of muscle mass, pain, and physical impairment [1, 2]. Symptoms can occur immediately after treatment or may not develop until 2–5 years ­following treatment [3]. These symptoms can be troubling for men because they can compromise masculinity, self-esteem, sexual confidence, responsivity to sexual cues, sexual fantasies, sexual desire, the ability to engage in sexual activity, and subsequently increase psychological distress [2 4–7]. Sexual dysfunction can be a particularly difficult stressor. Although approximately half of men diagnosed and treated for prostate cancer use erectile aids to partially or completely restore erectile functioning [8, 9], the majority of men do not continue to use and/or are not satisfied with these aids [9–11]. Ultimately, many men never achieve the same level of or satisfaction with sexual activity as they experienced before the cancer [6], and the disruptions to sexual activity compromise men's quality of life [7, 12].",

Symptoms related to prolapse may include the sensation of a vaginal mass or bulge, pelvic pressure, low back pain, and sexual difficulty. Stress urinary incontinence commonly occurs in association with anterior vaginal prolapse. Voiding difficulty may result from advanced prolapse. Women may require vaginal pressure or manual replacement of the prolapse in order to accomplish voiding or they may relate a history of urinary incontinence that has since resolved with worsening of their prolapse. This can occur with urethral kinking and obstruction to urinary flow; women in this situation are at risk for incomplete bladder emptying, recurrent or persistent urinary tract infections and for the development of de novo stress urinary incontinence after the prolapse is repaired.",

      "title": "[Side effects and complications of intrauterine devices with special reference to pelvic infection].",
      "abstract": "Existing international literature concerning complications stemming from the use of the IUD is reviewed. They are either immediate or delayed. Immediate complications are (partial) perforation of the uterus, vagal reaction, bleeding, and pain. Perforation should be followed up by echography or radiography. Hysteroscopy or celioscopy allows for recovery of the device. Vagal reaction, manifested by bradycardia, hypotension, pallor, sudation, nausea, even cardiac arrest, occurs with stenosis of the cervical canal predominantly in emotive and/or nulliparous women. Bleeding occurs from trauma caused by the IUD to the mucus of the endocervix and/or endometrium. Pain is an almost constant symptom that appears at the moment of insertion, more frequently in young nulliparae than multiparae, and disappears spontaneously after 5-10 minutes. Delayed complications are menometrorrhagia, often accompanied by dysmenorrhea, lost IUD, total or partial expulsion, ectopic pregnancy and pelvic infections (PID). Menometrorrhagia seems imputable more to an increase of fibrinolytic activity of the endometrium in contact with the IUD than to plasmatic alterations of the progesterone, estradiol or gonadotropin. Lost IUD generally is due to rotation caused by uterine contractions, or the thread being cut off too close to the mouth of the external uterus. Fracture of the IUD as well as migration toward the fallopian tubes are very rare. The FDA reports, in 1979, that ectopic pregnancy is verified more frequently in women carrying the device medicated with progesterone. PID are 10 times more frequent in young women having used the IUD for at least 2 years. A significant increase in PID is also reported for women who use the device for more than 5 years.",

Symptoms include abdominal bloating, low back pain, and dyspareunia. CPP is considered a symptom and not a diagnosis. The etiology may involve a specific organ or condition (eg, endometriosis, adhesions). The most common associated conditions are endometriosis, interstitial cystitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and depression. The history and physical examination are essential in the evaluation. A comprehensive history that encompasses the gynecologic, obstetric, surgical, and psychosocial histories is key. The psychosocial history should include screening for depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, and physical and sexual abuse because of their association with CPP. The physical examination should include musculoskeletal, abdominal, and gynecologic examinations. The choice of laboratory tests and imaging studies should be guided by the history and physical examination findings. Management is multimodal and involves management of associated conditions, pharmacotherapy, surgeries and procedures, physical therapy, and behavior and lifestyle therapies. The multidisciplinary care team typically consists of the primary care physician, subspecialty physicians (eg, gynecology, pain management, psychiatry, gastroenterology, urology), a physical therapist, and a behavioral health subspecialist.",

They include nausea or epigastric discomfort, malaise, dizziness, nervousness, fatigue, weakness, leg cramps, headache, and depression. The estrogenic component is thought to be the cause. There may also be a psychogenic basis reflecting apprehension. Breast tenderness is an occasional complaint and intermenstrual spotting or breakthrough bleeding is often reported. Increasing dosage has reduced this symptom. Dysmenorrhea prior to treatment may be improved but occasionally it is aggravated. Drug-induced amenorrhea presents a double problem in that failure to resume medication 7 days after completion of a cycle results in a risk of conception. Episodes of severe uterine bleeding in patients discontinuing use after several months or years have been reported. Other side effects include a skin reaction resembling acne, pruritus, hirsutism, thinning of scalp hair, increased skin pigmentation, and weight gain or loss. Serious vascular complications and hepatic dysfunction have been shown and deviation of thyroid function may be shown by increase of serum protein-bound iodine (PBI). Clinical signs of hyperthyroidism have not been described. Oral contraception is associated with elevated plasma cortisol (hydrocortisone) levels and decreased urinary levels of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OCHS). Suppression of ovarian activity by oral contraceptives is rapidly reversible. Fear of carcinogenesis has caused much alarm but no proof as of the present time.

      "title": "Medice, cura te ipsum : A first‐person experience with male infertility",
      "abstract": "Male infertility is a common condition: indeed, the male partner is either the only or a contributing factor in almost 50% of cases of couple infertility. Several causes of male infertility have been described so far: hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunctions, qualitative or quantitative defects of spermatogenesis and ductal obstruction or dysfunctions all have the potential to negatively affect male reproductive health.1, 2 Even among specialists, the topic of male infertility is often inadequately addressed: in many circumstances andrologists, urologists and other specialists are not aware of the psychological consequences of such a diagnosis or simply lack the skills to provide the necessary support to patients.3 Infertility is seemingly more prevalent in physicians than in the general population, at least among females.4 This condition is also worsened by several factors, such as excessive stress, frequent night shifts and, in many cases, lacking support from peers and faculty or the need to delay pregnancy or fatherhood in order to achieve economic stability.5 My story with infertility begins a few years ago. At the time I had already been “working” as an andrologist for almost 8 years, between med school, training and residency; my wife, two years younger than me, was at the time a resident in paediatrics. I was often taking care of patients who could not achieve pregnancy, whereas my wife would work with children—hence, both of us felt some kind of “pressure”. And yet, no pregnancy came. I knew infertility guidelines and treatment by heart, and kept saying that, given our situation, we just had to keep trying: normal reproductive physiology on both sides, good sperm quality and quantity, regular periods—nothing out of the ordinary. After three years, we decided to do something and sought fertility treatment: at the last step before IVF, I got the news that I had a paracentric inversion on chromosome 15 [46,XY,inv(15)(q15q24)], most likely the reason for the inability to have a clinical pregnancy. Genetic causes are not rare, being responsible for 15% of cases, although they are most frequently associated with severe oligozoospermia or azoospermia, quite differently from the present case. Psychological distress in infertility is well-known in women, and only to a lesser extent described and investigated in men.6, 7 Patients coming to my office in the suspicion of male infertility, however, have always reported distress from their condition, with the onset of depression and anxiety, including the onset of a sense of unease when together with friends with children or pregnant, as well as a general fear of being inadequate for the partner. Infertility-related sexual dysfunctions are not uncommon, including erectile dysfunction and impaired sexual desire, and might further increase distress in the couple.7 Such psychological issues often require early psychological intervention in order to reduce the risk of progression to a clinical condition—however, even in highly specialized settings, it is not uncommon for male patients to be left without any kind of psychological support.8 What have I learnt from my first-person experience with infertility? First of all—no man is an island: having someone to talk to is the most effective strategy for coping with the initial blunt trauma of the diagnosis. When talking to an infertile patient, I now start by saying that I am on their same boat: as a result, the patient is often more open and likely to disclose his own feelings and fears, and the patient-physician relationship is improved. Second, my approach to infertile men with unexplained infertility has changed a bit: while a few months ago I would have simply thought “it's just a matter of luck, keep trying”, I am now more likely to leave no stone unturned, and I strongly suggest patients to start considering assisted reproduction techniques, adoption and psychological consultation earlier than I did before. While some conditions—including mine—could benefit from advanced techniques, such as pre-implantation genetic diagnosis or testicular sperm extraction, we should always try to improve our patients’ overall health by all possible means.",

      "abstract": "#### Summary points\n\nRecent consensus defined vaginismus as, “The persistent or recurrent difficulties of the woman to allow vaginal entry of a penis, a finger, and or any object, despite the woman’s expressed wish to do so.”1 The definition also noted that affected women often avoid intercourse; experience involuntary pelvic muscle contraction; and anticipate, fear, or experience pain. However, it can be difficult to diagnose vaginismus. Women with total vaginismus are unable to tolerate penetration of their vagina by any object, but those with partial vaginismus tolerate penetration with difficulty and pain. The condition can be lifelong (primary) or it can occur after sexual function has been normal (secondary). It can also be situational, occurring only with certain partners or in particular circumstances, or it can be global, occurring independent of partner or circumstances. It is thus a clinical syndrome, not a definitive diagnosis, that consists of overlapping elements of hypertonic pelvic floor muscles, pain, anxiety, and difficulty in penetration.\n\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fourth edition (DSM-IV) categorises vaginismus as a sexual pain disorder along with dyspareunia. It describes vaginismus as occurring when “recurrent or persistent involuntary spasm of the musculature of the outer third of the vagina” interferes with intercourse.2 According to this definition, the experience of pain is not necessary for the diagnosis. …",

      "title": "Codeine for Acute Pain Related to Caesarean Section [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Caesarean section (C-section) is a method of birth through an incision in the abdominal wall and uterine wall., C-section rates have steadily increased worldwide in the last 3 decades. In Canada, C-section birth rates increased by approximately 50.8% from 1997 to 2016. C-section births may be planned or unplanned if there are complications that arise before birth or during labour. These complications may include an adverse position of the baby close to the due date, health conditions for the pregnant patient that may be worsened due to the stress of labour, chances of vertical transmission of a pre-existing infection to the baby, labour that is slow or stops completely, or signs of distress shown by the baby during labour., Hospital recovery after a C-section birth typically lasts 2 to 5 days; however, it may take weeks to months for a full recovery.,Acute pain can be described as pain caused by something specific and does not last longer than 6 months. Acute pain in the abdominal region is common after a C-section birth, and pain medications containing codeine, alone or in combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), have been used in the past to subdue post-operative pain., Oral codeine is hepatically metabolized by the polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme to a clinically active metabolite (i.e., morphine). Because of this metabolization process, oral codeine has the potential for drug interactions and adverse effects may be unpredictable due to interindividual differences in metabolism of codeine into morphine. In Canada, codeine-containing products are authorized to relieve pain or suppress cough; however, there may be safety issues with the use of codeine in postpartum patients.– Specifically, in postpartum patients who are breastfeeding there is the potential for neonatal toxicity from prolonged codeine exposure,,, and there is the potential for central nervous system depression caused by opioid toxicity in both postpartum patients and breastfed babies. There are additional concerns with opioid use worldwide including inappropriate prescribing, opioid addiction and dependency, and opioid-related deaths, and Canada is the second-highest consumer of opioids. It is important to determine whether the clinical benefits of opioid use in patients who have undergone C-section outweigh the potential risks.Four other CADTH reports have reviewed the clinical effectiveness of codeine with or without accompanying NSAIDs for acute pain related to osteoarthritis of the knee and hip, urological or general surgery, orthopedic surgery, and for acute pain in pediatric patients. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of codeine with or without acetaminophen or other NSAIDs for patients with acute pain who have undergone C-section.",

It happens in the postovulation phase because estrogen and progesterone levels fall dramatically if there is no pregnancy. Physical symptoms include breast tenderness and bloating sensation, and emotional symptoms may manifest as mood swings, depression or feeling of hopelessness, intense anger and conflict with others, tension, anxiety, irritability, decreased interest in usual activities, difficulty in concentrating, fatigue, and changes in appetite. Symptoms emerge 1–2 weeks before menses and resolve completely with the onset of menses. This review article outlines the pathophysiology, presentation, severity and timing of symptoms, diagnosis and treatment of PMS and reiterates that it is a transient and physiological phase during the menstrual cycle and not a pathological entity.",

      "abstract": "Masa remaja merupakan masa perkembangan pada diri remaja yang sangat penting, yang di tandai dengan matangnya organ-organ fisik (seksual) sehingga nantinya sudah mampu untuk bereproduksi. Masa remaja merupakan salah satu periode dari perkembangan manusia yang sangat penting, Salah satu tanda keremajaan yang muncul secara biologis yang di alami pada wanita adalah menstruasi. Menstruasi di mulai saat pubertas dan kemampuan seorang wanita untuk mengandung anak atau masa reproduksi. Menstruasi biasanya di mulai antara usia 10 sampai 16 tahun, tergantung pada berbagai faktor, termasuk kesehatan wanita, status nutrisi. Banyak gangguan menstruasi yang biasa di hadapi wanita ketika sedang menstruasi, gangguan ini biasanya menyebabkan ketidaknyamanan fisik bagi seorang wanita karena dapat menganggu aktivitas mereka. Salah satu ketidaknyamanan fisik yang di alami yaitu nyeri haid. Nyeri haid (dismenorea) adalah nyeri atau kram pada perut bagian bawah, yang muncul sebelum atau sewaktu menstruasi. ini merupakan keluhan ginekologis yang di sebabkan oleh ketidak seimbangan hormone progesterone dalam darah sehingga menimbulkan nyeri saat haid. Rasa nyeri ini merupakan hal umum yang dialami oleh wanita sesaat atau seblum menstruasi. Banyak wanita yang mengalami ketidak nyamanan fisik akibat nyeri haid ini, setengah dari seluruh wanita menderita akibat dismenorea ini, nyeri ini dapat di gambarkan dengan nyeri ringan, sedang, dan berat. Tujuan penyuluhan ini Untuk memberikan panduan dalam KIE mengenai dismenorea kepada siswi SMA N 1 Delitua, serta mengidentifikasi berbagai upaya yang dapat dilakukan untuk mengurangi nyeri dismenore pada tahun 2023. Dari hasil di atas terlihat bahwa seluruh siswa putri di SMAN 1 Deli Tua yang hadir mengikuti kegiatan PKM sebanyak 40 orang yang terdiri dari seluruh perwakilah siswi putri dari setiap kelas mulai dari kelas X-XII. Dan dari 40 siswi tersebut masih sebagian kecil yang paham bagaimana upaya penurunan nyeri dismenorea ketika menstruasi. Hal ini perlu mendapat perhatian khusus di karenakan nyeri dismneorea ini sangat menggangu aktifitas sehari-hari, salah satunya ketika sedang sekolah dan sedang dalam proses belajar. Para siswi akan menjadi tidak fokus belajar ketika merasakan yeri dismenorea ini.",

This syndrome refers to a musculoskeletal type of persistent pain localised at the anterior and/or posterior aspect of the pelvic ring. The pain may radiate across the hip joint and the thigh bones. The symptoms may begin either during the first trimester of pregnancy, at labour or even during the postpartum period. The physiological processes characterising this clinical entity remain obscure. In this review, the definition and epidemiology, as well as a proposed diagnostic algorithm and treatment options, are presented. Ongoing research is desirable to establish clear management strategies that are based on the pathophysiologic mechanisms responsible for the escalation of the syndrome's symptoms to a fraction of the population of pregnant women.",

      "abstract": "Menopause is the natural cessation of a woman’s menstrual cycle, and marks the end of fertility. Most women experience menopause by the average age of 52, but pelvic or ovarian damage may cause sudden menopause earlier in life. Genetics or any disease conditions may also lead to early onset of menopause. Perimenopause and post menopause are the two different stages of menopause. The beginning of irregular menses to the first 12 months of amenorrhea is perimenopause and the period after menopause is post menopause. Women experience various physiological and psychological changes during their menopausal period which will affect their quality of life and health. The main objective of this review was to assess the literature concerning the various postmenopausal symptoms and prevalence. In many research they reported that the most common symptoms in menopausal women are somatic symptoms such as hot flushes, heart discomfort, sleep problem, muscle and joint pain. The psychological symptoms like depression, anxiety, irritability, physical and mental exhaustion, sexual problem, bladder problem and dryness of vagina are the urogenital symptoms. The menopause in women is stressful and produces many changes in vital parameters. The low intakes of dietary iron and calcium are common in menopausal women. As a conclusion of this study proper diet, improved life style, self-care, medical support and awareness program can help to reduce the postmenopausal symptoms and increase their quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Dear Editor,\n\nBack pain, in particular low back pain (LBP), is a common symptom during pregnancy, afflicting about 50% of pregnant women with a negative impact on their quality of life [1]. Pregnancy-related LBP has been defined as a recurrent or continuous pain that occurs for more than 1 week during pregnancy [1], mainly during the third trimester, and often persists after delivery [2]. Many studies have identified some mechanical and hormonal risk factors underlying pregnancy-related LBP, but this condition is often ignored and consequently untreated. A rare and underdiagnosed cause of back pain during pregnancy is pregnancy-associated osteoporosis (PAO), which was first described about 60 years ago [3,4], and whose prevalence, etiology, and pathogenesis are still unknown [5]. PAO is more frequent during the third trimester of pregnancy or after delivery [6], and it is characterized by the occurrence of vertebral fragility fractures, most commonly at the lower thoracic and/or lumbar level, and the loss of bone mineral density (BMD) at the vertebral, hip, and even rib levels [5,6]. The main clinical symptoms are severe and prolonged back pain and height loss [7], although after pregnancy, symptoms are usually reduced with a BMD increase. However, in some cases, pain persists and the correct treatment is necessary. …",

The postpartum period is important for monitoring by midwives because many complained of discomfort during the post partum may even lead to complications such as post-partum infection. Maternal morbidity during puerperium is one of the highest causes in the prevalence of maternal mortality. Physical and psychological complaints that occur during the puerperium are things that must be a concern and become pathological if not done properly. Physical discomfort appears on puerperium including perineal pain due to trauma or injury sectio cesarean delivery, back pain, constipation, hemorrhoids, urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and exhaustion. The discomfort of the puerperium that is often experienced by the mother is constipation. Constipation in the puerperium occurs because of pain in the perineum and fear if there is pressure on the anus when defecation will affect the healing of perineal wounds, drug anesthesia, the influence of the hormone progesterone, dietary restrictions, lack of mobilization and psychological factors. Constipation causes the complications of hemorrhoids, post partum infection and bowel cancer if it is not done fast and precise management. Management given to postpartum mothers with constipation includes recommending consumption of fruits and vegetables such as plantains, papaya not only rice and side dishes, recommending morning walks and teaching postpartum exercise, telling mothers to consume 8 liters of water per day and collaborating with doctors for giving therapy.",

Long-term complications include formation of cysts, abscesses, and keloid scars, damage to the urethra resulting in incontinence, painful sexual intercourse, sexual dysfunction, recurrent urinary tract infections, chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility. During child birth, survivors of female genital mutilation may require Cesarean section or suffer obstructed labor leading to fetal death and/or vesico-vaginal fistulae and large perineal tears. The psychological consequences of female genital mutilation may involve loss of trust and confidence in care-givers, feelings of incompleteness, anxiety, depression, chronic irritability, and sexual problems.

Potential causal abnormalities for secondary dysmenorrhea include en- dometriosis (and adenomyosis), uterine fibroids (myomas), congenital uterine anomalies, endometrial polyps, use of an intrauterine contraceptive device, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic adhesions, pelvic abscess, pelvic inflammatory dis - ease, ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy, and, rarely, uterine or ovarian neo- plasm. 1-3 Although the most common and treatment of endometriosis can therefore be considered relevant to much of the discussion in this issue of Pain: Clinical Updates, which focuses on primary dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea usually begins six to 12 months after menarche and is characterized by spasmodic cramping pain in the lower abdomen that can radiate to the lower back and anterior or inner thighs. The pain usu- ally has a clear temporal pattern: it be- gins a few hours before or at the start of menstruation, is most intense at on- set, gradually waning over two to three days, and is sometimes accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, as worldwide report suffering from it, with 10-20% of them describing their suffering as severe and distressing. 7-10",

      "title": "Neuraxial opioids for labor analgesia: A double-edged sword?",
      "abstract": "Painful labor triggers unfavorable alterations in maternal physiology and biochemistry.[1] Effective labor analgesia is usually administered in the form of opioids via intrathecal, epidural, and/or intravenous routes. The nonanalgesic effects of intrathecal/epidural or intravenous opioids for obtaining pain relief during labor and delivery have always been associated with controversy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Committee in 2006 noted “maternal request is sufficient medical indication for pain relief during labor,” and neuraxial anesthesia is not related to increased incidence of cesarean delivery.[2] Regrettably, this caters to the faction that is focused on evaluating the efficacy of neuraxial analgesia vis-à-vis maternal and fetal complications and not neonatal outcomes. Most often than not, parturients who request analgesia are afflicted by severe pain, or are protracted, and/or have dysfunctional labor; hence, making “pain” a confounding variable in various studies. Thereby, neuraxial or intravenous analgesia though related often has only an associative relation with undesired outcomes.[34] The existing literature is replete with studies, which are challenging to interpret due to improper randomization, inappropriate sample sizes, and erratic dose schedules. Primarily, the research is focused on the effects of neuraxial analgesia on cardiotocography, Doppler flow studies, fetal oxygen saturation, etc. Oddly, none of them have a predictable correlation with neonatal outcome in labor. Future randomized research should concentrate on complete neonatal assessment (Apgar scores, acid-base balance, neurobehavioral scores, and breastfeeding). Because the placental vasculature is devoid of auto-regulation, it is entirely dependent on maternal blood pressure. Fetal heart rate (FHR), which reflects fetal oxygenation, is used to ensure peripartum fetal wellbeing. Fetal distress is detected by loss of variability and deceleration patterns. Maternal, fetal, obstetrical and anesthesiological causes may influence FHR. The fetus may be affected directly by placental transfer of local anesthetics or opioids, or indirectly due to maternal hypotension or uterine hyperactivity/hypotonus. Using continuous cardiotocography, fetal distress can be detected by loss of variability and deceleration patterns. Doppler flow studies done before and after neuraxial analgesia for labor found that uterine and umbilical artery resistance remained unchanged,[56] or increased[7] in normal labor, whereas in preeclampsia,[89] a reduction in resistance was reported. A maternal hemodynamic study concluded that the level of total vascular resistance[10] before combined spinal-epidural (CSE) analgesia in labor might suggest the risk of FHR abnormalities after the procedure. Lower total vascular resistance (<1000 dyne/s/cm−5) was associated with a decreased risk of FHR abnormalities. FHR decelerations seem to occur in women without the ability to upregulate stroke volume and cardiac output in response to the initial effects of analgesia. Tetanic uterine contractions due to intrathecal administration of opioids may lead to fetal bradycardia.[11] Though the mechanisms of action for this are undetermined, perhaps it points toward the hypertonicity of the uterine musculature subsequent to an acute fall in plasma epinephrine (a known tocolytic) levels. Decreased levels of maternal circulating beta-adrenergic agonists facilitate the predominance of alpha activity, which leads to uterine contractions, decreased uteroplacental blood flow, and ensuing fetal bradycardia. Successful management of uterine hyperstimulation (IV nitroglycerine 50–100 mcg or terbutaline 0.25 mg) results in uterine relaxation and subsequent stabilization of uteroplacental perfusion, leading to regularization of FHR abnormalities.[12] Epidural fentanyl and sufentanil, by virtue of their higher lipid solubility, exhibit quicker onset of action, greater systemic absorption, and lower concentration in the fetal circulation. Recent studies investigating the timing of neuraxial analgesia (early or late in labor) described no effect on Apgar score[1314] or umbilical acid-base status,[14] contrary to Chestnut,[1516] who found lower cord pH, higher pCO2 values and increased requirement of neonatal naloxone upon late induction. The neonatal outcome is not affected by the mode of induction (CSE or epidural bolus) nor maintenance with boluses, infusion, or PCEA.[17] No alteration in Apgar scores, cord pH, or NACS was detected in a double-blind comparison of fentanyl and sufentanil by infusion,[18] while less placental transfer, a significantly higher pCO2 but healthier 24 h NACS scores were reported by Loftus who gave sufentanil in relatively larger doses.[19] Leighton compared epidural with systemic analgesia and found no significant difference in FHR abnormalities.[20] A meta-analysis by Mardirosoff reported that fetal bradycardia occurred within 1 hour of intrathecal administration in 7.3% (39 out of 535), compared to 4.8% (19 of 392) of patients, however, it was not related to the increased rate of cesarean delivery.[21] Van de Velde concluded that intrathecal sufentanil (7.5 μg) potentially results in more nonreassuring FHR tracings compared with both intrathecal analgesia using a bupivacaine (2.5 mg)/sufentanil (1.5 μg) mixture and epidural analgesia using bupivacaine, sufentanil, and epinephrine.[22] It is known that larger doses of fentanyl may be associated with slightly impaired breast-feeding,[2324] however, a negligible effect on neonatal respiration was observed in a double-blind comparison of epidural bupivacaine infused alone or with fentanyl.[25] Frequently, obstetricians are concerned about neuraxial anesthesia leading to the slowing of labor, increased incidences of cesarean section, or use of instruments to ensure safe childbirth. In 2001, Cochrane database meta-analysis study explicitly showed that epidural anesthesia had no significant effect on the duration of the first stage of the labor, however, it prolonged the second stage.[26] Thornton has recommended the use of low doses to ameliorate the rate of operative vaginal delivery. No difference in umbilical artery pH was observed in a study comparing umbilical artery acid-base status in 110 matched pairs of women who received either epidural or no analgesia.[27] Interestingly, it showed significantly higher pCO2 and base excess in the epidural group, implying a beneficial effect of epidural analgesia on metabolic acidosis. Obstetric anesthesiologists must be cognizant of the conflicting facts. Informing the worried obstetricians with facts that neuraxial analgesia provides better Apgar scores and variable neurobehavioral changes should console them. Neonatal acid-base status is not only superior with epidural than with systemic opioid analgesia, it is also better than with no analgesia. The evident catecholamine upsurge due to fetal stress response to labor is advantageous for acclimatization to extrauterine life and is not inhibited by maternal neuraxial analgesia.[28] A home run for neuraxial opioids in labor analgesia!",

The primary aims of therapy are for the man to regain a sense of control over his ejaculation time and for him and his partner to feel satisfaction with sexual intercourse. The most effective therapies for primary PE are certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, given on a daily basis or \"on demand\" before sexual activity.

Physical symptoms are reportedly associated with functional limitations and decreased emotional well-being in postpartum women. Little is known about symptom trajectories over time, or whether maternal age and parity are associated with physical symptoms. What this paper adds? Prevalence of shoulder stiffness, back pain, and wrist pain during hospital-stay significantly increased up to 1 month postpartum for older primiparas. Older primiparas were the most vulnerable to back pain and wrist pain among all groups of women after 1 month postpartum. The implications of this paper: Special attention should be given to older primiparas in assessing and providing nursing care for physical symptoms, especially during the first month postpartum.",

Essential to the diagnosis of sexual abuse is an awareness of the problem and acknowledgement of its manifestations. The evaluation of the sexually abused girl usually is performed in a pediatric and adolescent gynecology outpatient department. Thus, the gynecologist will be part of a multidisciplinary approach to the problem and will need to be competent in the basic skills of history taking, physical examination, selection of laboratory tests und differential diagnosis. Findings secondary to sexual abuse are often subtle. Acute tears or bruisings are rare, because force is seldom part of sexual acts committed against a child. A vaginal opening of greater than 5 mm is not common and may indicate vaginal penetration. An intact hymen not necessarily exclude vaginal intercourse.

      "abstract": "Obstetric fistula or opening in the vaginal wall due to obstructed or prolonged labor is described in terms of the nature, consequences, and prevention of the problem for women in the developing world, who are primarily afflicted. This summary was derived from a larger Who review of obstetric fistula. This particular reproductive health problem, which is disabling and has dire social, physical, and psychological consequences, is the result of neglected childbirth. Obstetric fistula can take the form of vesicovaginal fistula, recto-vesico fistula, or recto-vaginal fistula. In prolonged labor, the anterior vaginal wall, the bladder base, and urethra are compressed between the fetal head and the posterior surface of the pubis, which results in necrosis of the pressured area between the 3rd-10th day of the puerperium. It is the duration of pressure not the magnitude of pressure that determines the degree of necrosis. The fistula may be as small as 1 cm or large and involve the middle of the vagina or the urethra, bladder neck, and cervix. If enough tissue is lost, the bladder and vagina are almost nonexistent. The consequences are urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, and excoriation of the vulva. Amenorrhea is an associated problem. Local nerve damage may also result which creates difficulty in walking. Stillbirth frequently occurs. The social consequences of incontinence, childlessness, and physical disabilities may be abandonment by husbands or ostracization by their social group. Preventing obstetric fistula involves improvement in the status of women in general, and includes educational advancement, deferment of marriage, access to family planning, improved nutrition, and skilled attendance during childbirth. Referral to skilled obstetric care is necessary. Maternity services need to be increased, and to provide identification of women at risk of difficult labor and transfer to an appropriate facility. Peripheral health centers must provide for operative delivery and obstetric expertise. Confidence must be secured from the population that services will be helpful. Treatment of obstetric fistula must begin early before the damage becomes irreversible. Appropriate staff and facilities must be available. The National Council of Women's Societies of Nigeria has launched an exemplary program for the physical, psychological, and social rehabilitation of women recovering from fistula repair.",

      "title": "KADAR TESTOSTERON PLASMA PRIA PASANGAN USIA SUBUR YANG DITERAPI DENGAN JUSTICIA GENDARUSSA BURM. F. SEBAGAI KONTRASEPSI ORAL SELAMA 30 HARI",
      "abstract": "Masih sedikitnya keikutsertaan pria dalam ber-KB dan juga jenis\r\nkontrasepsi pria yang sangat terbatas serta banyak menimbulkan\r\nketidaknyaman bagi pria, misalnya, kondom memiliki beberapa\r\nketidaknyaman bagi pria, yaitu memerlukan latihan dalam penggunaan\r\nkondom, beberapa pria tidak dapat mempertahankan ereksinya saat\r\nmenggunaan kondom, setelah ejakulasi pria harus menarik penisnya dari\r\nvagina jika tidak ingin terjadi kehamilan, dapat mengganggu kenikmatan\r\nsaat berhubungan seksual, dan menimbulkan alergi bagi beberapa orang\r\nserta seringkali menimbulkan resistensi psikologis dan mempunyai tingkat\r\nkegagalan 3-15%. Vasektomi, kelemahannya adalah komplikasi yang\r\nterjadi saat pembedahan yang menyebabkan pendarahan, nyeri, infeksi,\r\nserta reversibilitas sangat rendah. Vasektomi juga diduga terkait dengan\r\ntimbulnya kanker prostat. Kontrasepsi hormonal testosteron, berdampak\r\nkurang nyaman bagi pria, yaitu timbul ruam, jerawat, dan perubahan mood\r\nserta menurunnya dorongan seksual (mengganggu libido). Jenis kontrasepsi\r\npria lainnya, yaitu senggama terputus dan pantang berkala kelemahannya\r\nadalah kepuasan dalam berhubungan seksual berkurang dan kegagalan\r\ntinggi bila siklus menstruasi istri tidak teratur. Fakta tersebut, mendorong\r\nbeberapa peneliti untuk membuat suatu terobosan baru dengan menciptakan atau mengembangkan obat kontrasepsi non hormonal yang digunakan untuk\r\npria. Lepedium meyenii (Maca) yang memberikan efek pada energi dan\r\nmood, mengurangi kecemasan, dan meningkatkan hasrat seksual.\r\nTumbuhan tersebut terbukti meningkatkan produksi sperma, motilitas\r\nsperma, volume semen, namun tidak mempengaruhi konsentrasi testosteron,\r\nestradiol, LH, FSH, dan prolaktin. Daun tanaman Justicia gendarussa\r\nBurm. f. telah digunakan sebagian besar masyarakat Irian Jaya (Papua)\r\nsebagai obat kontrasepsi pria. Dari uji preklinik yang telah dilakukan, hasil\r\nyang diperoleh menunjukkan bahwa infus daun gendarussa ini menurunkan\r\nkadar testosteron dalam serum tikus. Dilanjutkan uji klinik dengan\r\nmenggunakan 120 subjek penelitian pria, sudah menikah dan mempunyai\r\nanak serta normospermia dimana kapsul ekstrak etanol 70% daun Justicia\r\ngendarussa Burm. f. diberikan selama 72 hari. Hasil uji klinik Justicia\r\ngendarussa Burm. f. didapatkan bahwa tidak ada pengaruh pada perlakuan\r\ndosis pemberian kapsul ekstrak etanol 70% daun Justicia gendarussa Burm.\r\nf dan perlakuan hari terhadap kadar hormon testosteron plasma pria fertil.\r\nPenelitian ini meneliti bahwa kapsul ekstrak etanol 70% daun\r\nJusticia gendarussa Burm. f tidak memberikan pengaruh terhadap hormon\r\ntestosteron, dimana testosteron memiliki peran sangat penting bagi pria.\r\nPeranan testosteron yaitu mempengaruhi sifat kelamin primer dan sifat\r\nkelamin sekunder, mempengaruhi pertumbuhan tulang dan matriks tulang,\r\nspermatogenesis, metabolisme basal, produksi sel darah merah, sistem\r\nimun, mempengaruhi dorongan seksual dan fungsi ereksi, mengurangi\r\nresiko diabetes dan penyakit kardiovaskular/peredaran darah, serta\r\npengaturan elektrolit dan keseimbangan cairan tubuh. Dilihat dari\r\npentinngnya peranan testosteron pada pria maka perlu diadakan penelitian lebih lanjut mengenai pengaruh penggunaan kapsul ekstrak etanol 70%\r\ndaun Justicia gendarussa Burm. f terhadap kadar testosteron plasma.\r\nPengukuran kadar testosteron total plasma menggunakan\r\nmetode/instrumen MODULAR ANALYTICS EVO dengan modul E 170\r\nyang terintegrasi di dalamnya, yang menggunakan metode ECLIA (Electro\r\nChemicaluminescence Immunoassays). Hasil pengukuran kadar testosteron\r\ntotal plasma ini dikelompokkan berdasar hari perlakuan (hari ke-0, hari ke-\r\n15, hari ke-30, dan hari ke-60 (30 hari setelah lepas obat)). Data yang\r\ndidapat kemudian diolah menggunakan program SPSS menggunakan uji\r\nAnova General Linier Model with Repeated Measures yang dilanjutkan\r\ndengan uji Post Hoc Bonferroni. Hasil dari pengolahan secara statistik\r\nmenunjukkan varians yang homogen yaitu sebesar 0.465 (P>0,05), serta\r\ntidak ada interaksi dari hari perlakuan terhadap konsentrasi hormon\r\ntestosteron, yang ditunjukkan dari F hitung hasil Anova General Linier\r\nModel with Repeated Measures pada perlakuan hari sebesar 1.404 dengan\r\nsignifikansi sebesar 0.254 (P>0,05). Kemudian dari uji Post Hoc\r\nBonferroni, yang menunjukkan tidak ada perbedaan signifikan di antara hari\r\nperlakuan terhadap konsentrasi hormon testosteron setelah diterapi dengan\r\nkapsul ekstrak etanol 70% daun Justicia gendarussa Burm. f. 450 mg/70\r\nkgBB selama 30 hari.\r\nDari hasil penelitian ini, dapat disimpulkan bahwa tidak ada\r\npengaruh signifikan terhadap kadar hormon testosteron plasma pria\r\npasangan usia subur setelah diberikan kapsul ekstrak etanol 70% Justicia\r\ngendarussa Burm. f. 450 mg/ 70 kgBB (setara dengan 2,9 mg gendarussin\r\nA) yang diminum per oral sehari satu kali satu kapsul selama 30 hari yang\r\ndiberikan kepada 26 volunteer. Diharapkan diadakan penelitian lebih lanjut\r\nmengenai hal-hal yang mempengaruhi hormon testosteron setelah diterapi dengan kapsul ekstrak etanol 70% Justicia gendarussa Burm. f. 450 mg/ 70\r\nkgBB (setara dengan 2,9 mg gendarussin A).",

The following are the diagnostic signs and symptoms of the unruptured group: Amenorrhea, or some irregularity of menstruation, is generally present (excepting when tubal pregnancy occurs during lactation). Menstruation in tubal pregnancy is as exceptional as it is in uterine pregnancy. As a rule the patient feels that she is pregnant, and may have the characteristic subjective signs peculiar to some individuals. She may suspect that the pregnancy differs in some manner from her previous gestations. Pain is a constant symptom of tubal pregnancy, and is due to the small hemorrhages caused by the eroding villi or the distention of the tube by the constantly growing ovum. The pain is sharp, lancinating and paroxysmal",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis of the urinary bladder and / or ureter are diseases that may occur alone or in association with endometriosis elsewhere in the pelvis or other sites of the body in women between the 2nd decades of life and the fifth decades of their lives typically in women who are menstruating but endometriosis of urinary bladder may occur / present in post-menopausal women on very rare occasions or in women with a past history of treatment for endometriosis elsewhere. Endometriosis of the urinary bladder and / or endometriosis of the ureter are uncommon diseases which tend to be reported sporadically globally. Endometriosis of the urinary bladder and / or ureter may be asymptomatic in some patients but other cases of endometriosis of the urinary bladder / and or ureter tend to present with non-specific symptoms including: suprapubic pain, urinary frequency and urgency, loin pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhoea, cyclical dysuria, and other non-specific symptoms including loin pain and infertility. A high-index of suspicion is required in order to diagnose the disease early with utilization of (a) various radiology imaging including ultrasound scan of pelvis and urinary tract, computed tomography scan of pelvis and urinary tract, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI scan of pelvis and renal tract, (b) laparoscopy and biopsy of the endometriosis lesion for histopathology examination including immunohistochemistry studies of the specimen, (c) cystoscopy examination for further assessment. Diagnosis of endometriosis of the urinary bladder and / or ureter tends to be confirmed by pathology examination finding of endometrial glands and stroma in the excised or biopsy specimen and immunohistochemistry staining studies tend to exhibit the following features: (a) the endometrial stromal cells of endometriosis tend to stain positively upon immunohistochemistry staining for CD 10; (b) the glandular component of endometriosis does exhibit positive nuclear staining for p63; (c) the glandular component of endometriosis also stains positively for: CK7, ER oestrogen receptor, PR progesterone receptor; (d) endometriosis specimens also usually stain positively for: CA125. Treatment for endometriosis of bladder and or ureter could be conservative with inclusion of hormonal treatment, pain relief, and medications to reduce urinary bladder symptoms and this tends to be effective in many cases but recurrences tend to be higher in most cases in comparison with surgical treatment. Some of the surgical treatment for endometriosis of urinary bladder includes partial cystectomy ensuring completed excision of the endometriosis lesion or submucosal excision of the urinary bladder endometriosis lesion but leaving an intact urinary bladder mucosa. Surgical treatment of endometriosis of the ureter tend to involve (a) complete excision of the endometriosis segment of the ureter and end-to end ureteric anastomosis, or excision of the endometriotic ureter segment with either Boari-flap ureteric anastomosis to the urinary bladder or Psoas hitch anastomosis. Complication may occur following various treatment options adopted for the disease of the ureter and urinary bladder including recurrence, urinary urgency and urge incontinence, urinary stress incontinence, ureteric stenosis / stricture, vesico-ureteric reflux and these complications need to be treated and a long-period of follow-up would be required in order to also diagnose the late complications of the disease. Surgical excision surgery in the developed countries tend to be undertaken by the laparoscopic technique but in the developing countries that do not have facilities for laparoscopic surgery the open technique would tend to be adopted for all surgical treatment options of the disease.",

Dysmenorrhea is sometimes associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, fever, headache, back pain, and dizziness. The exact cause of the disorder is not completely understood. However, there are many known factors that play significant roles in the pathogenesis of dysmenorrhea. The most important are: excessive uterine contractility, disturbances in uterine blood supply, synthesis of prostaglandins and anatomical abnormalities of the female reproductive tract. Primary dysmenorrhea refers to painful menstrual bleedings in the absence of any detectable underlying pathology. Secondary dysmenorrhea represents the clinical situation where menstrual pain can be related to an underlying disease, disorder, or structural abnormality either within or outside the uterus. Unexplained mechanisms and multiple factors involved in the pathogenesis of primary dysmenorrhea indicate a vivid need for further studies on this subject.",

      "abstract": "Experience with more than 375 cases of possible sexual abuse has taught us that much work still needs to be done in understanding normal prepubertal female anatomy and interpreting findings in sexual abuse cases. Because pediatric clinicians are often called upon to assess possible sexual abuse victims, knowledge of what is known and how best to examine the genitalia of a young girl is essential. Two cases are discussed that involve normal and abnormal anatomy. Examination techniques for adequate visualization include proper tension and timing with the spreading of the labia in the supine position, the knee-chest position, and lateral traction on the buttocks while lying flat on the abdomen to look for anal relaxation. The hymen, contrary to common notion, is often a slack, thick, folded, stretchable tissue which may persist after digital or penile penetration. Findings secondary to sexual abuse are often subtle. Acute tears or bruising are rare because force is seldom a part of the sexual acts committed against a child. A vaginal opening of greater than 5 mm is not common and may indicate vaginal penetration with a finger, object, or penis. An \"intact\" hymen does not necessarily preclude vaginal penetration. Lack of physical evidence never rules out abuse because many sexual acts leave no physical findings.",

Of these many problems of menstruation, one will be considered at present, that of dysfunctional uterine bleeding.

      "abstract": "Recent epidemiological and observational research has provided new insights into premature ejaculation (PE) and the associated negative psychosocial effects of this dysfunction. The first contemporary multivariate evidence-based definition of lifelong PE was deeloped in 2008 by a panel of international experts, and characterises lifelong PE as \"…ejaculation which always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about one minute of vaginal penetration, the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations, and the presence of negative personal consequences, such as distress, bother, frustration and/or the avoidance of sexual intimacy.\" [39] This definition is limited to heterosexual men engaging in vaginal intercourse. There is insufficient published evidence to propose an evidenced-based definition of acquired PE Although there is insufficient empirical evidence to identify the etiology of PE, there is limited correlational evidence to suggest that men with PE may have erectile dysfunction, hyperthyroidism, prostatitis and/or chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), high levels of sexual anxiety and inherited altered sensitivity of central 5-HT receptors. The off-label use of some SSRIs and clomipramine, along with the development of new on-demand drugs for the treatment of PE, has drawn new attention to this common and often ignored sexual problem. Daily administration of an SSRI is associated with superior fold increases in intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) compared to on-demand administration of SSRIs, including dapoxetine, due to greatly enhanced 5-HT neurotransmission resulting from several adaptive processes which may include presynaptic receptor desensitisation. However, until the neurobiological, physiological and psychological mechanisms responsible for PE are better understood, ideal treatment outcomes may remain elusive. Drug treatment fails to directly address causal psychological or relationship factors, and data are either lacking or scarce on the efficacy of combined psychosexual counselling and pharmacological treatment, and the maintenance of improved ejaculatory control after drug withdrawal. Drug combinations or single agents that target multiple 5-HT receptors may represent the next stage of PE drug development",

      "title": "AYURVEDIC ASPECT OF PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE-A REVIEW",
      "abstract": "The uterus, urinary bladder and rectum are the pelvic organs. These organs are held in their appropriate anatomi-cal position by the support of pelvic floor muscles and ligaments. But when laxity or loss of tone is seen in these muscles and ligaments, these pelvic organs get displaced in a downward direction due to their weight and gravi-ty. After some time, it results in the prolapse of the respective organ. Pelvic organ Prolapse (POP) is found commonly in old age, i.e. in the menopausal age group. Mostly, it is seen in multipara women, i.e., a woman who gives birth to more than one child. Mostly it is associated with the feeling of something coming out of the vagina, which causes discomfort while sitting or walking. Also, it leads to some urinary symptoms such as ur-gency or frequency or painful micturition, etc. This includes first-degree, second-degree, and third-degree uterine prolapse and cystocele. ureterocele, rectocoele. Management can be done using surgical and non-surgical meth-ods. In Ayurveda, it can be corelated to yonirogas Mahayoni, prasramsini, phalini/andini and vatiki yonivyapat. If any women who are prone to mithya ahara viharas, dukha prasava dushta arthava, who didn't follow proper dinacharya, rajaswalacharya, garbhini paricharya, sootika paricharya, results in improper dosha vitiation, rasa, rakta, mamsa, medo dhatu dushti, which in turn causes upadhatu arthava, kandara, sira vitiation resulting in loosening of ligaments, muscles and structures associated with pelvic organ supports, causing organ to prolapse. Prasramsini can be corelated to first or second-degree uterine prolapse, Andini/phalini as cystocoele, and Mahayoni as third-degree uterine prolapse/procidentia. The lakshana \"Bhramsa in Vatiki yonivyapat” can be corelated to the displacement of garbhashaya.",

HMB is an important symptom of many well-defined conditions, which may or may not be associated with irregular cycles. An excess of menstrual loss in women without evidence of pathology is sometimes called abnormal uterine bleeding, or unexplained HMB. During puberty, HMB can occur as a result of hypo-function of the anterior pituitary body, with consequent failure of ovulation, and therefore no corpus luteum is formed. HMB can be associated with fibroids, adenomyosis, pelvic infection, endometrial polyps, endometriosis, and the presence of an intrauterine contraceptive device. Chronic pelvic infection and ovarian endometriosis both give rise to HMB as a result of inflammation, but dysmenorrhoea, pelvic pain, dyspareunia, and backache are usually more prominent symptoms. Leiomyomas may cause a mixture of HMB and intermenstrual spotting. The irregular bleeding tends to occur when they are submucous.",

      "abstract": "Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is generally defined as non-cyclic pain perceived in the pelvic area that has persisted from three to six months or longer and is unrelated to pregnancy. The etiology of CPP is complex, multifactorial, with heterogeneous presentation, and includes several diseases such as endometriosis, adenomyosis, and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. It may also be associated with sexual dysfunction, musculoskeletal disorders, and comorbid psychiatric symptoms. Vulvar pain disorders (VPDs) are typically categorized separately from chronic pelvic pain; among all VPDs, vulvodynia is a chronic vulvar pain of unknown etiology, lasting at least 3 months and that might be associated with other potentially linked factors. Proteomics represents a useful approach to study the proteome profiles of clinical samples. In this review, we have considered a selection of articles that have analyzed the protein abundance and novel protein species from various biological samples, including eutopic/ectopic endometrium, urine, serum, follicular, peritoneal fluid, and cervical mucus, potentially involved in the pathogenesis and progression of CPP and VPDs. These findings could represent valuable targets for paving the way for the differential diagnosis and therapeutic management of CPP and VDPs, thereby optimizing both the prevention and treatment of these conditions.",

No significant changes in rectal or bladder compliance were noted, and anal pressure and urethral pressure and length were unchanged after surgery. Whole gut transit was not affected by hysterectomy. Urinary symptoms occurred de novo in 6/26 women and gastrointestinal symptoms in 2/26 women. These results show that significant changes in rectal and vesical sensitivity occur after hysterectomy for benign disease. These persist for at least six months postoperatively but are not always associated with development of urinary or gastrointestinal symptoms.",

      "title": "Managing Back Pain During Pregnancy.",
      "abstract": "The incidence of low-back pain during pregnancy is thought to be about 50%. It occurs most commonly after the sixth month and can last until the sixth month postpartum. The major predictors are back pain prior to pregnancy and multiparity. Several biomechanical and physiologic changes during pregnancy contribute to back pain. As the woman's abdominal muscles are stretched and tone is diminished, they lose their ability to contribute to neutral posture. During pregnancy, production of the hormone relaxin increases ten-fold. The hormone creates joint laxity, which not only allows the pelvis to accommodate the enlarging uterus, but also weakens the ability of static supports in the lumbar spine to withstand shearing forces. In the pelvis, joint laxity is most prominent in the symphysis pubis and the sacroiliac joints. On physical exam, neither lumbar nor sacroiliac back pain is generally associated with any evidence of neurologic deficit or hip pathology. In cases of lumbar back pain, the physical exam will be most consistent with discogenic pain and/or facet element pain. Therefore, a pregnant woman's pain may be most pronounced on flexion and standing. Among the tests that can be used to evaluate lower-back pain are the posterior pelvic provocation test; ventral gapping test; dorsal gapping test; sacroiliac joint fixation test; Patrick's test, or FABERE's maneuver (flexion, abduction, external rotation, and extension); and Derbolowski's test. The most common types of back pain during pregnancy are lumbar pain, sacroiliac pain, and nocturnal back pain.",

The case series aim to provide some insight on features and presentations of Asian women with vaginismus. Vaginismus is characterised by persistent or recurrent difficulties in vaginal penetration despite the woman's wish for coitus. Avoidance, phobia, anticipatory fear of pain and involuntary pelvic muscle contraction are the most common symptoms.We report a series of cases of Malaysian women who had been suffering from vaginismus and 'infertility'. All the cases had never been attended to medically and there were long delays in seeking intervention. There was no history of traumatic sexual experience or any major psychiatric illness in these patients. Majority of the patients had prominent symptoms of anxiety.The cases illustrate that it is important to rule out the possibility of vaginismus among patients with infertility. The former have unique psychological features which require psychological interventions.",

      "abstract": "Sexual pain disorders include dyspareunia and vaginis- mus. They may affect 10 to 15% of women between 18 and 59 years of age. Vulvar vestibulitis is the leading cause of dyspareunia in the fertile age. Etiology includes recurrent vaginal infections; hyperactivity of the mastcells; myalgic contraction of the pelvic floor; hyperactivity of the pain system, with shift from nociceptive to neuropathic pain, and neu- rogenically mediated inflammation. Iatrogenic factors may cause ac- quired dyspareunia. Loss of estrogens and related genital arousal disor- ders are the leading etiology of dyspareunia in the postmenopause. Spe- cial attention wll be dedicated to the strong association between urinary tract symptoms and dyspareunia - RR= 7.61 (4.06-14.26) - and geni- tal arousal disorders - RR= 4.02 (2.75-5.89) - respectively. Psychosex- ual factors may contribute to sexual pain disorders. Inadequate coping modalities may worsen pain perception over time. A careful clinical ap- proach, aiming at understanding and treating all the causes of sexual pain disorders, is mandatory if sexual pain is to be effectively addressed.

Vaginal and cervical eversions usually occur before calving, and uterine eversions after calving. The majority of vaginal and cervical eversions occur in the last few weeks of pregnancy; however, it may occur several months before calving. Vaginal eversions are classified into four grades according to the severity of eversion, the extent of injury, and the exposure of cervix in such eversions. Uterine eversion occurs mostly within 24 hours after fetal delivery, with the majority of cases occurring shortly after parturition. Many factors are believed to contribute to uterine eversion, including reduced uterine contractility due to decreased uterine activity following primary or secondary uterine inertia. This chapter addresses the clinical situations from a productive, fertility and, most importantly, an animal welfare perspective.",

Consistency is an important aspect of the definition of ED. Erectile difficulties must be reported to occur on a consistent or recurrent basis in order to qualify for the diagnosis of ED. A three-month minimum duration is generally accepted for establishment of the diagnosis. In some instances of trauma or surgically induced ED (e.g., postprostatovesiculectomy or postcystectomy), the diagnosis may be confirmed prior to three months. Although ED is a benign disorder, it is closely related to physical and psychosocial health, and has an essential influence on the quality of life of both patients and their partners. Clinically, the diagnosis of ED is primarily based on patient's self-report. The diagnosis may be supported by objective testing (or partner's report), nevertheless these measures cannot displace the patient's self-report in classifying the disorder. The necessary reliance on patient's reports implies that cultural factors and patient-physician communication and relation will be important determinants in defining and diagnosing the disorder.",

It causes regression of the miillerian ducts (MD) in males. Failure of the MD to regress permits their development into the uterus and fallopian tubes. Persistence of MD derivatives among subjects with a male sexual phenotype occurs in three main clinical settings: a “pure” form in which the synthesis or action of AMH is defective; a complicated form, often unilateral, in which the primary problem is one or another type or degree of testicular dysgenesis; and, inauthentically, before proper diagnosis of female pseudohermaphroditism. Persistent miillerian duct derivatives have also been reported in syndromal association with nonreproductive anomalies (Urioste Syndrome in chapter 15).",

      "abstract": "If you have had burning, stinging, raw, or irritating pain in your vulva (the area outside the vagina) for at least 6 months, you may have a vulvar pain syndrome. The pain from these syndromes, which are also called vulvodynia, may come and go or may constantly be present; it may be triggered by touch or by trying to have sexual intercourse or insert a tampon. Although vulvar pain is distressing and can interfere with daily activities, it can be treated.\n\nUnfortunately, there is not much quality research on vulvar pain, and it's not known how many women have the problem. Many vulvar pain treatments are based on what has worked for small numbers of women, rather than for women from large scientific studies.\n\nSome women with vulvar pain feel that friends, partners, and clinicians have brushed off their pain as being all in their head or that they do not understand how much it affects their life. In addition to finding a clinician for treatment, you may find it helpful to seek a support group for women with vulvar pain.\n\nWhat Is the Vulva? \n\nThe vulva is the area just outside of the vagina. You might want to look at a picture of the vulva with the parts labeled and then look at yourself with a long-handled mirror. On the outside of the vulva are the outer lips covered with hair and skin, called the labia majora. If you spread the labia majora apart, you will see the inner …",

Women with PFD also have sensory nerve impairment, and it is likely this occurs during childbirth, but this has never been investigated. In the current study 150 women underwent quantitative sensory testing for vibration sensation at the vagina and clitoris, and stretch sensation at the vagina and introitus, in the third trimester, three and six months postnatal. Antenatally vibration sensation was reduced but stretch sensation was normal. Postnatally vibration sensation deteriorated whilst stretch sensation initially deteriorated but recovered by six months postnatal to antenatal levels (all p&lt;0.001 ).Mode of birth had a significant impact on sensation, with caesarean section appearing neuroprotective, normal vaginal birth resulted in a transient deterioration in sensation that recovered by six months, whilst assisted vaginal delivery was prolonged suggesting persistent neurological impairment (all p&lt;0.015 ).

This may be secondary to physical factors such as fatigue and nausea and vomiting as well as a fear of miscarriage or harm to the pregnancy. Sexual activity in the first trimester has not been demonstrated to result in miscarriage, adverse obstetric outcomes, or fetal harm. Vaginal bleeding may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and therefore caution is advisable for vaginal intercourse in these cases.

For this therapy are used natural estrogen (17β-estradiol, estradiol valerate, estriol) in combination with progestins (dydrogesterone) or androgens. It is possible parenteral (injections), transdermal, vaginal and oral hormone introduction.To correct the climacteric syndrome, urogenital disorders are used short courses of menopausal hormone therapy (for 1–5 years). For the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis menopausal hormone therapy lasts over 3 years if necessary, in combination with a bisphosphonate.",

      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhea Dysmenorrhea, or painful menstruation, is the most common gynecologic problem that occurs during adolescence. It is estimated that 75% of menstruating women experience dysmenorrhea, making it the leading cause of school and work absenteeism among young women. Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as painful menses with no identifiable pelvic pathology. Secondary dysmenorrhea refers to painful menses resulting from a pelvic abnormality, such as endometriosis or fibroids. This is an important distinction because treatment is based on the cause of the dysmenorrhea. Evaluation of the adolescent who has dysmenorrhea begins with questioning about the timing, character, and location of the pain as well as the presence of associated systemic symptoms. A history of pelvic infection, menorrhagia, or intermenstrual bleeding suggests that the dysmenorrhea is secondary to pelvic pathology. Pelvic pain at times other than menstruation (eg, mid-cycle, during intercourse, with defecation) may indicate endometriosis. The onset of dysmenorrhea soon after menarche with rapid worsening over several cycles suggests an outlet obstruction, which may result from a partially imperforate hymen or uterine malformation. A pelvic examination should be performed before initiating treatment for dysmenorrhea. Abnormal uterine size, position, or shape suggest uterine malformation rather than fibroids, which are uncommon during adolescence. Cervical cultures for gonorrhea and chlamydia should be performed because chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) may appear as dysmenorrhea.",

      "abstract": "Ejaculatory dysfunction, especially premature ejaculation (PE), is a common male sexual disorder. Most epidemiological studies on the prevalence of PE are limited by their reliance on diagnosis by patient self-report. Recently reported normative intravaginal ejaculatory latency time data have expanded our understanding of this condition. Although there is insufficient empirical evidence to identify the etiology of PE, there is limited correlational evidence to suggest that men with PE have high levels of sexual anxiety and altered sensitivity of central 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors. Pharmacological modulation of the ejaculatory threshold using daily or on-demand selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors offers patients a high likelihood of achieving improved ejaculatory control within a few days of initiating treatment as well as consequential improvements in sexual desire and other sexual domains, and it is well-tolerated. It fails to directly address causal psychological or relationship factors, and data are either lacking or scarce on the efficacy of combined psychosexual counseling and pharmacological treatment as well as on the maintenance of improved ejaculatory control after drug withdrawal.",

It often occurs with a cough or sneeze, routine activities, or exercise and is caused by derangement of the pelvic supportive structures as a result of aging, birth trauma, or collagen defects. Initial evaluation should consist of a thorough history that includes a voiding diary, a pelvic exam, and, possibly, a cough stress test. Referral for urodynamic testing may be necessary. Conservative therapies such as intravaginal or barrier devices and/or pelvic muscle strengthening techniques are often effective and should be tried before surgical repair is considered.",

      "title": "An integral theory and its method for the diagnosis and management of female urinary incontinence.",
      "abstract": "The Integral Theory on Female Urinary Incontinence states: stress symptoms, urge symptoms, and symptoms of defective flow may all derive , for different reasons, from laxity in the suburethral vagina or its supporting ligaments. This theory proposes that the pre-tensioned anterior vaginal wall transmits specific pelvic muscle contractions which open or close the bladder neck and urethra. The vagina is tensioned like the membrane of a drum against the ligaments which support it from above. In its tensioned state, the vagina can be pulled by the pelvic floor muscles to mechanically open or close bladder neck. The tensioned vagina also indirectly supports the nerve terminals at bladder base. Vaginal laxity may predispose to premature activation of the micturition reflex. If this reflex cannot be suppressed, then the subsequent uninhibited detrusor contraction may cause urinary urge incontinence ( bladder instability). Therefore, laxity* in the vaginal tissue or its supporting ligaments may, for different reasons cause symptoms of stress incontinence, urge incontinence, or of defective opening. Based on the evidence presented here and in previous studies (1), a new anatomical classification of female urinary incontinence can be made, consisting of six specific anatomical defects. Characteristic clinical, morphological and urodynamic changes which help to diagnose a particular defect are identified, as is the modifying effect of age, hormones, and iatrogenically induced scar tissue. Three separate closure mechanisms are described, urethral, bladder neck, and a separate voluntary mechanism. * excessive tightness of these structures may also cause dysfunction of the opening/closure mechanisms in the patient who has been already subjected to surgical interference.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : The US Marine Corps currently gives Marines six months following their 42-day postpartum convalescent leave, or about seven and a half months, to rehabilitate before resuming fitness testing. However, this time period is inadequate to regain sufficient muscular strength and endurance in the transversus abdominis and pelvic floor muscles to enable safe fitness testing due to the high-impact and/or high-intensity of the constituent test events and the sustained repetitive nature of the abdominal crunch event. Pregnancy-induced musculoskeletal changes, to include hormone-induced ligament relaxation, persist for months after childbirth and have substantial ramifications for abdominal and pelvic floor muscles. If postpartum women do not return in a graduated, progressive manner to high-impact activities and activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as trunk flexion and heavy lifting, they are more prone to incidence or recurrence of diastasis recti, abdominal fascia herniation, incontinence, and/or pelvic organ prolapse, all of which affect long-term health and readiness. The current timeline for resuming fitness testing should be extended to no earlier than 9 months postpartum. Additionally, postpartum Marines should be referred to physical therapy programmatically so that they can undergo rehabilitation following childbirth with a physical therapist who has women's health training and experience.",

      "abstract": "In adolescence serious gynaecological pathology is rare, but menstrual disturbances are common and may add further disruption for them and their families. Menstrual disorders are one of the major problems faced by women all around the world and are generally perceived as minor health concerns. There are many types of menstrual disorders such as oligomenorrhea, hypomenorrhea, menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS), amenorrhea and polymenorrhea. Several studies have been performed to determine the prevalence and the pattern of menstrual disorders among students in various countries and also to understand the knowledge and awareness towards menstrual disorders among the student population. Among all menstrual disorders, dysmenorrhea is the most common, being reported among students, which is characterized by recurrent, crampy abdominal pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and back pain. This being the major cause leads to activity restriction and absenteeism from school or university, for which few of the adolescents consult physician or may adopt self-medication with over-the-counter medicines or home remedies. Studies have been reported that menstrual cycle abnormalities may also be associated with psychological stress, strenuous physical exercise, low body weight and endocrine disturbance. This review compiled the studies on menstrual disorders and discussed the associated problems in university and school students.",

      "abstract": "Existen dentro de la vida de una mujer, etapas reproductivas y no reproductivas. Dentro de las no reproductivas, nos encontramos con la menopausia, que generalmente coincide con la mediana edad, alrededor de los 50 años. Durante la perimenopausia, que es la etapa que rodea a la menopausia, la mujer es más vulnerable a sufrir depresión. Esto puede coincidir con otros factores estresantes en esta etapa, como pueden ser cuando los hijos dejan el hogar por primera vez, para estudiar o a trabajar, lo que se conoce por el “síndrome de nido vacío”. La aparición de síntomas menopáusicos como pueden ser los sofocos, el insomnio, o el cansancio, repercute en el estado de humor de la mujer, es decir, en su estado emocional. A lo largo de este periodo se producen cambios físicos, aunque también suelen ocurrir cambios psicológicos, como puede ser llanto fácil, ansiedad, etc. Es por ello necesario pensar en una estrategia que sirva de profilaxis o de preparación a la llegada de esta etapa. El coaching es una herramienta que, partiendo de las necesidades planteadas por cada mujer, puede ayudarla a alcanzar sus objetivos. La estrategia de coaching, puede ayudar a la mujer a sentirse más motivada, más segura de sí misma y, por tanto, puede reducir la aparición de una sintomatología depresiva. El coaching puede ayudar a la mujer a alcanzar su bienestar emocional, con el objetivo de vivir una madurez plena.",

      "title": "Factoring in the missing link",
      "abstract": "A 51-year-old woman with a history of uterine fibroids presented with 2 weeks of persistent heavy vaginal bleeding. These symptoms developed in the setting of irregular menstrual cycles over the previous year. After 2 months without menstruation, she noted heavy, painless vaginal bleeding. She reported no abdominal pain, dysuria, nausea, vomiting, vaginal discharge, fever, chills, hot flashes, or night sweats. Menorrhagia can be related to uterine fibroids, bleeding diatheses (most commonly von Willebrand disease), hypothyroidism, or advanced liver disease. Intermenstrual causes of vaginal bleeding include pregnancy, perimenopause, medications, intrauterine devices, infections (e.g., pelvic inflammatory disease), or structural abnormalities, the most concerning of which is malignancy. The presence of uterine fibroids could account for vaginal bleeding, but the persistence and excessive volume suggests an additional process. Endometrial cancer occurs in a significant number of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, often presenting as irregular painless vaginal bleeding. Rarely, uterine fibroids undergo sarcomatous degeneration, which may present as vaginal bleeding. Past medical history included hypertension, nephrolithiasis, hyperlipidemia, and cholecystitis for which she underwent an uncomplicated cholecystectomy. Her Papanicolaou smears were normal and up-to-date. She had no history of sexually transmitted diseases. Her medications included metoprolol, iron supplementation, vitamin D, and multivitamins. She worked as a nurse in a methadone clinic. She was in a monogamous relationship with her husband and had three uncomplicated pregnancies. She never smoked tobacco or used illicit drugs and did not regularly consume alcohol. The absence of prolonged bleeding during her prior cholecystectomy decreases the likelihood of an inherited bleeding disorder, which would be expected to manifest itself earlier. Her medications are not associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Occupational hazards for individuals within the health profession can include substance abuse and self-inflicted disease (e.g., surreptitious use of warfarin). Certain herbal supplements such as ginkgo can alter estrogen levels or clotting factors leading to irregular menstrual cycles. On physical examination, the patient appeared well and in no distress. She was afebrile, with a pulse of 88 beats per minute, blood pressure 110/66 mmHg, and respiratory rate 18 breathes per minute. There was no conjunctival pallor. No rash, lymphadenopathy, or hepatosplenomegaly was detected. The cardiac, abdominal, and lung exams were normal. Soft tissue bruising and petechiae were noted on her upper extremities. There was moderate bilateral pitting edema of the lower extremities to the mid thighs. She had normal appearing external female genitalia. There was clotted blood visualized within the vaginal vault without evidence of active bleeding. No lesions or purulent discharge was observed in the vulva, vagina, or cervix. No cervical motion tenderness or pelvic mass was appreciated. Bilateral lower extremity edema may result from increased intravascular hydrostatic pressure as seen in volume overload conditions or decreased intravascular oncotic pressure related to hypoalbuminemic states. The patient lacked evidence of volume overload. Hypoalbuminemia can result from malnutrition, defective protein synthesis, or excessive loss from protein-losing enteropathies or nephropathies. The patient did not have physical exam findings consistent with advanced cirrhosis. A protein-losing enteropathy is less likely given the absence of diarrhea. Protein-losing renal disease remains a possibility as it cannot be easily assessed by history or physical exam. Bilateral lower extremity edema can be caused by hypothyroidism and medications (e.g., amlodipine). Polycystic ovarian syndrome is unlikely in the absence of obesity, hirsutism, or acne. An adnexal mass was not detected, decreasing the possibility of an ovarian tumor, ectopic pregnancy, or cyst. The absence of pelvic pain, fever, and cervical motion tenderness would argue against pelvic inflammatory disease. The urine human chorionic gonadotropin assay was negative. Electrolyte and aminotransferase levels were normal. The white blood cell count (WBC) was 9,600 per cubic millimeter, hematocrit 24.3%, mean corpuscular volume 86 femtoliters (normal range, 80–95), and the platelet count 441,000 per cubic millimeter. The prothrombin time (PT) was 34 sec (normal range, 12–14.4), international normalized ratio 3.5 (normal range, 0.8–1.2), and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) 58 sec (normal range, 23.8–36.6). Albumin was 2.3 grams per deciliter, total protein 4.3 grams per deciliter (normal range, 6–8.3), and globulin 2 g per deciliter (normal range, 2.3–3.5). Urinalysis revealed 3+ protein, 1 WBC, and 28 red blood cells. Twenty-four hours urine protein and creatinine was 12,012 mg (normal value, <150 mg per day) and 926 mg (normal range, 8–170 mg per day), respectively. Fibrinogen level was 434 mg per deciliter (normal range, 200–400). A chest x-ray was clear without evidence of pleural effusions. The constellation of edema, hypoalbuminemia, and marked proteinuria meets diagnostic criteria for nephrotic syndrome, which, paradoxical to this case, is usually associated with hypercoagulability secondary to loss of antithrombotic proteins such as protein C and S. Nephrotic syndrome can be a result of primary disorders, such as membranous nephropathy, or secondary causes, most commonly diabetes mellitus. While an abnormally elevated PT/INR or PTT can be explained by a disease process that affects both the extrinsic (factor VII) and intrinsic (factors VIII, IX, XI, and XII) pathways, respectively, a disturbance in the common pathway (factors II, V, and X) will concomitantly prolong the PT and PTT. The PT often becomes abnormal earlier than the PTT as an acquired common pathway factor deficiency evolves. Given the patient's age and unremarkable bleeding history, the coagulopathy would likely have to be acquired rather than be a late manifestation of a congenital predisposition. Acquired coagulopathies are the result of factor inhibitors or deficiencies. Inhibitors can be generated by conditions driven by or related to immune dysfunction. A fraction of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus will develop antiphospholipid antibodies, which can impact the measurement of the intrinsic pathway by prolonging PTT and typically manifest with thrombosis rather than bleeding. The most common acquired factor inhibitor targets factor VIII and may present as life-threatening bleeding. Autoantibodies against factor VIII can be a complication of solid tumors, usually adenocarcinomas, hematologic malignancies, most commonly chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the postpartum state, and medications. However, a factor VIII deficiency would only impact the intrinsic pathway and therefore prolong PTT without affecting PT/INR. An etiology is only discovered in about half the cases of factor inhibitors. Serologic testing for antinuclear antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B antibody, hepatitis C antibody, cryoglobulins, and human immunodeficiency virus antibody were negative. Levels of rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody were within normal limits. A mixing study should be performed to evaluate for the presence of an inhibitor. An inhibitor with slow kinetics, often seen in the case of factor VIII inhibitors, more effectively binds factor after incubation, demonstrating a normalized PTT initially and an uncorrected PTT after 1 or 2 hr. The INR and PTT corrected immediately as well as at 1 and 2 hr incubations during the mixing study. The negative mixing study essentially excludes the presence of an inhibitor and suggests a factor deficiency. Deficiency in factor levels of II, V, or X—components of the common pathway—can certainly explain a prolonged INR and PTT. Defective protein synthesis in cirrhosis leads to a deficiency in most clotting factors except for VIII, which is predominantly produced by the endothelium. Vitamin K deficiency or its interference by warfarin will selectively decrease factor II, VII, IX, and X activity levels, whereas factor V and VIII activity levels would be preserved. Disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is improbable given the preserved platelet count and fibrinogen level, will indiscriminately decrease activity of all coagulation factors (Table 1). Factor activity levels were as follows: Factor II 210%, factor V 177%, factor VII 137%, factor VIII 97%, factor IX 89%, and factor X 3% (ref range for all factors tested, 50–150). Profilnine (Coagulation Factor IX complex) and factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity (FEIBA anti-inhibitor coagulant complex) was given with temporary improvement in factor activity levels, which rose to 5% when measured a half hour after product administration, and reduction in vaginal bleeding. The coagulopathy appears to be due to an acquired, isolated factor X deficiency. Light-chain (AL) amyloidosis is a condition that can manifest with nephrotic syndrome and factor X deficiency. Evaluation of select organs with not only a predilection for AL amyloid deposition but also suspected involvement in this patient should be strongly considered. In parallel, protein electrophoresis of the serum (SPEP) and 24-hr urine collection (UPEP), immunoglobulin levels, and serum free light chain (FLC) levels can be measured to evaluate for a plasma cell dyscrasia. SPEP and UPEP with immunofixation demonstrated a faint M-spike and monoclonal gammopathy with free lambda paraprotein. Kappa FLCs were 5.5 mg per liter (normal range, 3.3–19.4), lambda FLC was 265 mg per liter (normal range, 5.7–26.3), and kappa to lambda FLC ratio was 0.02 (normal ratio, 0.26–1.65). IgG level was 304 mg/dl (normal range, 620–1,400), IgA 53 mg/dl (normal range, 80–350), and IgM 29 mg/dl (normal range, 45–250). A transthoracic echocardiogram showed moderate concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle, restrictive filling, and normal ejection fraction. Cardiac MRI did not demonstrate specific findings attributable to cardiac amyloid infiltration. Whole-body 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan demonstrated increased fludeoxyglucose uptake in the heart and bone marrow. No discrete osseous lesions were present on imaging. Renal biopsy was not pursued given the high risk of bleeding due to the coagulopathy. Flow cytometric analysis of the bone marrow aspirate disclosed a clonal plasma cell population with immunoglobulin lambda light chain restriction. Histopathological, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization analysis of the bone marrow specimen confirmed an increased number of CD138-positive, lambda restricted plasma cells (Fig. 1A–D), consistent with involvement by a plasma cell neoplasm. Congo red staining of the bone marrow specimen revealed green birefringence under polarized light indicating the presence of amyloid fibrils (Fig. 1E,F). Fluorescence in situ hybridization uncovered a t(11;14) chromosomal translocation, which juxtaposes immunglobulin heavy chain and BCL-1, leading to the overexpression of cell cycle regulator Cyclin D1.

[Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com.] The patient started combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CyBorD) for AL amyloidosis. FLC levels rose to 304 mg/l after 3 months of treatment indicating primary refractory disease; factor X levels remained less than 5% and NT-proBNP rose to 5,181 pg/ml. She was subsequently treated with melphalan, bortezomib, and dexamethasone, which yielded a partial response as lambda FLC levels dropped to 72 mg/l after 2 months of therapy. A splenectomy was performed in an attempt to improve factor X levels, however, it was complicated by a hepatic subcapsular hematoma despite hematological support. Before undergoing a planned autologous stem cell transplant, the patient died, 13 months after the diagnosis was established. Acquired, isolated deficiency of factor X is rare, however, when it does occur, AL amyloidosis is the most common cause 1. Less common etiologies include malignancy such as gastric adenocarcinoma, infections such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and medications such as sodium valproate. Factor X deficiency more commonly occurs in liver dysfunction, warfarin use, vitamin K deficiency, and DIC, but a concomitant reduction in activity levels of additional factors is usually observed (Table 1). Factor X is a vitamin K dependent protease that acts in the common pathway by cleaving, and thereby activating, prothrombin. It is the most common coagulation factor to be affected in AL amyloidosis; activity levels were found to be less than 50% of normal in 8.7% of cases 2. Factor X is thought to be sequestered by amyloid fibrils 3, shortening the plasma half-life and, inconsiderate to the depth of deficiency, it can showcase an unpredictable gradation of altered hemostasis. Still, symptomatic bleeding occurs in a substantial fraction of patients with factor X deficiency. While factor concentrates can be used as a temporizing measure, they seldom lead to sustainable improvements in factor X activity levels. As observed in this patient, the rapid binding of exogenous factors by amyloid is difficult to outcompete. Benefits must be weighed against risk when deciding to use FEIBA, which carries a risk for thrombosis. Support for using FEIBA in AL amyloidosis is limited to case reports 4. Splenectomy can improve factor X levels in a subset of patients, presumably by eliminating a source of intimate amyloid-vascular interaction; however, these are higher risk surgeries given the bleeding predisposition as was seen in this patient 5. Addressing the plasma cell dyscrasia will ultimately provide the best opportunity for a durable recovery in factor X levels. AL amyloidosis, also known as primary systemic amyloidosis, is the most common form of amyloidosis, accounting for just over three quarters of cases 6. It occurs when a clonal plasma cell population elaborates an abnormally folded immunoglobulin light-chain with the potential to deposit in tissue throughout the body. Although AL amyloidosis is most often secondary to a plasma cell dyscrasia, it can less commonly be associated with other B cell lymphoproliferative diseases including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia 7. When related to multiple myeloma, a lambda light chain isotype is usually secreted 8, whereas a kappa light-chain isotype is typically associated with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Indiscriminant of the associated condition, advanced AL amyloidosis is rapidly fatal if left untreated. The disease phenotype is heterogeneous and directly related to the tissue tropism of the particular misfolded light-chain amyloid fibril: cardiac involvement occurs in 75% of cases and can present with biventricular hypertrophic restrictive cardiomyopathy with a characteristic zebra pattern on MRI (biventricular subendocardial enhancement leading to a striped appearance) 9; kidneys are affected in 65% of cases and manifest as nephrotic syndrome with albuminuria; liver, peripheral nerves, gastrointestinal tract, soft tissue, and bone marrow can also be involved albeit less frequently. AL amyloidosis is often recognized late; 40% of patients are diagnosed a year after the onset of symptoms 10. It is therefore not surprising that 30% of patients present with irreversible organ damage at the time of diagnosis, portending a very poor outcome as these patients often succumb within a year. Early clinical suspicion coupled with appropriate diagnostics can alter the disease course by enabling effective treatment strategies to operate during an interval before irreparable harm has occurred. Biomarkers are sensitive but not specific in AL amyloidosis. NT-proBNP is abnormal in cardiac AL amyloidosis and elevated levels portend a poor prognosis 11. The evaluation of serum FLCs is critical as it is more sensitive than protein electrophoresis; the latter can return an absent or faint M-spike owing to a minor clonal B-cell burden. Moreover, the difference between the involved FLC and uninvolved FLC, known as FLC-difference, carries independent prognostic value: patients with a lambda FLC difference greater than 18.2 mg/dl, as was the case for this patient, have an average overall survival of 10.9 months as opposed to 37.1 months for patients with a FLC difference less than 18.2 mg/dl 8. A tissue biopsy showing amyloid fibrils that display green birefringence when stained with Congo red will confirm the diagnosis. Fine needle aspiration of the abdominal fat pad is easily performed, low risk, and yields a diagnostic sensitivity of 81% 12. If clinical suspicion remains high despite a negative abdominal fat pad biopsy, the salivary gland, which provides 60% sensitivity in this setting 13, or an involved organ can be biopsied after careful assessment of risk. Since there are more than 30 types of amyloid deposits, molecular characterization of the amyloid fibril is necessary to rule out other amyloid subtypes that are paired with distinct interventions 14. The two approaches used are immunohistochemical testing with amyloid-specific antibodies 15 and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses 16. The prognosis for AL amyloidosis is dependent in part on the degree of cardiac dysfunction. Infusion of patient-derived amyloid-forming light-chains led to heart failure in animal models by increasing apoptosis and oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes 17. Patients who do not respond to standard therapy can still survive for many years in the absence of cardiac involvement. However, patients with severe cardiac dysfunction can succumb in as short as a few weeks. It is therefore not surprising that the cardiac injury markers NT-BNP and troponin-T hold prognostic value. When combined with the increased FLC-difference, the elevated NT-BNP and troponin-T levels in this patient placed her in the Stage IV category based on a modified prognostication model, carrying an overall survival of 6.7 months 18. The initial step in treating AL amyloidosis is to eradicate the abnormal plasma cell clone using chemotherapy. Although lenalidomide is an active agent in multiple myeloma, largely through selective protein degradation of IKZF1, it tends to be less tolerated by patients with AL amyloidosis. The protease inhibitor bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone comprise the backbone of therapy. Melphalan, an alkalating chemotherapy, is often added to these two drugs; the combination has proven to be less active in patients who harbor a gain in chromosome 1q21 19. Cyclophosphamide, a cytotoxic nitrogen mustard, is the other agent combined with bortezomib and dexamethasone. It is worth noting that translocation t(11;14) is associated with poor outcomes in patients treated with bortezomib-based regimens 20. Consistent with these findings, this patient was primary refractory to the initial therapy of CyBorD. Once a partial or complete response is achieved, consolidation with high-dose melphalan followed by an autologous stem cell rescue is typically pursued. If tolerated, this approach can lead to a hematological complete response and restoration of factor X levels. However, autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with AL amyloidosis and factor X deficiency is imbued with high risk as it can be associated with severe and sometimes fatal complications 2. Newer therapies directed at binding and stabilizing amyloid particles are in development and show promise as an adjuvant to treatment directed at the responsible plasma cell clone. Early recognition will be the key factor that links a patient to a desired outcome.

      "abstract": "A lengthening of the menstrual period is very common in women wearing intrauterine devices, although less so since the use of copper devices. Very often the period not only lasts longer, but it is also heavier. This problem requires therapy only in cases where it represents an actual inconvenience for the patient. If this disturbance begins as soon as the IUD is placed, and it it persists, the doctor must check whether the IUD has moved and whether the hemorrhage announces an expulsion; the IUD may also be stuck in the cervix or it may have turned; this however can be seen only when one removes a distorted IUD. The clinical examination also allows to check that there is no sign of an infection beginning. If the clinical examination is normal, the doctor may administer some Methergin or a progestative type 19 nor steroid. If the treatment does not help reduce the period, the IUD must be removed, and another type of device may be tried out. In cases when the disturbance appears only after a certain time during which the IUD was well tolerated, the cause is most often a build up of a calcareous deposit which may irritate the mucous membrane. This secondary appearance of a lengthening of the menstrual period is a sign that the IUD must be replaced.",

      "title": "Management of dysmenorrhea",
      "abstract": "This article discusses dysmenorrhea which includes any pelvic pain felt by a woman during her menstrual period and which impacts her professional or academic life. The physiological mechanisms of essential dysmenorrhea are still poorly understood. Among the hypotheses put forth are: hyperactivity in the myometrium arrhythmic contractions a decrease in blood flow a drop in progesterone levels and hypersecretion of arginine vasopressin. Furthermore in organic dysmenorrhea the clinical investigation and interview cause an organic foundation to the pain to be suspected. The primary etiologies in question are external endometriosis adenomyosis sequelae from genital infections an intrauterine device and other etiologies such as uterine-vaginal malformations and cervical stenoses after surgery of the cervix. The first major step in the diagnostic approach is the interview which includes a characterization of the pain accompanying signs analysis of menstrual flow and the psychoaffective context. The gynecological examination is also a key step in the procedure. Additional investigations are prescribed in the case of dysmenorrhea which appears to be organic or resists symptomatic treatment. Though of no use in an adolescent or in a woman whose pain has all the characteristics of essential dysmenorrhea these additional investigations are specifically: ultrasound whenever there is doubt about the condition of the reproductive organs hysterosalpingography which is performed when adenomyosis is suspected but also to assess a uterine-vaginal malformation and finally celioscopy which is indicated to cap the assessment of an invalidating dysmenorrhea or one which responds poorly to medical treatments. It seeks any intrapelvic lesions. Therapeutic management is a function of physiopathological mechanisms. The goals of treatment are to control uterine hypercontractility suppress ovulation through oral contraception inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and reduce the concentration of intracellular calcium. Therefore treatment of essential dysmenorrhea is purely symptomatic and conditioned by the intensity of dysmenorrhea and the desire of the patient in terms of oral contraception. Treatment of secondary dysmenorrhea which is determined etiologically is however most often combined with symptomatic treatment required by the intensity of the pain.",

      "abstract": "Cambios fisiologicos en el embarazo Ciertos cambios anatomicos y fisiologicos especificos del embarazo pueden dificultar la determinacion de la causa del dolor. A medida que aumenta de tamano el utero gravido, se convierte en un organo abdominal alrededor de las 12 semanas, y empieza a comprimir las visceras abdominales suprayacentes. Este engrosamiento puede hacer dificil localizar el dolor, y tambien puede enmascarar o retrasar los signos peritoneales (1-2).

      "title": "Pelvic organ prolapse.",
      "abstract": "Pelvic organ prolapse, or genital prolapse, is the descent of one or more of the pelvic structures (bladder, uterus, vagina) from the normal anatomic location toward or through the vaginal opening. Women of all ages may be affected, although pelvic organ prolapse is more common in older women. The cause is a loss of pelvic support from multiple factors, including direct injury to the levator ani, as well as neurologic injury from stretching of the pudendal nerves that may occur with vaginal childbirth. Previous hysterectomy for pelvic organ prolapse; ethnicity; and an increase in intra-abdominal pressure from chronic coughing, straining with constipation, or repeated heavy lifting may contribute. Most patients with pelvic organ prolapse are asymptomatic. A sense of bulging or protrusion in the vagina is the most specific symptom. Evaluation includes a systematic pelvic examination. Management options for women with symptomatic prolapse include observation, pelvic floor muscle training, mechanical support (pessaries), and surgery. Pessary use should be considered before surgery in women who have symptomatic prolapse. Most women can be fitted with a pessary regardless of the stage or site of predominant prolapse. Surgical procedures are obliterative or reconstructive.",

      "abstract": "Pregnancy is a normal physical state of womens life when they carried a 9 month developmental stages of the foetus. On these durations some pregnancy induced changes leads normal signs naturally but there is an increased risk of musculoskeletal pain or discomforts associated with increase of uterine size and mental stress of pregnant women, needed non-medicines approached like antenatal physiotherapy care. These possible pain or discomforts can make difficult to carry the pregnancy may leadsome complications. Various research studies have been pointed out these problems of pregnant women and found out the triggers. Some studies show the spectrums of these musculoskeletal problems during pregnancy period. Various case studies are assured to theparticular physiotherapy techniques as antenatal exercises have good impact on relief of respective Musculo-skeletalpain. Various researches have also covered some other aspects of Musculo-skeletal problems during pregnancies. In thepresent study an attempt has been made to comprehensive analysis of these review studies to identify the most common musculoskeletal problems in different stages of pregnancy and efficacy of physiotherapy techniques and antenatal exercises to overcome the problem.It was found in the spectrum analysis that most of the women (68.33 %) faced this problem during their pregnancy. On the analysis of most commonmusculoskeletal problem, the mean percent of reviews reveals showed that the most of the women found to be in muscle cramps and pain in neck and shoulder during I trimester whereas maximum women had low back pain (42.87 %) and pelvic girdle pain (11.65 %) on II and IIItrimesters respectively. The satisfactory impacts of antenatal exercises were observed in different musculoskeletal pain by different techniques of Physiotherapy.These results can utilize to make suggestions and recommendations foradoption of suitable physiotherapy techniques in pregnancy to avoid the problem.",

      "abstract": "Ibu hamil dapat mengalami kecemasan selama hamil dan berlanjut sampai masa persalinan. Kecemasan dapat memicu produksi hormon stress yang menyebabkan gangguan peredaran darah dan pertukaran oksigen ibu dengan janin yang berakibat melemahnya kontraksi uterus dan memicu kegawatan pada janin. Tujuan penelitian ini adalah untuk mendapatkan gambaran kecemasan ibu dengan riwayat obstetri buruk pada persalinan kala I. Metode penelitian menggunakan penelitian kualitatif fenomenologis Penelitian dilaksanakan di Rumah Sakit PKU Muhammadiyah Slawi, pada tahun 2022. Pengambilan data dilakukan melalui in depth interview. Teknik analisis data yang digunakan pada penelitian ini adalah eksplikasi data. Hasil penelitian, kecemasan yang dialami oleh ibu disebabkan oleh adanya pengalaman buruk dan rasa sakit selama proses persalinan. Rasa cemas mulai dirasakan oleh ibu pada trimester III dan semakin terasa berat ketika memasuki masa persalinan kala I. Ketidaknyamanan fisik yang dialami oleh ibu antara lain merasa tegang, kadang lesu, tidur tidak tenang, mudah kaget atau terkejut, mood swing, mudah gemetar, sering bermimpi buruk, mudah pingsan, gangguan pencernaan (muntah, diare), sering buang air kecil, pusing, mudah berkeringat dan ketidaknyamanan fisik lainnya. Upaya-upaya yang telah dilakukan untuk mengurangi kecemasan yaitu dengan melakukan pemeriksaan rutin ke dokter spesialis kebidanan dan kandungan, mengikuti kelas ibu hamil dan selalu komunikasi dengan suami. Orang yang paling dibutuhkan saat ibu mengalami kecemasan adalah suami, keluarga khususnya ibu, saudara , teman dan penolong persalinan yang sabar. Kesimpulan penelitian adalah perlu adanya pendampingan sejak awal masa kehamilan dan selama persalinan kepada ibu dengan riwayat obstetri buruk sehingga kecemasan yang dialami bisa diatasi dan tidak berlanjut. Dengan adanya pendampingan yang tepat maka rasa cemas dan takut yang dialami dapat dicegah dan tertangani sehingga tidak akan menyebabkan komplikasi pada masa kehamilan dan persalinan selanjutnya.",

      "abstract": "Aspermia can occur as a result of using anti-hypertensive drugs with sympathicolytic activity. Results of studies show that this is probably not due to retrospermia, but rather to an interruption of sperm transport during emission. Medications such as guanethidine can cause long-term aspermia and can be replaced by such drugs as methyldopa which do not cause aspermia as frequently. Impotence has also been reported among users of sympathicolytic agents. Ganglion blockers can cause disturbances in erection and potentia coeundi. Sympathicolytic agents suppress the contractions of the smooth genital canal muscles during ejaculation, which prevents the transportation of the semen. This principle may be useful in developing a male contraceptive. Sexual dysfunction has been reported following lesions of the plexus hypogastricus, upper thoracal transverse lesions, thoracolumbal sympathectomy, and aorto-iliacal or aorto-femoral operations. Retrospermia has been reported as a complication of prostatectomy or other operations on the true pelvis due to an adrenergic innervation of the neck of the bladder. Diabetics can also experience sexual dysfunction caused by autonomous anuropathies.",

Pregnancy can occur by sexual intercourse or assisted reproductive technology. In the pregnancy which lasts about 40 weeks, is grouped into three trimesters. Maternal physiologic adaptations are attributed to the hormones of pregnancy and to mechanical pressures arising from the enlarging uterus and other tissues. These adaptations protect the woman’s normal physiologic functioning, meet the metabolic demands pregnancy imposes on her body, and provide a nurturing environment for foetal development and growth. Although pregnancy is a normal phenomenon, problems can occur. The hormonal and physical changes of pregnancy result in enormous changes in a woman’s body. Enormous amount of estrogen is produced which leads to the discomforts during pregnancy. Common musculoskeletal discomforts are back pain, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, leg cramps, nerve compression syndromes like carpel tunnel syndrome, brachial plexus pain, meralgia paraesthetica, posterior tibial nerve compression, circulatory disorder such as varicose vein in the legs, vulval varicose vein, haemorrhoids, cramp, thrombosis and thrombo embolism, thoracic outlet syndrome, thoracic spine pain, postural back ache, osteoporosis of pregnancy, fatigue, insomnia and nightmares.",

      "abstract": "Menstrual dysfunction characterized by delayed menarche, irregular menses, or secondary amenorrhea often affects women who compete in athletics over a prolonged time. Loss of body fat and emotional stress are important predisposing factors. Under these circumstances, hypoestrogenism, an altered ratio of follicle-stimulating hormone to luteinizing hormone, and elevation of serum testosterone, prolactin, catecholamines, and opioids are fairly common. There is controversy over whether the working capacity and performance of the average woman varies appreciably during various phases of the menstrual cycle. Apparently, those who suffer from premenstrual tension do have a diminution in working capacity. Generally, the causes of menstrual dysfunction are the same for athletes and nonathletes, and there are currently no data to forbid athletes' training at any time during the menses. A gynecologic examination should be done before menstrual dysfunction is considered to be due to physical exercise. If this assumption is substantiated, and if amenorrhea persists for one year or more, a periodic estrogen-progesterone regimen should be offered to minimize vascular problems, osteoporosis, and stress fractures, and to protect the endometrium and ovarian function.",

The peri-menopausal period may last from six months to 10 years (average 3.5 years) and symptoms may vary from nonexistent to severe. Typically periods will become more irregular with changes in frequency, duration or flow. These changes may also be accompanied by vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, sweating), vaginal atrophy or dryness, loss of libido, mood changes, sleep disturbance, loss of concentration, fatigue and other symptoms that impair quality of life.

Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is considered the most aggressive form of endometriosis and is defined as a lesion that penetrates for more than 5 mm under the peritoneal surface. It has been demonstrated that DIE is associated with pelvic pain symptoms, and the intensity of pain is correlated with the depth of infiltration. Other symptoms are dysmenorrhea, deep dyspareunia, and painful defecation and urination. These symptoms are strongly associated with a significant reduction of the quality of life and a marked impairment of sexual function in the affected women.

      "title": "(227) Vaginismus - Current State of Knowledge",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Vaginismus is defined as a penetration disorder in which any form of vaginal penetration is often painful or impossible. It has traditionally been referred to as an involuntary contraction of the pelvic floor muscles due to actual or anticipated pain associated with vaginal penetration. Vaginismus is predominantly unknown among clinicians and women. Vaginismus causes women to feel pain, fear and anxiety with penetration attempts. It is a poorly understood and underdiagnosed condition, for which many women do not gain support. This is due to the lack of knowledge of the condition, for the shame and embarrassment felt by vaginismus sufferers which means many do not discuss the issue. Objective Vaginismus is commonly experienced medical issue, affecting about 1–7% of the female population worldwide. Female pain is often viewed not as a medical fact, but as a misimpression or misinterpretation of bodily events. Vaginismus is not the only condition that has been placed in context of neglect. Other sexual pain disorders, such as vestibulodynia, vulvodynia and dyspareunia, have also been met with doubt and disbelief. An examination of the disbelief surrounding female reportage of their own bodily events will not only be beneficial in terms of perception of vaginismus, but also for general women’s health. Methods This systematic review will provide an assessment of the current state of vaginismus. The following databases has been searched from the study inception to July 2023: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Cochrane Library), PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web Of Science, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, UpToDate, Polish Medical Bibliography and consultations of Polish specialists and discussion forums of patients have been used. Results Vaginismus influences the quality of life, in the most serious form it can result in unconsumated marriage, sterility and thus can lead to the separation of a couple. When adequately approached, the problem can mostly be solved. Treatment often involves multimodal approaches such as education, medication, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy and possibly surgery. Conclusions Vaginismus is a common and significant sexual problem that causes distress and frustration for both partners. There are women for whom vaginismus is a serious problem and who are not able to cope with the situation without professional help of specialists. Deepening the specialists knowledge in this field is essential for successful treatment. Vaginismus is a well recognized clinical condition associated with non-consummation and considerable distress in women. It has received little scientific attention, and further well designed studies are needed. Disclosure No.",

There are insufficient data on its use in organic or psychiatric disease for any evaluations to be made. There are insufficient data on dose, formulation, and consequent relationships of individual pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics for recommendations at present. However, in normal healthy adults over 18 years old, not pregnant or lactating, with no personal or family histories of psychiatric disorder, and unmedicated except for oral contraceptives and minor analgesics (if necessary), the only significant short-term side effect in the author's experience has been sleepiness following oral ingestion of synthetic melatonin (5 mg or less, oral fast release), licensed for human experimental use and for prescription on a named-patient basis.",

Mullerian anomalies are a heterogeneous group of congenital anomalies caused by isolated or complex alterations happening at different stages of embryological development, whether in the formation, channeling, fusion, or absorption of the Mullerian ducts. Women with Müllerian anomalies can be asymptomatic or can present with gynecological symptoms, including pelvic pain and/or presence of a mass due to obstruction of the outflow of menstrual residue with hematocolpos and hematometra, as well as infertility and miscarriage. A septate uterus occurs due a failure in the resorption of the septum resulting from the medial fusion of both Mullerian ducts. There are many causes of pelvic pain. One of the most common causes of pelvic pain is due to the presence of endometriosis. Women with uterine anomalies may also present with pelvic pain caused by adenomyosis.",

Intromission is imperfect if the introitus is abnormally tight or if the erection is weak. An incomplete erection in young men is nearly always psychogenic. Treatment by psychiatrists or urologists does not usually lead to improvement in cervical or vaginal insemination. In such cases of infertility there has been no alternative to artificial insemination, with use of the husband's semen. Since this entails masturbation or the equivalent to secure the specimen it is psychologically undesirable, because the fact of impotence is emphasized. Indeed, some men are unable, after a few trials, to produce an ejaculation. Thus a bad situation has been made worse. During the past six months I have prescribed a prosthetic device for eight husbands who were seldom or never able to effect intromission. The device has been helpful in the following",

      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain, is the most common menstrual symptom among adolescent girls and young women. Most adolescents experiencing dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea, defined as painful menstruation in the absence of pelvic pathology. When the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated. When a patient does not experience clinical improvement for her dysmenorrhea within 3-6 months of therapy initiation, her obstetrician-gynecologist should investigate for possible secondary causes and for treatment adherence. Secondary dysmenorrhea refers to painful menses due to pelvic pathology or a recognized medical condition. Endometriosis is the leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in adolescents. Endometriosis should be considered in patients with persistent, clinically significant dysmenorrhea despite treatment with hormonal agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, particularly if no other etiology for chronic pelvic pain or secondary dysmenorrhea has been identified based on history, physical examination, and pelvic ultrasonography. The appearance of endometriosis may be different in an adolescent than in an adult woman. In adolescents, endometriotic lesions are typically clear or red and can be difficult to identify for gynecologists unfamiliar with endometriosis in adolescents. Endometriosis in adolescents is considered a chronic disease with potential for progression if left untreated. The goals of therapy include symptom relief, suppression of disease progression, and protection of future fertility. Therapy must be individualized, and obstetrician-gynecologists should consider patient choice, the need for contraception, contraindications to hormone use, and potential adverse effects and counsel the adolescent and her family on treatment options.",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis and adenomyosis uteri are the most common benign disorders affecting girls and women after uterine myomas (fibroids), with a prevalence of roughly 5% to 15%. There have been many advances in diagnostic assessment and in our understanding of the disease over the past decade. Steady improvements in treatment have been accompanied by heightened consciousness of the diagnosis among the affected women and the doctors who care for them.A selective literature search was carried out in the Cochrane and PubMed databases using the key words \"endometriosis,\" \"deep infiltrating endometriosis,\" \"endometriosis AND diagnostics,\" \"endometriosis AND surgical therapy,\" \"endometriosis AND endocrine treatment,\" and others. The AWMF and ESHRE guidelines were also taken in account.The main manifestations are primary or secondary dysmenorrhea, bleeding disturbances, infertility, dysuria, pain on defecation (dyschezia), cycle-dependent or (later) cycle-independent pelvic pain, nonspecific cycle-associated gastrointestinal or urogenital symptoms. Cycle-associated problems of urination and/or defecation that are due to endometriosis are most common in young, premenopausal women. Whenever such manifestations are present, endometriosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis, and evidence for it should be sought in the clinical history, physical examination, and ultrasound findings. If endometriosis is histologically confirmed and is of the deeply infiltrating kind, the recommended management today is to refer the patient to an endometriosis center.",

The symptom development is very closely related to the luteal phase indicating the existence of one or more factors during the luteal phase that provoke mental symptoms in sensitive patients. This is further supported by the fact that hysterectomized women with no menstrual bleedings but with the ovarian hormone cycle continue to show cyclical mood changes without having the cycle phase. The nature of the symptom provocating factor is still unknown but the ovarian hormones progesterone and/or estradiol are suspected. This as certain women taking oral contraceptives and sequential postmenopausal estrogen‐progestagen treatment achieve mood changes. Psychological and personality factors are probably also involved, at least in the degree of the mood change and the type of mood experienced.",

In this systematic review we aimed to evaluate its value when ancillary tests are not readily available or when they are equivocal. Suspicion of EP is based on the presence of one or more of the following signs: vaginal bleeding, acute pelvic pain, or any risk factors for EP occurring in a pregnant woman. Detection of early pregnancy by urinary or serum hCG testing must be systematic because neither medical history nor physical examination can rule out early pregnancy with a high level of confidence. No isolated sign has sufficient diagnostic accuracy to rule out EP. In presence of vaginal bleeding without pain and if abdominal and pelvic examination are normal the risk of EP is very low. The presence of spontaneous pain moderate to severe, peritoneal signs, or definite pain during digital cervical mobilization increase the probability of EP. Absence of these signs does not rule out EP but tend to eliminate tubal rupture. In the presence of these signs one may consider an emergency transfer in a specialized center. In their absence, suspicion of EP may have outpatient diagnosis procedures.",

Mothers of pediatric with enuresis observed a lower quality of life, in terms of anxiety and depression, more stress and more intensity of pain than mothers of healthy pediatric. Nocturnal enuresis is characterized as the symptoms of intermittent urinary incontinence during sleep, at a minimum age of five yrs, with a minimum duration of three months, and a minimum of one episode per month. Nocturnal enuresis (night time wetting) is more common in boys. Diurnal enuresis can be characterized as unintended urination in a pediatric old enough to have develop control or uncontrolled passing of urine that occurs after age of five yrs and also when a child who is toilet trained has wetting accidents during the day.

      "title": "Symptomatology of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease during the menstrual cycle",
      "abstract": "Gender-related physiological variations in gastrointestinal (GI) symptomatology have been observed in women of reproductive age. Many women experience cyclical changes in GI symptomatology during their menstrual cycle, particularly alteration in their bowel habits. Physiological studies of healthy women during the menstrual cycle showed a prolonged GI transit time during the luteal phase, either in the oro-cecum route or in the colon. Worsened GI symptoms, such as abdominal pain, bloating or diarrhea are observed in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) during menses. This may be due to elevated prostaglandin levels during menses, with an enhanced perception of viscera-somatic stimuli resulting in nausea, abdominal distension and pain. Also patients with IBS or IBD demonstrate a cyclical pattern more closely related to their bowel habits than healthy controls. Women with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) also have exacerbated symptoms during menses; however, it is unclear whether this relates to physiological variation or disease exacerbation in IBS or IBD. Studies examining the association of the menstrual cycle and GI symptomatology in patients with IBS or IBD, have not yet clarified the underlying mechanisms. Moreover medications—such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral contraceptive pills used for dysmenorrhea and menstrual migraine in those patients have not well been controlled for in the previous studies, which can contribute to further bias. Understanding changes in GI symptomatology during the menstrual cycle may help to determine the true extent of disease exacerbation and proper management strategy.",

      "title": "Succenturiate Placental Lobe Abruption: a placental pathology complicating a dangerous delivery",
      "abstract": "The development of a placenta is a complex process that occurs without a clinically significant issue in most pregnancies. At times, however, the process develops in a way that isolates an island of placental tissue away from the main body, connected only by unprotected vasculature within the amniotic membranes. The vessels of this succenturiate lobe of the placenta are vulnerable both to compression or laceration, threatening the antepartum period with poor weight gain or the peripartum period with fetal distress, hemorrhage or retained products of conception. A majority of the time, this pathology is undiagnosed until recognized innocuously following delivery of the placenta. A placental abruption is a premature separation of the placenta from the uterus that can result in painful bleeding and fetal distress. This increased distress of mother or baby from continued blood loss usually necessitates delivery either vaginally, if stability is maintained, or by cesarean if it isn't. The amount of distress correlates to where and how much of the placenta is affected. While succenturiate lobes of the placenta and placental abruptions are not routinely associated with each other, the abruption of only the succenturiate lobe of the placenta in this instance minimized the severity to the fetus, by allowing the main body of the placenta to remain intact. As the bleeding coagulated at the lobe, maternal well-being was maintained allowing enough time to complete a vaginal delivery.",

In rare cases, a pubic symphysis disruption can occur during the labor, causing severe pain and functional limitations. The early recognition of this injury is crucial to prevent complications and improve clinical and functional outcomes. This study reports an acute symphyseal disruption resulting from childbirth in a primiparous patient who underwent open reduction and internal fixation with plate and screws.

      "title": "Premenstrual Syndrome and Its Effects on Laryngeal Functionality: An Approach for Singers and Pedagogues",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION IT IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED that most women experience at least some of the symptoms of Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS). Symptoms identified by psychologists and doctors in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) include depression, anxiety, emotional sensitivity, irritability, apathy, lethargy or fatigue, increase in appetite and food cravings, insomnia, and a sense of being overwhelmed. There is also a long list of physical symptoms related to PMS-cramps, bloating, breast tenderness, weight gain, and joint and muscle pain. Additionally, it has long been accepted anecdotally that many female singers also experience a variety of difficulties specifically related to their singing while suffering from PMS. European opera houses have offered female singers days on the day prior to and the first day of menses, a practice that has not found currency in the United States. Perhaps a belief has arisen from a variety of sources that difficulties in singing at this time are imagined rather than real. Perhaps the women's movement in America, partially denying fundamental physical differences between men and women, has led female vocalists to believe that they should push through this time period in an effort to not show weakness or differences from their male counterparts. Both of the preceding causes are alluded to by anthropologist Alma Gottlieb in her article on American PMS.1 Perhaps the American belief is that the symptoms are not severe or interruptive enough to address professionally. A possible explanation for the lack of deference the American opera industry has given to women during PMS may be the financial crunches experienced by opera companies that preclude their being able to honor grace days. In addition to financial constraints, the American opera system, with its reliance on the use of guest artists, does not allow for the use of alternate performers or a permanent staff of performing artists who could cover for one another in the case of vocal issues or illness. Whatever the reason, the issue of compromised laryngeal functioning as it relates to PMS has received little attention in America. Nonetheless, it is undeniable that some women acknowledge a variety of physical complaints associated with the onset of menses. Singers and other voice professionals, naturally being more in tune with their voice and vocal function, may notice additional premenstrual symptoms that would not necessarily be identified by individuals without voice training. It is conceivable that if changes taking place hormonally during this time period are affecting tissues throughout the body, the larynx would also be affected. Researchers have begun to recognize that for female professional voice users, there may be special problems during the premenstrual phase and voice complaints that are usually not psychogenic or anxiety-related.2 Historical research also supports the existence of legitimate vocal complaints related to menses. One of the first professional female singers, Caterina Gabrielli, is believed to have suffered from PMS to the extent that she cancelled performances because of her symptoms.3 Based on her personal diaries, researchers now also believe Maria Callas suffered vocal dysphonia because of her menstrual cycle.4 Therefore, since both historical and scientific research is now beginning to confirm what many female singers claim to experience, singers and pedagogues alike should become more aware of this issue so that it can be properly dealt with on the stage and in the studio. More research on this subject is needed in order to equip pedagogues and physicians with additional information and pertinent strategies for helping students and patients deal with the symptoms of PMS affecting their singing. THE STUDIES Reduced laryngeal functioning is a reality for certain women to the extent that researchers have now given it an official name: Premenstrual Voice Syndrome (PMVS). …",

No amount of pelvic floor exercises or aqua-aerobics can guarantee freedom from anal, perianal, and pelvic floor problems either during the many months of pregnancy or in the critical hours of the delivery itself. The female undercarriage—properly called the perineum—is rarely unaffected by pregnancy and vaginal delivery. Most of these problems are transient nuisances only. Some, however, are ongoing sources of discomfort and pain. And, occasionally, problems provoked by a difficult or even traumatic vaginal delivery can cause lasting distress and disability.",

      "title": "Migraine and pregnancy.",
      "abstract": "Female hormones are linked to migraine. Women who have had menstrual migraine and migraine onset at menarche tend to experience no migraine during pregnancy. Not all migraines improve during pregnancy, however. Some women experience migraine for the first time during pregnancy. Migraine developing during pregnancy may indicate an underlying structural or functional disorder, e.g., cerebral aneurysms. Headaches caused by cerebral arteriovenous malformations often present as migraine with aura. Cerebral venous thrombosis (common during pregnancy and the puerperium) may manifest with migraine-like visual disturbance and headache. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension or intracranial hypertension secondary to cerebral venous thrombosis or coincidental brain mass can manifest as a continuous and increasing headache. Physicians need to intensively evaluate such cases to achieve an accurate diagnosis. Spinal procedures linked to delivery can cause a low pressure headache. Oral contraceptive use is linked to migraine. Decreasing estrogen levels appear to precipitate migraine. Estradiol and progesterone therapy for menstrual migraine maintains high estrogen levels during the menstrual epoch, which generally prevents migraine. High but stable estrogen levels prevent migraine. Thus, migraines who do not suffer from migraine during pregnancy benefit from high estrogen levels. Pregnant women with migraine should not take drugs unless the frequency and severity of migraine is life threatening to the mother or fetus. Acetaminophen can be used to relieve pain. Meperidine suppositories can relieve severe pain. Pregnant women should not use aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or vasoconstrictors. Fluid replacement and acceptable antiemetic drugs can treat dehydration and vomiting. Behavioral modification, identification, and elimination of foods that trigger attacks, magnesium supplementation, and low doses of propranolol 3-4 times/day in severe cases may prevent migraine in pregnant women.",

      "abstract": "It is important to pay attention to bone metabolism in women long before the menopause. Irregular menstruation with anovulatory cycles or amenorrhoea persisting over several years have negative effects on bone formation and total bone mass already within a few years after menarche. They lead to a lack of oestradiol and are often associated with inadequate and unbalanced nutrition (e.g. lack of calcium and proteins). This results in severe impairment of bone formation and a net loss of bone mass. It is the duty of the doctors taking care of female athletes (as well as non-athletes) with irregular menstrual cycles or amenorrhoea to protect them against osteoporosis which may manifest itself 2-5 decades later. In the special case of female athletes a reduced bone mass is an important risk factor for stress fractures which can result in interruption or even in a premature termination of promising athletic careers. Athletes with retarded menarche, irregular menstrual cycles, or amenorrhoea must, therefore, be referred to a gynecologist for further diagnosis and treatment.",

Common medical complications during this period include persistent postpartum bleeding, endometritis, urinary incontinence, and thyroid disorders. Breastfeeding education and behavioral counseling may increase breastfeeding continuance. Postpartum depression can cause significant morbidity for the mother and baby; a postnatal depression screening tool may assist in diagnosing depression-related conditions. Decreased libido can affect sexual functioning after a woman gives birth. Physicians should also discuss contraception with postpartum patients, even those who are breastfeeding.

La menopausia es un acontecimiento puntual en la vida de la mujer (el cese de la menstruación), mientras que el climaterio representa un período amplio que puede abarcar los 25-30 años entre la etapa reproductiva y la senectud. Los síntomas y signos del climaterio: sofocos, sudoración nocturna, sequedad, comezón, irritación o secreción vaginal, dolor, molestia durante el sexo, osteoporosis, problemas de control de la vejiga, infecciones de las vías urinarias, depresión, ansiedad, irritabilidad, cambios en el estado de ánimo y problemas para conciliar el sueño. Se recomienda conversar con su médico tratante respecto a los síntomas o malestares que padece con la finalidad de ubicar la alternativa más adecuada para la paciente, para los sofocos se recomienda la hipnosis, la meditación, en relación a los huesos finos, el ejercicio diario con su propio peso corporal como caminar durante 20 a 30 minutos por día o cualquier otra actividad física, tomar suplementos de calcio y/o vitamina D de ser requeridos. Para la resequedad vaginal puede usar humectante o lubricantes en la vagina. Las principales patologías que requieren atención especial en cualquier programa de salud de la mujer por el riesgo de aumento en el climaterio son: osteoporosis, enfermedades cardiovasculares: identificación de los factores de riesgo y su corrección, cáncer, la enseñanza y uso de la autoexploración de las mamas, mamografía periódica.

      "abstract": "Abstract The sex cycles of a chimpanzee were studied for 18 months, during which the animal matured, menstruated four times, conceived, and delivered. Pronounced swelling of the ano‐genital region appeared periodically prior to the first menstruation. During menstrual cycles the swelling endured during most of the period between flows. Genital swelling was always accompanied by estrus; copulation and insemination never occurred during its absence. The animal was alert and active when in estrus, demonstrated non‐sexual affection for the male just prior to the flow, and appeared to be physically distressed during the first days of each flow. There were periodic weight changes coordinated with the animal's menstrual cycles. During pregnancy menstruation ceased, but genital swelling, with accompanying sexual receptivity, continued in irregular cycles. Cyclic changes in the desquamation of the vaginal epithelium occurred during menstrual cycles, were absent during pregnancy. The gestation period was approximately 246 days. At death from puerperal sepsis, 15 days after delivery, the ovaries were in a restin stage, one of them bearing a degenerating corpus luteum. The evidence given indicates that sex‐skin swelling and estrus are similarly controlled, but may occur independently of menstruation, cornification of the vaginal epithelium, or ovulation.",

During the first postoperative year, patient counselling and guidance are necessary aspects of the management of urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. In order to prevent irreversible erectile dysfunction, it is important that the patient resumes sexual activity soon after the operation; if necessary, a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor or intracavernosal injection therapy may be used. Treatment of urinary incontinence in the first postoperative year consists of pelvic floor exercises and guidance on the use of collection devices, penile clamps or condom catheters. If urogenital functional disorders persist after one year, in a way that significantly affects patient's quality of life, the implantation of an erectile prosthesis or - depending on the amount of urine loss - a sling or sphincter prosthesis is indicated.",

Pathophysiological mechanisms are identical: age, which is the most important predictor of sexual dysfunction, prolapse, menopause, hysterectomy, and previous abdominal or perineal surgery. Perineal stretch neuropathy with progressive denervation of striated pelvic sphincter musculature due to repeated stretch injury of peri- neal innervation can determine stress urinary incontinence and sexual disorders (anorgasmia). Urinary incontinence during sexual intercourse is due to increased abdominal pressure, urethral instability, or perineal skin stimulation inducing spinal reflex leading to uninhibited detrusor contraction.

      "abstract": "Puberty is the period of transition from childhood to adulthood characterized by the attainment of adult height and body composition, accrual of bone strength and the acquisition of secondary sexual characteristics, psychosocial maturation and reproductive capacity. In girls, menarche is a late marker of puberty. Primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menarche in ≥ 15-year-old females with developed secondary sexual characteristics and normal growth or in ≥13-year-old females without signs of pubertal development. Furthermore, evaluation for primary amenorrhea should be considered in the absence of menarche 3 years after thelarche (start of breast development) or 5 years after thelarche, if that occurred before the age of 10 years. A variety of disorders in the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis can lead to primary amenorrhea with delayed, arrested or normal pubertal development. Etiologies can be categorized as hypothalamic or pituitary disorders causing hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, gonadal disorders causing hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, disorders of other endocrine glands, and congenital utero-vaginal anomalies. This article gives a comprehensive review of the etiologies, diagnostics and management of primary amenorrhea from the perspective of pediatric endocrinologists and gynecologists. The goals of treatment vary depending on both the etiology and the patient; with timely etiological diagnostics fertility may be attained even in those situations where no curable treatment exists.",

Objetivos: Discutir e analisar, numa perspectiva integral, questoes relativas a sexualidade na formacao do MFC, a partir do relato de 2 casos de vaginismo em pacientes atendidas no Ambulatorio de Saude da Mulher do Programa de Residencia em MFC do Hospital Universitario Pedro Ernesto. Metodologia ou Descricao da Experiencia: E.C., casada, 26 anos, moradora do Borel, com queixa de dificuldade de penetracao ha 10 anos e M.S., solteira, 21 anos, moradora da Barra da Tijuca com relato de insucessos nas tentativas de penetracao vaginal ha 3 meses. Ambas referem dor intensa em todas as tentativas. EC relata algumas relacoes com penetracao mesmo com muita dor e MS revela nunca ter observado seus orgaos sexuais. Ao exame, ambas reagiam com forte contracao involuntaria dos musculos perineais ao menor toque da vulva. O toque digital vaginal revelou incapacidade de perceber os movimentos de contracao/relaxamento dessa musculatura, permitindo o diagnostico diferencial com dispareunia. Resultados: Nas consultas-conjuntas para atendimentos individuais semanais e quinzenais com a supervisao de 2 preceptores (sexologa e fisioterapeuta) e nas consultas mensais com os casais, puderam ser abordados os medos e mitos que mantinham e/ou reforcavam a disfuncao sexual, bem como a relacao dessas mulheres com seus corpos e seus desejos. Foram propostos exercicios de respiracao, conscientizacao corporal e cinesioterapia do assoalho pelvico com objetivos terapeuticos e para a capacitacao profissional da medica residente. A cada encontro era incentivada a busca pela intimidade com o proprio corpo e nas relacoes com o parceiro e reforcados os sucessos alcancados. Conclusao ou Hipoteses: O vaginismo tem abordagens pouco eficientes, tanto pela ausencia de tratamento cirurgico ou medicamentoso quanto pela ma interpretacao da queixa, por parte dos medicos. Embora reconhecido pela dor, a contracao dos musculos perineais precede essa sensacao. Assim, o controle da musculatura, a consciencia dos orgaos sexuais e das sensacoes eroticas sao fundamentais para o sucesso do tratamento.",

A woman is considered to reach menopause when the FSH level in the blood exceeds 40 mIU/ml and the estradiol level is below 30 pg/ml. According to WHO, menopause is the permanent cessation of menstrual cycles caused by the loss of ovarian follicle activity and 12 continuous months of amenorrhea. Menopause complaints in women can include hot flashes, insomnia, dizziness, night sweats, constant headaches, joint pain, feelings of pressure for no reason, pain during intercourse, osteoporosis, vaginal dryness, decreased function of the reproductive system, muscle weakness, breasts that are no longer firm, increased risk of heart disease. The changes in psychological disorders are worry, fear, repetitive thinking, excessive vigilance, anxiety and depression. Changes during menopause include changes in the decrease in the hormones estrogen and progesterone from the ovaries. If the symptoms above are not treated, they can disrupt daily life and never make efforts to deal with the complaints experienced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; This study aims to determine the relationship between menopause characteristics and symptom management efforts in menopausal women.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; This research was conducted using a quantitative approach with a cross-sectional design, using purposive sampling technique and primary data in Banguntapan Village, data analysis techniques using Chi Square statistical tests.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; The number of respondents who have high education and low education is balanced, namely 72 respondents (50.0%), more respondents who have more than one child (multigravida), namely 116 (80.6%), the number of respondents who do not work is 78 (54.2%), the majority of lower income, namely 118 respondents (84.7%), more respondents who have good handling efforts, 128 respondents (88.9%).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; The results of the Chi-square test (x2) indicate a significant relationship between education level and symptom management efforts, as evidenced by a p-value of 0.008, which is less than the significance level of 0.05.

      "abstract": "Ovarian ectopic pregnancy is a rare form of non-tubal ectopic pregnancy. It can rupture before the end of the first trimester, causing hemoperitoneum, and present with signs and symptoms similar to other commoner abdominal emergencies or the pregnancy can continue intraperitoneally. Therefore, they are not often diagnosed preoperatively. Ultrasound can assist in diagnosis of ovarian ectopic pregnancy but the findings could be ambiguous or inconclusive. We present a case of ruptured ovarian ectopic pregnancy at the second trimester causing massive hemoperitoneum that was suspected as an intrabdominal malignancy co-existing with intrabdominal pregnancy.She was a 34 year-old Nigerian unbooked G4P3+0, (3 alive), who presented to the labor ward on 21st January, 2021 with a complaint of a 6-week history of abdominal pain and swelling. Pain was insidious in onset, generalized, non-colicky, non-radiating, constant, no known aggravating or relieving factor, but it was of moderate intensity. She had amenorrhea with a positive serum pregnancy test without prior early ultrasound. At presentation, initial abdominopelvic ultrasound revealed intra-uterine viable pregnancy but repeat ultrasound done showed a left adnexal ectopic gestation and an echo-rich intraperitoneal fluid collection. Laparotomy was done and ovarian pregnancy was accurately diagnosed intra-operatively. Tissue samples from the ovary confirmed normal products of conception, namely chorionic villi, trophoblastic cells and ovarian stroma at histology.Despite advances in imaging techniques, the diagnosis of ovarian ectopic gestation is still very difficult. When premenopausal women present with amenorrhea, generalized non-colicky abdominal pain and swelling in combination with ambiguous findings of pregnancy on ultrasound in the absence of trauma, differential diagnoses should include ruptured ovarian pregnancy. Obstetricians should maintain a high index of suspicion to forestall delayed diagnosis and the potential maternal morbidity and mortality. However, the need for high-index of suspicion should be for any ectopic, not just ovarian pregnancy.",

Even if there is a smallest damage to the EGO region, the man needs to consult the urologist in the out-patient or in-patient medical institution.

      "title": "The use of prostaglandin inhibitors for the premenstrual syndrome.",
      "abstract": "The premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a complex of symptoms that usually occurs seven to ten days before menses in large numbers of women. These symptoms typically cease during the 24 hours after the onset of menses. PMS affects many areas of the body, with each afflicted woman having her personal set of symptoms. Frequently encountered signs and symptoms include breast tenderness and swelling, weight gain, headache, abdominal cramping and bloating, food cravings, thirst, nausea, joint pain, acne, dizziness, hyperalgesia and one or more psychologic symptoms: irritability, lethargy and fatigue, depression, anxiety, hostility and aggression. Theories relating PMS to hormonal imbalance, vitamin deficiency or psychosomatic aberration have failed to explain this condition fully. Treatments using hormones, vitamins, oral contraceptives or diuretics have failed to relieve all the symptoms of PMS. The prostaglandin (PG) theory proposes that these nearly ubiquitous substances, produced in pathophysiologic amounts in brain, breast, gastrointestinal tract, kidney and reproductive tract, can trigger many of the PMS symptoms. If that is true, then a PG inhibitor could counteract excessive PG production and successfully control those PMS symptoms related to prostaglandin excess or imbalance. Therapy based upon this theory can proceed to the use of PG inhibitors in conservative steps. First, permanent deletion of xanthine-containing beverages (coffee, tea, cola and chocolate) from the diet can reduce nervousness, irritability and breast tenderness. Luteal phase salt restriction, with a mild diuretic used if necessary the last week before menses, adds to this effect. For the 20-25% of women who need more help, either a PG inhibitor or natural progesterone (to oppose the action of PGs), given when PMS begins, brings relief. In women with depressive PMS complaints, small daily doses of an antidepressant may prove helpful.",

Recent studies suggest that physical activity has a beneficial effect on the perception of pain and the quality of life of women, if it is adapted to physical abilities, avoiding high-intensity sports during painful periods. Regular adapted physical activity combining endurance, stretching and flexibility at a light to moderate intensity, should allow a physical and psychological well-being for women with endometriosis in association with medical and/or surgical treatment.",

      "abstract": "Climacteric and menopause are two terms that are indistinctly used to name clinical expected events related to the decline in ovarian function. Thus, in the literature and in clinical settings we read and hear 'menopausal symptoms' or 'climacterics symptoms'. Globally, the term menopause is much more frequently used than climacteric but, before we use either one, we should consider that 'menopause' is referring to a specific event, the cessation of menses, and 'climacteric' to gradual changes of ovarian function that start before the menopause and continue thereafter for a while. In the premenopause period, hormonal changes will take place that are associated with symptoms, which deteriorate the quality of life, and with metabolic changes which increase the risk of chronic diseases. Therefore, the word climacteric ('steps' in Greek) seems more adequate to refer to the symptoms and chronic diseases associated with the gradual decrease of ovarian function, and we should leave the term 'menopause' only for naming the event of cessation of menstruation that will happen later as the consequence of the decline in ovarian activity. This differentiation has clinical importance, because it implies that, during the premenopausal period, the impact that the decrease in estrogen has on the health status of women must be assessed and, if it is pertinent, we should indicate lifestyle changes, hormonal therapy, hypolipidemic drugs, etc. It does not seem proper to wait for the cessation of menstrual bleeding before some intervention is started. The decay of women's health starts many years before menopause and prevention of its consequences is a must for us, the clinicians.",

      "title": "Postpartum Women with Urinary Incontinence and Low Back Pain",
      "abstract": "Background: Many women have urinary Incontinence after giving birth. Approximately 36%-44% of postpartum women have urine incontinence symptoms (UI). Incontinence in the postpartum period is often caused by damage to the urethra, the bladder, the nerves that control bladder function, malfunction in the pelvic floor muscles, or all four. Vesical denervation likely causes UI in women who have had a cesarean section by making the detrusor muscle unstable. F.Factors, Surgical Vaginal Birth, and Prenatal Bladder Neck movement owing to dysfunctional Pelvic Floor Muscles (PFM) and weakened Connective Tissue are further risk factors for the development of UI. Joint laxity, weakening of Connective Tissue, Loosened Ligaments and Stretched Abdominal Muscles from the growing uterus all contribute to the typical occurrence of lower back pain (LBP) in women after childbirth. It has been shown that postpartum women who experience low back pain and UI often do so together. Objective: This study aims to determine whether or not Urine Incontinence and Low Back Pain are related in Postpartum Women. Methodology: the study was conducted in Department of Urology at Lady Reading Hospital (LRH) Quota sampling was employed for this analysis. One group consisted of women with low back discomfort after delivery, whereas the other did not. In order to investigate the correlation between UI severity and LBP, participants were given UI questionnaires. Self-administered questionnaires were made available to respondents in English. Because some participants could not read the questionnaires, we had to collect the information from them verbally. Results: Fisher's exact test was used to look at the distribution of ICIQ-UI scores; the p-value was &gt; 0.05 therefore the null hypothesis was not rejected. This meant that there was no correlation between urinary Incontinence and Lower back pain in women postpartum. Conclusion: This Study concludes disproving the hypothesis that UI and postpartum women experiencing low back discomfort. Keywords: Urinary Incontinence UI), Low Back Pain (LBP), Post Partum period.

It is a condition which is highly prevalent and distressing for patients, yet is often underdiagnosed and undertreated and proves challenging to health care providers. Traditionally, female sexual pain disorder was divided into two categories, dyspareunia and vaginismus. Most recently, these categories have been combined with a new definition ‘genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder’ as described later in this manuscript. Sexual pain disorders often have a biological, psychosexual and functional component. Attention should be focussed on the predisposing, precipitating and maintaining factors of the condition.

POI aetiology may be related to iatrogenic or endogenous factors and in many cases remains unclear. The aim of this review was to characterize the long-term consequences of POI. The available literature regarding the long-term consequences of POI from MEDLINE has been reviewed. Lack of ovarian steroids synthesis has serious consequences for women's health. The short-term effects are similar to spontaneous menopause and refer mainly to the climacteric syndrome. In a longer perspective, POI affects a variety of aspects. It obviously and drastically reduces the chances for spontaneous pregnancies. Oestrogen loss leads also to urogenital atrophy. The most common urogenital symptoms include vaginal dryness, vaginal irritation and itching. The urogenital atrophy and hypoestrogenism interferes also with sexual functioning. Patients with POI are threatened by a decrease in bone mineral density (BMD). POI women also experience psychological distress and some studies have shown an increased risk of neurodegenerating diseases. Overall, POI women have a shortened life expectancy, mainly due to cardiovascular disease. Some studies have reported a reduced risk of breast cancer in this group of patients. In conclusion there are several well-characterized health risks in POI women. With every patient, an individualized approach is required to properly recognize and prevent these risks.",

Objective: To assess prevalence, magnitude and possible factors associated with postpartum perineum pain in a sample of women in the Hospital “La Victoria-Instituto Materno Infantil”, in Bogotá. Materials and methods: A prospective observational study was performed where the degree of perineum pain perceived by 133 postpartum patients was evaluated by using numerical analog scale of pain when they were sitting down, lying, walking and going to the bathroom (urination and/or defecation), at 12 and 48 hours of postpartum . Demographic, birth and newborn data were taken directly from the medical records. Results: Overall prevalence of moderate to severe perineum pain 36 to 39.5% depending on the activity at 12 hours of delivery, and since 28 to 31.6% at 48 hours after it. Perineum pain was associated, during any of the activities assessed, with the use of epidural analgesia during labor, laceration of degree II or greater, birth weight and head circumference of the newborn. Better analgesic effect of acetaminophen doses as 3 g per day or more was registered. Conclusions: Moderate to severe perineum pain affects less than 50 % of women with vaginal postpartum. It is associated with the frequency and degree of perineum trauma. The results suggest the need for further study of the most appropriate analgesic doses for these patients.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Pelvic Girdle Pain in the Postpartum Population",
      "abstract": "Background: Pelvic girdle pain (PGP) is defined as pain experienced between the posterior iliac crest and the gluteal fold, particularly in the vicinity of the sacroiliac joint. Pelvic girdle pain is common postpartum, may result from pregnancy-related factors, and is a leading cause of disability postpartum. The purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for physical therapist management of PGP in the postpartum population. Key Points: Postpartum individuals may experience PGP beginning during pregnancy, immediately after childbirth, or up to 2 years after delivery. Although most cases of PGP in pregnancy resolve spontaneously, a subset of postpartum individuals may experience persistent pain. Based upon critical appraisal of literature and expert opinion, 23 action statements for risk factors, systems screening, examination, diagnosis, prognosis, theoretical models of care, and intervention for postpartum individuals with PGP are linked with explicit levels of evidence. A significant body of evidence exists to support physical therapist intervention with postpartum clients with PGP to reduce pain and disability. Emerging evidence suggests that further investigation of biopsychosocial factors is warranted, especially factors that influence the development of persistent pain in the postpartum population. Future research is needed in several areas to optimize examination and intervention strategies specific to postpartum individuals and guided by a classification system for PGP that includes elements of pain, movement, and biopsychosocial factors. The authors provide clinical practice guidelines for providing physical therapy to postpartum individuals with PGP.",

Although a few women may have ambivalent feelings or feelings of guilt, most have a sense of relief and other positive reactions. However, the emotional response of a woman and her family to therapeutic abortion is complicated. A number of factors may help identify women at risk of emotional difficulty and depressive symptoms after abortion. Women who terminate their pregnancy during the second trimester, have a history of multiple abortions, have preexisting psychiatric problems or perceive a lack of support at home are more likely to have emotional difficulty. Women who have an abortion for medical or genetic reasons are at increased risk of developing depressive symptoms.",

The ageing process is known to increase the prevalence of sexual dysfunction. Female sexual dysfunction prevalence is quite high, range from 38-85.2%. Sexual disorders can take many forms and clinical symptoms. &#x0D; Circulating estrogen levels have been shown to influence sexual desire, activity, experiences, and problems in sexually active postmenopausal women. Deficiency of estrogen will cause vaginal atrophy which can affect sexual dysfunction. Many factors influence sexual dysfunction, both biological and psychological, in postmenopausal women.

      "abstract": "Disfiguring and mutilating operations, especially of the face, breasts, genitals, and reproductive organs, often have a deleterious effect on a woman's self image and sexuality. Sociopsychological aspects of body image form a complex pattern of self knowledge and how one is perceived by others. The invasion of surgery invariably causes temporary or permanent changes, which may not be anticipated by women or may emerge only on discharge from hospital. Partners who adapt poorly to the new circumstances may also find it difficult to continue sexual activity, but an existing strong and intimate relationship encourages positive postoperative adjustment. Dealing with psychological and emotional states such as anxiety, fear, and depression about surgery is crucial to a woman and her partner. Medical teams should encourage women to discuss their worries, especially sexual anxieties, as problems become more entrenched and more difficult to treat over time. Postoperative surveys of women suggest that 28-50% wanted their doctor to address sexual difficulties. Rehabilitation is important in promoting adjustment and acceptance by facilitating the grieving process. Women who have a stoma as a result of chronic illness such as irritable bowel disorder, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease often experience a better psychological and sexual outcome than do those who undergo emergency surgery for, say, cancer of the colon. Healthy adaptation to a stoma depends on preoperative and postoperative counselling and understanding by stoma nurses. Patients' greatest fears are loss of control, bad odour, noise, leaking or bursting bags, unsightliness, and their partner's feelings towards them. ### Factors affecting sexual function after an operation",

Rather than a blissful time, it may be one of ambivalence and emotional lability. Pregnancy is not a protected time, as depression, anxiety, and psychotic illness may all occur during this time. The risks increase if there has been a previous personal or family history, increased stress, and decreased support, or if the woman discontinues her psychotropic medication. Psychiatric illness during pregnancy predisposes her to problems postpartum. The postpartum period is the time in a woman’s life when she is most likely to develop a depression or require a hospital admission for psychiatric reasons. Effective treatment can prevent ongoing problems for the woman, her partner, and the infant.",

Especially is the first child to be decisive for the stability of the pelvic floor.During pregnancy, the progressive increase in volume of the uterus subject perineal structures to a major overload.

Understanding these injuries is vital to preserving the health and well-being of the dam and the offspring as well as the dam's future fertility. Among prepartum injuries, a vaginal prolapse can occur with or without involvement of the cervix and is ascribed to many factors like hereditary, elevated estrogen (a relaxed pelvic diaphragm and vagina), severe straining, increased intra-abdominal pressure, mineral deficiency, extreme cold etc. Most ventral abdominal hernias and tears in the prepubic muscle happen in the last month of pregnancy, the weight of a gravid uterus and peripartum swelling of the ventrum are two main contributing factors. Perineal laceration, uterine rupture, and calving paralysis occur during parturition, whereas uterine prolapse, vaginal cystocele, etc. mainly occur after postpartum. A battery of approaches that are surgical, medicinal, and conservative can be used to manage different types of birth canal injuries. Prognosis depends upon the duration, severity, and promptness of treatment. The health and well-being of both the dam and the offspring as well as the dam's future fertility can be preserved using proper technique and speedy attendance to the case.",

      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain, is the most common menstrual symptom among adolescent girls and young women. Most adolescents experiencing dysmenorrhea have primary dysmenorrhea, defined as painful menstruation in the absence of pelvic pathology. When the patient's history suggests primary dysmenorrhea, empiric treatment should be initiated. When a patient does not experience clinical improvement for her dysmenorrhea within 3-6 months of therapy initiation, her obstetrician-gynecologist should investigate for possible secondary causes and for treatment adherence. Secondary dysmenorrhea refers to painful menses due to pelvic pathology or a recognized medical condition. Endometriosis is the leading cause of secondary dysmenorrhea in adolescents. Endometriosis should be considered in patients with persistent, clinically significant dysmenorrhea despite treatment with hormonal agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, particularly if no other etiology for chronic pelvic pain or secondary dysmenorrhea has been identified based on history, physical examination, and pelvic ultrasonography. The appearance of endometriosis may be different in an adolescent than in an adult woman. In adolescents, endometriotic lesions are typically clear or red and can be difficult to identify for gynecologists unfamiliar with endometriosis in adolescents. Endometriosis in adolescents is considered a chronic disease with potential for progression if left untreated. The goals of therapy include symptom relief, suppression of disease progression, and protection of future fertility. Therapy must be individualized, and obstetrician-gynecologists should consider patient choice, the need for contraception, contraindications to hormone use, and potential adverse effects and counsel the adolescent and her family on treatment options.",

      "title": "[Management of abnormal bleeding in an intrauterine device user].",
      "abstract": "Abnormal uterine bleeding is the most common complication of IUD use. Minor metrorrhagia during the insertion and the initial 2 or 3 cycles is common and has no pathological significance. The true complications are menorrhagia, or augmentation of the volume of blood, and metrorrhagia, or repeated intermenstrual bleeding. Inert IUDs increase the volume of menstrual blood loss by 100-140% and copper devices by 50-60%. Blood loss is directly related to the size and form of the IUD; copper devices cause less bleeding primarily because of their reduced surface area. Anemia secondary to menstrual problems is a serious problem in developing countries. Metrorrhagia in IUD users is often associated with pain and may lead to removal of the device. It may result from the same array of morphological and functional modifications of the endometrium as menorrhagia, but more often it signals a true complication, either utero-adnexal infection, an intra- or extrauterine pregnancy or spontaneous abortion, or an inadaptation to the uterine cavity or a displacement of the IUD, perhaps with perforation. Metrorrhagia may also result from appearance of a calcium deposit on the surface of an IUD in place for over 2 years, or it may reveal a pathology unrelated to the IUD, such as a myoma, polyp, endometrial hyperplasia, or adenomyosis. Menorrhagia is an almost inevitable consequence of IUD use, but metrorrhagia requires close surveillance. A clinical examination aided by diagnostic tests is needed to distinguish between complications requiring immediate treatment and simple intolerances that may spontaneously resolve. Sonography is indispensable, to confirm good placement of the IUD or to rule out uterine anomalies or pregnancy. Hysteroscopy can be performed with the IUD in place or not, to diagnose localized endometrial hyperplasias, polyps, poorly positioned IUDs, or partial or complete perforations. Hysterography after infection and pregnancy have been ruled out can reveal endocavity pathology, uterine malformation, poorly positioned IUD, or possible perforation, but many practitioners prefer hysteroscopy. In most cases, spotting and menorrhagia result from inflammatory responses of the endometrium to the foreign body represented by the IUD. Antifibrinolytics, vascular protectors, or perhaps progestins such as lynestrenol may be used to reduce bleeding. Prostaglandin inhibitors may be used only during menstruation. A progesterone-releasing IUD ma reduce menstrual volume by 40-50%, sometimes at the cost of several months of amenorrhea, but the total number of days of bleeding may be increased. If there is no improvement with these measures, the IUD should be removed and systematically cultured. A difficult removal may signal perforation, in which case the device should be laparoscopically removed.",

In general, during pregnancy there is a decrease in sexual desire, frequency of intercourse, and capacity for orgasm and sexual satisfaction, with these changes being more evident in the first and third trimesters and less so in the second. In the postnatal period hormonal changes involve a decrease in sex hormones due to the release of prolactin for breastfeeding. This can have a negative influence on libido and the emotional state in general, but also in the genital region, causing atrophy of the vaginal epithelium, which is thinner and more fragile, with less lubrication capacity. The prevalence of postpartum sexual dysfunction is frequent. Pain is the most frequent symptom, together with low libido. The main contributing factors are perineal trauma, breastfeeding, postnatal depression, fatigue, and sleep deprivation disorders, as well as changes in body image. Individualized assessment of women must be done at 6–8 weeks postpartum, allowing the implementation of specific techniques for pelvic floor recovery, and thus contributing to the prevention of future pelvic floor dysfunction.",

This often results in pain with attempts at sex. Often it begins when sexual intercourse is first attempted. This reaction is completely inhospitable and uncontrollable and prevents any foreign object from entering, even the finger or tampon to the vagina. Vaginismus can lead to sexual impairment, emotional disturbances and marital disharmony. This research includes a series of cases of Malaysian women, who had been suffering from vaginismus and infertility. There was no history of traumatic sexual experience or any major psychiatric illness in these patients and majority of the patients had prominent symptoms of anxiety. They had unique psychological features, which require psychological interventions. Generally there is a relation between infertility and vaginismus but in some cases, shows that pregnancy was still possible despite the women suffering from vaginismus and can still have vaginal delivery. The underlying cause is generally a fear that penetration will hurt. It is thought to be more prevalent in younger women, women with negative attitudes towards sex and those with a history of sexual abuse. Treatment may include behavior therapy such as breathing exercises and relaxation techniques assist in overcoming sexual anxieties.",

      "abstract": "Introduction During menstruation, almost all women have experienced discomfort such as the cramping pain in the lower abdomen accompanied by nausea, dizziness, and even fainting. Dysmenorrhea is a physical disorder in women occurring just before or during menstruation characterised by cramping pain, in the absence of other diseases such as endometriosis. Primary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain that occurs without any anatomical abnormalities of the genitals. The prevalence rates of this disease are high, and the initial presentation of primary dysmenorrhea typically occurs in adolescence. Method The research was conductedbased on the authority of midwives by utilizing the 7-stages of Varney management approach. Result The results of this study indicated that there were no serious obstacles found during the conduct of primariy dysmenorrhea care and treatment to Ms. “E”. The patient was advised to have an adequate rest and to do regular and aerobic exercises so that her menstrual pain and her primary dysmenorrhea could be reduced. After the treatment, care, and regular monitoring process, it was evident from this research that the menstrual blood and pain of the patient was reduced. Conclusion Based on the 7-stages of Varney management approach and SOAP documentation procedure used in this research, it could be concluded that the condition of the patient was normal in which no complications were found. After the treatment, there were no more pain felt by the patient, and all the vital signs of the patient were within normal. In this case, the medical staff and midwives play an important role in the success of the care and treatment to the patient.&#x0D;",

      "abstract": "Pregnancy is often a life-changing experience for a woman where she experiences so many different ‘feelings’, both physically and psychologically. Most primigravidas will experience ‘aches and aches’ during pregnancy. For some, these aches and pains will be numerous, varied and may interfere with bodily functions. Perhaps because of these factors, and because pregnancy and birth are ‘unknown’ experiences, the so-called ‘mild ailments’ of pregnancy can be considered very important to the woman herself. Much of this discomfort can be directly related to the physical changes that occur during pregnancy and the biomechanical effects that these have on functional movement. The enlarging uterus and its contents can give rise to experiences of discomfort or pain such as ‘pulling, pressing and pushing’. Some women describe ‘sharp stabbing pains’ or a feeling of ‘falling’. Understanding the physical and biomechanical changes that occur is an important part of a ‘coping strategy’. Often, a clear explanation, and a consistent understanding, of the reasons behind the symptoms will in most cases be enough to allow the expectant mother to ‘manage’ and cope with them. This community service was carried out with the aim of increasing mothers’ awareness of discomfort in pregnant women through the educational video APA NYAMIL (I Understand Pregnancy Discomfort). The method used in this community service was the lecture and independent methods. Before and after the educational video was given, the respondents’ level of knowledge regarding discomfort in pregnancy was measured. This community service activity helped mothers to know their level of knowledge regarding discomfort and provided knowledge to mothers regarding discomfort in pregnancy so that it was hoped that mothers could cope with it well. ABSTRAK Kehamilan sering kali menjadi pengalaman pertama kali dalam hidup seorang wanita Dimana Wanita tersebut mengalami begitu banyak ‘perasaan’ yang berbeda, baik secara fisik maupun psikologis. Sebagian besar primigravida akan mengalami ‘rasa sakit dan nyeri’ selama kehamilan. Bagi sebagian orang, rasa sakit dan nyeri ini akan sangat banyak, bervariasi, dan mungkin mengganggu fungsi tubuh. Mungkin karena faktor-faktor ini, dan karena kehamilan dan kelahiran adalah pengalaman yang ‘tidak diketahui’, apa yang disebut ‘penyakit ringan’ kehamilan dapat dianggap sangat penting bagi wanita itu sendiri. Sebagian besar ketidaknyamanan ini dapat secara langsung terkait dengan perubahan fisik yang terjadi selama kehamilan dan efek biomekanik yang diakibatkannya pada gerakan fungsional. Rahim yang membesar dan isinya dapat menimbulkan pengalaman ketidaknyamanan atau rasa sakit seperti ‘ditarik, ditekan, dan didorong’. Beberapa wanita menggambarkan ‘rasa sakit yang menusuk tajam’ atau perasaan ‘jatuh’. Pemahaman tentang perubahan fisik dan biomekanik yang terjadi merupakan bagian penting dari ‘strategi penanggulangan’. Sering kali, penjelasan yang jelas, dan pemahaman yang konsekuen, tentang alasan di balik gejala-gejala tersebut dalam sebagian besar kasus akan cukup untuk memungkinkan calon ibu untuk ‘mengelola’ dan mengatasinya. Pengabdian kepada masyarakat ini dilakukan dengan tujuan untuk meningkatkan kesadaran ibu tentang ketidaknyamanan pada ibu hamil video edukasi APA NYAMIL (Aku Paham Ketidaknyamanan Kehamilan). Metode yang digunakan dalam pengabdian masyarakat ini adalah menggunakan metode ceramah dan mandiri. Sebelum dan sesudah diberikan video edukasi responden dilakukan pengukuran tingkat pengetahuan ibu mengenai ketidaknyamanan pada kehamilan. Kegiatan pengabdian kepada masyarakat ini membantu ibu untuk mengetahui tingkat pengetahuannya mengenai ketidaknyamanan dan memberikan pengetahuan kepada ibu mengenai ketidaknyamanan pada kehamilan sehingga diharapkan ibu dapat mengatasinya dengan baik.",

      "abstract": "Meconium passage in newborn infants is a developmentally programmed event normally occurring within the first 24 to 48 hours after birth. Intrauterine meconium passage in near-term or term fetuses has been associated with fetomaternal stress factors and/or infection, whereas meconium passage in postterm pregnancies has been attributed to gastrointestinal maturation. Despite these clinical impressions, little information is available on the mechanism(s) underlying the normal meconium passage that occurs immediately after birth or during the intrauterine period of fetal development. Birth itself is a stressful process and it is possible that fetal stress-mediated biochemical events may regulate the meconium passage occurring either during labor or after birth. Aspiration of meconium during intrauterine life may result in or contribute to meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), representing a continued leading cause of perinatal death. This article reviews aspects of meconium passage in utero, its consequences, and management.",

It is believed they start around 6 weeks gestation but usually are not felt until the second or third trimester of the pregnancy. Braxton Hicks contractions are the body's way of preparing for true labor, but they do not indicate that labor has begun or is going to start.Braxton Hicks contractions are a normal part of pregnancy. They may be uncomfortable, but they are not painful. Women describe Braxton Hicks contractions as feeling like mild menstrual cramps or a tightening in a specific area of the abdomen that comes and goes.Braxton Hicks contractions can be differentiated from the contractions of true labor. Braxton Hicks contractions are irregular in duration and intensity, occur infrequently, are unpredictable and non-rhythmic, and are more uncomfortable than painful. Unlike true labor contractions, Braxton Hicks contractions do not increase in frequency, duration, or intensity. Also, they lessen and then disappear, only to reappear at some time in the future. Braxton Hicks contractions tend to increase in frequency and intensity near the end of the pregnancy. Women often mistake Braxton Hicks contractions for true labor. However, unlike true labor contractions, Braxton Hicks contractions do not cause dilatation of the cervix and do not culminate in birth.",

Abortion is a word-wide phenomenon linked to different aspects of public health. Although negative consequences are assumed to occur after abortion, most of the women who decide to terminate their pregnancy show several signs of relief. For instance, a decrease of signs of anxiety and depression may occur during the first month after abortion. Actually, the critical moment is the pre-abortion period. In this phase, most of the psychiatric and psychologic manifestations take place. Moreover, recent studies reinforce the importance to address the consequences of abortion with a multidisciplinary approach integrating somatic and psychologic components.",

Many studies have shown that if the mother is stressed, anxious, or depressed during pregnancy, this increases the risk of a range of physical and neurodevelopmental problems for the child, even after allowing for relevant confounders. There is also strong evidence concerning the impact of both maternal and paternal anxiety and depression on parent–infant interaction in the postnatal period. Although there is good evidence for interventions that reduce depression and anxiety during the perinatal period for women, less is currently known about effective interventions for men or effective methods of prevention more generally. Overall, the evidence points to the importance of starting interventions in pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Co-morbidity between urological disorders, overactive bladder and urge incontinence first, and female sexual dysfunctions (FSD) is still underdiagnosed in clinical practice, in spite of data in- dicating an extremely high association between the two conditions. Latent class analysis of sexual dysfunctions by risk factors in women indicate that lower urinary tract symptoms have a RR= 4.02 (2.75- 5.89) of being associated with arousal disorders and a RR=7.61 (4.06-14.26) of being associated with sexual pain disorders. Clinical history focusing on prepubertal signs and symptoms of overactive bladder (enuresis, nocturia, daily symptoms) indicate that 2.3% of women currently suffering of urge incontinence do report these early symptoms when actively asked for. Pathophysiological factors under- lying co-morbidity between urge incontinence and FSD may begin in early infancy or adolescence. Estrogens may attenuate bladder' vul- nerability at puberty. Their loss at menopause may re-trigger bladder overactivity, which remains borderline across the fertile age. Higher clinical and research attention is needed to further substantiate this preliminary finding and improve life-span designed preventive and therapeutic measures.

      "title": "Postmenopausal endometriosis: a challenging condition beyond menopause",
      "abstract": "Abstract Importance and Objective Postmenopausal endometriosis is a complex condition that challenges the conventional belief that endometriosis resolves with menopause. Despite the cessation of menstruation, a subset of women continues to experience or develop endometriosis-related symptoms during the postmenopausal period. Thus, this review aimed to shed light on postmenopausal endometriosis, exploring its clinical features, diagnostic considerations, management approaches, and the potential impact on women's health. Methods PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used for the research, with only articles in English language, using the following terms: “postmenopausal endometriosis,” “menopause,” “management,” “treatment,” and “quality of life,” from inception to 2023. Discussion and Conclusion The clinical features of postmenopausal endometriosis include persistent or recurrent pelvic pain, dyspareunia, bowel, or urinary symptoms and, occasionally, abnormal vaginal bleeding. The absence of menstrual cycles presents a diagnostic challenge, as the traditional diagnostic criteria for endometriosis rely on menstrual patterns. Visual cues may be less evident, and the symptoms often overlap with other gynecological conditions, necessitating a thorough evaluation to differentiate postmenopausal endometriosis from other potential causes. Management approaches for postmenopausal endometriosis encompass surgical intervention, hormonal therapies, pain management, and individualized care. Postmenopausal endometriosis significantly impacts the quality of life, sexual health, and long-term well-being of women. Understanding the clinical features, diagnostic challenges, and management approaches of postmenopausal endometriosis is crucial for healthcare professionals to provide effective care and to improve the quality of life of women affected by this condition.",

      "abstract": "Although vasectomy is technically a simple and minor operation, the procedure is major from a psychological and physiological point of view. It is important that the patient weigh carefully the consequences of vasectomy after having been adequately counseled by a skilled and trained person. Ideally, the couple should appear together during the counseling session as fertility control involves a couple. The motivation for such a permanent form of contraception as vasectomy should be established early in the interview because it reflects the couple's depth of thinking and emotional maturity. Well-motivated individuals would have considered many if not all of the following areas: 1) family size is complete, or they have low or negative parental desires; 2) age, financial and medical reasons; 3) lack of confidence in or dislike of other contraceptive methods; and 4) assumption of contraceptive responsibility by the male partner. Unrealistic motivations include 1) perception of vasectomy as a solution to chronic or deep-seated sexual problems within himself or within the marriage; 2) pressure from the wife for the man to have a vasectomy; and 3) frail masculine image or hypochondria. After the patient's motivation has been established, the doctor should explain the procedure and its attendant short-term and long-term side effects. Patient motivation is the evaluation key to success in sterilization cases. A reasonable motivation correlates with the individual's later emotional and psychological health.",

      "abstract": "Lumbopelvic pain associated with pregnancy may originate from the lumbar spine, the pelvic girdle or may be mixed. According to European guidelines, individual subtypes of pain require different procedures, for which a detailed differential diagnosis is necessary. These ailments arouse a lot of controversy. The aim of the work was to present the current state of knowledge on the aforementioned ailments, including European guidelines and the latest trends in foreign literature. The diagnosis of lumbopelvic pain, with particular emphasis on the pathophysiology and methods of differentiation of both pain syndromes, was discussed. Lumbar spine pain is mainly related to the mechanical load caused by a pregnant uterus. In the case of pelvic girdle pain, the main cause is the disorder of optimal stability, which depends on the correct mechanisms of force and form closure. Pelvic girdle pain is characterized by other clinical symptoms and risk factors, it also often remains after pregnancy, having negative impact on the daily functioning of a woman even years after giving birth. Depending on the location (one or both sacroiliac joints, pubic symphysis), several types of this pain syndrome are distinguished. The worst prognosis is pelvic pain associated with the involvement of all three joints at the same time. Until now, this term has not been more widely used in the Polish-language literature. The complexity of chronic pain syndromes, in which the discomforts of the pregnancy period may develop, entails the necessity of early identifi cation and deliberate action. Knowledge of the etiopathogenesis of these ailments is a prerequisite for therapeutic success. Introduction of terminology popular in foreign literature will improve treatment of these diseases, adapting it to current standards and will also enable better exchange of experience between professionals. pelvic girdle pain, lumbar pain, pregnancy",

      "abstract": "Adverse effects of hormonal contraceptives usually diminish with continued use of the same method. Often, physi- cians only need to reassure patients that these symptoms will likely resolve within three to five months. Long-acting injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is the only hormonal contraceptive that is consistently associated with weight gain; other hormonal methods are unlikely to increase weight independent of lifestyle choices. Switching com- bined oral contraceptives is not effective in treating headaches, nor is the use of multivitamins or diuretics. There are no significant differences among various combined oral contraceptives in terms of breast tenderness, mood changes, and nausea. Breakthrough bleeding is common in the first months of combined oral contraceptive use. If significant abnormal bleeding persists beyond three months, other methods can be considered, and the patient may need to be evaluated for other causes. Studies of adverse sexual effects in women using hormonal contraceptives are inconsistent, and the pharmacologic basis for these symptoms is unclear. If acne develops or worsens with progestin-only contra- ceptives, the patient should be switched to a combination method if she is medically eligible. There is insufficient evidence of any effect of hormonal contraceptives on breast milk quantity and quality. Patient education should be encouraged to decrease the chance of unanticipated adverse effects. Women can also be assessed for medical eligibility before and during the use of hormonal contraceptives.",

Ectopic pregnancies are also known as tubal pregnancies, these in turn can cause an acute abdomen with vital compromise of the patient if not intervened in a timely manner. Objectives: To describe nursing care in complicated ectopic pregnancy. Methodology: A qualitative study was carried out, with a unique clinical case design based on the Nursing Care process (PAE), applying Maryori Gordon's functional pattern assessment guide as an instrument to a 34-year-old obstetric patient. Results: 7 nursing diagnoses were identified, of which the diagnosis was prioritized. Acute pain r/c physical injurious agents’ m/p facial expression of pain, expressive behavior. The interventions performed were satisfactory, the patient was able to reduce the intensity of pain; however, in the case of hemorrhage, the results are still indefinite due to the few hours of intervention and evaluation. Conclusions: The clinical characteristics of the patient corresponding to complicated ectopic pregnancy and the risk factors that increase possible complications were identified. The care was administered observing improvement in the altered patterns, all framed in the nursing process and thus allowing us to provide timely and quality care.",

Its early recognition and management reduce maternal mortality and morbidity. Acute uterine inversion refers to uterine inversion occurring within 24 hours following vaginal delivery. Uterine inversion is classified into various degrees according to the location of the inverted fundus in relation to the rest of the female genital tract. A sudden increase in the intra-abdominal pressure, as a result of coughing, sneezing, vomiting or straining, as well as connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, are also risk factors for uterine inversion. Severe and sustained pain in the suprapubic area due to stretching of the infundibulo-pelvic ligaments and other viscera is the most common initial symptom. Vaginal bleeding is usually present, unless the placenta is completely adherent to the uterine wall.",

      "title": "Diagnosis of Cornual Pregnancy in the Emergency Room: a Rare Case Report",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Ectopic or extrauterine pregnancy is a life-threatening medical condition in which a fertilized egg is implanted elsewhere than in the uterine cavity, commonly in the fallopian tubes. However, it can also occur in the peritoneal cavity, ovaries, and cervix. There are several etiological factors contributing to ectopic pregnancies, such as a history of pelvic inflammatory diseases, habitual abortions, and miscarriages, previous ectopic pregnancies, fertility procedures, as well as increased maternal age that has been correlated with a higher risk of carrying an ectopic pregnancy. Often, the first alerting sign in any ectopic pregnancy is a pain in the pelvic region, along with vaginal bleeding usually spotted between the 6th and 11th gestational week. Other symptoms include vomiting, nausea, tachycardia, and in severe cases hypovolemic shock due to internal bleeding induced by the rupture of the tubes. The key to diagnosing an ectopic pregnancy is transvaginal ultrasound, alongside the measurement of beta human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (beta-hCG) concentrations, which are usually found to be low in such cases. The management of ectopic pregnancy is either medical or surgical. Case report: We are reporting the case of a 32-year-old pregnant woman, who presented to the emergency department for diffuse abdominal pain and recurrent episodes of vomiting and diarrhea of one-week duration. The patient was stable on admission, but later on, she showed a rapid shift in her vital signs. Blood tests were obtained, and pelvic ultrasound was done, followed by a Computed Tomography (CT) scan that revealed the presence of a right cornual ectopic pregnancy. A rapid surgical intervention was carried out to save the patient’s life and alleviate the pain. Conclusion: Ectopic pregnancy is an urgent condition that needs to be treated immediately to avoid its fatal consequences. Several risk factors stand behind it, and a usual history and physical gynecological examinations are insufficient to detect it, hormone screening tests additionally to ultrasounds are highly recommended to decrease the incidence of mortality. A proper follow-up with a specialist could avoid the risk of an ectopic pregnancy as well as its undesirable outcomes.",

The keywords used for the first search are \"Childbirth Fear\" AND \"Impact of Childbirth Fear\" OR \"Effects of Childbirth Fear\". Research results show that fear of giving birth that continues or is not handled correctly can cause mental well-being disorders after giving birth. These include postnatal anxiety, postnatal depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Persistent, unresolved fears can affect the bond between mother and baby. A prolonged fear of giving birth can increase the risk of premature birth or a baby with a low birth weight. The nursing intervention that can be carried out is making a directed and comprehensive birth plan involving the medical and nursing team. In conclusion, fear can trigger a stress response and increase physical and emotional tension in pregnant women during labor, causing delayed delivery or hindering the progression of work. Continued fear can lead to posttraumatic stress disorder, postpartum depression, or difficulty in meeting their baby's emotional and mental needs.&#x0D; Keywords: Maternal Emotions, Fear of Childbirth, Baby Risks",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY A serious year‐round fertility problem on a commercial piggery was investigated. The problem was characterised by a high proportion of non‐pregnant sows and gilts which showed a delayed return or failure to return to oestrus after a normal mating to a fertile boar. Several factors were identified that we considered to be placing undue stress on the breeding stock from wearning through mating and early pregnancy. When steps were taken to reduce the influence of these stressors there was a marked improvement in the herd farrowing rate. Across all months this improvement was largely due to a reduction in the number of sows showing delayed return or failure to return to oestrus after mating. There were no concomitant changes in other indices of performance. In conclusion this study has shown that stressful factors other than summer heat stress can cause a syndrome of delayed or failure to return to oestrus, this syndrome is commonly and perhaps wrongly called summer or seasonal infertility. When given the appropriate combination and/or intensity of stressful stimuli, it can be manifest at any time of the year.",

The 1st years of menstruation are usually anovulatory resulting in variable periods of amenorrhea which corrects itself in time. In profuse menstrual loss, endocrine, metabolic, and hemorrhagic disorders must be exlcuded before treatment with progesterone for endometrial hyperplasia. Primary amenorrhea requires detailed examination before diagnosis. Secondary amenorrhea is commonly caused by a disturbance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis due to an emotional disturbance. If pregnancy is eliminated, examination and reassurance are sufficient treatment. Most dysmenorrhea may be treated with mild analgesics and reassurance; in severe cases ovulation may be inhibited by estrogen treatment. Dilation of the cervix should never be attempted. In complaints of vaginal discharge, examination should be made for trichomonas, monilia, gonorrhea, or a forgotten tampon. Requests for contraception should be taken seriously regardless of age. The combined contraceptive pill or Gravigard or copper 7 IUD is the method of choice. Lower abdominal pain caused by pelvic inflammatory disease should be treated early to prevent tubal occlusion after salpingitis. Evidence of higher cervical cancer incidence among women who were sexually active in adolescence suggests routine cervical cytology should be performed. Treatment of adolescents should dispel ignorance and embarrassment with patience and skill.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Disruption of the processes of sexual determination or sexual differentiation by any genetic or environmental factor may result in a disorder of sexual development (DSD) with discordance among chromosomal, gonadal, and anatomical sex. Materials and methods: In order to update concepts related to DSD with 46,XX karyotype without numeric or structural abnormalities, a search of information was carried out for the last 10 years in which three subcategories are described: Disorders of gonadal (ovarian) development, Disorders related to androgenic excess and other abnormalities (vaginal atresia, cloacal exstrophy, uterine abnormalities and labial adhesions). Conclusion: The great variability of phenotypical manifestations in this kind of DSD may create confusion in diagnostic approaches guided by clinical findings. This presentation variability, paired with a lack of knowledge of the pathophysiology, can contribute to delayed or non-conclusive diagnoses. For these reasons, deepening the knowledge of the causes and clinical manifestations of this class of clinical conditions will result in the well-being of the patient and his family.",

      "abstract": "Whether its title, ύπέρ τοῦ μ⋯ γεννᾶν is authentic or not, the work transmitted as ‘Book X’ of Aristotle's History of Animals (HA) deals with a wide range of possible causes for failure to conceive and generate offspring. It sets out by saying that these causes may lie in both partners or in either of them, but in the sequel the author devotes most of his attention to problems of the female body. Thus he discusses the state of the uterus, the occurrence and modalities of menstruation, the condition and position of the mouth of the uterus, the emission of fluid during sleep (when the woman dreams that she is having intercourse with a man), physical weakness or vigour on awakening after this nocturnal emission, the occurrence of flatulence in the uterus and the ability to discharge this, moistness or dryness of the uterus, wind-pregnancy, and spasms in the uterus. Then he briefly considers the possibility that the cause of infertility lies with the male, but this is disposed of in one sentence: if you want to find out whether the man is to blame, the author says, just let him have intercourse with another woman and see whether that produces a satisfactory result (636bl 1–13; see also 637b23–4). The writer also acknowledges that the problem may lie in a failure of two otherwise healthy partners to match sexually, or as he puts it, to ‘run at the same pace’ ἲσοδρομῆσαι during intercourse, but he does not go into this possibility at great length (636b 15–23), and he proceeds to discuss further particulars on the female side.",

      "abstract": "The commonest cause of faecal incontinence is considered to be childbirth. In this review we consider the available data on the prevalence of faecal incontinence in the community and the incidence of incontinence after childbirth. The results and implications of studies on childbirth using anal manometry, neurophysiological tests and anal ultrasound are discussed. The development of symptoms are more likely with a third degree tear and forceps delivery. Reduced resting and squeeze pressures are seen early after vaginal delivery with recovery noted with time. Reduced pressures have been seen in symptomatic and asymptomatic women and there is no correlation of the pressures with the presence or absence of a sphincter defect or evidence of pudendal neuropathy. Anal manometry can not be used as an indication of muscle or nerve injury. Both sphincter defects and evidence of pudendal neuropathy are common after vaginal delivery but these are not necessarily associated with symptoms. It is suggested that such occult sphincter injuries may go on to be symptomatic in later life. The number of these injuries, however, is far greater than the documented prevalence of incontinence in the community, and hence many must remain asymptomatic. Their true clinical significance remains uncertain.",

Esta patologia acomete grande parte da população mundial, em especial as mulheres, todavia homens podem também apresentar esta disfunção no decorrer do envelhecimento. Em decorrência da falta de informação quanto a esta doença por Educadores Físicos, o objetivo deste estudo foi debater sobre quais práticas estão associadas diretamente aos episódios de IU, assim como prevenir e/ou melhorar os sinais e sintomas de indivíduos incontinentes através de atividades físicas adequadas. Recentes pesquisas têm demonstrado que atividades físicas/exercícios físicos de alto impacto parecem enfraquecer a musculatura do períneo ou do assoalho pélvico – principal músculo responsável pelo sistema de continência, resultando em afastamento das atividades físicas e de lazer. De forma inversa, outras pesquisas sugerem que a prática de atividades físicas de baixa a moderada intensidade podem ser eficazes tanto na prevenção quanto na redução das perdas urinárias através do fortalecimento de determinados grupos musculares, assim como na musculatura responsável pelo sistema de continência de forma sinérgica. Relationship Between Physical Activity and Urinary Incontinence: Useful Information to The Physical Trainer ABSTRACT: Urinary Incontinence (UI), the involuntary loss of urine, is a serious health problem. The pathology is present in a great section of people worldwide, especially women, although males may also suffer the dysfunction due to aging. Due to lack of information on the disease by Physical Educators, current paper discusses which practices are directly associated with episodes of UI and how to prevent and/or improve the symptoms of incontinent people through proper physical activities. Recent research has shown that high impact physical activities/physical exercises weaken the perineum or the pelvic muscles, or rather, the main muscle that controls the continence system, and thus tends to prevent physical and recreational activities. Contrastingly, other research works suggest that the practice of low and medium impact physical activities are efficient for the prevention and the decrease of urinary loss through the synergic strengthening of certain muscular groups and muscles responsible for the urinary continence system.",

Clinical studies suggest that interventions which reduce tension and anxiety can prevent or inhibit preterm labor. A model is proposed that links preterm labor to a disorder of arousal manifested physiologically as a hyperreactivity of the limbic circuitry and its efferent components. Autonomic hyperreactivity has been found repeatedly in women who experience preterm labor. This central hyperreactivity could unleash a cascade of psychophysiological reactions that could cause uterine excitation and facilitate preterm labor.",

      "title": "Seven dangerous <i>P</i> s of pregnancy and challenges of caring for pregnant women with complex needs",
      "abstract": "Pregnancy and birth are physiological processes resulting in good outcomes in most healthy women. However, pregnancy is a vulnerable period in women′s lives and the risk of serious complications can be substantial in those with pre-existing disease or adverse socio-economic conditions. The six most important complications of pregnancy that carry substantial risk of morbidity and mortality for the mother and/or her baby are: preeclampsia, pulmonary embolism, preterm birth, postpartum/peripartum hemorrhage, perineal trauma, perinatal/puerperal sepsis and psychosis. I call them “seven dangerous Ps of pregnancy”. Risk of such complications is especially high among women with medical co-morbidities and complex unmet social needs. Additionally, some social and iatrogenic factors also play an important role in increasing risk. For example, social factors are closely associated with mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and behavioral problems which may increase the risk of suicide during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Multiple cesarean sections exponentially increase the risk of abnormally invasive placentation, uterine rupture and peripartum hemorrhage. Disregard for hygiene, lack of appropriate routines for infection control and improper use of antibiotics increases the risk of perinatal sepsis and microbacterial resistance. Inadequate training in vaginal delivery and lack of proper skills in perineal protection among birth attendants and inconsiderate use of operative vaginal delivery are all associated with increased risk of severe perineal trauma 1. Today, a significant proportion of women with serious medical conditions, such as surgically corrected congenital heart diseases, HIV, Hepatitis B or C, autoimmune disorders etc., get pregnant. Pregnancies are not uncommon even after organ (kidney, liver or heart) transplantations. Generally, specialized care of these women by competent medical teams leads to good outcomes. However, any pregnant women with two or more medical or pregnancy related co-morbidities, or those taking multiple medications, should be considered to be at very high risk of poor outcome. Mental health problems are quite common, with almost 20-25% of women developing anxiety, depression or psychosis during or within a year after pregnancy. Perinatal mental health problems are more common in low-income counties 2. Pre-existing mental health problems may be heightened by economic burden, gender-based violence, or forced displacement, and often surface during pregnancy, manifesting through depression, substance misuse or suicide attempts, especially when the pregnancy is unintended and unwanted. Therefore, these factors should be taken very seriously into account, particularly as suicide is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality. A report on maternal mortality by MBRRACE-UK, covering the period between 2011–13, demonstrated that around 25% of all maternal deaths between 6 weeks and 1 year after childbirth were related to mental health problems and one in seven of those women died from suicide 3. Biological, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors interact closely and play a fundamental role in determining women′s physical and mental health. While the challenges of unplanned pregnancies and teenage pregnancies still remain in many countries due to lack of education, economic resources and access to effective contraception, age at first pregnancy is steadily increasing, and delaying pregnancy until 35-40 years of age is becoming more and more common, especially in developed counties. Reasons for this are complex, but may be related to social trends, reproductive freedom and availability of effective contraception as well as fertility treatments. Women who postpone their pregnancies are generally a heterogeneous group, but the risk of comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, increases with age, which in turn increases the risk of pregnancy complications. Socio-economic and life style factors are equally important, both for physical and mental wellbeing. Pregnant women who misuse alcohol and/or drugs, who have an unhealthy life style, are obese or malnourished, who experience domestic or intimate partner abuse (psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional) are clearly vulnerable groups. So are pregnant women who have recently migrated or are refugees as they may have difficulty in navigating the healthcare system in a foreign country, or struggle to communicate due to language and cultural barriers. There are challenges in providing effective and safe care for women with complex social and medical needs and pregnancy related co-morbidities. Most healthcare professionals working with pregnant women and children are generally well trained in providing proper advice regarding maternal nutrition, breast feeding, immunization etc., but have little knowledge and expertise regarding identification of mental health problems and social needs. Patient complexity in pregnancy is determined by medical (physical as well as mental), socioeconomic and life style factors, and the issue of training needs to be urgently addressed to improve the care of pregnant women. Training of doctors, midwives and primary care health professionals in inter-professional team work, empathy towards patients and their families, clinical skill development and rational use of resources based on healthcare settings is the way forward in taking care of pregnant women at high risk of complications and poor outcome. In summary, a multidisciplinary team approach, clinical competence and good coordination are essential to providing comprehensive care for women with complex medical and social needs. Considering patients′ wishes and respecting their integrity is necessary to ensure good communication. Effective communication within and between medical teams at hospitals and community settings as well as in social and healthcare services is of utmost importance to provide continuity of care. By regularly assessing and continuously monitoring the care needs of pregnant women with complex medical and social needs, we can ensure patient safety and avoid adverse outcomes.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRAK\r\nLatar Belakang: Dhysmenorhea adalah nyeri pada daerah panggul akibat menstruasi dan produksi zat prostaglandin. Seringkali dimulai segera setelah mengalami menstruasi pertama (menarche). Biasanya masa menstruasi pertama terjadi sekitar umur 12 atau 13 tahun, atau kadang-kadang lebih awal atau kemudian. Irregular periods biasanya untuk pertama atau dua tahun. Akibat dari dismenorrea pada perempuan seringkali mereka tidak mengikuti proses pembelajaran dan tidak dapat hadir saat kuliah karena sakit saat menstruasi yang berakibat pada berkurangnya persentase kehadiran mahasiswi yang berdampak terhadap berkurangnya penguasaan terhadap topik yang tidak dihadiri dan tidak memenuhinya persyaratan untuk mengikuti ujian.Dismenorea dapat dilakukan dengan terapi farmakologis dan non-farmakologis. Terapi farmakologis meliputi: pemberian obat analgesik, terapi hormonal sedangkan terapi non farmakologis lainnya, kompres hangat, terapi relaksasi dan senam dismenorea.senam dismenorea merupakan salah satu bentuk relaksasi yang sangat dianjurkan untuk perempuan yang sedang mengalami nyeri perut. Tujuan: penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui keEfektifitasan Senam Dismenorea Terhadap Intensitas Nyeri Haid Primer Pada Mahasiswi. Metode Penelitian: Penelitian ini menggunakan Quasi Eksperimen dengan desain One Group pre-test post-test dengan jumlah sampel 38 orang yang diberikan intervensi senam dismenorea selama 20 menit . Teknik analisa data yang digunakan pada penelitian ini adalah uji statistik non parametrik berupa Uji Wilcoxon. Hasil penelitian: Berdasarkan hasil uji statistik didapatkan nilai yang signifikan (Z= -5,517, Pvalue= 0,000 (Pvalue<0,05)) yang artinya nilai Pvalue<0,05, sehingga dapat disimpulkan bahwa ada terdapat perbedaan yang bermakna antara senam disemnorea terhadap penurunan intensitas nyeri haid dismenorea.

Oestrogen therapy has also been used in the management of psychological/ psychiatric and cognitive symptoms associated with the menopause. However, it has been argued that these symptoms may be more related to comorbid physical and psychosocial factors rather than the effects of ovarian failure.",

      "abstract": "Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) is a bulge or protrusion of pelvic organs and their associated vaginal segments into or through the vagina. The causes are multifactorial and result in the weakening of the pelvic support connective tissue and muscles as well as nerve damage. Patients may be asymptomatic or have significant symptoms, such as those relating to the lower urinary tract, pelvic pain, defecatory problems, faecal incontinence, back pain, and dyspareunia. The conventional treatment options for POP are preventive, conservative, and surgical. Available surgical options are reconstructive pelvic surgery with or without mesh augmentation and obliterate surgery. POP is a condition which impairs the quality of life of many women. Many women are reluctant to undergo surgical management, and they opt for conservative management like pessary and Kegel exercises. These may not bring significant reduction in their symptoms and may lead to psychological issues. A 37-year-old woman came to the Outpatient Department (OPD) of PNNM Ayurveda Medical College, Thrissur, Kerala, India, with complaints of dribbling of urine while coughing and sneezing. She was diagnosed as having cystourethrocele on examination. In this condition, we have considered prasramsini yonivyapath, as mentioned by Acharya Sushruta. Several yonidrteekarana dravyas have been mentioned in Ayurveda texts, which can be used in POP to improve the strength of supporting structures. Ayurvedic conservative management was done for one week at the OP level. The patient's condition was very much improved with the management, and the quality of her life was restored.",

      "title": "The effects of labour and delivery on the pelvic floor",
      "abstract": "Increasing public and professional attention has recently been focused on the issue of both faecal and urinary incontinence following childbirth and these symptoms are sometimes being cited as indications for elective caesarean section. Faecal incontinence has a female-to-male preponderance of 8:1, consistent with childbirth as the principal causative factor, although most symptomatic women do not seek medical advice until after the menopause. Similarly, urinary stress incontinence is almost an exclusively female phenomenon. Obstetric injury may take the form of direct muscular damage to the anal sphincter, as occurs during a third-degree tear, and/or may be the result of cumulative damage to the pudendal nerves. Mechanical, neural and endocrine factors may all play a causative role in faecal incontinence. Symptoms are rarely volunteered by the patient, and may be present for many years after the index pregnancy, and clinical examination alone may fail to detect specific abnormalities. The performance of anal manometry, endoanal ultrasound, urodynamics and neurophysiology studies of the pelvic floor may help to increase the diagnostic yield. Treatment for both urinary and faecal incontinence is available in the form of physiotherapy, fluid and dietary manipulation and in more severe cases, surgery. Adequate primary management of third-degree tears requires careful appraisal as this injury, in particular, is the most important risk factor for subsequent faecal incontinence symptoms. In this chapter we aim to outline the mechanism of damage to the pelvic floor during childbirth, concentrating primarily on anal sphincter damage. We describe the necessary investigations, follow-up and treatment which women with significant pelvic floor damage should receive following delivery, and we finally discuss the issue of further deliveries and, specifically, the current place of caesarean section.",

It is any indention representing myometrial discontinuity or a triangular anechoic defect in the anterior uterine wall, with the base communicating to the uterine cavity at the site of the previous cesarean section (CS) scar. Ventrofixed uterus is an adhesion between anterior surface of uterus and anterior abdominal wall secondary to Caesarean section. Cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) pregnancy at a scar site is trouble either causing scar rupture or placenta accreta syndrome. Here are the seven cases of having a problem of isthmocele or ventrofixed uterus or both. All these cases had previous CS done at peripheral hospitals. The intension of this case series is to study preoperative symptoms, clinical and investigation findings, intraoperative presentation, and challenges with postoperative recovery in cases of previous CS-related problems. All these cases presented with us post-CS either lower abdominal pain, intermenstrual spotting, menorrhagia, or secondary infertility, and one had emergency abdominal pain with pregnancy. On hysteroscopy, a large niche at CS scar with trenches was detected in five cases, and on laparoscopy, ventrofixed uterus in five cases, and four cases have both. One has multiple fibroids, one has associated ventrofixed ovarian endometrioma. One case has ruptured CSP. After corrective hysterolaparoscopy surgery, all patients recovered well. Hysterolaparoscopic corrective surgery is a real need and challenge in cases of symptomatic ventrofixed uterus and isthmocele. The incidence and prevalence of isthmocele are greater than most gynecologists realize. It is imperative to understand the etiology and adopt preventive measures during CS to reduce its incidence and also to reduce the incidence of CSP.",

      "abstract": "Amenorrhea, the absence of menstrual periods in women of reproductive age, is a multifaceted and clinically significant gynecological condition that can have various underlying causes and far-reaching implications for a woman’s overall health and well-being. This abstract provides a concise overview of amenorrhea, encompassing its classification, etiology, clinical presentation, and management. Amenorrhea can be categorized into two primary types: Primary and secondary. Primary amenorrhea refers to the absence of menstruation by the age of 16 years in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics, or by the age of 14 years with no signs of puberty. Secondary amenorrhea, on the other hand, is characterized by the cessation of regular menstruation for at least three cycles or six months in women with a history of regular menstruation. The etiology of amenorrhea is diverse and may be attributed to various factors including hormonal imbalances, structural abnormalities in the reproductive tract, excessive exercise, stress, and eating disorders. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and hypothalamic amenorrhea are common hormonal causes, while Asherman’s syndrome and structural abnormalities in the uterus are anatomical factors contributing to amenorrhea. The clinical presentation of amenorrhea varies depending on its underlying cause but often includes symptoms such as changes in weight, hair growth patterns, and breast development. An accurate diagnosis requires a comprehensive evaluation, which may involve hormonal assays, imaging studies, and sometimes a biopsy. The management strategies for amenorrhea depend on this cause. Hormone therapy, lifestyle modifications, and surgical interventions are recommended to address hormonal imbalances, structural abnormalities, or other contributing factors. Psychosocial support and counseling play crucial roles in the management of amenorrhea, especially when related to eating disorders or psychological stress.",

The process of childbirth and a changing role as a new mom can be associated with many disturbances of emotions. Besides that, the development of baby blues or postpartum depression may occur in the puerperium period. Depression in post partum occurs in one month after childbirth and may be prolonged to one year. Depressive disorders in a young mother affect the mother and the newborn’s health status. That is why it is crucial to identify for factors that could significantly reduce the likelihood of developing depression in this period. The literature review was aimed at describing the relationship of physical activity during pregnancy and postpartum and the development of postnatal depression. It was shown that physical activity during pregnancy and puerperium, or in the postnatal period itself reduces the risk of developing depression in pregnancy and after delivery. Physical activity can be an essential factor in preventing depressive disorders in women in the postnatal period.",

Spontaneous abortion is identified as the unintentional expulsion of an embryo or a fetus before the 24th week of pregnancy. About 50% of miscarriages are attributed to chromosomal aberrations such as structural changes or abnormal chromosomal numbers. The increased age of more than 35 years for both partners has a considerable role in adverse pregnancy outcome and is 50% significantly higher if the age of the mother is 42 years or more. Other factors such as ethnicity, psychological status of the female partner, feeling of stress, hormonal abnormalities, very low or very high body mass index (BMI), infectious diseases, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, smoking and addiction to alcohol have also been correlated with recognizably higher rates of spontaneous abortion or miscarriage.

The cessation of menstruation in the female at the so-called change of life has been tangible evidence for ages that the woman is having a decline in her sex function and is approaching the end of her child-bearing period. This cessation of menstruation in the female, usually called the menopause, is not the climacteric but represents only visible evidence that the woman is having endocrine imbalance. The endocrine dysfunction, plus the imbalance of equilibrium between the two divisions of the autonomic nervous system, with evidence at times of disturbance in the psychic centers, is the climacteric. The true climacteric is due primarily to decline of function of the sex glands. Decline of sex function is not limited to",

Infertility, or the inability to conceive after 12 months of regular sexual activity free of birth control, threatens attainment of this goal and is associated with elevated levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Many infertility treatments are invasive and time consuming, which is associated with additional emotional distress. Miscarriage is usually defined as a spontaneous abortion when the fetus is up to 20 weeks' gestation, and the term, neonatal loss, is usually used when the loss occurs after 20 weeks' gestation, including during delivery; together, these experiences are called perinatal loss. Women who experience perinatal loss report elevated depression and anxiety following the loss, accompanied by a sense of shame, self-blame, and inadequacy. Men also report elevated emotional distress, although their grief typically resolves more quickly than women's grief. In addition, up to 25% of women who experience perinatal loss report posttraumatic stress. Healthcare professionals who work with parents experiencing a perinatal loss are encouraged to allow the parents to choose the way in which they handle the logistics of the loss (e.g., whether to have a memorial service) as well as to seek mental health treatment if their emotional distress causes life interference. Mental health professionals who work with people who have experienced perinatal loss are encouraged to demonstrate empathy and compassion and to provide psychoeducation about expected grief reactions following such a loss. There is some evidence for the efficacy of cognitive behavioral interventions.",

The process by which an erection occurs must thoroughly be understood before treatments can correct ED. The first phase of the male sexual response is that of excitement, initiated by an erotic stimulus. During this phase, the penis hardens and increases in both length and diameter as the result of being engorged with blood. The penis can also become erect without the presence of an erotic stimulus: for example, many men experience erections every thirty to ninety minutes at night during rapid eye movement sleep, or in the morning upon waking. 2",

Menstrual cramps are the results of strong myometrial contraction that occur just before and during menstruation period. The causes of menstrual cramps could be endocrine, psychological and other factors related to reproduction organ. The cramps may be due to excessive prostaglandin secretion. Generally, women ignore the menstrual cramps because it is the monthly routine, but others feel extremely uncomfortable Menstrual cramp (painful) can be reduced by taking anti-inflamantory drugs or drugs which inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis or non medicinal practices like massase, warm compress, listening to music, watching television, or breathing relaxation.Key word : Mentrual",

The prevalence of migraine in reproductive-aged females is 4 to 5 times higher than that in males. However, the prevalence in headache does not differ with gender before puberty. Female life stages include the pre-pubertal period, pubertal period, reproductive period (pregnancy, parturition, and puerperium), menopausal period, and postmenopausal period. During these life stages, serum estrogen levels change dynamically. Even during the menstrual cycle, serum estradiol levels change dynamically. These changes definitely differ from changes in serum testosterone levels in males. Headache or migraine during the menstrual cycle is more frequently observed during the period of menstruation. However, the prevalence of headache and migraine become lower after menopause. These findings suggest that the occurrence of headache is in part associated with the decline in serum estradiol levels.",

An understanding of the physiological life cycle variations is essential to determine whether a pattern of bleeding episodes should be regarded as normal or abnormal. Normal men-struation occurs in response to the decline in progesterone following the regression of the corpus luteum. Any alteration in the cyclical exposure of the endometrium first, to unopposed oestrogen during the follicular phase and, after ovulation, to oestrogen and progesterone, is likely to result in disturbances in the menstrual pattern. Intermenstrual bleeding may last only a few hours or persist for several days. Bleeding perceived as abnormal or unusual evokes fear and anxiety and is a common reason for gynaecological consultation.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Labor pain is a complex phenomenon with sensory, emotional, and perceptive components and can be regarded as one of the most serious kinds of pain. Different strategies to approach acute labor pain have been developed. Chronic pain after labor and delivery has not been studied so extensively. In this review recent findings about chronic pain after labor and delivery will be discussed. Recent findings Prevalence rates of chronic pain after cesarean section are between 6 and 18% and after vaginal delivery they are between 4 and 10%. Predictors for chronic pain after cesarean section and delivery are previous chronic pain, general anesthesia and higher postdelivery pain. As labor pain is rated as one of the most serious kinds of acute pain one could make a prediction about chronic pain after labor and delivery. We speculate that effective treatment of this pain with epidural analgesia could prevent the development of chronic pain. Summary Treatment of acute pain during labor and delivery is necessary to prevent chronic pain. Future studies should focus on the long-term effects of different analgesic regimens on the development of chronic pain after labor and delivery.",

Due to its evolution, it will be classified as acute and chronic. The acute stage is sudden onset and appears in the second trimester, when associated with congenital malformations not compatible with life and evolving to a previous delivery. While the chronic degree appears in the third trimester, it is associated with maternal factors and is mainly idiopathic. Regarding its clinical manifestations, the patient will present a progressive and rapid increase in his height of the uterine fundus (AFU), symptoms of compression and / or distension, as he may also notice respiratory distress, lower limb edema, edema. vulvar and abdominal cut, weight gain, development of pre-eclampsia. The diagnosis will be based on a higher AFU for gestational age, difficulty palpating fetal parts, difficulty auscultating fetal focus, and subjective palpation of increased amniotic fluid. However, ultrasound will provide the diagnosis with the measurement of amniotic fluid, the most frequently detected technique is that of Phelan. The treatment is based on the use of indomethacin, but it has now been implemented as an invasive procedure, amniocentesis. The present structured investigation in this clinical case, will provide us with the necessary and correct information, to know the importance of this pathology and to carry out the nursing care provided by the 25-year-old pregnant woman with 30 weeks of gestation with a medical diagnosis of polyhydramnios.",

      "abstract": "The increasing importance of an ectopic pregnancy as a cause of maternal death presents a challenge that will be met when primary care physicians combine a high index of suspicion with the ability to recognize the patient most at risk. The major symptoms, abdominal pain, secondary amenorrhea and abnormal vaginal bleeding are well known, as are the major signs, abdominal tenderness, adnexal mass and tenderness on motion of the cervix. Less well known are factors in the clinical history which indicate the patient to be at high risk. These include primary or secondary infertility, previous abortion or ectopic pregnancy and previous tubal operation, either reconstructive or sterilizing. In addition, the use of an intrauterine contraceptive device or its recent removal because of abdominal pain or bleeding, or both, is highly significant. Of major importance is a history of recent uterine evacuation. Should the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy be under consideration, procrastination by observation is no longer acceptable. An active effort must be made to confirm or deny the diagnosis, Culdocentesis should be performed in the emergency department or clinic. If positive, prompt laparotomy is indicated. Should the result of culdocentesis be unsatisfactory or negative, laparotomy should be undertaken with further delay.Ectopic pregnancy is a serious complication of pregnancy accounting for 6-13% of all maternal deaths in the U.S. Early diagnosis and treatment is absolutely necessary to ensure a successful outcome. In the period from January 1, 1965-December 31, 1979, 556 consecutive cases of ectopic pregnancy were treated at The Brookdale Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn, accounting for less than 1% of all pregnancies handled in that period. 3 of these cases had an ovarian pregnancy, 8 had an abdominal, and 545 a tubal pregnancy. Relevant personal characteristics and aspects of obstetric history of these cases were studied. 85% of them had used no contraception prior to the ectopic pregnancy. Maternal age was not a factor in the occurrence of the ectopic pregnancy. The following factors in the clinical history were found to put the patient in a high-risk category: 1) primary or secondary infertility; 2) previous abortion or ectopic pregnancy; 3) previous tubal operation, either reconstructive or sterilizing; 4) recent uterine evacuation; and 5) the use of an IUD or its recent removal due to abdominal pain and/or bleeding. Major symptoms were found to be abdominal pain, common symptoms or early pregnancy, abdominal tenderness, adnexal mass, and tenderness on motion of the cervix. Culdocentesis and laparoscopy are effective diagnostic aids. Procrastination by observation should not be followed.",

It remains unclear whether the paroxysmal disorder seen in infants who have yet to develop self-awareness or ideas about sex is equivalent to the masturbatory orgasm seen later on in childhood, when the patient has a clear self-awareness and sexual interest. This article details a case that may answer this question. Paroxysmal disorder was initially observed in a female patient at an age of 5 months. It presented regularly throughout her infancy and childhood, up age 8 years. She described the sensations that she experienced during episodes as pleasant as early as age 3 years. In a clinical interview, she confirmed that she experienced pleasure with the rhythmic contractions of her vagina, suggestive of episodes of masturbatory orgasm. This suggests that the paroxysmal disorder seen in infancy is most likely similar to the masturbatory orgasm seen in childhood. The scientific and clinical meaning of early paroxysmal disorder in sexual medicine is discussed.",

The symptom development is very closely related to the luteal phase, thus indicating the existence of one or more factors during the luteal phase that provoke mental symptoms in sensitive patients. This is further supported by the fact that hysterectomized women with no menstrual bleedings but with the ovarian hormone cycle, continue to show cyclical mood changes without knowing the cycle phase. The nature of the symptom-provoking factor is still unknown, but the ovarian hormones progesterone and/or estradiol are suspected because certain women taking oral contraceptives or on sequential postmenopausal estrogen progestagen treatment undergo mood changes. Psychological and personality factors are probably also involved, at least in the degree of the mood change and the type of mood experienced.",

      "title": "Evaluation of Factors that Increase the Severity of Dysmenorrhoea among University Female Students in Maiduguri, North Eastern Nigeria",
      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhoea is defined as painful menses in women.1 Dysmenorrhoea is frequently encountered in young women around adolescence. It affects the quality of life (QOL) of women during reproductive age. The aetiology of primary dysmenorrhoea is not precisely understood, but most symptoms can be explained by the action of uterine prostaglandins, particularly PG F2α. It may be associated with other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, back pain, fatigue, headache, dizziness, and fainting. These symptoms could be very severe and social activity is very limited during menstruation, reducing quality of life in women. Severity of symptoms is usually assessed by grading of dysmenorrhoea as mild, moderate, and severe according to the degree of pain and analgesic requirement. Risk factors for dysmenorrhoea are early age at menarche (&lt; 12 years), age &lt; 20 years, nulliparity, heavy or prolonged menstrual flow, smoking, positive family history, obesity, attempts to lose weight, depression/anxiety, disruption of social networks among others. A study on factors influencing the prevalence and severity of dysmenorrhoea in young women had been conducted in Sweden by Sundell et al. Another study was conducted by Okusanya et al on menstrual pain and associated factors amongst undergraduates of Ambrose Ali University Ekpoma, South- south, Nigeria. These studies were carried out in other areas; however, to the best of our knowledge, no study on the factors that influence severity of dysmenorrhoea has been conducted at the University of Maiduguri. Dysmenorrhoea is the leading cause of recurrent short-term school absence in adolescent girls and a common problem in women of reproductive age.7 Knowledge of the severity factors is important because of the potential for intervention. It is against this background that we undertook this study. The objectives of the study, therefore, were to evaluate the factors that increase the severity of dysmenorrhoea among university female students, and to determine if increased severity of dysmenorrhoea affects the academic performance of the participants.",

      "title": "IMPACTOS DA VIOLÊNCIA OBSTÉTRICA NA SAÚDE MENTAL DA MULHER BRASILEIRA",
      "abstract": "O tema escolhido é de grande importância, pois aborda a violência obstétrica à mulher não somente durante o parto, mas também em uma grande maioria, nos meses que antecedem a hora de dar à luz, ou seja, no pré-natal, no parto, pós-parto, cesárea e até mesmo na hora fatídica e desgastante do abortamento involuntário. Veremos algumas ações consideradas como violência obstétrica, tais como: pouco caso, palavrões, se desfazer da parturiente com comentários desnecessários e constrangedores, privar da anestesia em momentos de extrema dor. Um dos métodos desta violência utilizado é fazer pressão sobre a barriga da mulher, a fim de forçar o bebê a nascer mais rápido também chamada de manobra de Kristeller. A saúde mental da mulher é abalada e o seu sofrimento psíquico tende a atrapalhar em sua jornada do dia a dia, em casa, no trabalho e, às vezes, ao adentrar um hospital até para um simples procedimento anual de Papanicolau que é o exame preventivo de colo de útero. O medo de reviver tudo aquilo vem à tona novamente. Em algumas pesquisas que fizemos, vamos dar exemplos e fazer citações para deixar claro como a violência obstétrica afeta não só a saúde mental materna, mas também como pessoa, a saúde da mulher, que fica com traumas, crises de pânico e, em muitas delas, o medo de ser mãe novamente, ficando assim uma sequela interior difícil de ser tratada ou até mesmo cicatrizada. Como resultado deste trabalho, espera-se que possamos contribuir, acima de tudo, com o incentivo por parte da equipe hospitalar, em especial na ala obstétrica, a agir com mais respeito pela mulher que se encontra em estado tão frágil na hora de dar à luz seu bebê sem ser necessário ferir de nenhuma maneira, seja com a instrumentalização ou com o tratamento direto de pessoa para pessoa.",

      "abstract": "Both physical and psychological factors affect the sexual interest and behavior of women at midlife. Hot flashes and genitourinary atrophy are the major menopausal complaints and may affect the ease and comfort of sexual exchange, although hormone replacement therapy can be helpful in reducing these symptoms. Changes in the sexual response cycle occur as well and may be attributable to the psychological and/or physical effects of aging, the partner's physical or psychological difficulties and/or the hormonal changes associated with the climacteric. Many women note a decline in sexual desire during the climacteric years, although orgasmic response is usually unimpaired. Hysterectomy, the second most commonly performed major surgical operation, can either enhance or diminish sexual comfort, depending on the women's preoperative distress and expectations. Often, sexual difficulties can be avoided at midlife by alterations in the sexual script.",

      "title": "Prevalence and factors associated with unsafe abortion among females below 25 years in Fort Portal regional referral hospital, Fort Portal City, Western Uganda",
      "abstract": "Unsafe abortion is defined by the World Health Organization as a method of terminating an unplanned pregnancy that is either performed by someone who doesn't have the necessary skills or in a setting that does not meet the bare minimum of medical requirements, or both. While the concept appears to be related to the procedure, the criteria of an unsafe abortion refer to unsuitable conditions that may exist prior to, during, or following an abortion. An unsafe abortion often has the following characteristics, however occasionally only a few or even all of them apply: Abortion is self-induced by ingesting traditional medications or dangerous substances, abortion is provoked by insertion of an object into the uterus by the woman herself or by a traditional practitioner, or by a violent abdominal massage, abortion is induced by an unskilled provider, frequently in unhygienic conditions, or by a health practitioner outside official/adequate health facilities, no pre-abortion counseling and advice, the wrong drug is provided for a medical abortion, or a pharmacist gives out the wrong medication with no instructions and no follow-up. A cross-sectional study design was deployed to generate the data for this study. Quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection were utilized and the study population was women aged below 25years attending post abortion care services in Fort portal Regional Referral Hospital. According to this study, the prevalence of Unsafe Abortion was 15.7% and the socio demographic factors that was commonly associated with unsafe abortions were; age 17-20 years (52.0%), single marital status (55.2%), unemployment (58.6%), No formal education (53.6%), Residing in the rural area (55.2%), age of first sexual intercourse at 17-20 years (48.5%), Having at least one child (61.2%) and having a monthly income lesser than 100,000/=(56.7%). Unsafe abortion continues to be a major public health problem. The risk factors associated with unsafe abortion were; age, marital status, unemployment, Level of education, Place of residence, age of first sexual intercourse, Number of children and financial status. The recommendation of this study is to encourage the people who provide information about Unsafe abortion to package a right full information to the young women. And to add on these young women should obtain extensive knowledge about contraception methods and safe methods of abortion. Parents are recommended to practice family planning methods as it would increase the care of parents to their girl child and this will decrease on the number of unwanted pregnancies thus prevention of un safe abortion.

Various gynaecological problems such as pelvic organ prolapse and endometriosis affect sexual function and this impacts on their treatment. Management often requires the need to address different components of the sexual dysfunction. Women wish to keep their options relating to sexual function open well past the menopause, and more women are presenting in later life with FSD. Learning objectives To know how to assess FSD in clinical practice. To appreciate the reasons why all women attending a gynaecology clinic should have their sexual function assessed to establish a baseline. To establish realistic expectations of outcomes on sexual function following treatment of gynaecological problems. Ethical issues Failure to inform women of the risk of deterioration in sexual function following gynaecological surgery can lead to litigation. Some essential treatments, such as vulvectomy or prophylactic oophorectomy, will result in adverse effects on sexual function, and women should make informed choices regarding their treatment.",

      "abstract": "When there is a defect in the uterine wall, it serves as a weakness through which the fetal membrane may herniate into abdominal cavity during pregnancy. This may manifest as either a silent (partial) or complete uterine rupture. Any silent (partial) uterine rupture has a potential of becoming complete. When a uterine rupture becomes complete, it may lead to acute life-threatening complications to both the mother and her fetus. As of today, there seems to be no consensus as to whether to manage silent or complete uterine rupture expectantly or surgically, including repair of the uterine wall or termination of the pregnancy, especially when this happens in the early second trimester, especially in Nigeria where the age of viability is still 28 weeks of gestation.",

      "abstract": "The menopausal transition is associated with significant psychosocial changes and dramatic alterations in the internal hormonal milieu, which may be associated with negative affects on sexual interest and activity. While one-third of women report sexual activity for nonsexual reasons, two-thirdsmaintain sexual interest and satisfaction through the menopausal transition. Although the percentage of women with low desire increases with age, because associated distress decreases, the prevalence of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (diminished desire plus distress) remains unchangedacross the lifespan, affecting 10–15% of women. Problems with arousal and orgasmic dysfunctionare associated with declining levels of sex steroids, and may also be associated with partner sexualor relationship problems, absence of a partner, medical or psychiatric illness, and/or effects of medication. Other risk factors include surgical menopause at a young age, severe vasomotor symptoms, socioeconomic issues, and lifestyle factors such as smoking and alcohol use. Interventions for adecline in sexual interest or function at midlife include lubricants, supplementation of sex steroids(predominately estrogen and androgens) either as a prescription or as phytoestrogens, phosphodi-esterase-5 inhibitors, bupropion, lifestyle changes, and psychotherapy. Identifying sexual problemsin mid-life women allows for appropriate interventions to aid in re-establishing a satisfactory sex lifeafter menopause.",

Such outcomes, especially with neurodevelopmental sequelae, may be compounded by a genetic disorder, congenital abnormality, or syndrome. Material and methods This is a report of 297 cases in which a pregnancy complication, error, or incident occurred that was followed by progeny with a genetic disorder, congenital abnormality, or syndrome that spawned litigation. The author assessed, opined, and in many cases, testified about causation. Results Pregnancies complicated by hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy were not infrequently compounded by offspring with a genetic disorder, congenital abnormality, or syndrome. Multiple cases were brought because of missed ultrasound or laboratory diagnoses, or failures in carrier detection. Teratogenic medication prescribed before or during pregnancy invited legal purview. Failure to refer (or confer) for genetic evaluation or counseling in the face of significant risk, occurred repeatedly. Ethical breaches and hubris promptly led to litigation. Conclusions Many lessons and recommendations emerge in this report. These include the realization that the vast majority of errors in this series involved at least two caregivers, serial ultrasound studies are important, decreased fetal movements may signal a genetic disorder, congenital abnormality, or syndrome, family history and ethnicity are vital, cognitive biases profoundly affect decision‐making. Finally, the simplest of errors have the potential for causing life‐long grief.",

When these environmental conditions are not met, anxiety and fear inevitably trigger a stress response that inhibits uterine contractions and increases the likelihood of prolonged, dysfunctional labor (Chapter 7). Parasympathetic dominance in labor is best promoted by a one-on-one female companion and the personal attention of a trustworthy professional who watches over the parturient's safety and ensures that labor progresses. This is a double-edged sword: the demanding requirements of non-stop presence, personal commitment, and continuous labor support are strongly correlated with a fixed limit on the maximum duration of labor, because neither is possible without the other. Work schedules exceeding 12 hours are unrealistic.",

Lifelong premature ejaculation is defined as ejaculation always or nearly always within 1 minute of vaginal penetration that has been present since the first sexual encounter. Acquired premature ejaculation typically begins after a period of normal function, with ejaculation occurring within 3 minutes of penetration. Treatment options include medications and behavioral techniques. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants are first-line drugs. Delayed ejaculation applies to a range of issues, from delay to complete absence of ejaculation. Guidelines suggest use of an ejaculatory latency time greater than 25 to 30 minutes for diagnosis. Etiologies include psychological and organic factors, such as adverse effects of medications. Treatment focuses on causal medication discontinuation, psychological interventions, and use of off-label drug therapy. Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen enters the bladder due to an anatomic, neurogenic, or pharmacologic cause. Treatment options include sympathomimetic medications and surgical correction of anatomic abnormalities. Hematospermia, or blood in the semen, is generally benign and self-limited. However, underlying malignancy is possible and should be considered based on patient age and risk factors. Treatment ranges from reassurance to management of the underlying cause.",

      "abstract": "This introduction discusses the aetiology of menstrual problems, their presentation and investigation as well as medical and surgical management. Specific problems such as fibroid-associated bleeding, adolescent and perimenopausal bleeding and breakthrough bleeding are covered, as are other critically important problems such as premenstrual disorders, pelvic pain and dysmenorrhoea. The most common presenting menstrual problem is heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB). A woman's approach to her periods will vary through her reproductive life. After childbearing is completed, the view of the menses will alter dramatically. The longest intermenstrual interval occurs at the menarche. Menstrual irregularity is most likely to occur at the extremes of reproductive life, the incidence of anovulation increasing as the menopause approaches. Classical primary spasmodic dysmenorrhoea occurs at the onset of the menses and gets better after 1 or 2 days, whereas secondary dysmenorrhoea tends to start prior to the menses and worsens as it proceeds.",

      "title": "Pelvic floor dysfunction as a representative of pelvic frailty",
      "abstract": "Pelvic floor trauma developing into pelvic frailty is a significant concern in urogynecology or orthopedics. The majority of women who have experienced vaginal childbirth are affected, to a certain extent, by some form of pelvic floor damage, thereby eliciting substantial alterations of functional anatomy in the pelvic cavity which are manifested as urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse (e.g., uterine prolapse). With the above in mind, medical researchers, continence experts, and continence exercise practitioners in the research areas of sports medicine and rehabilitation medicine believe that the coordinated activity of pelvic floor muscles, in association with the abdominal muscles, is a prerequisite for urinary and defecatory continence. Since the pelvic floor forms the base of the abdominal cavity, stronger pelvic floor muscles are crucial in maintaining such capabilities. Opposing action of the abdominal and pelvic floor muscles ensures that exercises for one may also strengthen the other. Appropriate abdominal maneuverability or logical exercise training of the abdominal muscles may thus be beneficial in maintaining not only strength but also coordination, flexibility, and endurance of pelvic floor muscles and abdominal muscles. Such exercises, collectively known as pelvic floor muscle training, may be effective for long-term pelvic cavity care and also in rehabilitating cases of pelvic floor dysfunction. Further research is needed, however, in determining whether pelvic floor muscle function can be truly enhanced or maintained by such exercises in cases of pelvic floor dysfunction and/or decreased urinary continence.",

Evaluation and treatment are recommended earlier than 12 months when risk factors for infertility exist, if the female partner is 35 years or older, and in the setting of nonheterosexual partnerships. A comprehensive medical history and physical examination emphasizing the thyroid, breast, and pelvic areas should be performed to help direct diagnosis and treatment. Causes of infertility in females include uterine and tubal factors, ovarian reserve, ovulatory dysfunction, obesity, and hormone-related disorders. Common male factor infertility issues include abnormal semen, hormonal disorders, and genetic abnormalities. Semen analysis is recommended for the initial assessment of the male partner. Evaluation of the female should include assessment of the uterus and fallopian tubes with ultrasonography or hysterosalpingography when indicated. Laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed to evaluate for endometriosis, leiomyomas, or evidence of a previous pelvic infection. Treatment with ovulation induction agents, intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization, donor sperm or eggs, or surgery may be necessary. Unexplained male and female infertility can be treated with intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization. Limiting alcohol intake, avoiding tobacco and illicit drug use, consuming a profertility diet, and losing weight (if obese) may improve pregnancy success rates.",

      "title": "The Fifth Decade",
      "abstract": "HERE is no period in a woman's life that has been so hedged about and distorted by superstitions and laymen theories as the menopause or the fifth decade. Many of these ideas that are passed about from mother to daughter, neighbor to neighbor, and friend to friend, have been the cause of death from diseases that could easily have been prevented, or if not the cause of death, the cause of years of invalidism, perhaps even more distressing. It is a very common notion among women that irregular and great losses of blood are to be expected during the menopause. It is also expected that this period will be the cause of all kinds of nervous disturbances, more especially what is known as flashes. Some think that enlargement of the abdomen, annoyance from intestinal digestion with gas formation is to be expected. Frequency in urination and especially the necessity for urinating during the night is explained by that blanket covering nearly all the ills of the fifth decade, the of life. The normal menopause consists in a lessening of the ovarian secretion, due to the fact that the ova or eggs that have been periodically ripening and being discharged from the ovary from the time that maturity has been established up to the fortieth year of age have now at the fifth decade been nearly all matured and the function of the ovary is rapidly diminishing. The uterus, which normally is the size and shape of a pear, is beginning to atrophy, or shrink. This shrinkage, which starts in the fifth decade, continues until, around the seventieth year, the uterus is often no larger than a thimble. Not only do the ovaries and uterus degenerate naturally and shrink to insignificant size, but the vagina itself and even the lips and enrance to the vagina shrink. With this striking anatomical change there is a corresponding physiological change, which becomes evident by a lessening of the amount of blood lost during menstruation, a shortening of the menstrual days, and a lengthening of the intermenstrual period, and finally, the skipping of the menstrual period. The lessening of the ovarian activity produces a disturbance in the glands known as the endocrine glands. These endocrine glands are made up of the pituitary located in the brain, the thyroid in the neck, the adrenal above the kidney, and the ovarian in the ovary. The action of these glands is more or less interdependent and they control the important and vital actions and functions of the body. When the ovarian secretion is checked, diminished, or absent, these glands must become adjusted, and during this adjustment the patient will undergo symptoms which she will describe as hot flashes, and while they are the normal result of the menopause they are disagreeable and not necessarily to be endured, for they can be relieved by supplying artificially to the system a small amount of glandular secretion for a period of time sufficient to accomplish endocrine adjustment. When symptoms arise pointing to an increase in loss of menstrual blood, to a prolongation of the menstrual period, to the occurrence of intermenstrual bloody discharges, to symptoms of pain or soreness in the lower abdomen, to increase of size in the abdomen, to leukorrheal discharges, to diarrhea or constipation, to an-",

At present, one entity, anencephaly, clearly fulfills both conditions. We studied 10 cases involving fetuses with sonographically diagnosed anencephaly that were aborted during the third trimester. We also examined other fetal disorders and conclude that they do not clearly fulfill our two conditions for the justifiable termination of pregnancy in the third trimester.The question whether to terminate the pregnancy during 3rd trimester involves a moral conflict.

      "abstract": "The International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) new statement on the diagnosis of pregnancy was drawn up in April 1990. A pregnancy diagnosis includes clinical evaluation of the woman's history, symptoms, physical examination, and pregnancy tests. Pregnancy symptoms may include amenorrhea, nausea, vomiting, enlargement and tenderness of the breasts, frequent urination, and changes in appetite and food and drink habits. If biochemical testing is not possible, a reliable clinical diagnosis of pregnancy cannot take place before 6-8 weeks. At this time, the clinician can observe cervical softening and uterine softening and enlargement if a woman is pregnant. If the uterine size does not match the length of amenorrhea, clinicians should suspect the following: earlier or later conception than indicated, ectopic pregnancy, incomplete or missed spontaneous abortion, twin gestation, hydatidiform mole, or other uterine anomaly. They should suspect ectopic pregnancy in women with smaller than expected uterine size when they have been sterilized or are using an IUD or are using low-dose progestogen-only pills or Norplant. They should refer women with smaller than expected uterine size who are experiencing bleeding and/or pain to a more sophisticated clinical facility, where an accurate diagnosis of and adequate treatment for ectopic pregnancy can be done. Biochemical pregnancy tests consist of antibodies that mark human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) from a urine or serum sample. hCG levels increase beginning about 10 days after fertilization. The most convenient and inexpensive pregnancy test for clinics is the immunoassay test (slide test), which requires a urine or serum sample. It can provide reliable results a few days after the missed menstrual period. Clinicians should provide appropriate counseling regardless of whether the client wishes to continue or terminate the pregnancy.",

Risk factors for dysmenorrhea include nulliparity, heavy menstrual flow, smoking, and depression. Empiric therapy can be initiated based on a typical history of painful menses and a negative physical examination Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the initial therapy of choice in patients with presumptive primary dysmenorrhea. Oral contraceptives also may be considered. If pain relief is insufficient, prolonged-cycle oral contraceptives or intravaginal use of oral contraceptive pills can be considered. If dysmenorrheal remains uncontrolled with any of these approaches, pelvic ultrasonography should be performed and referral for laparoscopy should be considered to rule out secondary causes of dysmenorrhea. the use of danazol or leuprolide may be considered and, rarely, hysterectomy.

      "abstract": "In the larger domesticated animals, clinical methods for diagnosing pregnancy are inadequate or unsatisfactory during the first third of the gestation period, and in individual instances for a longer period. In comparison with most other animals, œstrus in horses is markedly erratic, for a pregnant mare may continue to show from one to three apparently normal œstral manifestations after conception, and may even accept service on each occasion. On the other hand, unsuccessful coition, in a considerable proportion of cases, may inhibit a subsequent œstrus. In addition, particularly in highly-bred thoroughbreds, only one œstrus period may, in certain circumstances, be exhibited during a breeding season, and the non-appearance of subsequent heat cannot be regarded as evidence of conception. Neither the clinician nor the owner, therefore, can obtain reliable evidence of the existence of pregnancy from observations of the sexual behaviour of the mare. Clinical methods, necessitating examination of uterus or ovaries by rectal and vaginal methods, are cumbersome, difficult, sometimes dangerous or impossible, owing to the temperament of the mare, and except to the thoroughly experienced vaterinarian these methods do not always yield reliable evidence of pregnancy until from 3/11 to 5/11 of the gestation period have passed. Numerous instances have been encountered where a valuable thoroughbred mare or hunter has been prevented from working in autumn, and during winter has been treated mistakenly as though she were pregnant, sometimes at considerable inconvenience and expense; similarly other mares not infrequently exhibit markedly subnormal subjective signs of pregnancy and may continue to be regarded as barren until a very shot time (sometimes only two weeks) before parturition.",

      "abstract": "an appreciable chance of conceiving. The average duration of this is not known precisely but almost certainly averages under 48 hours.3 Since the time period is so brief, coital frequency has a bearing on conception ease. This relevance is the more assured because of evidence, furnished primarily by the studies of MacLeod and Gold,4 indicating that coital frequency can be increased without jeopardizing virility, except possibly in cases where the increase is to very high levels or the male is oligospermatic. Any relationship of coital frequency to contraceptive effectiveness is more speculative. Strong libido, reflected in high levels of sexual activity, may contribute to less effective contraception by generating more occasions for chance-taking and, in the case of rhythm, by making continence more difficult to maintain during the unsafe period. Having a less direct but potentially important bearing on conception ease and contraceptive effectiveness is knowledge of the fertile period with reference to its timing within the",

There are many factors which influence the success or failure of breastfeeding including physical, emotional, and social factors. However, the barriers of breastfeeding could be occurred at the first time of breastfeeding in labor room such as stress, analgesic administration during the second stage of labor, cesarean section, or the separation of mother and their child after birth. Thus, obstetricians and nurse-midwives need to realize about those obstacles and help a mother to initiate her breastfeeding right away after delivery or within half an hour after delivery. This practice is important because it can help the mother to continue her successfully breastfeeding during the postpartum period.",

Sebanyak 90% dari remaja wanita di seluruh dunia mengalami masalah saat haid dan lebih dari 50% dari wanita haid mengalami dismenore primer. Dismenore primer merupakan nyeri haid yang tidak didasari kondisi patologis, sedangkan dismenore sekunder merupakan nyeri haid yang didasari dengan kondisi patologis. Dismenore primer terjadi karena peningkatan prostaglandin (PG) F2-alfa yang merupakan suatu siklooksigenase (COX-2) yang mengakibatkan hipertonus dan vasokonstriksi pada miometrium sehingga terjadi iskemia dan nyeri pada bagian bawah perut. Bentuk dismenore yang banyak dialami oleh remaja adalah kekakuan atau kejang dibagian bawah perut. Rasanya sangat tidak nyaman sehingga menyebabkan mudah marah, gampang tersinggung, mual, muntah, kenaikan berat badan, perut kembung, punggung terasa nyeri, sakit kepala, timbul jerawat, tegang, lesu, dan depresi. Terdapat beberapa faktor risiko yang memengaruhi terjadinya dismenore. Dalam beberapa literatur faktor risiko yang sering berkaitan dengan dismenore yaitu menarke usia dini, riwayat keluarga dengan keluhan dismenore, indeks masa tubuh yang tidak normal, kebiasaan memakan makanan cepat saji, durasi perdarahan saat haid, terpapar asap rokok, konsumsi kopi dan alexythimia.

      "abstract": "Prematurity is a major cause of perinatal mortality and short-and long-term morbidity.Preterm birth before 34 weeks constitutes 40% of total and contributes to majority of mortality and morbidity.Threatened preterm labour (PTL) is diagnosed by painful palpable uterine contraction at least once per 10 minutes and may or may not be associated with cervical changes.Calcium-channel blocker and oxytocin antagonist were shown to delay delivery by 7 days, β2 -agonist drugs delay by 48 hrs., respectively, but they carry more side effects.Magnesium sulfate has not been proved to have effective tocolytic action.There is insufficient data about the effects on the baby of these tocolytic drugs.Progesterone is essential for the maintenance of pregnancy and acts by establishing uterine quiescence and maintaining cervical length by different mechanisms.Progesterone has been administered as oral capsule, vaginal gel or suppository, or intramuscularly in different trials to show the efficacy and safety of progesterone in prevention of recurrent preterm delivery.Different routes have variable efficacy and different side effect profiles when used in preterm labour.The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of vaginal micronized progesterone compared to intramuscular 17 α OH progesterone caproate in management of threatened preterm labour before 34 weeks of gestation.METHODS 100 pregnant women with threatened preterm labour before 34 weeks of gestation and fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized into two groups.One group received vaginal micronized progesterone 200 mg twice daily and other group received I/M 17 α OH progesterone caproate 250 mg twice in a week.Cases were followed up till 6 weeks postpartum. RESULTSEfficacy and tolerability of progesterone in two different routes for prevention of PTL were compared by statistical analysis of data using chi-square test and student-t test.Efficacy of both routes is similar as determined by primary outcome like gestational age at delivery admission, delivery interval, and birth weight.Vaginal group has significantly lesser side effects in comparison to IM group. CONCLUSIONSVaginal progesterone was as effective as intramuscular progesterone in reducing preterm birth in threatened preterm birth with fewer side effects in vaginal route.Larger studies are required to confirm the findings.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Urinary incontinence is an embarrassing problem that affects more and more women. The most common type of incontinene in women is stress urinary incontinence, which is defined as the involuntary loss of urine caused by an abnormal closure of the urethra. It happens most often during exercise, coughing or sneezing. The problem of urinary incontinence is extremely important due to the accompanying impact on the psyche of women. It causes a disturbance of self-esteem and is often a cause of embarrassment before visiting a doctor. Results: The pathogenesis of urine loss is multifactorial, but in recent times a lot of blame has been placed on the changes taking place in the body during pregnancy and childbirth. Childbirth weakens the pelvic floor muscles, causing temporary or permanent urine loss. The diagnosis of urinary incontinence is based on the basis of a carefully collected medical history, physical examination and additional tests. Conclusion: Physiotherapeutic procedures, pharmacological treatment and surgical treatment are used as a therapeutic procedures. Prophylactic pelvic floor muscle exercises also play an important role. The most popular treatment for stress urinary incontinence is physiotherapy, including Kegel exercises. The awareness of women about the problem of urinary incontinence should be increased to prevent them from limiting their daily activities and deteriorating sexual activity.",

In some women, this feeling develops into fear of childbirth which might have negative consequences on both the mother and the baby. This case study describes the anxiety experienced by Mrs. G, a 27-years-old primigravida, which caused obstacles in the labor process. The anxiety arose because Mrs. G had no felt any signs of labor until a week after the due date. Counseling and personal approaches are carried out to deal with anxiety, as well as the use of hot herbal compress for relaxation. Meanwhile, uterine contraction was induced naturally by doing oxytocin massage and acupressure on the BL 67 point. Midwifery care provided in this case could reduce anxiety and stimulate uterine contractions to initiate the labor process. Comprehensive and continuous support and assistance from health workers is needed to obtain optimal midwifery care outcomes.",

      "abstract": "At the end of war, and other times of both chronic and acute stress, remarkable changes occur in the human secondary (birth) sex ratio. At the end of a long war, significantly more boys are born; after a short war, or disaster, fewer boys than usual are born six to nine months later. Since it is commonly held that the sex of the offspring is a matter of chance, these data provide an intriguing problem; but new findings in reproductive physiology, and an increased understanding of male vulnerability, could help resolve it. It appears the sex ratio of offspring may be influenced by variations in the mother's follicular testosterone. Under conditions of chronic stress, maternal testosterone rises, resulting in an increase in male conceptions; but these same stressful conditions also exacerbate differential male vulnerability, so more males are lost during pregnancy. At the end of war, improving conditions temper male vulnerability, leaving higher sex ratios at birth. Conversely, normal conditions at conception followed by a severe stressor during pregnancy result in lower secondary sex ratios.",

Symptoms commonly occur during the late premenstruum; at ovulation and during the premenstruum; or at ovulation, gradually increasing in severity throughout the luteal phase. To diagnose PMS, three consecutive menstrual cycles must be charted, the symptoms must be limited to the luteal phase, and there must be a complete absence of symptoms for at least one week in the postmenstruum. Rational treatment programs for mild, moderate and severe PMS are proposed. The role of progesterone in treatment is discussed.",

Complications (respiratory distress, intestinal obstruction) are more frequent during the third trimester, during delivery and in the post-partum hours. In the asymptomatic patient, surgery should be performed specially in the first and second trimesters. During the third trimester, fetal maturity should be watched and the defect should be repaired at the time of elective cesarean section. Active labor should be avoided because of the increased abdominal pressure produced during the expulsion period. If an unexpected labor occurs, forceps application, if cesarean section could not be performed, should be realised. If signs of respiratory distress or of obstruction arise at any time, immediate repair should be undertaken, regardless of the age of pregnancy. An hernia operated before the pregnancy could recur during this one (this is the case of the author).

Very often sex instruction is faulty, although the AIDS campaigns have led to remarkable improvements (condoms). Instructions for sexual behaviour should take place at home or at school, but not in the street. Nevertheless, the first intercourse occurs mostly unprotected. Teenage pregnancies present not only physical but also psychological problems. Termination of pregnancy means an especially difficult decision for the adolescent girl, often causes crisis and occasionally leads to negative consequences for later fertility. The choice of appropriate contraceptive methods for girls under 16 years of age may also have legal problems. Condoms and barrier methods are possible alternatives to the much safer hormonal contraception with the combination, sequence or minipill. Under certain circumstances, a progestin injection every three months or the 'morning-after pill' as postcoital contraception or, in the case of an abortion or of pregnancy termination, even an intrauterine device can be an alternative for adolescent girls under those exceptional circumstances.",

This is a female specific illness and is one of the women’s health problems that negatively impacts quality of life (QOL). The causes of prolapse are multifactorial. However, it is primarily associated with vaginal delivery, which leads to pelvic floor muscle and connective tissue injury. POP presents with various symptoms that may include urinary, bowel, and/or sexual dysfunction. Available POP treatments vary according to the degree of the prolapse symptoms. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is the treatment of first choice for mild POP (evidence level Ⅰ, recommended grade A). In Japan, it is not yet covered by health insurance, so patients have limited opportunities to learn about correct PFMT under the diagnosis from a specialist physician in pelvic floor disorder.

Workup may include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, fecal guaiac testing, fecal ova and parasite testing, or urinalysis. Pregnancy testing and screening for sexually transmitted infections should be considered in adolescents or if there are concerns about sexual abuse. Abdominal radiography can be helpful for diagnosing obstruction or constipation. Abdominal ultrasonography identifies an abnormality in up to 10% of children with RAP who meet criteria for further workup, compared with 1% of those who do not meet these criteria. Functional abdominal pain is a clinical diagnosis and no workup is needed. Management of functional abdominal pain focuses on improving quality of life, reducing parent and child concerns about the seriousness of the condition, and reducing the disability associated with pain rather than complete resolution of pain. Although evidence is lacking for most pharmacologic treatments of functional abdominal pain, psychological therapies such as cognitive behavior therapy and hypnotherapy have been shown to be beneficial.",

      "abstract": "Il dolore coitale e il sintomo principe di due disturbi sessuali: la dispareunia e il vaginismo, oggi inclusi nella categoria dei disturbi sessuali caratterizzati da dolore. La dispareunia ha solide basi biologiche: la sede del dolore e le sue caratteristiche sono i piu forti fattori predittivi della sua origine organica. I fattori biologici includono cause ormonali, infiammatorie, muscolari, iatrogene, neurologiche, vascolari, connettivali e immunologiche. La vestibolite vulvare e la etiologia piu frequente di dispareunia introitale cronica in eta fertile. Le caratteristiche cardinali della vestibolite vulvare sono riassumibili nella iper-attivazione del: a) sistema immunitario, specie dei mastociti vestibolari; b) del sistema nervoso, con viraggio del dolore da “nocicettivo” a “neuropatico”; c) del sistema muscolare, con iperattivita del muscolo elevatore dell’ano. Le altre etiologie di dispareunia introitale e profonda verranno discusse con attenzione ai criteri di diagnosi differenziale. Il vaginismo e un disturbo sessuale caratterizzato da un variabile spasmo del muscolo elevatore in risposta al tentativo di penetrazione e da una variabile fobia del\r\ncoito. Puo esservi o meno una risposta muscolare sistemica di allarme. Il vaginismo di grado severo impedisce la penetrazione, ed e la causa femminile piu frequente di matrimonio non consumato. Nei casi piu lievi il vaginismo consente la penetrazione causando tuttavia dispareunia.\r\nLa diagnosi dei disturbi sessuali caratterizzati da dolore dovrebbe considerare i fattori predisponenti, precipitanti e di mantenimento. Di ciascuno dovrebbe considerare i fattori biologici, psicosessuali e relazionali, che possono variare nella singola donna e coppia.Il ginecologo e lo specialista che per formazione e competenza fisiopatologica ha la massima probabilita di poter aiutare la donna con terapie risolutive anche sul fronte del dolore sessuale.",

      "abstract": "Introducao: A dor lombar e pelvica e uma queixa comum na populacao em geral, sendo um sintoma frequentemente relatado durante a gestacao. Objetivos: Determinar a prevalencia e as caracteristicas da lombalgia em gestantes, bem como apontar possiveis fatores de risco relacionados a esta dor e o efeito do exercicio fisico como meio de intervencao e prevencao em gestantes foram os objetivos do presente estudo. Metodo: Para tanto, foi realizada uma pesquisa bibliografica em publicacoes nacionais e internacionais indexadas no periodo de 1997 a 2007, em quatro bases de dados, sendo elas LILACS, MEDLINE, SCIENCEDIRECT e SCIELO, sendo relacionados 25 artigos que tratassem do tema. Resultados: Os resultados demonstraram que mais da metade das gestantes sofrem de dor lombar e/ ou pelvica durante algum periodo da gestacao. Os provaveis motivos para a lombalgia, durante esse periodo estao ligados a acao do hormonio relaxina que provoca mudancas na mobilidade articular e ligamentar, tornando-as mais instavel e suscetivel a lesoes e a dor. E evidenciado que as dores aumentam principalmente se a mulher apresentava esta queixa antes de engravidar, alem disso, esse sintoma pode perdurar no periodo pos-parto e acabar gerando intervencao na realizacao das atividades diarias e profissionais, acarretando prejuizo na qualidade de vida e na saude geral. Conclusao: Dessa forma, muitos programas de exercicios fisicos estao sendo propostos para diminuir a intensidade da dor ou prevenir sua ocorrencia. Algumas atividades, como ginastica aquatica, natacao, yoga e alongamentos sao indicadas para esse publico, demonstrando eficiencia na prevencao, reducao e/ou alivio definitivo.",

It is important that he should be familiar with all the more prominent symptoms of an accidental misplacement or deviation from lines of normal pregnancy. All cases of suspected pregnancy in women who have had a longer or shorter period of sterility, should be carefully watched in the early months for symptoms of tubal gestation. I do not know of a single case of rupture, or the history of rupture with well marked symptoms of loss of blood, that the rupture did not take place before the twelfth week. All these cases must of necessity first pass through the hands of the general practitioner, and are lost or saved through their appreciation",

Experience and research have led to important breakthroughs, but there is currently no 100% effective treatment devoid of complications. As treatments have changed, the materials and access routes have given way to complications not previously reported that have sometimes been fatal. ObGyns, urologists and urogynecologists that perform surgical procedures for urinary incontinence would like to have the best kit and none of the reported complications, but in actuality, everyone has such complications. Every surgeon wonders: What was the cause of this complication? How will it be resolved? How is it classified? For future patients, how can such a complication be prevented? There have been reports of erosion and/or extrusion of material in new kits or devices for urinary incontinence in the urethra, bladder, vagina and ureter; as well as bleedings during the surgical procedure with injury to the pelvic or vaginal vessels, suburethral hematomas, intestinal perforation, voiding dysfunction, nerve lesions, bladder perforation, infections and abscesses, de novo overactive bladder, pelvic pain, necrotizing fasciitis and even death.",

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic and non-treatable pain condition resulting in lifetime disability due to a tendency to relapse. Both diseases present with chronic pain and neuropathy. We aimed to report a unique patient with successful pregnancy and delivery although she had both CES and CRPS. Here we present a female who was diagnosed as CES with CRPS after fall from a high building about 10 years previously. She became pregnant after two miscarriages, maintained her pregnancy with numerous pain killers and finally delivered a healthy baby vaginally. Interestingly, during her parturition, she was tolerable with labor pain unlike her chronic pain that came from CES and CRPS. She is a unique and significant case because of the rare condition that has two pain-associated diseased and success of vaginal delivery without any complication during pregnancy. This case may be helpful in counselling attending physicians and may inspire other pre-existing CES or CRPS patients who are afraid to decide on pregnancy.",

However, few studies have examined these relationships. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships among stress, fatigue, depression, and cytokines as markers of immune modulation in prenatal and postpartum women. Women completed questionnaires and gave blood samples during late pregnancy and again at 4–6 weeks postpartum. Blood was analyzed for cytokines as measures of immune modulation. Stress, fatigue, and depression were experienced at moderately high levels, with higher levels of fatigue and depression in the postpartum but higher stress in the prenatal period. Levels of several cytokines were increased in the postpartum over the prenatal period. Stress and depression were related in the prenatal period and stress, depression, and fatigue were related in the postpartum. While various cytokines were related to each other in both periods, only stress was related to MIP-1 β , a cytokine that may be important for childbirth processes. More studies, especially longitudinal and interventional studies, are needed to increase our knowledge about etiology, patterns, symptoms, factors, and management of maternal distress. The search for reliable biomarkers for at-risk mothers remains a priority.",

The diagnosis of the uterine inversion is mainly supported by clinical symptoms. It is based on three elements: haemorrhage, shock and a strong pelvic pain. The immediate treatment of the uterine inversion is required. It is based on a medical reanimation associated with firstly a manual reduction then surgical treatment using various techniques.

      "abstract": "Urinary incontinence as a consequence of an insufficient urethral closure mechanism (urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence, USMI) or an impaired storing capacity of the urinary bladder is a considerable side effect of castration in the female dog. Different factors such as breed, body weight and time of spaying have an impact on the risk of urinary incontinence. Loss of urine while the patient is recumbent is the most typical symptom which is first observed at a mean time of 2.8 years after castration. Diagnosis is obtained by excluding other causes, whereas a precise patient history is particularly helpful. Therapy is aimed at increasing the closing pressure of the urethra and/or the compliance of the urinary bladder. Usually success can be achieved by medical therapy, thus surgical intervention is normally not required. In addition to urinary incontinence, coat changes can be observed as an undesirable effect of castration in certain dog breeds. To date, the pathophysiology of decreased urethral closing pressure, altered storing function of the urinary bladder and coat changes induced by castration are still not fully understood. Apart from the well-known hypothesis of estrogen deficiency, altered secretion of the hypothalamic and pituitary hormones GnRH, FSH and LH due to castration may have an influence. In addition to a-adrenergic medication, Flavoxate and Estriol, depot formulations of GnRH analogues have been successfully used to treat urinary incontinence. These depot formulations have also been described for the treatment of coat changes due to spaying.",

      "abstract": "Background In 2012, the Board of Directors of the International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health (ISSWSH) and the Board of Trustees of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) acknowledged the need to review current terminology associated with genitourinary tract symptoms related to menopause.Methods The two societies cosponsored a terminology consensus conference, which was held in May 2013.Results and Conclusion Members of the consensus conference agreed that the term genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is a medically more accurate, all-encompassing, and publicly acceptable term than vulvovaginal atrophy. GSM is defined as a collection of symptoms and signs associated with a decrease in estrogen and other sex steroids involving changes to the labia majora/minora, clitoris, vestibule/introitus, vagina, urethra and bladder. The syndrome may include but is not limited to genital symptoms of dryness, burning, and irritation; sexual symptoms of lack of lubrication, discomfort or pain, and impaired function; and urinary symptoms of urgency, dysuria and recurrent urinary tract infections. Women may present with some or all of the signs and symptoms, which must be bothersome and should not be better accounted for by another diagnosis. The term was presented and discussed at the annual meeting of each society. The respective Boards of NAMS and ISSWSH formally endorsed the new terminology – genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) – in 2014.",

Dyspareunia may be superficial, causing pain with attempted vaginal insertion, or deep. Women with sexual pain are at increased risk of sexual dysfunction, relationship distress, diminished quality of life, anxiety, and depression. Because discussing sexual issues may be uncomfortable, clinicians should create a safe and welcoming environment when taking a sexual history, where patients describe the characteristics of the pain (e.g., location, intensity, duration). Physical examination of the external genitalia includes visual inspection and sequential pressure with a cotton swab, assessing for focal erythema or pain. A single-digit vaginal examination may identify tender pelvic floor muscles, and a bimanual examination can assess for uterine retroversion and pelvic masses. Common diagnoses include vulvodynia, inadequate lubrication, vaginal atrophy, postpartum causes, pelvic floor dysfunction, endometriosis, and vaginismus. Treatment is focused on the cause and may include lubricants, pelvic floor physical therapy, topical analgesics, vaginal estrogen, cognitive behavior therapy, vaginal dilators, modified vestibulectomy, or onabotulinumtoxinA injections.",

      "abstract": "Childbirth, often known as labor and delivery, is the procedure that ends a pregnancy and takes place when one or more infants are delivered vaginally or through cesarean section from the mother’s body. Primigravidae experience several physical and emotional changes, which can make them nervous about the birthing process. The pathological fear of pregnancy known as “childbirth fear” is one factor that can contribute to a woman delaying her delivery. It has been found that a woman’s level of childbirth self-efficacy, which is also referred to as labor and delivery confidence, is a crucial indicator of how well she will be able to cope with the physical and emotional challenges that come with giving birth. Prenatal education, prenatal counseling, prenatal training, and role-playing are all examples of psychoeducational intervention techniques that have been shown to have a significant impact on a variety of psychological outcomes, including attitudes toward childbirth, fears associated with childbirth, depression, fear, and anxiety. Their expectations for the birth procedure were elevated as a result of solutionfocused counseling, midwife-supported psychotherapy, and a midwife-led integrated pre-birth training program.",

      "title": "El papel del ejercicio en el dolor menstrual",
      "abstract": "&#x0D; La dismenorrea se define como calambres dolorosos en la zona de la pelvis que ocurren inmediatamente antes o durante la menstruación. La dismenorrea se clasifica en primaria y secundaria. Se considera que es primaria cuando no hay una enfermedad o trastorno que esté provocando los calambres, a diferencia de la secundaria. La dismenorrea primaria generalmente se puede diagnosticar y diferenciar de la secundaria con los antecedentes familiares, así como con un examen abdominal.&#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; La dismenorrea primaria es un problema ginecológico común entre las mujeres en edad reproductiva. Es responsable de reducir tanto la calidad de vida de dichas mujeres como su participación en actividades deportivas y sociales. Además, puede llegar a provocar ausencias en el trabajo y la escuela y trastornos del sueño. A veces también pueden presentarse otros síntomas como dolores de espalda y miembros inferiores, dolores de cabeza, diarrea, náuseas y vómitos.&#x0D; A pesar de que no se conoce todavía el motivo por el que aparece la dismenorrea primaria, la teoría más aceptada es que se produce una liberación excesiva de prostaglandinas en el flujo menstrual. Las prostaglandinas son unas sustancias que regulan numerosas funciones en diferentes zonas del cuerpo. En este caso, los niveles elevados de prostaglandinas provocan contracciones repetidas del útero, reduciendo el flujo sanguíneo de este órgano y haciendo que las células tengan un déficit de oxígeno. Este último hecho, se manifiesta en la mujer como dolor pélvico, es decir, dolor en la zona baja del abdomen. También parece que las citocinas proinflamatorias, un tipo de proteínas que favorecen la inflamación, pueden estar involucradas en la dismenorrea primaria.&#x0D; La mayoría de las mujeres maneja sus síntomas con antiinflamatorios no esteroideos o AINEs, una clase de medicamentos que disminuyen o quitan el dolor, como el ibuprofeno, y estrategias de autocuidado, como el reposo y la aplicación de calor. Sin embargo, hay mujeres que no toleran bien estos medicamentos, que rechazan tomarlos por sus efectos adversos o en las que las estrategias de autocuidado no muestran resultados positivos. Así, el ejercicio físico se puede plantear como una alternativa al tratamiento habitual o un complemento de los antiinflamatorios no esteroideos.El tipo de ejercicio físico que se ha estudiado para mejorar los síntomas de la dismenorrea primaria es el aeróbico. No obstante, los estudios de investigación son escasos en este campo.&#x0D; “El principal efecto del ejercicio aeróbico en la dismenorrea primaria es la reducción de la intensidad del dolor”&#x0D; La revisión sistemática realizada en 2019 por Armour y sus colaboradores sugiere que el ejercicio aeróbico, realizado durante aproximadamente 45 a 60 minutos, tres veces por semana o más, independientemente de su intensidad, puede proporcionar una reducción significativa en la intensidad del dolor menstrual en comparación con la inactividad.&#x0D; Un estudio publicado en mayo de 2019 por Priya Kannan y sus colaboradores, investigadora de la universidad de Otago en Nueva Zelanda cuya línea de investigación se centra en el ejercicio físico para el manejo del dolor menstrual, apoya la disminución del dolor mencionada anteriormente y añade otros efectos del ejercicio aeróbico en la dismenorrea primaria. En este estudio 70 mujeres fueron divididas en dos grupos. Un grupo no recibió intervención, mientras que el otro realizó ejercicio aeróbico supervisado durante 4 semanas, seguido de ejercicio en casa durante los 6 meses posteriores. El ejercicio aeróbico se realizó tres veces por semana en una cinta de correr y fue de alta intensidad. Cabe recalcar que las participantes se ejercitaron entre periodos menstruales, es decir, el ejercicio no se realizó durante la semana de la menstruación. Los investigadores hallaron que el grupo que realizó ejercicio aeróbico obtuvo mejoras significativas en la intensidad e interferencia del dolor, así como en la calidad de vida.&#x0D; “Es todavía una incógnita si los efectos del ejercicio aeróbico son superiores a los producidos por los antiinflamatorios”&#x0D; Se necesita un mayor número de estudios para esclarecer por qué y cómo el ejercicio aeróbico es efectivo para el tratamiento de la dismenorrea primaria. Es probable que diferentes intensidades de ejercicio actúen de distintas maneras. El ejercicio de intensidad moderada a alta puede reducir el dolor al aumentar las citocinas antiinflamatorias, un tipo de proteínas que reducen la inflamación, y reducir el flujo menstrual, de manera que disminuye la cantidad total de prostaglandinas liberadas. El ejercicio menos intenso, puede reducir los niveles de una hormona llamada cortisol, que a su vez puede reducir la producción de prostaglandinas.&#x0D; Se requieren futuros estudios de mayor calidad para responder a varias incógnitas que se exponen a continuación. No está claro si hacer ejercicio con menos frecuencia o por una duración más corta que la mencionada tendría los mismos resultados. Además, se desconoce si el ejercicio aeróbico tiene algún beneficio en comparación con los AINEs. Por último, en la mayoría de los estudios el ejercicio aeróbico se realiza entre periodos menstruales y, por lo tanto, no está claro si el ejercicio durante el período menstrual tendría efectos similares.&#x0D; Conclusión&#x0D; El ejercicio aeróbico puede reportar varios beneficios a la gran cantidad de mujeres que sufren dismenorrea primaria, al actuar sobre la intensidad e interferencia del dolor y la calidad de vida. Podría recomendarse, con cierta reserva, como una herramienta útil para el manejo de la dismenorrea primaria de forma solitaria o en combinación con otras modalidades de tratamiento, principalmente los antiinflamatorios no esteroideos. Aun así, es necesario continuar investigando porque la evidencia de su efectividad es escasa, la calidad de los estudios es baja, los mecanismos por los cuales actúa no están claros y también para resolver los interrogantes planteados.&#x0D;",

      "abstract": "In virgin female Microtus ochrogaster, increases in uterine weight, indicative of reproductive activation, were observed as early as 20 days of age. Exposure to an unfamiliar adult male for a period of 1 h or less induced, within 48 h, increases in uterine weight lasting for at least 10 days. Applications of male urine induced increases in uterine weight equivalent to those observed in females exposed to additional visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli from the male; urine from castrated males was less effective than urine from intact males. Direct physical contact with intact males or their urine was essential to reproductive activation, and visual or air-borne cues were not adequate. Sibling male-female pairs of this species do not ordinarily reproduce, probably due to the failure of the female to become reproductively active. Estrus and subsequent reproduction were induced, however, by applications of sibling male urine to the female's upper lip, suggesting a behavioral barrier to reproduction among siblings.",

      "abstract": "The pressure exerted on the fetal head during the second stage of labor was continuously measured in 42 spontaneous deliveries with a new instrument. The pressure values were correlated to various obstetric variables. Typically, the head pressure remained elevated beyond the end of the uterine contraction in primiparae, whereas it decreased simultaneously with the amniotic pressure in multiparae. On the average, the head pressure was higher in primiparae indicating, together with the longer lasting bearing down period, a higher resistance of the birth canal. Deliveries with pudendal block or peridural analgesia showed no differences, but these two groups differed in other factors which might have influenced the results. Infusion of oxytocin during the course of labor was associated with higher head pressure values that could not be deduced from the hormone administration per se, but from a higher resistance of the birth canal. Maternal age did not influence the head pressure. Within physiological limits, the head pressure was independent from the size of the child and the maternal pelvis.",

This is a very common presentation in the gynaecology services. In the pregnant patient the underlying cause may be pregnancy related or non-pregnancy related. Assessment and diagnosis are often challenging due to the influence of pregnancy on maternal physiology and the very wide range of differential diagnoses [1]. Abdominal pain is a very common symptom in pregnancy that most often resolves without much intervention. This observation may make the clinician complacent and therefore less suspicious of more serious or life-threatening underlying pathology. Diagnostic evaluation is further complicated by altered reference ranges of laboratory tests.

See Pregnancy, p.333. Traumatic bleeding The most common cause of vaginal trauma is consensual intercourse. Trauma may occur as a result of insufficient lubrication or personal sexual preferences. Insertion of FBs into the vagina may also cause trauma. It is important to exclude abuse. The patient should be given privacy and time in which to discuss these issues should she wish. Straddle injuries, where the patient falls aside an object such as a bicycle, can result in lacerations and trauma to the vagina has also been reported following the use of water slides, where the hydrostatic pressure can cause lacerations. All but the most minor of vaginal lacerations require an expert review.",

Currently, abortion is the most common early reproductive failure. In Poland, more than 40 000 pregnant women a year lose pregnancy due to various reasons. There are many reports in literature on the risk of somatic consequences of miscarriage, while extra-somatic complications resulting from exposure to the strong influence of anxiety and stress, such as, for example: depression and psychosomatic disorders have not been paid too much attention to, yet. Abortion is accompanied by stress and a lot of negative emotions, such as anxiety. They may intensify both due to hospitalization and the need to implement treatment. These negative emotions destroy cognitive power of women, depriving them of their confidence, they can exacerbate the sense of danger, lead to stress and hinder treatment.",

Ask the mother to pull the pants or undergarments below the knee while a blanket covers the patient. Always wear gloves. Answer succinctly any questions the patient raises. Inspect pubic hair, mons pubis, labia majora, labia minora, clitoris, urethral meatus, and vaginal introitus for presence, location, infestations, appearance, and discharge. A large clitoris (a glans wider than 10 mm) may be normal or an isolated physical finding; however, it may indicate adrenal hyperplasia or any of the conditions associated with precocious puberty defined as occurring before age 8 years (7 years in African Americans) in girls. The clitoris may not develop in adolescent girls with hypopituitarism or gonadal dysgenesis. The external genitalia grow very little until adolescence starts. In early puberty, a rectal examination and an examination with the girl on the examining table with the knees bent and the soles of the feet flat allows the patient to hold the labia apart when this exam is indicated. Show the equipment to be used and explain any expected pain or pressure. Pubic hair stages (Figure 15.1) are useful in quantifying development. Urethral discharges are always pathologic in childhood and may indicate infection anywhere in the urinary tract. A flaming red area around the end of the urethra may be caused by prolapse of the urethral mucosa. An eccentric mass near the urethra may be a cyst, urethral polyp, papilloma, caruncle, condyloma, sarcoma botryoides, prolapsed ureterocele, or periurethral abscess.",

      "title": "Efectos del ejercicio físico en el perfil esteroideo urinario femenino: tras una actividad física intensa de corta duración, y tras un programa de entrenamiento de fuerza donde se valoran las fases del ciclo menstrual",
      "abstract": "espanolEl ejercicio fisico constituye un modelo de estres cientificamente demostrado en multitud de estudios; estres que abarca al plano fisiologico, y que se pone de manifiesto por una alteracion en el sistema endocrino, que puede ser transitoria ante ejercicio fisico intenso, o mas o menos permanente ante ejercicio cronico. Una de estas alteraciones transitorias es la elevacion de las hormonas de estres, los glucocorticoides, pero si el ejercicio se realiza de forma continuada, con cierta intensidad y, sobre todo, a nivel competitivo, se han descrito alteraciones en la produccion de hormonas sexuales que, en la mujer, pueden conducir a irregularidades menstruales transitorias de mayor o menor relevancia, siendo habitual los casos de oligomenorrea y menos frecuentes los casos de infertilidad. Asi pues, el estres fisico y emocional asociado tanto al ejercicio intenso como a las competiciones puede alterar el eje hipotalamo-pituitario-adrenal y/u ovarico. Pero no todos los tipos de ejercicio fisico y programas de entrenamiento producen las mismas alteraciones del sistema hormonal endocrino, concluyendo muchos autores que las adaptaciones cronicas, y las variables en el diseno del programa de entrenamiento, son altamente especificas del tipo de ejercicio realizado. Por ello, hemos realizado un estudio del efecto de dos tipos diferentes de ejercicio fisico sobre la excrecion urinaria de hormonas esteroideas en mujeres jovenes y deportistas, una es un partido de competicion de balonmano, y otra es un entrenamiento de fuerza de intensidad submaxima, durante 3 dias a la semana, y durante 3 ciclos menstruales consecutivos, y se ha comparado con la excrecion urinaria de mujeres sedentarias del mismo grupo de edad. Hemos valorado la excrecion urinaria durante 3 fases del ciclo menstrual, la fase folicular temprana, o fase de menstruacion, la fase folicular media, y la fase lutea media. La tecnica analitica utilizada ha sido la cromatografia de gases-espectrometria de masas (GC/MS). Tambien creemos que es innovador el estudio realizado en la excrecion de un grupo de hormonas esteroideas hasta ahora poco valoradas en la practica deportiva, como son los metabolitos de la progesterona, hormona sexual importantisima para mantener los ciclos menstruales normales. Los resultados obtenidos sugieren que la competicion deportiva produce, en mujeres jovenes, una respuesta diferente en la excrecion urinaria de hormonas esteroideas, manifestada por un incremento muy significativo de las hormonas catabolicas, a la que produce un entrenamiento de fuerza de intensidad submaxima durante 3 ciclos menstruales consecutivos. Tambien que el perfil urinario esteroideo de mujeres deportistas puede ser mas anabolico que el de mujeres no deportistas, ya que hemos comprobado un incremento en las relaciones entre hormonas anabolicas y catabolicas, pero solo en una fase menstrual este incremento ha resultado significativo. Otro aspecto relevante ha sido que el entrenamiento de fuerza realizado condujo a las participantes a un incremento de la fuerza maxima, y este incremento estuvo acompanado de un balance claramente mas anabolico que catabolico en las distintas fases de su ciclo menstrual. EnglishA vast number of scientific studies have demonstrated that physical exercise constitutes a model of stress: stress on a physiological level, which is highlighted by an alteration of the endocrine system, which may be transitory before intense physical exercise, or more or less permanent before chronic exercise. One of these transitory alterations is the rise in stress hormones, glucocorticoids, but if the exercise is continuous, and at a certain intensity, and, especially, at a competitive level, alterations in the production of sex hormones have been observed which, in women, may lead to temporary menstrual irregularities to a greater or lesser degree, and cases of oligomenorrhea and less frequently cases of infertility. Therefore, physical and emotional stress associated with both intense exercise and competitions may alter the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and/or the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Nevertheless not all kinds of physical exercise and training programmes produce the same alterations in the endocrine hormonal system, many authors having concluded that chronic adaptations, and the design variables of the training programme, are highly specific according to the type of exercise carried out. For this reason, we carried out a study of the effect of two different kinds of physical exercise on the urinary excretion of steroid hormones in young sportswomen, one is a competitive handball match, and the other one is sub-maximal intensity strength training, 3 days a week, and during 3 consecutive menstrual cycles, and the results were compared to the urinary excretion of sedentary women of the same age group. We assessed the urinary excretion during 3 phases of the menstrual cycle, the early follicular phase, or menstrual phase, the mid-follicular phase, and the mid-luteal phase. The analytic technique used was gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC/MS). We believe that the study carried out of the excretion of a group of steroid hormones which have not been assessed much in sports practice until now, such as progesterone metabolites, a sex hormone of upmost importance to maintain normal menstrual cycles, is innovative. The results obtained suggest that sports competition produces, in young women, a different response in the urinary excretion of steroid hormones, shown by a very significant increase in catabolic hormones, when compared to the response produced by sub-maximal intensity strength training during 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Also, the urinary steroid hormone profile of sportswomen may be more anabolic than in non-sportswomen, since we observed an increase in the anabolic and catabolic hormone ratios, but this increase was only significant during one of the phases of the menstrual cycle. Another relevant fact is that the strength training carried out led to an increase in the participants' maximum strength, and this increase was accompanied by a clear hormonal balance that was more anabolic than catabolic during the menstrual phase of their menstrual cycles.",

      "title": "Differentiation of sexual behaviour in pigs",
      "abstract": "Summary. Behaviour in pigs is sexually dimorphic as early as 1 month of age; mounting of penmates is observed more frequently for males than for females. This mounting reaches its highest frequency during the 2nd month of life and then declines to a low frequency in prepubertal pigs. During the prepubertal period (3-5 months of age), bipotentiality of sexual behaviour is apparent in boars because they will not only mount oestrous females but they are also receptive to mounts by older, mature boars. If males are castrated during neonatal development (first 2 months of life) and treated acutely with oestrogen during adulthood, they display sexual behaviour that is characteristic of females; i.e. show a selective preference to remain near mature boars in a choice test, are receptive to mounts by mature boars, and have a short latency to receptivity after contact with a mature boar. Males that are castrated at 6 months of age or later, or males that are castrated neonatally and treated chronically with oestrogen or testosterone during the prepubertal period, display significantly less female behaviour after acute oestrogen treatment than do males castrated neonatally. Additionally, exposure of females to elevated testosterone during early fetal development results in no detectable changes in oestrous behaviour as adults. These observations support the hypothesis that defeminization of sexual behaviour in boars occurs as a result of elevated testicular steroids during pubertal development. The limited data available on masculine sexual behaviour in pigs indicate an activational role for gonadal steroids with little evidence for true masculinization per se. After prolonged testosterone treatment of mature females or males that are castrated before puberty, considerable courtship and mounting behaviours are exhibited by these individuals when placed with oestrous females. Studies have not evaluated differential sensitivity of such animals to dosage or duration of testosterone treatment. Differentiation of sexual behaviour in boars therefore involves primarily a loss of sensitivity to display female-typical behaviours. Presently, pigs differ from other mammals that have been investigated because sexual differentiation of reproductive behaviour occurs during pubertal development and not during gestation.",

      "title": "History and Evaluation of Patients with Chronic Pelvic Pain",
      "abstract": "There are multiple causes of pelvic pain, and it is very important to acknowledge that in most women pelvic pain is not of gynecological origin. It is also important to remember that in most patients with pelvic pain there is more than one reason for pain and simply just treating endometriosis without addressing pelvic floor or bladder pain or associated emotional issues is not enough. History is by far the single most important part of the diagnostic process, with examination being less useful and radiological tests often not helpful at all. Three simple questions can probably diagnose most of the causes for pelvic pain: How did the pain start, what makes in better and what makes it worse? Patients whose pain began at menarche may have endometriosis, but cyclical pain does not always mean the diagnosis of endometriosis. Many pain symptoms may worsen during the menstrual period. Conversely, when pain begins after surgery or trauma to the pelvis it is almost certainly not endometriosis. Pain after delivery may be due to musculoskeletal issues (muscle spasm, nerve injury, incisional neuroma – episiotomy or laparotomy scar) but also result from congested pelvic veins. Pain that worsens with physical activity and improves with rest and use of a heating pad is almost always of musculoskeletal origin. Finally, pain with a full bladder may be consistent with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome but pain at the end of urination is often from spasm of pelvic floor muscles. Pain during intercourse is present in most of the conditions causing pelvic pain but in patients with pelvic floor muscle spasm this pain/pressure usually persists for hours to days after. Use of questionnaires such as the one developed by the International Pelvic Pain Society may be very useful to determine the cause of pain.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Universally every woman faces menopause and feeling of onset of uncomfortable physical, psychological and emotional changes. Many fear about their loss of beauty and sexual life. The word menopause has come from Greek word “Menos” meaning menstruation and “Pause” meaning stopping of the menstrual period. 1 The loss of ovarian follicular activity or the dwindling function of ovaries at the end of reproductive life which leads to permanent cessation of menstruation is known as menopause or climacteric. The period of time when women passes from reproductive to non–reproductive stage is menopause transition. The life after menopause is the stage of postmenopausal period. In majority of women, menopause occurs without any physical or psychological symptoms. But in some of the women there will be marked physical and psychological symptoms. Symptoms of the climacteric are multiple and vague. These climacteric symptoms are due to decrease in oestrogen level and increase in Gonadotrophin level in the body, but the exact mechanism is unknown. The climacteric symptoms are grouped into vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats), cardiovascular symptoms and cerebro-vascular effects (hypertension, palpitation, heart disease), neurological &amp; psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression, insomnia, irritability, malaise, loss of libido / lethargy), general symptoms (fatigue, headache, general weakness, vertigo, breast tenderness, skin pigmentation, dyspareunia, indigestion or constipation, obesity), physical symptoms / changes (atrophy of secondary sexual characters, atrophy of internal genital organs, osteoporosis, skin becomes thick and coarse, straggling growth of hair).2 KEY WORDS Flax Seed, Climacteric Symptoms, Menopause",

      "abstract": "Pelvic organ prolapse is the descent of one or more of the anterior vaginal wall, posterior vaginal wall, the uterus (cervix), or the apex of the vagina (vaginal vault or cuff scar after hysterectomy). Prevalence increases with age. The cause of prolapse is multifactorial but is primarily associated with pregnancy and vaginal delivery, which lead to direct pelvic floor muscle and connective tissue injury. Hysterectomy, pelvic surgery, and conditions associated with sustained episodes of increased intra-abdominal pressure, including obesity, chronic cough, constipation, and repeated heavy lifting, also contribute to prolapse. Most patients with pelvic organ prolapse are asymptomatic. Symptoms become more bothersome as the bulge protrudes past the vaginal opening. Initial evaluation includes a history and systematic pelvic examination including assessment for urinary incontinence, bladder outlet obstruction, and fecal incontinence. Treatment options include observation, vaginal pessaries, and surgery. Most women can be successfully fit with a vaginal pessary. Available surgical options are reconstructive pelvic surgery with or without mesh augmentation and obliterative surgery.",

The disorder can be life-threatening and usually there is difficulty in differentiating it from the cervical phase of an incomplete abortion as well as bleeding cervical fibroid. Ultrasound scan has been found helpful in the diagnosis of cervical ectopic pregnancy. The conservative management and the possible alternative surgical management, based on the clinical presentation, are discussed.Cervical pregnancy is a very rare, potentially life-threatening type of ectopic pregnancy. The condition is usually difficult to differentiate from the cervical phase of an incomplete abortion or a bleeding cervical fibroid. A 24-year-old Nigerian woman was seen in a private hospital with a history of 2.5 months amenorrhea, followed by irregular, occasionally heavy, vaginal bleeding for 8 days. She denied any history of associated abdominal pain or urinary symptoms. Before this recent period of morbidity, the woman's menses had been regular every 30 days with normal blood loss of 4 days' duration. She had had two prior normal deliveries, most recently 2 years earlier, and had no history of prior abortion, dilatation, and curettage; infertility; or any contraceptive practice before consultation. Vaginal examination found no active bleeding, but a bulky, soft, 1-2 cm dilated cervix. An ultrasound scan obtained by the patient in another private clinic one day earlier identified an empty uterine cavity, but a bulky cervix with a gestational sac and fetal node. The patient was to be admitted for immediate evacuation, but left the hospital in search of money for the operation. The products of conception were evacuated at the hospital the next day. The patient was in satisfactory condition with no complaints at 4 weeks follow-up.",

      "abstract": "The majority of injury combinations in multiply injured patients entail the chest, abdomen, and extremities. Numerous pig models focus on the investigation of posttraumatic pathophysiology, organ performance monitoring and on potential treatment options. Depending on the experimental question, previous authors have included isolated insults (controlled or uncontrolled hemorrhage, chest trauma) or a combination of these injuries (hemorrhage with abdominal trauma, chest trauma, traumatic brain injury, and/or long-bone fractures). Combined trauma models in pigs can provide a high level of clinical relevance, when they are properly designed and mimicking the clinical situation. Most of these models focus on the first hours after trauma, to assess the acute sequel of traumatic hemorrhage. However, hemorrhagic shock and the associated mass transfusion are also major causes for organ failure and mortality in the later clinical course. Thus, most models lack information on the pathomechanisms during the late posttraumatic phase. Studying new therapies only during the early phase is also not reflective of the clinical situation. Therefore, a longer observation period is required to study the effects of therapeutic approaches during intensive care treatment when using animal models. These long-term studies of combined trauma models will allow the development of valuable therapeutic approaches relevant for the later posttraumatic course. This review summarizes the existing porcine models and outlines the need for long-term models to provide real effective novel therapeutics for multiply injured patients to improve organ function and clinical outcome.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Menstrual suppression to provide relief of menstrual-related symptoms or to manage medical conditions associated with menstrual morbidity or menstrual exacerbation has been used clinically since the development of steroid hormonal therapies. Options range from the extended or continuous use of combined hormonal oral contraceptives, to the use of combined hormonal patches and rings, progestins given in a variety of formulations from intramuscular injection to oral therapies to intrauterine devices, and other agents such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonists. The agents used for menstrual suppression have variable rates of success in inducing amenorrhea, but typically have increasing rates of amenorrhea over time. Therapy may be limited by side effects, most commonly irregular, unscheduled bleeding. These therapies can benefit women's quality of life, and by stabilizing the hormonal milieu, potentially improve the course of underlying medical conditions such as diabetes or a seizure disorder. This review addresses situations in which menstrual suppression may be of benefit, and lists options which have been successful in inducing medical amenorrhea.

In searching for the causes, I found a suggestion in an old edition of the work on midwifery by Cazeaux that led me to think that the condition was often maintained by too frequent sexual indulgence. Cazeaux suggested that in women the ovum is usually thrown off at the time of menstruation; but that during an orgasm provoked by sexual congress the ovum might be discharged at other times. I reasoned that in this way the ova were constantly thrown off before reaching maturity, and therefore were incapable of fecundation. I advised that for five or six months all sexual intercourse should be abstained from excepting immediately before and immediately after menstruation. I feel sure that in",

The secretory or luteal phase is the time from ovulation to menstruation, which is usually constant at 14 days. Cycles of 6 weeks' duration seem to show no difference from normal-length cycles in regards to follicular and hormone development. There are several conditions that lead to oligomenorrhoea, and these range from normal conditions to the same conditions that cause amenorrhoea. Some common causes are: polycystic ovarian syndrome; a prolonged proliferative phase, associated with ovulatory oligomenorrhoea; prolactinomas and other endocrine problems; and weight related, either low or very high body mass indexes. Clinically, oligomenorrhoea should be considered in the same way as amenorrhoea for the purpose of investigations and further management.",

Few studies have in details explored specific gender differences in response to experimental stimulation of selected visceral organs or specific visceral diseases. Lower pain threshold to e.g. oesophageal distension has however been shown in females. The effect of female sex hormones on visceral function and pain is studied in greater details in both experimental and clinical studies. Pronounced differences in pain sensitivity are found across the menstrual phases. This may also interact with pharmacological interventions. For clinicians assessing the pain level of female patients in the reproductive age group should take into consideration the physiological and clinical effects of the menstrual cycle and the somatic segmental sites related to the uterus and cervix when clinically evaluating the pain and assessing for disease activity.",

Cyclical breast pain is more common and varies with the menstrual cycle. Non-cyclical breast pain includes true breast pain and extramammary causes. Categorizing breast pain helps to guide the work-up and management. A thorough history and physical exam should be performed in all patients presenting with breast pain. Though breast pain alone is rarely a sign of breast cancer, breast imaging may be still be appropriate. If there are no concerning findings on the physical exam, the imaging work-up is determined by patient age and the type of breast pain. Management of breast pain without suspicious findings on physical exam or breast imaging is driven by the severity of the pain. Reassurance of the negative findings and that the patient does not have breast cancer is often all that is required. Breast pain frequently resolves spontaneously and no further treatments are necessary. If pain is persistent or impacting quality of life, initial management is centered on conservative therapies such as physical support. Medications can be considered for severe and persistent pain, but the side effects of these therapies need to be considered.",

      "title": "How to escape male infanticide: mechanisms for avoiding or terminating pregnancy in mammals",
      "abstract": "Abstract The phenomenon whereby pregnancy may be inhibited or terminated when a female is exposed to non‐sire males after mating is often, and rather generally, referred to as the ‘Bruce effect’. Widespread and indiscriminate use of the term for any case of pregnancy failure following exposure to an unfamiliar male, however, masks distinct physiological and social causes of the blocking or termination of pregnancy. Within the available literature, we identify four basic processes by which mammalian females can terminate pregnancy, and thus minimise risks of wasted reproductive costs which might result from male infanticide by a subsequent consort of any progeny carried to full‐term where he was not the father. Physical contact with a non‐sire male may induce pregnancy failure either before implantation (pregnancy block) or after implantation (pregnancy disruption). By direct contrast, in other species, physical presence of a familiar non‐sire male may act to prevent the blocking or disruption of pregnancy, while separation from this non‐sire male may act to trigger termination. We propose that use of the term ‘Bruce effect’ should be restricted to situations in which pregnancy failure is induced primarily by physical contact and/or odour stimuli from a non‐sire male as in its initial formulation. Blanket use of this single term for all situations of pregnancy block or disruption, implying by default that pregnancy failure is the consequence of pre‐implantation pregnancy block of an inseminated female as a result of physical contact with an unfamiliar male or his olfactory cues, masks the fact that, in many circumstances or species, very different mechanisms may operate in the prevention or disruption of pregnancy. The implicit presumption that pregnancy failure is a single and uniform phenomenon also discourages further research into the range of rather different circumstances and mechanisms by which pregnancy disruption may be triggered.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Diagnosis of diastasis symphysis pubis in the postpartum period need not depend on radiographic findings. This diagnosis can be made with simple observation techniques. Entertaining a high index of suspicion and observation of the patient are the most important contributions the physician can make. Parameters triggering a tentative diagnosis would include, but not be limited to, a large infant, a small pelvis, a rapid second stage of delivery, or application of forces to abduct the thighs. The diagnosis of diastasis symphysis pubis should be ruled out if thefollowing conditions are present postpartum: the flattened abdomen (the postpartum \"pooch\" is absent); the patient is incontinent of urine when changing position from supine/prone to upright; the patient has pain in the hips or sacral region when walking; or the patient waddles when walking. The change in gait, or the pain on walking may not be noticed until 24 hours or more after delivery. However, the change in abdominal contour and incontinence is noticed immediately. Using these observational clues, the physician can institute treatment sooner, thereby expediting recovery.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Obstetricians and gynecologists have a complex task. They must deal with the fear, anxiety, and depression that may accompany any physical illness. In addition, issues that involve a woman’s reproductive health are highly emotionally charged and closely linked to her sense of femininity, sexuality, attractiveness, and value. The gynecologist often acts as the woman’s primary care provider and, therefore, may be the only one in a position to detect ongoing concerns such as relationship problems, domestic violence, sexual dysfunctions, or histories of abuse. Psychological conflicts related to femininity, sexuality, or abuse may present as aversion to physical examination, pelvic pain, or attitudes toward pregnancy or sexuality. Healthcare professionals involved with patients undergoing gynecological surgery must recognize that patients are dealing, not only with the reason for the surgery, but also with the specific meanings of surgery on female sexual and reproductive organs.",

      "title": "Acute Pelvic Pain in Women",
      "abstract": "Acute pain caused by pelvic pathology is common, and the presenting complaint may be diffuse or lower abdominal pain, pelvic pain, or low back pain. A patient with chronic pelvic pain may also have an acute process, either related to the chronic condition or arising de novo. Over one third of reproductive-age women will experience nonmenstrual pelvic pain. Among diagnoses for women with pain caused by gynecologic disorders in the emergency department, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and lower genital tract infections (e.g., cervicitis, candidiasis, Bartholin’s abscess) account for almost half. Other common diagnoses are menstrual disorders, noninflammatory ovarian and tubal pathology (including cysts and torsion), and ectopic pregnancy. In the general population, ectopic pregnancy accounts for 2% of first-trimester pregnancies; however, among women visiting the emergency department with vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain in the first trimester of pregnancy, the incidence of ectopic pregnancy is as high as 18%. Younger patients and those with multiple sexual partners are more likely to have PID, and a previous episode increases the likelihood of a subsequent episode. The risk of ectopic pregnancy is higher in women who have had PID, pelvic surgery, or a prior ectopic pregnancy, as well as in women with an intrauterine device. Heterotopic pregnancy is of special concern in women undergoing fertility treatment. The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy in the general population was 1 in 30,000 patients in 1948 and is currently reported to be as high as 1 in 8000. It is much more common in women undergoing assisted reproductive techniques (in vitro fertilization and ovulation-stimulating medications), with an incidence of 1 in 100. Common nongynecologic diseases, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, urinary tract infection, and urolithiasis, remain important considerations in the woman with acute pelvic pain. Box 33-1 lists conditions accounting for pelvic pain in most women. Some causes of pelvic pain may lead to serious sequelae. PID carries the short-term risk of tubo-ovarian abscess and the longterm risks of impaired fertility, chronic pelvic pain, and increased predisposition to ectopic pregnancy. Rupture of an ectopic pregnancy or a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst may be life-threatening. Unrecognized abuse may have serious or lethal consequences as well.",

      "abstract": "Female genital mutilation (FGM) is often associated with African and Muslim women, but dealing with its aftermath is a public health concern in the United States. There are several different types of mutilation, which are demonstrated with drawings. FGM is primarily practiced and enforced by women and has cultural significance. FGM is practiced in the United States among some immigrant groups, and women who have immigrated here often need specialized medical care as a result of the mutilation. The most extreme form of FGM is called infibulation which involves removal of all outside genitalia and near closure of the vaginal opening. Infibulated women often must be cut to allow intercourse and childbirth, and are sometimes re-infibulated after delivery, often after each child. Women who have had FGM suffer from a number of serious health complications, including anemia, chronic pelvic infections, infertility, abscesses and keloids, sexual dysfunction, menstrual disorders, urinary problems, and complications in pregnancy and childbirth. The psychological consequences have not been well studied. FGM can cause vaginal lacerations during intercourse, and anal intercourse is common in affected couples. The lacerations and anal intercourse raise concerns about HIV transmission in these women and also from the practice of performing FGM on a group of girls with the same unsterile tools. FGM is being re-introduced in the United States by some immigrant communities, and health care providers need to be sensitive to the needs of affected women. Several issues related to the need for cultural sensitivity are discussed.",

In layman's terms, menopause is often described as an absence of \"periods.\" However, the process is most accurately defined as the permanent cessation of menses. Clinical menopause is recognized after 12 months of amenorrhea [1]. The normal transition period that occurs prior to menopause is known as perimenopause. This transition begins approximately 4 years prior to menopause and is a result of progressive decline in ovarian function. This transition leads to menstrual cycle disruption, with waxing and waning of ovarian function. During perimenopause and menopause, women will experience many symptoms that include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, as well as mood and sleep disturbances [2]. There are several treatment options, both hormonal and nonhormonal, to combat these unwanted menopausal symptoms.",

      "title": "Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, the Role of Imaging and Reconstructive Surgery",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT We are putting forward three novel concepts describing the pathophysiology concerning: • Micturition, factors that control urinary continence and different types of urinary incontinence. • Genital organs support and genital prolapse. • Defecation, causes of fecal incontinence (FI). I. Urinary continence depends on high urethral pressure (Pura) which depends upon two factors: One inherent and one acquired. 1. The inherent factor is the tough strong collagen layer constituent of the internal urethral sphincter (IUS), that creates the high wall tension necessary for keeping high urethral pressure (Pura). The IUS is a collagen-muscle tissue cylinder that extends from the bladder neck to the perineal membrane in both sexes. 2. The acquired factor, which is high alpha-sympathetic tone at the IUS gained from learning and training in early childhood, keeps it contracted and the urethra closes all the time until there is a need or a desire to void as social circumstances allow. Injury to one or both factors leads to urinary incontinence. II. The vagina is a cylinder of collagen-elastic-muscle tissues. The strong tough collagen sheet is responsible for the upright position of the vagina. The main function of the pelvic ligaments is to assign the pelvic organs to their anatomical site and keeps the pelvic organs in situ. Childbirth trauma damages the collagen layer due to overstretching of the vagina and leads to flabby and redundant vaginal walls with subsequent vaginal prolapse. When the pelvic ligaments suffer most of the trauma, the insult will lead to weakness of the pelvic ligaments, leading to vault and uterine prolapse. III. The integrity of both anal sphincters, internal anal sphincter (IAS) and external anal sphincter (EAS) is an essential factor in keeping fecal continence. Fecal continence also depends on strong pelvic floor muscles which keep an angle between the rectum and the anal canal. In addition, it depends on an acquired behavior, gained by learning and training in early childhood of maintaining high alpha-sympathetic tone at the IAS keeping the anal canal empty and closed all the time until there is a desire and/or a need to pass flatus and/ or stool and there are favorable social circumstances. The intimate relation of the IUS with the anterior vaginal wall and the IAS with the posterior vaginal wall exposes them to the childbirth trauma with subsequent damage. This will lead to stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and FI in addition to vaginal prolapse. Therefore, we have innovated an operation to treat SUI, FI and vaginal prolapse. ‘Urethro-ano-vaginoplasty’ repair operation. It consists of anterior and posterior sections. In the anterior section, we have corrected the SUI and the anterior vaginal wall descent through the following steps: 1. Expose the IUS and mend its torn wall. 2. Strengthen the anterior vaginal wall by overlapping the two vaginal flaps, and hence we can add extra support to the mended IUS and preserve the body collagen. In the posterior section, we have the following: 1. Exposed the IAS and mended the torn sphincter. 2. We have approximated the two-levator ani muscles. 3. Strengthened the posterior vaginal wall by overlapping the two vaginal flaps; as such, we would have also added extra support to the mended IAS and kept the natural body collagen. 4. We repaired the perineum. How to cite this article El Hemaly AKM, Mousa LA, Kurjak A, Kandil IM, Serour AG. Pelvic Floor Dysfunction, the Role of Imaging and Reconstructive Surgery.

Due to the rarity of moles, it is possible that they may be confused with abortive pregnancies until the pathological examination. The aim of this study is to identify the sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive and negative value of the main symptoms and clinical signs of molar pregnancies. Methods. Thirteen molar pregnancies have been detected after pathological examination from January 2003 to July 2005 in Perugia. Their main clinical signs and symptoms are compared with those recorded in 288 abortive pregnancies, 56 ectopic pregnancies and 27 Hyperemesis gravidarum, observed in the same period. Results. Vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain are the most sensitive symptoms and have the highest predictive negative values. The size of the uterus greater for date is the most specific sign. Pelvic pain with hyperemesis, and uterus size greater for date have the highest predictive positive values, but the lowest sensitivity. Conclusion. A mole should be excluded in patients with hyperemesis and pelvic pain, and in patients with uterus size greater for date. In the first case, a hyperemesis gravidarum may be diagnosed and, in the second one, a twin pregnancy may be confirmed with a sonographic scan.",

      "abstract": "Hintergrund: Das Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser-Syndrom (MRKH) ist durch eine Fehlbildung der Scheide sowie der Gebärmutter charakterisiert. Es kommt bei ca. 1: 5000 weiblichen Neugeborenen vor. Mittels einer Operation kann eine neue Scheide (Neovagina) angelegt werden. Die Diagnose wird meist in der schwierigen Phase der Entwicklung der weiblichen Identität (Pubertät) gestellt. Methodik: 25 Patientinnen wurden vor Operation sowie nach 6 Monaten hinsichtlich Körperbild, Sexualität, psychischem Befinden und Verarbeitung der Fehlbildungsfolgen (Unfruchtbarkeit) befragt (FKB–20, FSFI, PHQ-D, NeoCope). Begleitend fanden supportive Gespräche statt. Ergebnisse: Im FKB–20 zeigte sich eine sig. Besserung im Körperbild sechs Monate nach Operation, im FSFI eine sig. Besserung der \"Schmerzen beim Geschlechtsverkehr\". Zu keinem Meßzeitpunkt ergaben sich Hinweise auf depressive Symptome, Angststörungen oder somatoforme Beschwerden (PHQ-D). Die Psychosomatische Begleitung wurde von 61% der Patientinnen als hilfreich erlebt. Schlussfolgerung: Die operative Neovagina-Anlage wird als wichtige Vorrausetzung zur Verbesserung von Körperbild und Sexualität wahrgenommen. Große Verunsicherung bleibt hinsichtlich Unfruchtbarkeit und der Kommunikation der Fehlbildung im soz. Umfeld oder gegenüber Lebenspartnern. Die bisherigen Erfahrungswerte der psychosomatischen Begleitung werden manualisiert und in einer Studie hinsichtlich der Diagnoseverarbeitung und der weiteren Behandlung evaluiert.",

      "title": "Sex Differences in Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract In this chapter the authors discuss sex differences in sleep behavior, sleep structure, and aspects of three sleep disorders. Women report a greater need for sleep and sleep longer than men, as determined from self-report as well as actigraphy and wearable sleep trackers, although this difference is heavily influenced by family and work responsibilities. Women are also more likely to have earlier bedtimes and a morning chronotype, which may in part be a consequence of their phase-advanced circadian rhythms and shorter circadian period compared with men. Women are more likely than men to report poorer sleep quality and greater difficulty sleeping; however, polysomnographic recordings reveal other sex differences, including better sleep efficiency and more slow-wave sleep that is better preserved with aging in women than in men. Sex differences are evident in the prevalence, presentation, and etiology of some sleep disorders. Women are more likely than men to have insomnia disorder, a difference that becomes evident in adolescence and continues across the life span. Restless legs syndrome is more prevalent in women than men, and they also experience worse symptoms, particularly during pregnancy and postmenopause. Men are at greater risk for obstructive sleep apnea, at least until women reach menopause, when the sex difference lessens.",

      "title": "[Effect of the male presence on the reproductive mechanisms in female mammals].",
      "abstract": "In various physiological situations, the presence of the male may interfere with the timing of the physiological events of female reproduction. Contact with the male hastens puberty in a variety of species, provided that the female has reached a given age and weight. The male presence may induce synchronized oestrus in the adult female. In the case of seasonal or lactation anoestrus in ewes, contact with the ram increases the pulsatile release of LH within a few minutes, resulting in a preovulatory surge 24 hrs later, followed by ovulation, but usually no behavioural oestrus. However, the development of the corpus luteum is abnormal in half of the cases, leading to an abnormally short 7-day oestrous cycle. During oestrus itself, the male presence reduces markedly the duration of sexual receptivity and hastens ovulation. Direct contact is not needed to produce these effects which can be mediated by the sense of smell and also by other senses, acting in a cumulative, and possible substitutive, way. Male-induced ovulation would ensure a higher probability of fertilization in species in which the males and females are not permanently associated. Furthermore, the resulting synchronized reproduction might have an adaptative value by reducing predation at birth in wild species. Such effects could also be used for the control of domestic animal production.",

      "abstract": "Introducao: A dor lombar e pelvica e uma queixa comum na populacao em geral, sendo um sintoma frequentemente relatado durante a gestacao. Objetivos: Determinar a prevalencia e as caracteristicas da lombalgia em gestantes, bem como apontar possiveis fatores de risco relacionados a esta dor e o efeito do exercicio fisico como meio de intervencao e prevencao em gestantes foram os objetivos do presente estudo. Metodo: Para tanto, foi realizada uma pesquisa bibliografica em publicacoes nacionais e internacionais indexadas no periodo de 1997 a 2007, em quatro bases de dados, sendo elas LILACS, MEDLINE, SCIENCEDIRECT e SCIELO, sendo relacionados 25 artigos que tratassem do tema. Resultados: Os resultados demonstraram que mais da metade das gestantes sofrem de dor lombar e/ ou pelvica durante algum periodo da gestacao. Os provaveis motivos para a lombalgia, durante esse periodo estao ligados a acao do hormonio relaxina que provoca mudancas na mobilidade articular e ligamentar, tornando-as mais instavel e suscetivel a lesoes e a dor. E evidenciado que as dores aumentam principalmente se a mulher apresentava esta queixa antes de engravidar, alem disso, esse sintoma pode perdurar no periodo pos-parto e acabar gerando intervencao na realizacao das atividades diarias e profissionais, acarretando prejuizo na qualidade de vida e na saude geral. Conclusao: Dessa forma, muitos programas de exercicios fisicos estao sendo propostos para diminuir a intensidade da dor ou prevenir sua ocorrencia. Algumas atividades, como ginastica aquatica, natacao, yoga e alongamentos sao indicadas para esse publico, demonstrando eficiencia na prevencao, reducao e/ou alivio definitivo.",

      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on women's mental health issues as they relate to depression. Specifically, women are at more risk than men for developing depression throughout their lifetimes, especially during their childbearing years. The incidence of depression in women rises during puberty. High-risk periods for onset or recurrence of a major depressive episode include the postpartum period and the perimenopausal transition to menopause. This chapter discusses how fluctuations of estrogen levels may be linked to the onset or recurrence of a major depressive episode in a woman, and provides some tips for how to manage depression in women, including evolving findings about treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with the onset or recurrence of depression during perimenopause.",

Nous avons teste le seuil de la douleur chez des femmes avec (n=13) et sans contraception (n=10) en reponse a un stimulus electrique, thermique, mecanique durant un cycle entier. Lorsqu'on utilise une stimulation electrique (reflexe RIII), on observe une tendance a des seuils moyens d'apparition de la douleur plus bas, quelle que soit la phase chez les sujets sans contraception. Lors de l'ovulation cette difference est significative (p=0,04). On n'observe pas cette difference de seuil avec les autres modalites de stimulation. La suppression des variations hormonales par la contraception semble rendre moins sensible a une stimulation electrique. Le mecanisme de l'influence du cycle menstruel est probablement multifactoriel, somme d'interactions biologiques et de facteurs psychologiques.

Infertility affects millions of people and has an impact on their families and communities. In the female reproductive system, infertility may be caused by a range of abnormalities of the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and the endocrine system, among others. In the male reproductive system, infertility is most commonly caused by problems with the ejection of semen, absence or low sperm count, or abnormal shape and movement of the sperm. Fertility care encompasses the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infertility. Equal and equitable access to fertility care remains a challenge in most countries.",

      "abstract": "The article explains the practice of female circumcision/genital mutilation including health problems and particularly the possible serious obstetric complications of childbirth in the labor ward. Female genital mutilation is viewed as one of the extreme forms of female oppression seen across centuries. It is practiced across the African Sahel and also in the UK extending to East Africa north into Egypt and Somalia and south into Tanzania. It has been classified into three degrees of severity: 1) sunna; 2) excision; and 3) infibulation or pharaonic circumcision. Health complications due to genital mutilation include acute infections abscess and damage to the urethra or anus and obstruction to menstrual flow. Long-term complications mentioned are trauma scarring with keloid leading to urinary retention menorrhagia pain on intercourse and deep mental and psychosexual damage. In addition obstetric complications may include obstructed labor severe hemorrhage injury to the bladder urethra or bowels and also fetal brain damage secondary to prolonged obstructed second stage of labor. Some complicated obstructed labor also leads to death of the mother and the child. In conclusion health care workers particularly midwives and obstetricians should be fully prepared to deal with mutilated patients so as to prevent social and health complications.",

However, it is difficult to characterize the condition of urinary retention on the basis of the magnitude of residual volume alone, and more important to evaluate and render treatment for the presenting symptomatic complex and any associated urinary tract pathophysiology. Retention may be symptomatic or asymptomatic. Symptoms commonly associated with retention may include pure irritative (urgency, frequency), or obstructive (incomplete, bladder emptying, hesitancy) components, with or without abdominal or suprapubic discomfort, and urinary incontinence (either due to overflow incontinence or detrusor overactivity). Urinary tract sequellae associated with retention include: alterations in bladder storage characteristics such as compliance changes, which result in abnormal bladder filling pressures, detrusor overactivity, abnormalities in bladder sensation, and effects on renal function owing to abnormal vesical storage pressures and/or recurrent urinary tract infection.",

      "title": "Persistent Genital Arousal Disorder Misdiagnosed Because of Islamic Religious Bathing Rituals: A Report of Three Cases",
      "abstract": "Persistent genital arousal disorder is not well known or adequately understood by physicians. The disorder is characterized by a persistent and highly unwanted state of genital arousal and orgasm-like feelings. Ghusl is an ablution in Islamic culture, which is an obligatory ritual wherein the body is washed thoroughly after exposure to religious contaminants such as sexual intercourse, menstruation, and childbirth. Muslim women suffering from the disorder may bathe frequently because of their religious beliefs. The authors summarize the case histories of 3 patients with persistent genital arousal disorder who were initially misdiagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder. All 3 patients presented with complaints of unwanted, persistent orgasms or orgasm-like arousals, and as a result, they performed ghusl several times a day. At previous interviews, the genital arousal was diagnosed as a sexual and somatic obsession, and repeatedly performing ghusl was considered a cleansing compulsion. Physicians’ lack of awareness or knowledge of persistent genital arousal disorder, combined with the unwillingness of patients to discuss sexual problems, can lead to a focus on the repetitive bathing, and thus, a misdiagnosis of the problem as obsessive-compulsive disorder. These cases are presented to highlight the possible pitfalls in the diagnosis of persistent genital arousal disorder cases in Islamic countries where ghusl is common.",

Hal ini karena kelemahan otot fasia dan ligamen penyokongnya. Kerusakan pada penyangga vagina dapat terjadi dalam satu lokasi saja (misalnya, dinding vagina anterior saja), tetapi lebih sering terjadi kombinasi. Metode merangkum daftar referensi terupdate sebagai bahan artikel yang dapat menjadi pedoman dan tatalaksana prolaps organ panggul. Hasil tidak semua prolaps alat genitalia membutuhkan terapi, karena banyak penderita tidak mempunyai keluhan, terutama stadium I dan kadang-kadang stadium II. Pada mereka yang mempunyai keluhan tentu perlu penanganan dengan tepat agar penderita merasa lebih baik. Prolaps uteri stadium II dan III dipilih vaginal histerektomi dan disertai dengan kolporafi anterior dan kolpoperineorafi, Hal ini terutama bila penderita sudah mengalami manaupose atau tidak memerlukan lagi organ reproduksi. Kesimpulan, walaupun tidak mengancam nyawa, akan tetapi prolapsus alat genitalia dapat menurunkan kualitas hidup wanita.What is ProlapseAbstractPurpose to find out more about descent or genital prolapse can be likened to a hernia, in which a genital organ descends into the vagina, possibly even out of the vaginal canal. This is due to weakness of the fascial muscles and ligaments that support them. Damage to the vaginal support can occur in one location only (eg, anterior vaginal wall only), but is more common in combination. Although it does not cause death, pelvic organ prolapse can reduce the quality of life for women. Method summarize an updated list of references as material for articles that can guide and treat pelvic organ prolapse. Result not all prolapse of the genitalia needed therapy, because many patients had no complaints, especially stage I and sometimes stage II. Those who have complaints, of course, need to be handled properly so that the sufferer feels better. Uterine prolapse stages II and III were chosen by vaginal hysterectomy and accompanied by anterior colporaphy and kolpoperineorafi, especially if the patient has menopause, or no longer needs reproductive organs. Conclusion, although not life threatening, genital prolapse can reduce a woman’s quality of life.Key word: Prolap genitalia, quality of life for women",

      "abstract": "Sexual behavior in pregnancy is affected by many factors, including biological, psychological, social, and environmental, that vary throughout its course. To assess the demographics of sexual behavior in pregnancy, several research tools have been developed. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a brief self-report measure that is commonly used to assess female sexual function in research studies. In general, the literature has shown that sexual frequency and sexual function decline over the course of pregnancy. Most studies demonstrate a decrease in the first trimester, no change or an increase in the second trimester, and then a sharp decrease in the third trimester and early postpartum period. In order to address the decline in sexual function over the course of pregnancy, it is important to understand and recognize the factors contributing to sexual dysfunction in pregnancy. Some of these factors include discomfort, nausea, fatigue, fear of harming the fetus or causing infection, and negative self-perception. Physicians should create a supportive environment in which patients feel comfortable discussing their concerns regarding sexuality in pregnancy. Exploring and addressing patient fears may alleviate unnecessary abstinence and the associated stress this places on a relationship.",

Se transcribieron las sesiones de entrevista, se reviso su contenido y se hizo una narracion casuistica con matiz biografico. Se encontro que este hombre presento sintomas couvade solo en el primer embarazo, parto y postparto, tales como mareos, nausea, vomito, antojos, dolor de vientre, que son semejantes a los mas comunes hallados en otras latitudes. Estos sintomas fueron parcialmente semejantes a los que vivio su pareja. Los sintomas couvade , relacionados con distintos aspectos de la vida de pareja, fueron vividos y significados de maneras peculiares por el varon.

      "abstract": "Women should be considered as a most important valuable jewel as a fourfold objective of life, progeny, happiness, all can be attained only through her. Her life is spread into different stages due to some anatomical and physiological changes in body. She responds very differently in different stages of her lives. menopause is a natural phase which tends to be highly variable in timings, pattern, and behaviour due to the reduction in reproductive sex hormones. The term “Menopause” is commonly used to describe the years when women’s ovaries gradually begin to produce fewer eggs and less of female hormones like oestrogen and progesterone. This reduction hormone production causes periods to become less regular until they stop together, and produces physical and psychological symptoms in many women. Menopause is an important period in a woman's life. It is the permanent cessation of menses for 12 months or more. Menopause can develop over a long period of time. The average age for menopause to start is 52 years, but it can begin at any time from age 40 to 58 years. Many symptoms are related to postmenopausal syndrome: hot flashes, irritability, mood swings, insomnia, dry vagina, difficulty concentrating, mental confusion, stress incontinence, urge incontinence, osteoporotic symptoms, depression, anxiety, headache, and vasomotor symptoms it is determined clinically by the onset of irregular menstrual cycles or variable cycle lengths. Women are at an increased risk of depression and anxiety during perimenopause and the menopausal transition. During menopausal transition, the impact of fluctuating oestrogen in the central nervous system (CNS) can have negative psychological effects for some women.",

      "abstract": "Secondary amenorrhea is the absence of menstruation for a period of 6 months or longer in a woman with established normal cycles. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common causes of pathological secondary amenorrhea. The diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome is based on the presence of any 2 among the criteria: oligo and/or anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries. In Ayurveda, it can be considered Nashtartava. Modern management of PCOS is primarily focused on the use of hormonal preparations like oral contraceptive pills and insulin sensitizers like metformin. In cases resistant to medical therapy, laparoscopic ovarian drilling, and ovarian wedge resection surgeries are employed. The usage of contraceptive pills is associated with adverse effects like spotting or breakthrough bleeding (BTB), nausea, headache, breast tenderness, weight gain, mood changes, low libido, and dermatologic problems.This is a case report of a 24 year old unmarried woman with delayed menstrual cycles, last menstrual period 6 months back and increased facial hair growth, and mood swings for 6 years. On USG, she was diagnosed with PCOS. For this problem, she took allopathic medication twice. Despite having a few subsequent normal cycles, she developed symptoms including mood swings, headaches, excessive sweating, hair loss, and weight gain. She was forced to stop medications due to these problems which are the adverse effects of hormonal medications. She was admitted in In Patient Department treatment was given based on Nashtartava management. Acharya Susruta explains that Nashtartava occurs in females due to Vata kaphaavarana of artavavahasrothas. Samshodhana (purificatory procedure) and Agneya dravyaupayoga (use of drugs with hot potency) are the line of management mentioned in Ayurveda. Purificatory procedures like Vamana, Virechana, and Vasthi were administered with proper care.She attained menstruation shortly after treatment, followed by two more cycles at an interval of 35–37 days. Her issues like mood swings, headaches, and facial hair growth also subsided. This case demonstrates the role of Ayurveda in the management of Nashtartava without any adverse effects.",

      "title": "[Diagnosis and treatment of missed abortion].",
      "abstract": "Literature on the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of missed abortion is reviewed. Missed abortion during the 1st 28 weeks of gestation is defined as retention in the uterus of an abortus. The incidence of missed abortion among spontaneous miscarriages is 2.6-9.4%. Etiology of missed abortion is associated with intrauterine infections, severe abnormalities, inhibition of uterine contraction, or impairment of the hormonal balance. Prolonged retention of an abortus can result in fetal maceration or mummification. Clinical manifestations of missed abortion include absence of fetal heart tone, discharge from the breasts and diminution of their size, general fatigue, fever, and sometimes skin itch. Diagnosis of missed abortion is based upon the results of general and gynecologic examinations. Missed abortion is characterized by cessation of growth of the uterus, decrease in cyanosis of the cervix uteri, decrease in urinary excretion of estriol (up to 0-5 mg/day), drastic decrease in excretion of chorionic gonadotropin, decrease in blood level of placental lactogen, and decrease in pregnadiol excretion. Echographic signs of missed abortion during the 1st trimester include absence of heart activity, absence of fetal movements, and changes in the size of the uterus, amniotic cavity, and embryo. The most frequent complications of missed abortion are uterine hemorrhage, infection, and malignant transformation. Treatment of women with missed abortion consists of administration of abortifacient agents and curettage. The most frequently used abortifacient agents are oxytocin in large dosages, intravenous infusions of prostaglandin e2 (PGE2) or single intraamniotic injection of 15-methyl-PGF2alpha. The women with threatening uterine hemmorrage can be subjected to hysterectomy.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pain between the costal margins and the inferior gluteal folds which sometime referred down to the leg and accompanied by painful limitation of the movement known as nonspecific low back pain. diagnosing this pain is not related to conditions such as fractures, spondylitis, direct trauma, or neoplastic, infectious, vascular, metabolic, or endocrine–related processes.Another most common complication during pregnancy or after pregnancy is developing stress urinary incontinence (SUI).it has detrimental effects on the quality of life and SUI is an important social and hygienic health problem affecting adult women.People who develop SUI develops during pregnancy and after pregnancy without remission 3months after delivery have a very high risk of symptoms persistence 5years later.so, the objectives of this study are to determine the prevalence of LBP, pain referred down to the leg (LP), PGP, and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and find the co-relation among them during post pregnancy phase in a large representative sample of pregnant INDIAN women.METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey study where all the subjects were interviewed using Oswerty Low back pain questioner after taking their inform consent. Participants were selected conveniently from different areas of Kolkata. Women within age group of 25 to 40 who had a history of Low back pain after their Pregnancy will be included in this study. Pain without any history of Disc herniation was included in this study. History of Injury, Trauma, any other pathological conditions were excluded from this study.All participants of this study were given university approved informed consent. In addition, Research process will be explained in full. Research will start only after receipt of a signed informed consent.OUTCOMES MEASURES: Once all the participants were included in the study was assessed using The Questionnaire for The Revised Urinary Incontinence Scale (RUIS). RUIS is a scale which mainly consists of five QUESTION.RESULTS: In this study among 106 female participants 70 participants (66.03%) showed minimal disability, 21 participants (19.81%) showed moderate disability, 9 participants (8.49%) showed severe disability, 3 participants (2.83%) with bed bound condition due to back pain and disability with 3 participants (2.83%) needs serious medical Intervention. In this study among 106 participants 30 female participants were having mild symptoms (28.30%), 73 participants were having moderate symptoms (68.86%) and 3 participants were having severe symptoms (2.83%) as assessed by RUIS scale.CONCLUSION: This study concludes that post pregnant women are at higher risk of developing back pain which can vary minimal to moderate severity. Also, there is a mild to moderate risk of developing urinary incontinence among them. It’s the high time to find the probable cause for the same and positive interventions needed to prevent further complications. Prevalence of LBP is quite higher among women in comparison with men and post pregnancy the risk factor increases. Urinary incontinence also a predisposing factor after pregnancy and also a health hazards among women in older age groups. So positive interventions needed to solve these issues.",

      "abstract": "Some patients exaggerate their sexual power before the operation and take refuge in the operation as an excuse for deficient powers thereafter, a loss more frequently attributable to debility or aging. Although some patients claim improved sexual function after prostate surgery by the suprapubic, retropubic or transurethral routes, this must be attributed to improvement in the patient's general condition and not to the operation itself. Figure 1 illustrates the location of the external and internal urethral sphincters in relation to the prostate gland. This will help to understand why, even though potency is maintained, an almost inevitable sequela of all types of prostatectomy is retrograde ejaculation. The ejaculatory ducts and glands of the prostatic cortex open into the cavity of the prostatic urethra midway between the external and internal sphincters. Ordinarily, with ejaculation in the normal male the external sphincter opens or is relaxed, and the internal sphincter is closed and the seminal fluid is projected through the urethra. Following prostatectomy, the internal sphincter has either been completely removed or traumatized, and when ejaculation occurs the seminal fluid flows back into the bladder and is voided with urine at the next micturition. In some patients the ability to ejaculate through the anterior urethra returns later, particularly if the internal sphincter regains part or all of its function. We have on several occasions successfully retrieved motile sperm from the bladder in patients who developed retrograde ejaculation",

POP leads to a considerable reduction in women’s quality of life and can cause chronic pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction, and social/psychological issues. The lifetime risk for having surgery for POP is approximately 11% with 200,000 POP procedures performed each year in USA, with an annual direct cost of over $1000 million. Exact etiology of POP is unclear, but it is understood that POP is multi-factorial in nature. Risk factors for POP include increasing age, obesity, multiple vaginal births, gravidity, history of hysterectomy, smoking, chronic cough conditions, frequent heavy lifting, and some genetic factors. POP results due to loss or damage of structural supports that support the pelvic organs (i.e. rectum, bowel, bladder, etc). Vaginal wall prolapse (anterior and posterior) is the most common presentation. This can result from weakening of the levator ani muscle and other connective tissue structures which not only control the mechanical function, but also help support neurological and anatomical function[1].",

      "title": "Overactive bladder syndrome in nulliparous women",
      "abstract": "Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome, a multifactorial and nonspecific storage symptom complex with poorly defined pathophysiology, is characterized by urinary urgency, usually accompanied by increased daytime frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence (UUI), in the absence of urinary tract infection (UTI) or other obvious pathological condition.1–4 The International Continence Society (ICS) further recommended that these symptoms are usually “suggestive of urodynamically demonstrable detrusor overactivity (DO), but can be due to other forms of urethra-vesical dysfunction, and all of which can be named as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).3 OAB may significantly affect quality of life, since there are a handful of studies showing the negative impact of OAB, such as increased health care visits, disturbance of sleep, higher rates of depression and anxiety, increased risk of fall-related injuries, increased risk of UTI, and of most important, reduced work productivity.5 Nonmodifiable risk factors and contributory factors for OAB in women include age, metabolic syndrome, post menopause, and pelvic organ prolapse (POP).2,6,7 The possibility of OAB in young women without history of delivery (nulliparous [NP] women) is often neglected, resulting in underestimation of prevalence or incidence rate of OAB in the young population. Therefore, only few studies have attempted to investigate the impact of OAB on these young women, and many of them focused on the association of female sexual function.8 We are happy to introduce the current article from the Taipei Medical University Hospital to focus on the topic addressing OAB in NP women.9 The authors retrospectively enrolled 906 women with OAB, which were further separated into three groups as 221 NP, 571 parous women via normal spontaneous vaginal delivery (NSD), and 114 parous women via cesarean section delivery (C/S) to compare the urodynamic changes among three groups via urodynamic study (UDS).9 The NP had statistically higher rates of DO and female voiding dysfunction, including decreased peak flow and decreased mean flow, compared with NSD or C/S did.9 As expected, the NP were younger, and had higher maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) and longer functional urethral length (FUL) than NSD or C/S did.9 The current article is interesting and worthy of discussion. First, as recommendation by the Urogynecology Section of the Polish Society of Gynecologists and Obstetrics guidelines on the management of non-neurogenic OAB in women, although the detailed diagnostic process is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of OAB before treatment, a UDS is not necessary during the initial assessment and is not the essential condition to initiate treatment.10 The diagnostic process and evaluation selection can be tailored to the individual needs and symptoms of the patients.10 Since the authors had performed UDS to evaluate subjects of OAB, it is supposed that these women may have other symptoms out of OAB or the physicians may consider the presence of other comorbidity of OAB. All were associated with a high possibility of the selection bias. In fact, this selection bias can be easily identified by significant difference of age among three groups in their study.9 In terms of UDS parameters in the current Fang et al’s study9 and based on the order of data presented in NP, NSD, and C/S groups, mean peak flow was 18.9, 21.4, 20.7 mL/s; mean flow was 7.5, 9.4, and 9.0 mL/s; mean MUCP was 104.9, 77.9, and 86.4 cm H2O; mean FUL was 31.0 24.5, and 27.1 mm; and mean maximum cystometric capacity (MCC) was 339, 345, and 325 mL, respectively.9 Compared with previous OAB Taiwanese women reported by Dr. Hsu et al,11 who has shown below that mean peak flow was 17.9 mL/s; mean MUCP was 73.4 cm H2O; mean FUL was 26.5 mm; and mean MCC was 333 mL,11 the certain degree of difference may exist, if statistical analysis was performed. However, both data were significantly lower than that obtained from the healthy women (23.5 mL/s for mean peak flow and 13 mL/s for mean flow as an example).12 In fact, Dr. Hsu et al11 further separated their OAB patients into the absence and presence of DO, and found the statistically significant difference of certain-type UDS parameters between two groups, including residual urine and peak flow rate.11 Even though Dr. Hsu et al11 tried their effort to distinguish OAB from interstitial cystitis,11 since the latter should be managed by different strategies, such as an intravesical hyaluronic acid therapy,13,14 the statistically significant difference was dramatically varied greatly when OAB women if these women were further separated into the absence of presence of DO.11 Some are different and others are similar. Of most importance, the consistency is not always reproducible. All hinted us if we cannot clearly dissect the pathophysiology of OAB, it is difficult for us to manage these OAB women, even though the UDS procedure is applied. As shown by authors, the authors hypothesized that NP may have hypertonicity or poor relaxation of the pelvic muscle, causing functional bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), which may be related to their OAB.9 It is reasonable. However, POP is a well-known cause of OAB symptoms in the affected women and BOO is a main reason of POP contributing to OAB symptoms. Based on the recommendation from the Polish Society of Gynecologists and Obstetricians guideline, the diagnosis of OAB should be made after excluding POP as the cause of OAB symptoms.10 In fact, Dr. Fang et al’s9 study showed the mean MUCP of NP with OAB was statistically significantly higher than that of both NSD and C/S with OAB, and also dramatically higher than that of normal volunteers (72-79.3 cm H2O).15 Although the clinical meaning is uncertain for the aforementioned finding, it is worthy of further evaluation. Finally, OAB is a bothersome disease, although it is not life-threatened and often underestimated, any effort to clarify its underlying pathophysiology and offer a better therapy is welcome. We hope to see more research articles addressing this topic in near future.

A 44-year-old patient presented within 24 h postpartum in a state of shock. Clinical examination revealed a patient in shock with diffuse pelvic pain. A complementary ultrasound detected a significant peritoneal effusion extending to the Morison's pouch. Due to hemodynamic instability and the extent of the lesions, an emergency hemostatic hysterectomy was performed. Spontaneous uterine rupture in an unscarred uterus is a rare but severe complication that can significantly impact maternal outcomes. Its occurrence is more frequent in developing countries, reflecting disparities in socioeconomic conditions and limited access to healthcare resources. The risk factors are diverse and can stem from trauma or obstetric interventions. The primary treatment approach is conservative; however, in severe cases where conservative measures are not feasible, a hysterectomy may be required. Neglected uterine rupture in an unscarred uterus is exceptional but complicated situation with high mortality and morbidity. It requires prompt management. Uterine rupture should always be considered in the postpartum period in cases of postpartum hemorrhage, hemodynamic shock, or pelvic pain, regardless of the patient's obstetric history, whether the uterus is scarred or unscarred.",

      "title": "Pearls and Pitfalls in Imaging of Pelvic Adnexal Torsion: Seven Tips to Tell It’s Twisted",
      "abstract": "Pelvic adnexal torsion is a collective term referring to twisting of an ovary, fallopian tube, or paraovarian cyst on its axis with varying degrees of vascular compromise. Although it is the fifth most common gynecologic emergency, the diagnosis is challenging and often missed due to symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging features that are nonspecific. Delay in salvage surgery may lead to ovarian or tubal loss, dysfunction, and infertility. The tips shared herein are based on the authors' observations of key clinical and imaging features of torsion, with the intent of heightening radiologists' index of suspicion and diagnostic accuracy in a clear and memorable fashion. Clinically, severe acute pain with a known adnexal mass or of severity to elicit nausea or vomiting should raise concern. At imaging, features of ovarian edema are key to the diagnosis, including asymmetric ovarian enlargement, peripheralized follicles, adjacent free fluid, and foci of stromal hemorrhage. The converse finding of symmetric nonenlarged ovaries in a normal location with any imaging modality has a high negative predictive value for torsion, obviating the need for additional imaging. The whirlpool sign (twisted vascular pedicle), abnormal ovarian location, and uterine tilting are additional key imaging manifestations. The presence of color Doppler flow or contrast enhancement only suggests that an ovary is still viable and should not be used to exclude the diagnosis of torsion. In cases of isolated tubal or paraovarian cyst torsion, the ovaries may appear normal; therefore, recognition of this entity along with appreciation of several key imaging findings may assist with this difficult diagnosis.

Forty percent of male and 55% of female dialysis patients do not achieve orgasm. The pathophysiology of gonadal dysfunction is multifactorial. It is usually a combination of psychological, physiological, and other comorbid factors. Erectile dysfunction in males is mainly due to arterial factors, venous leakage, psychological factors, neurogenic factors, endocrine factors, and drugs. Sexual dysfunction in females is mainly due to hormonal factors and manifests mainly as menstrual irregularities, amenorrhea, lack of vaginal lubrication, and failure to conceive.

      "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is common in middle-aged and elderly men, affecting more than 100 million males worldwide. Most ED cases can be attributed to organic and/or psychological factors. Here we report an atypical ED case with no clear manifestation fitting the diagnosis for recognized types of ED.The 35-year-old male is unable to have normal erection since puberty, and unable to complete intercourse with his wife. He had no history of trauma, surgery or psychiatric/psychological disease. The patient has a normal male karyotype. There is no significant finding in physical examination, nocturnal penile tumescence test, and ultrasound measurement of penis vascular functions. The serum levels of major hormones are all in normal ranges.Atypical ED, psychogenic ED not excluded; infertility.Oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors Tadalafil (20 mg, BIW) or Sildenafil (50 mg, BIW) had no effect in this patient. Penile prosthesis implantation helped the patient to acquire normal sexual life, but did solve the ejaculation failure and infertility. Motile sperms were obtained by testicular epididymal sperm aspiration under the guidance of ultrasound, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection was performed with occytes retrieved from his wife.The patient sexual life was significantly improved after penile prosthesis implantation; the patient wife is currently in the first trimester of pregnancy as the result of in vitro fertilization.The no response to phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5) treatment may suggest an impediment of PDE5-related pharmacological pathways or the presence of defect/injury in the neural system. This special case raises a question if some patients with persistent ED may have similar manifestations and can be treated with the same procedures.",

Each year, the woman is contacted to complete a questionnaire detailing her reproductive history, presence of pelvic pain, and menstrual history, as well as other miscellaneous gynecologic history. The study covers a follow-up interval of six months to 8 years. The results are categorized according to the severity of the acute PID, as well as the time elapsed since the infection. A psychological investigation of post-PID pain was performed, and yielded accurate prediction of whether or not pain had been reported by a patient during the acute phase of the disease. Results indicate an increased incidence of involuntary sterility as the disease progresses in severity. The occurrence of ectopic pregnancy is increased for all stages of PID, but most particularly, following tubo-ovarian abscess. The long-term consequences of a single episode of acute PID are often severe.",

      "title": "A comparison on the effect of remifentanil patient-controlled analgesia versus fentanyl via any delivery method on maternal satisfaction and pain reduction during labor: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective In parturients who are in active first and second stages of labor, what is the effect of intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with remifentanil on the level of maternal satisfaction and pain reduction from baseline compared to intravenous fentanyl? Background Pain during childbirth has been around since the very first birth of a human. The attempts to alleviate pain during childbirth are long standing with efforts made by midwives, obstetrical nurses, obstetricians, and anesthesia providers. Almost all women in labor experience pain at varying degrees which is mediated by uterine activity, cervical dilation, and fetal position. The process of childbirth is categorized into three stages. The first stage of labor is when the cervix slowly dilates, shortens and thins. Pain is usually felt in the abdomen and the lower back with each contraction. The pain typically intensifies as the cervix reaches full dilation and the fetus moves down in the pelvis towards the birth canal. The second stage of labor is when the cervix is fully dilated and effaced (shortened and thinned) and the fetus is pushed through the birth canal. Pain during this stage of labor is intensified further and is usually felt in the lower pelvic and vaginal areas. It then reaches to the perineum as final stretching occurs to accommodate the large head of the fetus. The third stage of labor is when the placenta is delivered and is associated with comparatively little pain.1 In recent years, continuous laboring epidural catheters (CLEs) have been a mainstay in the delivery of analgesia for the laboring parturient.2-5 They are the most effective and satisfying analgesic delivery method for the control of pain during labor.6,7 Although a proven, safe and effective method of pain control, CLEs are not an acceptable option for all.8 Many institutions may not have 24 hours a day availability of anesthesia providers to offer this option of pain relief during labor. Some laboring women may have infective processes, coagulopathies, spinal/neurological abnormalities, and other physiologic disorders that are contraindications to the placement of a CLE. Additionally, some women may be too fearful of potential complications while others are physically unable to cooperate for the time it takes to administer the CLE. The fear of potential complications is not unfounded, as the placement of the epidural does not come without risk. Incorrect CLE placement can result in intravascular injection, intraneural injection, or intrathecal injection all of which can have catastrophic consequences.9 Before the advent of CLEs, intravenous (IV) narcotics were the backbone of pain management for labor. IV narcotics are still currently in use on a regular basis for women who are in early labor, up to just a few hours before delivery. Narcotics are a powerful class of analgesics with many drugs available that have varying degrees of potency and duration. Commonly used narcotics for labor and delivery include morphine, meperidine, butorphanol, nalbuphine and fentanyl. The choice of which one to use is based on speed of onset, duration of action, associated side effects, provider preference and maternal preference. In spite of well-known sedation properties that exceed its analgesic properties, meperidine continues to be the most commonly used opioid worldwide during labor and delivery.6,8,10-12 This is mostly due to its ease of administration and cost effectiveness.3 In addition to the sedation properties being greater than the analgesic properties, it is well documented in the literature that meperidine causes significant neonatal respiratory depression.8,10,12 With these negative side effects in mind, studies recommend the use of fentanyl as the first line drug to be given for labor analgesia over meperidine.13,14 Fentanyl appears to be a better suited drug for labor, but is still associated with a 44% incidence of a moderately depressed neonate with low Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity and Respiration (APGAR) scores.8 Standard obstetrical practice does not allow administration of either fentanyl or meperidine within two to four hours of delivery or after cervical dilation has reached eight centimeters. This leaves a void in pain relief options for parturients in the later stage of labor and delivery. Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) is a method of drug delivery for pain control that is very familiar to most bedside practitioners. It is a useful strategy for providing pain relief during labor and delivery by establishing plasma levels of narcotics that the parturient can increase quickly and easily as the pain level increases. Remifentanil was first introduced into the United States drug market in 1995 and has slowly found its way into use for labor and delivery. Remifentanil is an ultra short-acting and potent narcotic metabolized by non-specific tissue and plasma esterases. The hydrolysis of the ester link by tissue and plasma esterases affords lack of drug accumulation.15 It has been well documented in the literature that the fast onset and elimination of remifentanil matches well with the onset and duration of contractions during active labor making it an ideal choice for PCA during labor.5,16-18 Rapid elimination permits the titration of an infusion without the concern for prolonged duration of effect or drug accumulation. The safety of mother and neonate are of concern when considering which potent narcotic to administer. Numerous studies have since been published in support of using remifentanil PCA to effectively and safely reduce the pain of labor throughout its duration up to birth.8,10,14,19-26 Favorable neonatal outcomes and proven safety hold far greater implications than maternal efficacy when considering this analgesic for managing labor pain. There is one systematic review published through the International Anesthesia Research Society that compares the effectiveness of pain control of remifentanil during labor to that of meperidine.24 The conclusion of this systematic review revealed remifentanil to be a better analgesic than meperidine and it provided better satisfaction scores. This is not surprising considering the well-known weak analgesic properties of meperidine. There are two studies in the literature comparing the effectiveness of pain reduction and satisfaction of remifentanil and fentanyl during labor.6,12 Each study produced a different conclusion. A systematic review is proposed because of these differences and as a means to focus the body of knowledge concerning this question. Preliminary literature searches have revealed no systematic reviews published comparing remifentanil PCA and fentanyl via any delivery method. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of remifentanil versus fentanyl when used for labor analgesia as measured by maternal satisfaction and reduction in pain score from baseline. The overall intent is to bring together the existing evidence on remifentanil use in labor to provide more insight in choosing the best treatment for intravenous pain management. The results of this systematic review could have an important impact on the decision making process concerning which analgesic to administer during labor. This is important in light of the favorable safety profile of remifentanil when compared to the significant neonatal depression associated with fentanyl. If the systematic review finds that maternal satisfaction and reduction in pain score are better when using remifentanil, a recommended change in practice would be offered which could result in increased safety for the neonate.",

Causes of retroversion act by either weakening the natural supports or bringing an abnormal or unusual strain to bear upon them. The mechanical treatment, or that which corrects the displacement while a cure is being accomplished, or attempted, should avoid weakening or interfering with the natural supports. We may divide the more directly mechanical means usually adopted for correction of such deformity into four kinds. 1. Those which permanently fix the fundus in front of the pelvic axis. 2. Those which draw or fix the os or cervix back of the pelvic axis. 3. Those which place a barrier or obstacle to the forward displacement of the os and cervix. 4.

The measurements were carried out at the bladder neck, in the high pressure zone, and distally in the urethra before and after blockade. Strong adjunctive closure forces were demonstrated all along the urethra. They were significantly reduced by pudendal blockade except at the bladder neck during coughing. The results indicate that the pudendal innervated striated muscles contribute significantly to the adjunctively acting closure forces all along the female urethra, including the bladder neck. Some passive pressure transmission to the bladder neck seems to take place during stress episodes following pudendal blockade, but whether it occurs in healthy females remain uncertain. The findings following pudendal blockade, corroborate with those in stress incontinent women, and thereby support the concept that striated muscle weakness is of pathophysiological significance in stress urinary incontinence.",

The correct plan of examination leads to the proposal of the appropriate treatment. The history, correct judgment of symptoms of incontinence and detailed gynaecological examination are important at the beginning of the diagnostic process. Negative urine cultivation is necessary condition for the invasive investigation of the urinary tract. Special questionnaires, micturition diary and clinical tests belong to the physical examination. The pad-weight test is based on the measurement of weight gain of absorbent pads during a test period under standardised conditions. Q-tip test (cotton swab test) measures the degree of mobility of urethra and bladder neck. Most of the clinical tests can be replaced by the ultrasound examination (introital or perineal approach), which helps to appreciate the vigour of urethra, bladder neck and vagina during the resting period and at stress. Urodynamic examination records pressure changes during the bladder filling, pressure gradients in urethra and the velocity of the urinary flow. It should be carried out when antiincontinence surgery is planned or when conservative therapy failed. Urodynamic examination helps to distinguish between stress and urge type of incontinence. Urethrocystoscopy is indicated for the diagnosis of the recurrent urinary infections, urge incontinence when structural pathologies of the urinary bladder are suspected, iatrogenic incontinence or postoperative complications.",

Causes of FHA can be classified into the three groups: 1) stress-related factors, 2) consequences of weight loss and/or underweight, and 3) consequences of physical exercise or practicing sports. Diagnosis of FHA should be based on a history of menstrual disorders. During physical examination, patients with FHA present with secondary and tertiary sex characteristics specific for the pubertal stage preceding development of the condition and with the signs of hypoestrogenism. Laboratory results determine further management of patients with amenorrhea, and thus their correct interpretation is vital for making appropriate therapeutic decisions. Treatment of chronic anovulation, menstrual disorders, and secondary amenorrhea resulting from hypothalamic disorders should be aimed at the elimination of the primary cause, i.e. a decrease in psycho-emotional strain, avoidance of chronic stressors, reduction of physical exercise level, or optimisation of BMI in patients who lose weight. If menses do not resume after a period of six months or primary causative treatment is not possible, neutralisation of hypoestrogenism consequences, especially unfavourable effects on bone metabolism, become the main issue. Previous studies have shown that oestroprogestagen therapy is useful in both the treatment of menstrual disorders and normalisation of bone mineral density. Hormonal preparations should be introduced into therapeutic protocol on an individualised basis.",

      "abstract": "Selama kehidupan manusia selalu dapat mengalami stres. Stres merupakan respon tubuh yang spesifik terhadap stimulus atau stresor balk dari internal maupun eksternal. Bila stres berlanjut terus menerus dan berulang dapat memberikan gangguan pada berbagai sistem tubuh, salah satunya adalah sistem reproduksi. Fungsi gonadal axis dapat berubah di bawah kondisi tertentu seperti stresor fisik, bahan kimia, dan psikologis. stresor ini dapat menyebabkan terjadinya ketidakseimbangan pada Hipotalamus-hipofisis-ovarian axis. Ketidakseimbangan sistem reproduksi yang ditimbulkan dapat berupa gangguan atau supresi ovulasi. Gangguan reproduksi yang terjadi dapat berupa gangguan menstruasi yang meliputi keterlambatan menarche, fase luteal yang singkat dan tidak adekuat, bahkan terjadi amenorrhea sekunder. Hal ini dapat menyebabkan terjadinya infertil yang reversibel.\r\n\r\nStresor fisik, kimiawi, dan psikologis dapat mempengaruhi frekwensi dan amplitudo pulsatil dari Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH). Hal ini penting bagi sekresi Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) dan Luteinizing Hormone (LH). Selain itu stresor juga dapat mengaktifkan sistem saraf simpatis (pelepasan norepinefrin) dan respon adrenal (pelepasan epinefrin). Peningkatan kadar epinefrin dan norepinefrin dapat meningkatkan pulsasi GnRH. Bila peningkatan pulsasi ini berlebihan dapat menurunkan dan menghentikan sekresi FSH dan LH. Penurunan FSH dan LH akan menghambat pertumbuhan folikel ovarium dan menurunkan sintesis estrogen dan progesteron di dalam ovarium.\r\n\r\nPenurunan sintesis estrogen dan progesteron dapat menambah penurunan jumlah folikel ovarium. Epinefrin sebagai salah satu stresor bahan kimia sering digunakan sebagai salah satu terapi, sehingga penelitian ini bertujuan untuk membuktikan pengaruh pemberian berulang cpinefrin dosis terapeutik maksimal terhadap penurunan jumlah folikel ovarium. Pemberian injeksi subkutan epinefrin dilakukan secara berulang (setiap jam sebanyak 5 kali) yang dimulai pada awal siklus proestrus.\r\n\r\nPenelitian ini adalah eksperimental laboratoris dengan menggunakan rancangan Posttest only Control Group Design. Variabel yang diperiksa adalah jumlah folikel ovarium yang meliputi jumlah folikel primer, sekunder, tersier, dan de graaf. Rancangan analisis data dengan menggunakan analisis multivariate Anova dan uji beda nyata kecil (BNT) 5 %.\r\n\r\nAnalisis terhadap jumlah folikel ovarium dapat digunakan untuk menentukan fertilitas individu. Ovarium yang diambil dibuat preparat histologisnya dan kemudian dilakukan pewarnaan hematoksilin eosin. Dibawah mikroskop dihitung jumlah folikel ovariumnya. Folikel ovarium ini terdiri dari : (1) folikel primer, (2) Folikel sekunder, (3) folikel tersier (4) Folikel De Graaf. Penelitian ini menggunakan 3 kelompok yaitu kelompok kontrol posttest, kelompok 1 yang diberi injeksi subkutan NaCl 0.9 % dan kelompok 2 yang diinjeksi epinefrin.\r\n\r\nBerdasarkan hasil analisis statistik deskriptif didapatkan nilai meandan standar deviasi jumlah folikel primer kelompok kontrol posttest adalah 18.2 ± 5.71 buah, kelompok yang dinjeksi subkutan NaCl 0,9 % 15.9 ± 3.54 buah, dan kelompok yang dinjeksi epinefrin 14.9± 3.45 buah, jumlah folikel sekunder\r\n\r\nkelompok kontrol posttest 10.3± 4.971 buah, kelompok yang dinjeksi subkutan NaCl 0,9 % 9.9 ± 2.47 buah, kelompok yang dinjeksi epinefrin 7.1± 4.33 buah, jumlah folikel tersier kelompok kontrol posttest 7.8 ± 4.158 buah, kelompok yang dinjeksi subkutan NaCl 0,9 % 4.9 ± 1.79 buah, kelompok yang dinjeksi epinefrin 4.5± 1.58 buah, dan juah folikel de graaf kelompok kontrol posttest 6.1± 1.44 buah, kelompok yang dinjeksi subkutan 3.7 ± 1.34 buah, dan kelompok yang dinjeksi epinefrin 1.0± 0.82 buah. Analisis multivariate Anova jumlah folikel ovarium menunjukkan bahwa pemaparan epinefrin berulang dengan dosis terapeutik maksimal tidak mengakibatkan penurunan pada jumlah folikel primer (p=0,240) dan sekunder (p=0,178) pada ovarium dengan nilai p>0,05. Namun terdapat penurunan jumlah folikel tersier dan de graaf akibat pemaparan epinefrin berulang dengan dosis terapeutik maksimal dengan nilai p=0,025 untuk folikel tersier dan 0,000 untuk folikel de graaf. Analisis uji beda nyata terkecil menunjukkan tidak terdapat perbedaan yang nyata (p>0,05) antara jumlah folikel primer (p=0,612) , sekunder (p=0,135) dan tersier (p=0,749) kelompok 1 yang diberi injeksi NaCl 0,9 % dengan kelompok 2 yang diberi injeksi epinefrin. Sedangkan jumlah folikel de graaf antara kelompok 1 dengan 2 menunjukkan ada perbedaan yang nyata (p<0,05) dengan p=0,000.\r\n\r\nPenelitian ini menyimpulkan bahwa stresor kimiawi (epinefrin), stressor fisik berupa suntikan subkutan berulang dapat menurunkan jumlah folikel, serta penurunan jumlah folikel de graaf pada ovarium akibat pemberian berulang epinefrin dosis terapeutik maksimal lebih banyak bila dibandingkan dengan pemberian berulang injeksi NaCl 0.9 %. Berdasarkan hasil ini peneliti menyarankan untuk dilakukan penelitian serupa untuk beberapa siklus birahi yang\r\n\r\ndisertai dengan pengukuran kadar kortisol maupun FSH dan LH untuk melihat pengaruh lebih lanjut terhadap proses folikulogenesis serta membandingkan penurunan jumlah folikel ovarium yang terjadi antara ovarium kanan dan kid. Selain itu juga dapat melihat pengaruh stres terhadap kadar growth hormone, prolactin,dan thyroid stimulating hormone",

This emergency can be predicted before birth. The uterine content film obtained, when a twin pregnancy or an abnormal presentation is suspected, shows an extreme and permanent fetal malposition as early as the 6th month of gestation: the head is forcibly overextended, embedded in the spinal abnormal concavity. Its severity and duration entail a cervical elongation and a temporary atonia of inspiratory muscles. Respiratory autonomy is impossible at birth. A prolonged artificial ventilation should be organised and used immediately at birth to prevent death or any risk of transient cerebral anoxia. The acute neonatal neurological syndrome is only due to a purely peripheral motor and transitory impairment, and it will have no consequences.",

Laboratory tests, imaging, and surgical intervention are not always helpful in identifying the etiology of pelvic pain. For appropriate management of this complex disease process, a detailed history and physical examination, and a multidisciplinary approach are needed. Pelvic pain may be caused by endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, adenomyosis, interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome, or other factors. Evaluation may include keeping a pain diary; laboratory tests, such as a pregnancy test, urinalysis, or tests for sexually transmitted infections; ultrasonography of abnormalities detected on physical examination; and laparoscopy. Specific first-line treatments include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral contraceptives for endometriosis; progestins, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, aromatase inhibitors, or hysterectomy for adenomyosis; and education, food avoidance, and behavioral modifications for interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome. Surgical options include nerve transection procedures, laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation, and presacral neurectomy, although data on effectiveness are limited.",

Very often the cause and effect model used to explain and treat these complaints is one of simple oestrogen deficiency. However, factors other than menopausal status may play an important part in sexual and vaginal problems. This study investigated the relationship between vaginal symptoms and factors such as affective state, the importance of intercourse, satisfaction with sexual activity and strength of desire among 274 peri‐menopausal patients at a menopause out‐patient clinic. While vaginal dryness affects enjoyment and desire for intercourse, only dyspareunia was associated with a reduction in the frequency of intercourse. Depression was found to be an important factor in loss of libido and anxiety was the most important influence on reduced frequency of intercourse.",

      "title": "Obstetric complications and anxiety during pregnancy: is there a relationship?",
      "abstract": "This review examines the contribution of recent research into the effects of anxiety during pregnancy. The focus of interest is upon the process of labor and delivery rather than its timing or the size of the baby. Therefore studies directed at areas of prematurity or low birthweight are specifically excluded as these have already been well evaluated in the literature.It is known that one proximal cause of obstetric complications is increased hormone levels in the uterus. It seems likely therefore that anxiety, a form of arousal, known to influence hormone levels, may be implicated as a distal determinant of obstetric complications.Attempts to evaluate this hypothesis have been hampered by methodological issues such as: poor definition and measurement of obstetric outcomes, in particular utilizing composite measures of diverse components; inappropriate measurements or over broad conceptualizations of anxiety; failure to account for confounding variables and inadequate sample sizes.On balance the evidence reviewed suggests that a general association between anxiety and obstetric complications per se does not exist, but specific types of anxiety, such as psychosocial stress, family functioning, or fear of childbirth may have associations with specific complications, such as prolonged labor or Cesarean section. Recent studies considering the effect of fear of childbirth, for example, on specific obstetric outcomes, such as type of delivery, have produced more clear-cut relationships. Recommendations for future research into the relationships between specific combinations of types of anxiety and individual obstetric complications are discussed.",

Children from two previous pregnancies had been given up for others to raise. This case illustrates a dilemma commonly faced by health care professionals in managing sexual risk-behaviours of chronically ill psychiatric patients. The patient is at risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease (or may have already done so), as well as at risk of pregnancy ending in a child being given up for another to raise. During pregnancy the woman is at risk of experiencing added psychological stress that may precipitate an illness episode, and her medications may have a deleterious effect on the fetus. If she chooses to raise her child, the stress of parenting must be considered, as well as effects on the child of the mother's illness episodes. It must also be considered that the patient's mental illness may impair her capacity to make decisions about contraception. Guidelines for ethically justified responses to such cases are considered in this editorial.",

Ovarian activity was monitored after operation by twice weekly measurements of total oestrogen and pregnanediol in 12‐hour urine samples. Cyclical changes in mood persisted following hysterectomy with the greatest mental and physical symptoms occurring during the late luteal phase of the cycle. In contrast there was a marked decrease in activity and vigour ratings during the late luteal phase of the cycle and during menstruation. There was a small but significant improvement in symptoms in most women following hysterectomy. These results demonstrate that neither the presence of the uterus nor the occurrence of menstruation are necessary for the manifestation of the premenstrual tension syndrome and support the view that it has a hormonal basis.",

      "abstract": "With increasing longevity in Poland, women can now expect to live around 40% of their lives after menopause, and there is a growing desire for older women to preserve their vitality sexual function and quality of life. The most common urogenital symptoms associated with menopause are dryness, followed by irritation or itching, and discharge, with a substantial number of post-menopausal women also being affected by dysuria. These symptoms are the result of vaginal atrophy which is in turn caused by reduced transudation through the vaginal epithelium and reduced cervical gland secretions resulting from post-menopausal estrogen depletion. Vaginal atrophy generally occurs 4-5 years after the last menstrual period and progressively increases in prevalence in the subsequent years. Importantly vaginal atrophy is strongly associated with sexual dysfunction, and lower urinary tract symptoms, such as frequency urgency nocturia and dysuria, as well as incontinence and recurrent infection are reported more frequently in the presence of vaginal atrophy Those symptoms, apart from being bothersome for the patients also negatively impact their quality of life. Consequently before irreversible changes occur, early detection and treatment of vaginal atrophy should be implemented. Estrogen therapy is the most commonly prescribed treatment. Estrogens restore the cytology pH and vascularity of the vagina, resulting in symptom resolution for the majority of treated women. Because vaginal atrophy symptoms tend to occur later than vasomotor symptoms, many women do not necessarily require or wish to take systemic estrogen treatment if their symptoms are restricted to the urogenital tract. Vaginal estrogen products deliver estrogen locally to vaginal tissues with little or no systemic absorption and provide an effective alternative to systemic estrogen therapy for these women. Various vaginal estrogen preparations such as conjugated equine estrogens, estradiol and estriol vaginal creams, a sustained-release intra-vaginal estradiol ring and a low-dose estradiol and estriol tablets are useful therapeutic options in the treatment of this condition. Moreover; a low dose treatment with a minimised systemic absorption rate may be considered in women with a history of breast cancer and associated severe vulvovaginal atrophy. It should be mentioned that vaginal lubricants once applied on a regular basis may also be effective in alleviating the symptoms of vaginal atrophy and should be offered to women wishing to avoid the use of local vaginal estrogen preparations and in cases where local estrogen therapy is contraindicated. Vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), vaginal testosterone, and tissue selective estrogen complexes are new, emerging therapies; however more clinical studies are necessary to confirm their efficacy and safety in the treatment of postmenopausal vulvovaginal atrophy.",

While considered an area of interest and research, and experienced by 3–5% of women, PMDD is not considered to be a serious mental illness. Nonetheless, since the mid‐1800s, courts around the world have countenanced arguments based on the notion that a woman's reproductive organs exerted a profound influence over her mind and behavior.

В литературе существует понятие посттравматического стрессового расстройства, связанного с беременностью и родами, которое описывает психические нарушения у родителей в период от начала беременности до 12 месяцев после родов. В отличие от классического понятия посттравматического стрессового расстройства данный термин употребляется в большинстве случаев по отношению к матери, реже по отношению к отцу ребенка, при наличии травмирующих событий, связанных с беременностью и родами, начиная от начала беременности и включительно до 1 года после родов. Подчеркивается уникальность данного термина с позиции психических нарушений у родителей, что связано с травмирующими событиями на протяжении беременности, родов и дальнейшей судьбой и прогнозом для недоношенного ребенка и/или ребенка с патологией. Приводятся данные о сложностях терминологии, используемой для описания травмирующих событий от начала беременности до 12 месяцев после родов. Изложена информация о распространенности стрессовых состояний в период, связанный с беременностью и родами, у родителей, подробно описываются факторы риска, в том числе акушерские, социально-экономические, патофизиологические, психиатрические. Отдельно описываются стрессовые состояния родителей, чьи дети находятся в отделении реанимации и интенсивной терапии, с описанием реакции родителей при различном исходе госпитализации ребенка. Освещаются варианты профилактики стрессовых состояний у родителей, а также приводятся рекомендации по выявлению пациентов, страдающих посттравматическим стрессовым расстройством, связанным с беременностью и родами, взаимодействию с данной группой пациентов работников родовспомогательных учреждений. The review focuses on post-traumatic stress disorder associated with pregnancy and childbirth. In the literature, there is the concept of post-traumatic stress disorder associated with pregnancy and childbirth, which describes mental disorders in parents during the period from the beginning of pregnancy to 12 months after childbirth. In contrast to the classical concept of post-traumatic stress disorder, this term is used in most cases in relation to the mother, less often in relation to the father of the child, in the presence of traumatic events associated with pregnancy and childbirth, starting from the beginning of pregnancy and up to 1 year after childbirth. The uniqueness of this term is emphasized from the perspective of mental disorders in parents associated with traumatic events during pregnancy, childbirth and the subsequent fate and prognosis for a premature child and/or a child with pathology. Data is provided on the complexities of terminology used to describe traumatic events from the beginning of pregnancy to 12 months after childbirth. Information is presented on the prevalence of stressful conditions during the period associated with pregnancy and childbirth in parents, risk factors are described in detail, including obstetric, socio-economic, pathophysiological, and psychiatric. The stressful conditions of parents whose children are in the intensive care unit are described separately, with a description of the parents’ reactions to different outcomes of the child’s hospitalization. Options for the prevention of stressful conditions in parents are highlighted, and recommendations are provided for identifying patients suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder associated with pregnancy and childbirth, and for the interaction of maternity workers with this group of patients.",

The initial evaluation typically consists of a medical history, physical examination, microscopy examination of vaginal swab, and cervical tests for sexually transmitted infections. Evaluation of patient risk factors is important and should include a detailed discussion about the sexual history (number of partners, type of sexual activity, condom use, new sex partner, sex partner with a diagnosed sexually transmitted infection, sex partner with concurrent sex partners), vaginal hygiene (douching), and age (&lt; 25). All women with symptoms suggestive of cervicitis or vaginitis undergo a physical examination that includes pelvic and vaginal evaluations. Vaginitis is often the result of the presence of infectious agents. The most common infections, such as bacterial vaginosis, Candida vulvovaginitis and trichomoniasis, account for over 90 percent of the vaginal infections.

      "abstract": "The typical symptom of complete uterine rupture is continuous pain in lower abdomen. The prognosis of a complete uterine rupture is poor. However, twin pregnancy with asymptomatic uterine rupture leading to two live fetuses are rare. The authors report a case of a 41-year-old asymptomatic woman with twin pregnancy (gravida 4, para 1) who presented with a large herniation of the amniotic sac through the left uterine horn that was detected by ultrasonography at 26 +5 weeks of gestation. After comprehensive counseling and under close observation, the patient chose to proceed with her pregnancy and extend the pregnancy to 28 +5 weeks gestation. Scarred uterine is the most common risk factor of uterine rupture during pregnancy. The typical symptom of complete uterine rupture is continuous pain in lower abdomen. However, there is no characteristic presentation in uterine rupture. Ultrasound and MRI are all important supplementary means to diagnose the uterine rupture. Therefore, obstetrician should pay more attention to the patients who have the related history or are suspected uterine rupture during pregnancy.",

In this issue Chiarelli and Cockburn (p 1241)1 highlight and confirm the work of other investigators who have shown that vaginal delivery induces urinary incontinence, especially the first vaginal birth.2 Many clinical studies have attempted to discover the particular obstetric event that causes the incontinence. The obvious suspects include large babies and “difficult deliveries” marked by lengthy pushing phases with or without instrumentation. No clear single event has been found to be responsible, suggesting that postpartum urinary incontinence arises from a multifactorial physiological insult. The consequences of this pathophysiology are not limited to urinary incontinence. Pelvic organ prolapse (cystocele, rectocele, and uterine prolapse) and anal incontinence are also troublesome sequelae of vaginal delivery. These prevalent pelvic problems receive even less than the scant attention paid to postpartum urinary incontinence. …",

Inconsistencies of interpretation stem from a lack of consensus about the symptoms, severity, and duration of mental disorder. In addition, opinions differ based on individual case studies and there is no national reporting system or adequate follow up system. Frequently, reviews combine studies conducted prior to and after the 1973 Supreme Court decision, mix elective abortion with those induced for medical reasons, or fail to distinguish between abortions performed early or late in gestation. The literature reveals methodological problems, a lack of controls, and sampling inadequacies. A review of the available literature and the files of \"Abortion Research Notes\" suggests that women at particular risk for postabortion stress reactions are those who terminate an originally wanted pregnancy, are strongly ambivalent, come very late in their pregnancy, or lack the support of significant others.",

The reasons for this may be medical and clear such as rise of blood pressure, which is an obstacle to using combination pills. Sometimes a question arises, whether the feelings are really caused by the contraceptive method, or does the woman possibly blame contraception for some other reason.In Finland, all known combined oral contraceptives (OCs), minipills, implants, IUDs, and condoms are available, yet there are situations when none of these is suitable. For instance, OCs are contraindicated in the case of high blood pressure and problems can be encountered with fitting IUDs if an inflammation is present, or on account of irritability, weight gain, libido change, and depression. Solving psychological problems is arduous and time-consuming; these may include the desire to get pregnant, religious grounds for refusing to use OCs, and the mindset which opposes the introduction of any foreign hormone into the body. Another cause for nonuse of contraception is the unfounded fear of the risk of cancer. That is why the role of counseling is paramount in finding the appropriate contraceptive method for every individual situation.",

This implies that other factors such as age, estrogen levels, genetic factors and overweight have also a role in the pathophysiology of pelvic floor dysfunctions.

      "title": "Physical Activity Level and Its Association with Mental Health and Quality of Life in Females during Menses",
      "abstract": "Background: During a normal menstrual cycle, the lining of a woman's uterus sheds. This cycle is part of a woman's reproductive system and prepares the body for a possible pregnancy. It is also called a period, menses or cycle. A menstrual cycle is considered to begin on the first day of a period. The average cycle is 28 days long; however, a cycle can range in length from 21 days to about 35 days. Girls start menstruating at the average age of 12, but it can range from 8-16 years. The most common symptoms that is been seen during menses are Moodiness, Trouble sleeping, Food cravings, Cramps in the lower abdomen and back. Physical activity plays a key role in maintaining or improving an individual’s wellness. Physical activity (PA) is beneficial for women’s health as it is associated with a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease; breast and colon cancers; type 2 diabetes; osteoporosis; and other adverse health outcomes and also reduces the risk of depression and perceived stress levels. Some women report low physical activity level and energy level during the time of menses. Data from various literatures suggests that there is high prevalence of anemia in India and during menses, due blood loss, the severity level increases. During menses, due to blood loss, hormonal level fluctuations, there occurs extreme pain, mood swings, social stigma as a part of culture; all this alters the mental health status and quality of life. Purpose of the study: To determine the Physical activity level in females during menses. The objective is to find the association of Physical activity level with mental health and quality of life. Methodology: A google form was shared in whatsapp consisting of all 3 questionnaires (IAPQ- International Physical activity questionnaire short form), Quality of life was assessed through (WHOBREF). Mental health was assessed by General health questionnaire (GH-12).The consent and details of the study were also mentioned in the form. All the data were analysed. Results: A total 100 responses were analyzed and out of that 55% were physically active and remaining 45% were inactive. For the association of PA level with quality of life and mental health status, there was a significant association (p&lt;0.05) Conclusions: The overall PA level is 55% in this study. There is also positive influence of PA on general health aspects. Given that a proper understanding of physical activity and doing it on a regular basis can be effective in the health and life of young women and also improving the mental health status and overall quality of life. Keywords: Physical activity, mental health and Quality of life. Keywords:[Physical activity, Mental health, Quality of life, Menses]",

      "abstract": "The ovarian remnant syndrome arises as a consequence of incomplete ovariectomy or ovariohysterectomy. Remnant ovarian tissue which has been left mostly unintentionally in the bitch may show endocrine activity a few weeks to several years after surgery, provoking a variety of clinical signs. The majority of affected bitches return to heat, in other cases signs of pseudopregnancy and endometritis may be observed. Occasionally, bitches with unclear clinical signs are presented with the suspicion of an inactive ovarian remnant. The following article intends to place the origin of the ovarian remnant syndrome into a factual context regarding the responsibility of the veterinarian and to demonstrate a reasonable diagnostic procedure according to the respective clinical signs. In this regard, the clinical-gynaecological examination, including vaginal cytology, must receive high priority, with the addition of progesterone analysis in peripheral blood plasma or serum if required. Using these combined diagnostic tools, ovarian remnants in stages of endocrine activity (follicular and luteal phases as well as cystic or tumourous ovarian tissue) can be easily unequivocally diagnosed. The application of a GnRH-stimulation test is only reasonable in bitches in which clinical signs are missing. In this context, the usefulness of semi-quantitative LH-assays is also discussed.",

      "abstract": "Pregnant dogs are susceptible to chloroform administered shortly before delivery or during labor, and show the same degree of liver injury as normal dogs, or even a somewhat greater one. Chloroform anesthesia may cause more or less hyaline necrosis in the border zone between the maternal and fetal parts of the placenta that may lead to hemorrhage, placental separation, and premature delivery. Chloroform anesthesia causes no injury to the liver of the fetus nor to any other fetal organ, in spite of the fact that it can be demonstrated to be present in these tissues. These experiments raise objections to the use of chloroform in pregnant women where an anesthetic must be continued for half an hour or longer. Chloroform anesthesia may be admissible for the few minutes at the end of the delivery, but when operative measures are necessary, before or after delivery, it is a dangerous anesthetic and surely capable of producing injury to the liver in the manner recognized in the case of normal persons. Objections may be raised to the application of conclusions derived from experiments on dogs to human cases; but the similarity of the effects of chloroform in man and dog surely affords a sound basis of comparison. Two fundamental facts would seem to be now established: (1) Normal human adults may be fatally poisoned (late chloroform poisoning) by chloroform anesthesia of one half to one hour's duration. (2) Normal and pregnant dogs are equally susceptible to late chloroform poisoning, and may be fatally poisoned by an anesthesia of two hours' duration. Hence one may conclude that probably normal and pregnant human beings are equally susceptible to chloroform poisoning, that chloroform anesthesia during any part of the pregnant period is capable of causing liver necrosis, and, consequently, that chloroform is a dangerous anesthetic.",

      "abstract": "In modern era due to altered lifestyle and working motherhood, the rest needed for women during menstruation &amp; during puerperal period is not available. Acharyas have been mentioned the importance of Rajahswalacharya and Sutika Paricharya in our classics. Protrusion of the pelvic organs into or out of the vaginal canal is known as Pelvic Organ Prolapse. It results from weakening or damage to pelvic supporting structures that maintain pel-vic organs' position in-situ. The problem unmasks after delivery and with age progression, due to injury/ laxity of pelvic supporting structures. Anything that increases intra-abdominal pressure can lead to pelvic organ prolapse e.g., chronic constipation, heavy weightlifting&amp; strenuous exercises. Acharya Sushruta has mentioned that Prasramsini Yonivyapda occurs due to chronic irritation &amp; difficult labor. Clinical features of Prasramsini Yonivyapda are Pitta and Vata dominant. According to WHO estimation the global prevalence of uterine pro-lapse is 2-20%. A non-surgical approach to relieve the symptoms is need of hour as surgical management is not a good option for a female of reproductive age group. Moreover, recto cystocele corrected by colpoperineorraphy sometimes doesn’t provide sustainable results. A female patient aged 42 years came to PTSR OPD with com-plaints of something coming out of her vagina for 6 months, heaviness and pain in lower back for 6 months. SthanikChikitsa (Local treatment) was advocated to her for three consecutive cycles after clearance of menses.

      "title": "Enzootic abortion of ewes (ovine chlamydiosis)",
      "abstract": "Ovine chlamydiosis, also known as enzootic abortion of ewes (EAE) or ovine enzootic abortion (OEA), is caused by the bacterium Chlamydophila abortus. Chlamydial abortion typically occurs in the last 2-3 weeks of pregnancy with the appearance of stillborn lambs and inflamed placentas. However, infection can also result in the delivery of full-term stillborn lambs or weak lambs that do not survive longer than 48 hours. Infected ewes can also give birth to healthy lambs and it is not uncommon to observe delivery of a dead and a weak or healthy lamb. There are rarely any predictive signs that abortion is going to occur, although behavioural changes and a vulval discharge can be observed in the last 48 hours of pregnancy. Diagnosis of enzootic abortion depends on the isolation and identification of the causative agent or detection of the agent or its nucleic acid in the products of abortion or vaginal excretions of freshly aborted females. A humoral antibody response may be detected following abortion. Goats as well as sheep and, less commonly, cattle, pigs, horses and deer, can be affected. Chlamydiosis of small ruminants is a zoonosis and the organism must be handled with biosafety precautions. Pregnant women are particularly at risk. \r\nIdentification of the agent: \r\nThe basis for a positive diagnosis of infection with C. abortus depends on a history of abortion in sheep or goats (often in late pregnancy), evidence of necrotic placentitis, and the demonstration of large numbers of the organism in stained smears of affected placentae. The still moist fleece of fetuses or vaginal swabs of females that have freshly aborted are also useful. Care is needed to distinguish cotyledonary damage caused by Toxoplasma gondii and, in stained smears, to be aware of the morphological similarities between C. abortus and Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever. Chlamydial antigen can be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry or the fluorescent antibody test, whereas chlamydial DNA can be detected by the polymerase chain reaction or by microarray. Some of these methods are available in commercial kit form. Chlamydophila abortuscan be isolated only in living cells; thus facilities for growth in chicken embryos or cell cultures, with appropriate biohazard containment, are required. Serological tests: A rise in antibody titre to C. abortus, detected by the complement fixation (CF) test, is common after abortion or stillbirth, but this does not occur in every case. Chlamydophila abortus shares common antigens with C. pecorum and some Gram-negative bacteria, so that the CF test is not wholly specific, nor does it distinguish between responses to vaccination and to infection. Low CF titres need to be interpreted with caution, particularly if these are encountered in individual animals or in flocks with no history of abortion. Alternative serological tests have been developed and some commercialised, but none has been sufficiently appraised so far for field use. A delayed hypersensitivity reaction to chlamydial antigen can be elicited in infected sheep, but the procedure is not amenable to routine use. Requirements for vaccines: Inactivated and live vaccines are available that have been reported to prevent abortion and to reduce excretion. They assist in control of the disease but will not eradicate it. Serological screening during the period after parturition helps to identify infected flocks, to which control measures can then be applied.",

In the gynecological history, attention to prior pelvic incontinence and/or reconstructive surgeries should be noted hormonal status, any gynecologic malignancy and treatments, sexual history, and complaints. The pelvic examination begins with the patient in lithotomy position followed by inspection of the perineal skin and external genitalia for signs of hypoestrogenism such as atrophy or agglutination of the labia. Pelvic floor muscle training involves contraction of the pelvic floor or levator ani muscles to assist in controlling urinary leakage in women with both stress and mixed incontinence.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome and functional bowel disorder are diagnoses used to describe chronic GI symptoms for which no overt pathological condition can be identified. Symptoms are more common in women and are frequently followed in gastroenterology clinics. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the research linking GI symptoms and reproductive cycling and to discuss implications for practice. GI symptoms such as stomach pain and nausea are highest during menses compared with other cycle phases; also, stool consistency is loosest at menses. This pattern is present in control subjects. In women with irritable bowel syndrome the same pattern is seen but with higher symptom intensity. Although animal studies have demonstrated that estrogen and progesterone modulate contractile function of some GI segments, in humans, symptoms are highest when these hormones are at the lowest levels. Thus, symptoms in women may be related to decreasing ovarian hormone levels or to other circulating hormones or factors which vary with the menstrual cycle. Additionally, other factors such as stress aggravate symptoms. Therapeutics directed toward increasing patient awareness of cyclic patterns in symptom complaints, for example, via the use of daily symptom diaries may be a useful adjunct to dietary, pharmacological, and other therapies.",

      "abstract": "Menstrual pain or dysmenorrhea is a gynecological complaint caused by an imbalance of the progesterone hormone in the blood that causes pain and most often occurs in women. Women who experience menstrual pain usually produce prostaglandin 10 times more than women who do not experience menstrual pain. This prostaglandin causes an increase in uterine contractions that causes menstrual pain. Research purposes: to identify literature related to acidic turmeric drinks to menstrual pain levels. The type of literature study conducted is using analytical metadata using literature (literature review) that can explain the benefits of acid turmeric drinks to reduce pain levels during menstruation. Menstrual pain is abdominal pain that comes from uterine cramps that occurs during menstruation. Usually occurs at the onset of menstruation and lasts several hours to several days until it reaches the peak of pain. Menstrual pain is the most common problem in adolescent and adult women, but is a different condition for many women who influence health-related quality of life. Menstrual pain, the fact that women cannot act normally can have an economic impact, because it relates to expenditures spent on purchasing, and medical care. To reduce prices on dysmenorrhea respondents, what we did was to give acidic turmeric drinks to respondents who were conceived during menstruation. Acidic turmeric drinks are drinks that are processed with the main ingredients of turmeric and acid. Naturally turmeric is believed to have active ingredients that can be used as analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory, so it is also acidic (tamarind) which has active ingredients as anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and sedative.",

      "title": "Spine and Joint Disorders in Pregnancy",
      "abstract": "Introduction During pregnancy, maternal anatomic changes present mechanical challenges to the musculoskeletal system. The enlarging gravid uterus alters the maternal body's center of gravity, mechanically stressing the axial and pelvic systems, compounding the stresses brought about by the hormonal changes and fluid retention associated with pregnancy. Complaints of musculoskeletal discomfort during pregnancy are common and may be temporarily disabling. It is estimated that virtually all woman experience some degree of musculoskeletal discomfort during pregnancy, and 25% have at least some temporarily disabling symptoms. These problems usually resolve spontaneously with completion of pregnancy, but occasionally they may remain as chronic disorders. In addition, some musculoskeletal conditions that exist prior to pregnancy may affect the course of the pregnancy. Low Back and Pelvic Girdle Pain General Considerations Having been described by Hippocrates and others through the course of the past two millennia, pregnancy-related lower back pain was more definitively characterized by Walde in 1962, who recognized two patterns of low back pain: lumbar pain and pelvic girdle pain. Setting aside the enduring debate as to whether pregnancy-related back pain is an inevitable or even an essential component of healthy pregnancy, the personal and societal toll is astounding. One study reported that nearly 20% of women suffering with severe low back pain during pregnancy elected to not have another pregnancy because of fear related to recurrence. And as many as 30% of women will need to take sick leave from work, and the pain may persist for over 6 months in 6% of patients. Nighttime backache afflicts over 60% of women, and in more than a third it is so severe that it wakes them from sleep. Persistent pelvic girdle pain has even been found to persist for 2 years beyond postpartum in as many as 8.5% of afflicted patients. Nonetheless, the etiology remains theoretical and its description, until more recently, imprecise. In 2003, Wu and coworkers published a metaanalysis of English-language papers concerning “pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain” (PPP) and “pregnancy-related low back pain” (PLBP), considered together to be “lumbopelvic pain.” They found 761 papers, of which 106 contained sufficient material for analysis. They concluded that about 45% of women have lumbopelvic pain during pregnancy and 25% have lumbopelvic pain after pregnancy.",

There is limited evidence to provide guidance on sexual activity in higher-risk pregnancies complicated by maternal disease. This chapter outlines the existing recommendations for a range of medical conditions and provides useful recommendations for patients, partners, and physicians. Sex is generally considered safe in pregnancy but may require adaptations for improved safety and pleasure. Several factors need to be taken into consideration in the context of maternal conditions, including physical discomfort and limitations, fear of injury to the individual or the fetus, as well as physical awkwardness with increasing gestation. However, abstinence is very rarely recommended in the context of maternal disease in pregnancy.",

So, perimenopausal clinical symptoms begin: hot flushes, tiredness and libido decrease; to these problems, others can be connected to inadequate luteal phase, as breast pain, nervousness and body increase. Therefore, it's possible to affirm that the perimenopause is a particularly delicate period, either because it represents a transient moment to climateric phase, or because it's possible to detect a great hormonal instability, fundamental step for clinical problems. In our investigation we discuss this problem, explain the causes and the possible remedies to delay the onset of symptoms or to treat hormonal perimenopausal modifications.",

Although a number of reviews exist, few have critically evaluated the existing body of research on PD and experimental and procedural pain. Data from 19 published research articles that include women with PD and responses to an experimental or procedural pain stimulus (or stimuli) suggest that women with PD may have elevated pain reactivity, as compared to women without PD. This pattern appears to be true across different phases of the menstrual cycle. However, there is an abundance of conflicting findings, which may be due to significant methodological issues such as inconsistent definitions of PD, wide variation in experimental pain methodologies, and inaccurate assessment of the menstrual cycle. Future research should focus on identifying specific symptoms (i.e., pain threshold ratings) to more clearly define what constitutes PD, establish reliable and valid laboratory testing protocols, and assess the menstrual cycle with greater precision.

Four hundred seventy two articles were selected.When performed liberally, episiotomy appears to increase the risk of post partum bleeding. More restrictive use does not appear to increase the risk of serious perineal injury. In the event of instrumental extraction, use of episiotomy appears to be associated with more severe damage. Medial episiotomy does not appear to be associated with third or fourth degree tears. Following delivery, patients who had an episiotomy complain of perineal pain more than those with an intact perineum or first or second degree tears. Three months after delivery, there is no difference. While episiotomy appears to be a source of dyspareunia during the first weeks after delivery in comparison with spontaneous tears, this does not appear to be true later after delivery.Episiotomy appears to be the cause of more perineal pain and dyspareunia during the early post partum weeks.",

This cessation of menstruation in the female, usually called the menopause, is not the climacteric but represents only visible evidence that the woman is having endocrine imbalance.

      "abstract": "Abstract: Every age group experiences back pain, a common reason for activity limitation. Management of back pain in a woman is challenging because of physiologic and hormonal changes through the woman’s life cycle. The treatment is dictated by etiology and a woman’s stage of life or reproductive events, such as pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause. Most episodes of low back pain are temporary with minimal long-term sequelae, but recurrent and long-lasting episodes require more thorough clinical evaluation. This monograph describes the anatomy of the spine; illustrates a focused, thorough evaluation, including obtaining a medical history and performing a physical examination; discusses warning signs and symptoms of more serious etiologies; provides recommendations for further testing or referral; and offers case vignettes of common causes of low back pain as a woman progresses from young adulthood to advanced age.",

      "abstract": "Muito se discute a importância do parto normal na saude da mulher e do neonato, sendo uma experiencia unica e inesquecivel na reproducao humana. Durante o trabalho de parto ocorre alteracoes na musculatura do assoalho pelvico, e como consequencia surge modificacoes na genitalia, podendo haver alteracoes na sexualidade como falta de libido, diminuicao do desejo sexual, alteracoes hormonais. Alem de tudo, a puerpera passa por fases de ansiedade, condicoes psicologicas, alteracoes no corpo, sao fatores que colaboram para a falta de relacao sexual (PEREIRA et al.,2018). Aproximadamente 53% das mulheres relatam ter queixas sexuais, sendo as mais constantes: ausencia da vontade sexual (34,6%), dificuldade em atingir o orgasmo (29,3%) e dor durante o ato sexual (21%), podendo ocorrer tambem durante o periodo gestacional e puerperio como dor durante ou apos a relacao (22 a 41%) e mais uma vez a falta de vontade durante o ato (83 a 86%) e, cerca de 52% das mulheres no pos-parto ja recomecam a vida sexual dentro de 5 ou 6 semanas. (VETTORAZZI et al.,2012). Mesmo sabendo dos beneficios do parto normal ou vaginal comparado ao parto cesareo, existem indicios de que o parto vaginal esteja relacionado com maiores alteracoes principalmente em mulheres que tiveram filho pela primeira vez. (SILVA et al.,2017). Por conseguinte, identifica-se nessa etapa da vida da mulher, um momento que merece atencao tambem da Psicologia. A intervencao psicologica nesse momento sensivel na vida da mulher e imprescindivel, com a possibilidade de criar um espaco de escuta e acolhimento para as ansiedades vivenciadas no momento do parto, pos-parto e a hospitalizacao. (ALVES et. al., 2012). O apoio psicologico tambem pode prevenir o surgimento da temida depressao pos-parto, um importante problema de saude publica. Os sintomas mais comuns da depressao pos-parto sao desânimo persistente, sentimento de culpa, alteracoes do sono, ideias suicidas, temor de machucar o filho, diminuicao do apetite e da libido, diminuicao do nivel de funcionamento mental e presenca de ideias obsessivas ou supervalorizadas (MORAES et. al., 2006) Sendo assim, o presente estudo tem como objetivo analisar as possiveis influencias do parto normal na vida sexual da mulher, sob a otica da Enfermagem e da Psicologia",

      "title": "Evaluating the Pelvic Floor in Obstetric Patients",
      "abstract": "EDITORIAL COMMENT: This paper presents important information that will be new to many readers about the possibility of pelvic floor denervation occurring in association with pregnancy or delivery. There is some evidence that the condition can occur irrespective of the mode of delivery and antenatal exercises may be of relevance in avoidance of the problem. The important point is that we realize the condition does occur and that it may be influenced by antenatal preparation or the mechanics of delivery in which case we need to know whether timely episiotomy and/or forceps delivery without undue pushing in the second stage is of possible preventative value. There is no doubt that faecal incontinence is a fairly common temporary problem after vaginal delivery especially when an episiotomy has been necessary; although the condition usually resolves, it is a cause of considerable embarrassment — the patient often does not volunteer the symptom at the time of a postnatal visit unless asked. Moreover there are some patients in whom the problem is persistent and occasionally the condition can cause confusion with incontinence thought to be due to an improperly sutured third degree tear. The degree of faecal incontinence following external sphincter repair depends on the extent of injury to the pudenda! nerve. More long‐term follow‐up information is required about this entity and whether persistent problems are associated with particular delivery techniques which may indicate the possibility of prevention. It is also interesting to note that there is evidence that constipation and defaecation straining can damage the nerve supply of the puborectalis and external and sphincter muscles due to perineal descent, resulting in anorectal incontinence 1B . 1A. Laurberg S, Swash M. Henry MM. Delayed external sphincter repair for obstetric tear. Br J Surg 1988; 75: 786–788. 1B. Snooks SJ, Barnes PRH, Swash M, Henry MM. Damage to the innervation of the pelvic floor musculature in chronic constipation. Gastroent 1985; 89: 977–981. Summary: Up to 40% of vaginal deliveries lead to pelvic floor denervation. This has been linked causally with the later occurrence of urinary incontinence, faecal incontinence and vaginal prolapse. Pelvic floor position, anal sphincter pressures and anal electrosensitivity were evaluated in 72 volunteers as simple screening tests for detecting patients who might benefit from neurological assessment. A lower perineum and reduced voluntary sphincter pressures were found antenatally in parous women when compared with nulliparas. The tests were repeated postnatally 24 to 72 hours after delivery. When compared with antenatal readings, the perineum was lower and sphincter pressures were reduced in subjects delivered vaginally. Forty one subjects were reexamined after 6–8 weeks and partial recovery was found. Anal squeeze pressures and pelvic floor position when straining were the results most consistently changed. On the basis of this study it is suggested that 28% of multiparas seen anrenatally and between 25% to 30% of all women who deliver vaginally may be eligible for more detailed neurological study.",

      "title": "Prevention of Pregnancy Loss: Combining Progestogen Treatment and Psychological Support",
      "abstract": "Pregnancy loss can be defined as a loss before either 20 or 24 weeks of gestation (based on the first day of the last menstrual period) or the loss of an embryo or fetus less than 400 g in weight if the gestation age is unknown. Approximately 23 million pregnancy losses occur worldwide every year, equating to 15-20% of all clinically recognized pregnancies. A pregnancy loss is usually associated with physical consequences, such as early pregnancy bleeding ranging in severity from spotting to hemorrhage. However, it can also be associated with profound psychological distress, which can be felt by both partners and may include feelings of denial, shock, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide. Progesterone plays a key part in the maintenance of a pregnancy, and progesterone supplementation has been assessed as a preventative measure in patients at increased risk of experiencing a pregnancy loss. The primary objective of this piece is to assess the evidence for various progestogen formulations in the treatment of threatened and recurrent pregnancy loss, postulating that an optimal treatment plan would preferably include a validated psychological support tool as an adjunct to appropriate pharmacological treatment.",

      "abstract": "Ostomy surgery not only diverts the urinary or intestinal tract to and through the abdominal wall, it also causes an upheaval in an individual's body image and sexual functioning. Without proper care and rehabilitation, it can be one of the most overwhelming and disruptive surgeries performed. It is estimated that about 450,000 Americans of all ages, genders, and sexual orientations have an ileostomy, colostomy, or urinary diversion and that approximately 120,000 new surgeries are performed each year. After ostomy surgery, both the loss of control over elimination of stool and/or urine and the need to wear an external collection device, called an ostomy pouching system, create feelings of depression, low self-esteem, and fear of rejection by current or potential sexual partners. In some cases, these concerns become so extreme that individuals withdraw entirely from their family or other types of socialization. As a consequence of removing the bladder or the rectum, many males experience erectile dysfunction (ED) or retrograde ejaculation. Many women are concerned about body image, pregnancy, or being sexually desirable. Because it is estimated that the average age of individuals with stomas is about 68, education about sexuality and sexual functioning after ostomy surgery is often overlooked. Due to reduced postoperative hospitalization stays, new patients are often discharged with little or no instruction or counseling. Health care educators and professionals must have a clear understanding of the ramifications of ostomy surgery on their clients and their clients' partners in order to assist them in regaining their feeling of sexuality and desirability.",

Eclampsia is the occurrence of convulsions that are associated with the signs and symptoms of pre-eclampsia. The seizure that is the key feature of eclampsia is thought to be due to intense vasospasm of the cerebral arteries, oedema secondary to ischaemic damage of the vascular endothelium and/or intravascular clot formation. HELLP syndrome is a serious complication of pre-eclampsia, but many women do not develop significant hypertension or proteinuria, and it is the most common cause of severe liver disease in pregnancy. Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy (AFLP) is a rare but potentially fatal obstetric complication, described as acute liver failure secondary to fatty infiltration. It is considered a variant of PET.

There is a lack of studies that would show the demand and the nature of help required by women who go through crisis pregnancy. Crisis pregnancy is a pregnancy which is neither planned nor desired by woman, and which means a personal crisis for her. This definition can include a woman for whom a planned or desired pregnancy turns into a crisis over time due to a change in circumstances. Support of close friends or family members is one of the most important factors for woman in crisis pregnancy that could help to overcome it. Qualitative research shows the demand for help that women experiencing crisis pregnancy need. The research method is semi-structured personal interview. Women who had an abortion and received pastoral help through Rachelle program participated in this research. During the time of deliberation the emotional state of women could be described as discomfort (fear), feeling of being lost (having no one to share with or having a strong inner resistance) and being forced to choose an abortion instead of being offered help. The reaction to a crisis pregnancy from medical doctors was pressure, indifference or lack of information. The reaction of husbands/partners to a crisis pregnancy was incomprehension of the situation, hostility towards an unborn child, psychological pressure and even abuse. The reaction from relatives and those close to a pregnant woman was a lack of dialogue, showing no interest towards an unborn child, encouraging an abortion or dissuading it. In a case of encouraging an abortion or dissuading it woman’s decision to give birth depended on the strength of the emotional bond with and trust in the person giving the advice. [...]",

It is well established that the injection of estrin depresses the ovary (1–4) and that male sex hormone depresses the testis (4, 5). Estrin also appears to be able to depress the testis (2), and male sex hormone the ovaries (6, 7, 8). There is considerable evidence that depression of the gonads is due to suppression of the pituitary and not to the effect of the injected substance directly. Further evidence that injected sex hormones suppress the pituitary comes from clinical reports that either estrin or male sex hormone injected into patients at the time of natural or artificial menopause may correct or relieve menopause symptoms in human females (9–12,)",

Many women assume that the degradation of ovarian function is a long, steady decline, characterized by a slow ebbing away of their estrogens. In reality, the perimenopause can be a stormy period of hormonal chaos, with unpredictable levels of estrogen, irregular ovulation, and diminishing peak levels of progesterone. Perimenopausal years, puberty in reverse, can be rapid or slow, tranquil or tempestuous, unnoticed or disorienting. The members of the Council of Affiliated Menopause Societies have agreed that perimenopausal transition shall be defined as the period immediately before menopause when endocrinologic and biologic and clinical features of approaching menopause commence and the first year after menopause. The median onset is around 47.5 years of age. Perimenopause encompasses what is often termed being in or going through menopause. With the mean age of menopause being 51 years of age, perimenopause includes 3 to 5 years before and 1 year after the cessation of menstrual flow. Perimenopause and menopause result from the progressive follicular depletion. The most rapidly progressive decline in fertility occurs after age 38 because of ovary senescence. Atresia of follicles accelerates at this age. Ovulation occurs less frequently, cycle length can increase or decrease, and in an effort to flag the failing ovary, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) rises in the early follicular phase. Although the peak number of follicles at 20 weeks’ gestational age may be as high as 7 to 8 million and 1 million at birth, by age 40 residual follicle units generally has fallen to less than 25,000. These remaining follicle units exhibit functional impairments, less likely to achieve successful and complete maturation. Further down the course, the follicles become less responsive, increasing resistant to stimulation, and surviving units each produce less estradiol. In many cycles, in an effort to find a competent follicle, many follicles are recruited and occasionally",

They can have diverse etiology. Continual exposition to estrogens or androgens may induce female or male dysmorphism, and also development of benign or malignant tumors at target organs. We present a case of a young woman, 15 years old, with virilization, who attend medical consultation for progressive abdominal growing. The presence of ambiguous, genitalia since birth, was not a previous reason of concern. Diagnostic, findings, management and follow up for about 4 months are described and also a topic review. Genitalia develop during first trimester of intrauterine life, under influence of sexual steroids, and changes of sexual development can emerge as consequence of endocrine or morphologic disorders and the later ones, related to karyotypic abnormalities. Sexual steroid and their metabolites can demonstrate individually, different biological effects, suggesting the presence of individual receptors. The presence of cooperative effects between each steroid produce even more complexity to the evaluation of each steroid. Various mutations principally at gene receptors of sexual steroids, cause resistance to them. At female pseudohermaphroditism in difference from male P. there is no errancy at genetic gonadal transmission. These women are intrauterine exposed to excessive quantities of androgens, and they have normal internal genitalia but external ambiguous genitalia. The involved androgen comes from external factors, a it occurs at mother who receives progesterone to avoid abortion, but it is due frequently to androgen storage, caused by enzymatic blockade at steroidogenesis (adrenogenital syndrome).",

Estas fracturas son causadas por insuficiencia o por fatiga.

El embarazo y la lactancia son factores de riesgo para la fractura pélvica por estrés. La mayoría de los casos en la literatura han sido reportados como complicación posparto y unos pocos se han producido en el tercer trimestre. Su aparición se debe considerar al evaluar a embarazadas antes o después del parto con dolor lumbar intenso y de inicio insidioso, generalmente en ausencia de traumatismo.

      "abstract": "Discussion focus is on the diagnosis and management of post-pill amenorrhea. Post-pill amenorrhea can be defined as a presentation of secondary amenorrhea consisting of the failure to resume natural menstruation within 6 months after discontinuing oral contraceptive (OC) use in the case of a woman who is otherwise in normal health. The time of 6 months is arbitrary. It has been estimated that 1-3% of women who discontinue OCs will fail to resume menstruation within 6 months. The wide variation in the incidence of post-pill amenorrhea appears to be dependent upon the time limit set by various authors the population in the study and the peculiarities of the center performing the investigations. The patient requires full investigation mainly to exclude the possibility of a pituitary tumor or a serious endocrinological disorder and to correct any other reversible condition that could be responsible for the problem. A pattern of hypothalamic deficiency may be found. This usually consists of low values for the gonadotropic and ovarian hormones along with mild to moderate elevations of prolactin. A patients concern about missing a few menstrual periods after stopping OC use makes necessary at least a careful history and physical examination. In the physical examination emphasis should be on the following: visual fields and fundi; peripheral neurological deficits; signs of thyroid dysfunction; skin and hair abnormalities; presence of galactorrhea by actual expression of the breasts; and assessing pelvic organs for their size and consistency to rule out pregnancy or tumors. The extent of the initial laboratory investigation will depend to a great extent on the complexity of the presenting signs and symptoms. If pregnancy is not desired there are some effective drug treatments -- clomiphene bromocrptine and human menopausal gonadotropin. 2 factors appear to increase the risk of developing post-pill amenorrhea: a history of anovulatory oligomenorrhea and OCs with high progestational potency. There is no benefit to taking patients off OCs for 1 or 2 cycles a year.",

Moreover, 14 independent prospective studies have shown a link between antenatal maternal anxiety/stress and cognitive, behavioural, and emotional problems in the child. This link generally persisted after controlling for post-natal maternal mood and other relevant confounders in the pre- and post-natal periods. Although some inconsistencies remain, the results in general support a fetal programming hypothesis. Several gestational ages have been reported to be vulnerable to the long-term effects of antenatal anxiety/stress and different mechanisms are likely to operate at different stages. Possible underlying mechanisms are just starting to be explored. Cortisol appears to cross the placenta and thus may affect the fetus and disturb ongoing developmental processes. The development of the HPA-axis, limbic system, and the prefrontal cortex are likely to be affected by antenatal maternal stress and anxiety. The magnitude of the long-term effects of antenatal maternal anxiety/stress on the child is substantial. Programs to reduce maternal stress in pregnancy are therefore warranted.",

First diagnostic procedures are suggested, such as history, evaluation of degree of pubertal development, and gynecologic, neurologic, and psychiatric exam, with temperature curve, vaginal smear, basal and stimulated hormone tests, and chromosome studies as required. Common but probably not pathologic complaints include dysmenorrhea (rule out ovarian cyst, endometriosis, congenital malformation); menstrual irregularity (rule out Stein-Levinthal syndrome); menometrorrhagia (rule out Willebrand's syndrome and vaginal or uterine tumor). Primary amenorrhea, if not simply late development, could be due to ovarian dysgenesis, Turner's syndrome, sellar tumor, olfactory-genital syndrome, testicular feminization syndrome, or malformation of the vagina or uterus. Amenorrhea with virilization may be of adrenal or ovarian origin, distinguished by whether urinary ketosteroids are elevated after adrenal inhibition or after ovarian stimulation. Secondary amenorrhea may possibly be related to hypothyroidism, adrenal androgens, pregnancy, or psychogenic causes. If urinary gonadotropins are high, ovarian tumor, primitive ovarian insufficiency, or gonadal dysgenesis may be suspected; of if gonadotropins are low, primitive hypothalamic syndrome, tumor, or iatrogenic causes may be considered as causes of secondary amenorrhea.",

It is characterized by painful cramps in the lower abdomen that are accompanied by one or more symptoms such as perspiration, lower backache, exhaustion, diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and syncope in severe instances. Because conventional medicines often do not completely relieve pain and have their own side effects on the human body, it is necessary to understand the traditionally documented therapeutic options that have no adverse effects on the human body. The many causes and treatments for dysmenorrhea have been discussed in the unani literature under the category of waje rehm / dard rehm / usre tams. According to Unani manuscripts, the main management strategy is to induce analgesia and address the underlying cause of usr-i-tamth, which includes aberrant temperament, monthly irregularities/uterine disorders, as well as psychological and environmental variables. Unani drugs having emmenagogue, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic are helpful in the treatment of usr-i-tamth.Herbs including Apium graveolens, Cuminum cyminum, Foeniculum vulgare, Matricaria chamomilla, and Nigella sativa have the aforementioned qualities, and their usefulness in usr-i-tamth has been scientifically verified. Validation and preservation of traditional knowledge are thus necessary for future study and important for usage in the modern period. The focus of the review study is on the treatment of dysmenorrhea in the unani medical system. It also goes over some of the herbal medicines and unani compound formulations that are used to treat dysmenorrhea.",

Traditional association of menstruation with \"illness,\" \"curse\" and the like is indicative of the psychic roots of dysmenorrhea.

      "abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND: Breast cancer survivors report many symptoms post treatment. However, longitudinal data, including pre-treatment measures, are scarce making it difficult to accurately attribute symptoms, as patients experience many changes; hormonal fluctuation, chemotherapy, additive endocrine therapy. Therefore, we undertook this longitudinal study to distinguish the impact of these different treatments along the survivorship time course, starting with time at diagnosis. METHODS: Female, breast cancer survivors completed symptom questionnaires (Qx) pre-treatment (pre-tx), at 6-months follow-up (during-tx) and 12-months (post-tx) follow-up. Women rated symptoms in the past week as not at all, a little bit, somewhat, quite a bit, and very much. Symptoms included, hot flashes, vaginal discharge, vaginal itching, vaginal dryness, pain during intercourse, loss of interest in intercourse, weight gain, dizziness, vomiting diarrhea, headaches, abdominal bloating, breast sensitivity, mood swings, irritability, and joint pain. Additional measures included view of overall health, overall pain in the past month, and average fatigue in the past week. Chi-square tests were conducted across time points and stratified by menopausal status and type of treatment. Symptom changes from baseline, clustered by subject, were entered into a generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. RESULTS: Of the 237 breast cancer survivors (median pre-tx age: 53 years, range: 24-70), who completed the pre-tx Qx, 112 completed the 6-month Qx and 95 completed the 12-month Qx. Women reported an increase in hot flashes from pre-tx to 6-months (p&amp;lt;0.001) and pre-tx to 12-months (p=0.04), with a slight decrease from 6 to 12 months (p=0.19). An increase in vomiting was observed from pre-tx to 6-months (p=0.04). Women reported an increase in vaginal discharge from pre-tx to 12-months (p=0.04), and a decrease in average fatigue in the past week from pre-tx to 12-months (p=0.04). Both overall pain in the past month and joint pain in the past week increased from pre-tx to 6-months and then decreased below pre-tx levels at 12-months (p=0.03 and p=0.12, respectively). Changes in hot flashes, vaginal dryness, pain during intercourse and weight gain were only observed among premenopausal women, while changes in vaginal discharge were only observed among postmenopausal women. GEE modeling showed associations between the use of endocrine therapy and increased hot flashes (Odds Ratio [OR]: 2.60, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.97-3.42), vaginal discharge (1.38; 1.15-1.66), pain during intercourse (1.34; 1.05-1.72), weight gain (1.61; 1.22-2.12) and joint pain (1.90; 1.48-2.45). By 12-months, severity of all symptoms decreased, except for vaginal discharge. Associations were observed between the use of chemotherapy and decreased weight gain (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48-0.91) and decreased breast sensitivity (0.67; 0.49-0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Several symptoms thought to be related to treatment may actually be present at time of diagnosis and many treatment-related symptoms appear to decrease by 12-months. Severity appears to be modified by menopausal status and type of treatment. Our results give crucial insight for the development of effective symptom-based management and intervention along the treatment time course.

In many cases, a specific etiology may never be identified. A variety of clinical presentations are possible, ranging from imperceptible loss to profound life-threatening shock. Physicians should be able to diagnose and manage the six recognized types of spontaneous abortion: threatened, inevitable, incomplete, complete, missed and septic. In all cases, uterine evacuation, avoidance of complications and psychologic support of the family are important. The prognosis for a subsequent successful pregnancy is good, except in cases of habitual abortion.",

This chapter introduces the definitions of chronic pelvic pain, vulvodynia, and the bladder pain syndrome. It focuses on the history of the nosology of sexual pain syndromes. In clinical practice and in research settings, the three most frequently used terms to describe sexual pain in women are vulvodynia, dyspareunia, and vaginismus. The tissues of the vulva and vagina are both responsive and dependent on sex steroids (hormones) for proper health and function. There are many causes of decreased sex steroids, both natural and iatrogenic, that can lead to dyspareunia. The most common cause of decreased sex steroids in women is menopause. The discomfort of vulvodynia can also be associated with pelvic floor muscle overactivity or hypertonicity.",

Psychological problems became progressively more severe from childhood to incapitation by age 13 years. Gender identity reversal was performed after extensive physiological testing. Because he wanted to have corrective surgery, his external genitalia sex reassignment was made male from female. There were surgical problems with his phalloplasty; after surgery at infancy there was reduction of the phallus with recession of the glans to the typical clitoral location. Genital response during sexual activity and satisfaction after reconstructive surgery for male genitalia are as yet unknown. This patient is a typical example for medical, psychological and surgical dilemmas of sex reassignment and the problems of early corrective surgery. Sufficient brain virilisation associated with undervirilised external genitalia is an important problem for assignment of gender identity.",

      "title": "Phytotherapy in the Management of Menopause-Associated Vasomotor Symptoms",
      "abstract": "Introduction:  Menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation for at least 12 consecutive months which results from the loss of ovarian follicular activity. Although it is a normal and natural part of aging occurring on average at age of 51 years, most menopausal women develop symptoms, which may deteriorate their quality of life for around one third of their life span (given the mean female life expectancy in Bulgaria of 78 years). The most common complaints are the vasomotor symptoms (VMS: hot flashes and night sweats). Hormone therapy was the gold standard of care for menopausal symptoms before the release of the Women`s Health Initiative. Afterwards, women became reluctant or anxious to use hormone therapy and sought natural non-hormonal alternatives. Materials and Methods:  An analysis of accessible articles in scientific web databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar) on the problem was conducted. Collected data considering evidence in alleviating vasomotor symptoms by popular herbal remedies was further reviewed and summarized. Results: Botanical supplements are considered to act through a number of different mechanisms of action including estrogenic, progestogenic, and/or serotonergic pathways that might mimic the actions of endogenous substances. But clinical studies of the main herbal drugs used to alleviate vasomotor symptoms either did not suggest significant efficacy (as not being superior to placebo) or were limited, and inconsistent, or show different improvements: in well-being, depression, health scores. Thus, patients should be informed to be cautious of possible side effects notwithstanding the general perception of that something is safe if it is of natural origin. In case of adverse reactions, women should be referred to specialists for reconsideration of their therapy. Conclusion:  To conclude, as the evidence for phytotherapeutic menopausal VMS relief is both scarce and unconvincing, there is definitely a continued need for further work on the effectiveness and long-term safety of herbal medicinal products.",

      "abstract": "Latar belakang : Dismenorea primer (PDM) adalah nyeri haid yang terjadi tanpa adanya kelainan dari organ reproduksi secara nyata, yang timbul sejak menstruasi pertama dan terjadi biasanya dalam 6-12 bulan pertama setelah menarche. PDM berhubungan dengan kontraksi uterus yang dipicu oleh berkurangnya progesteron di awal menstruasi. Kontraksi ini menyebabkan iskemia uterus, yang akan memodulasi nyeri ditambah dengan meningkatnya kadar prostaglandin. Akupunktur adalah salah satu modalitas terapi yang sering digunakan untuk mengatasi nyeri, termasuk nyeri menstruasi. Akupunktur terbukti mengurangi nyeri secara efektif dengan efek samping minimal sehingga dapat meningkatkan kualitas hidup pasien.Kasus : seorang perempuan 26 tahun dengan dismenorea primer yang sudah terjadi sejak beberapa tahun terakhir dan semakin lama keluhan nyeri semakin memberat (NRS 6), hingga saat terjadi dismenorea menggangu pekerjaan dan kualitas hidup pasien. Dilakukan terapi akupunktur sebanyak 3 siklus menstruasi pada titik LI4 Hegu, SP10 Xuehai, serta titik Kidney daun telinga bilateral. Elektroakupunktur gelombang DD 4/20 Hz diberikan pada titik CV4 Guanyuan, CV6 Qihai, SP9 Yinlingquan, SP8 Diji, SP6 Sanyinjiao dan ST36 Zusanli, sebanyak 2 kali seminggu, selama 20 menit per sesi.Hasil : setelah 18 kali sesi akupunktur, skala nyeri pasien yang diukur dengan NRS berkurang dan kualitas hidup pasien yang diukur menggunakan kuesioner SF-36 hasilnya meningkat. Dalam follow up 3 bulan berikutnya setelah sesi akupunktur selesai, didapatkan bahwa saat menstruasi pasien hanya mengalami sedikit rasa tidak nyaman (NRS 1), tapi tidak mengalami nyeri seperti sebelum diterapi akupunktur. Sehingga akupunktur dapat berperan dalam penanganan dismenorea primer, baik sebagai preventif maupun kuratif.",

Premenopause is characterized by a progesterone insufficiency which manifests in menstrual irregularity and menometrorrhagia. Treatment with progesterone replacement alone is most often sufficient. Menopause is the cessation of menstruation, sometimes without other symptoms. Immediate postmenopause is the most difficult period to live through; symptoms arise from the disappearance of ovarian secretions and an estrogen/progesterone replacement is necessary. Late postmenopause is sometimes complicated by osteoporosis, which estrogen helps prevent, but calcium should be added for greater effect. It is preferable to prevent the harmful effects of the menopause rather than cure the pathological consequences.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Expulsion of the tsetse larva from the uterus of the female is preceded by 1–2 h of rhythmic pulses of haemolymph pressure that can be detected using a barographic technique. At first baseline pressure is maintained and all pulses are positive in relation to baseline. Then, about 1 h before parturition, baseline pressure increases, pulse intensity increases, and the pulses become both positive and negative in relation to baseline. Each pulse correlates with ‘bobbing’ action of the female's proboscis, the only external indication of this internal activity. A single large pressure pulse is observed at parturition, and thereafter the pressure level returns to the original baseline and pulsing action ceases. Around the presumptive time of ovulation, 1–2 h after parturition, another series of pressure pulses is observed. The pulses are the likely consequence of coordinated waves of muscular contraction that are essential preparation for successful parturition and ovulation.",

      "title": "Is Psychiatric Consultation in Abortion Obsolete?",
      "abstract": "The 1973 United States Supreme Court decision removing all impediments to abortion requested by adult women in the first trimester eliminated the necessity for psychiatrists to “approve” such abortions on psychiatric grounds. At the same time, the development of new thinking about post-abortion emotional problems occurred. It was shown that despite the formerly widely held view that abortion was usually followed by psychiatric illness, such complications are in fact rare. Therefore, the two principle reasons for routine psychiatric consultations in abortion cases are no longer viable. Nevertheless, there are important indications for psychiatric involvement in pre- and post-abortion counseling and consultation which cannot be overlooked. These can be summarized as cases in which: 1) the woman exhibits marked ambivalence, or in which motivation for continuing or terminating the pregnancy is suspect; 2) unhealthy, self-destructive or inappropriate use of sexuality results in pregnancy, with the use of abortion as birth-control; 3) the woman is incompetent to decide on continuation or termination of pregnancy; 4) a serious physical illness may have compromised the ability of the woman to cope emotionally with the issue of pregnancy or abortion; 5) there is a history of prior psychiatric illness, especially postpartum illness or suicidal behavior; or 6) the primary role of the psychiatrist is in liaison or education of the physician or staff. Six illustrative cases are briefly presented and discussed.",

      "abstract": "Certain medical conditions worsen during the different phases of the menstrual cycle. Approximately 20–40% of reproductive-aged women experience menstrual cycle-related symptoms that significantly impair their usual physical and emotional health. Normal ovarian function rather than reproductive endocrine imbalance is associated with menstrual cycle-related disorders. The cyclic fluctuation in estrogen and progesterone is the primary factor that can alter cognitive and sensory processing, emotional wellbeing, appetite, and certain disease states in women. Research suggests that the worsening of certain clinical conditions results primarily from changes in neurotransmitter levels (e.g., gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin) induced by cyclic changes in ovarian sex steroids. Furthermore, certain clinical conditions can alter hypothalamic and pituitary function either directly or secondarily through medications used to treat these disorders. This chapter reviews the associated effects of the menstrual cycle on health, including premenstrual syndrome, menstrual migraine, catamenial epilepsy, and other medical conditions. The accurate and prospective documentation of symptoms in relation to a particular phase of the menstrual cycle will help diagnose these cyclic disease states and provide a strategy to target preventive therapy.",

      "title": "Acute appendicitis during pregnancy",
      "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency during pregnancy. It should be suspected when a pregnant woman complains of newly developed abdominal pain. No laboratory finding was found to be conclusive for acute appendicitis during pregnancy. A considerable percentage of fetal loss occurs after appendectomy in pregnant women during the first trimester, but also during the second. The combination of symptoms and clinical findings are crucial in making the diagnosis of acute appendicitis during pregnancy. Uterine contractions and diffuse or periumbilical abdominal pain, which migrates into the right lower quadrant are significantly more frequent among pregnant women with acute appendicitis than in pregnant women with other types of abdominal pathology. Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, leukocyte count, CRP and body temperature were of no help in establishing the correct diagnosis. The maternal morbidity and mortality were no higher than they were in other, non-pregnant individuals with acute appendicitis. However, the complications of the pregnancy itself were found to be significant.",

When a pregnant women presents herself as a patient with low back- and pelvic pain, walking dysfunction, and when the pain is reproduced by sacroiliac provocation tests, the diagnosis \"symptom-giving pelvic girdle relaxation\" may be justified. If the same symptoms and signs continue after delivery, we suggest the term \"pelvic joint syndrome\". Studies of selected patients indicate an incidence of 1.5 to 16%. In a random Norwegian population comprising 1,045 women, 25% claimed to have had pelvic girdle relaxation pre- and/or post partum. Four months post partum a point prevalence of 26.5% was found to have pelvic and low back pain. One of three was diagnosed as pelvic joint syndrome on the basis of special criteria after having excluded other diagnoses by clinical examination, X-ray and laboratory controls. Symptomatic lowback pain may be a difficult differential diagnosis. Risk factors for pelvic joint syndrome seem to be previous pelvic girdle relaxation or pelvic girdle relaxation in mother and sisters.",

      "title": "Suicide by Firearm and Hormonal Imbalances: A Forensic Case Report With Literature Review",
      "abstract": "Hormonal imbalances play a crucial role in the development of various diseases, with a significant impact on the gynecological system, especially in the onset of uterine fibroids (UFs). UFs, also known as myomas or leiomyomas, are noncancerous uterine growths commonly observed in women, particularly during their reproductive years. By age 50, many women experience fibroids, though the condition's prevalence varies significantly across different ethnic groups. While most fibroids remain asymptomatic, those that are symptomatic can lead to several issues, such as irregular bleeding, pelvic discomfort, and complications during pregnancy. Receiving a diagnosis of fibroids can be distressing, particularly when concerns arise about their potential link to more serious conditions. This distress can adversely affect a woman's quality of life and mental health, sometimes contributing to emotional distress, depressive symptoms, or even suicidal ideation. The management of UFs encompasses a spectrum of approaches, from careful monitoring to medical or surgical interventions, which are chosen based on the severity of symptoms and the patient's preferences. Psychological support can be valuable in helping women manage the anxiety and fears associated with the diagnosis and treatment process. Consequently, the impact of UFs on women's mental health warrants attention. This paper aims to review the existing scientific literature on the potential link between UFs, hormonal imbalances, and an increased risk of psychiatric disorders.",

      "title": "Urinary Retention and Post-Void Residual Urine in Men: Separating Truth From Tradition",
      "abstract": "The definitions of acute and chronic urinary retention remain empirical and subject to wide interpretation. Standardized criteria have not been established and many questions remain unanswered. Moreover, the definition of significant post-void residual urine is unclear. We reviewed several aspects of urinary retention that require clarification with the objective of stimulating discussion among urologists to establish an accurate and coherent definition of urinary retention and significant post-void residual urine, and clarify risk factors.A MEDLINE search for articles written in English and published before April 2007 was done using a list of terms related to urinary retention. Articles not directly relevant to urinary retention or post-void residual urine were excluded.The term urinary retention lacks precise clinical or urodynamic meaning. Use of this term to describe a symptom, a sign, and a condition further complicates the issue. Many factors can contribute to the development of retention, including bladder outlet obstruction, detrusor underactivity, and neurogenic bladder conditions. Community based studies and clinical trials in patients with benign prostatic enlargement and/or lower urinary tract symptoms yield different estimates of the incidence of retention and only provide information on the epidemiology of acute urinary retention. However, age, previous retention episodes, lower urinary tract symptoms, chronic inflammation, serum prostate specific antigen level, prostate size, and urodynamic variables appear to be predictors of acute urinary retention. Alpha-receptor antagonists and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors may be useful in preventing urinary retention episodes and progressive benign prostatic enlargement. Clinical trials on the short-term use of antimuscarinics have not provided evidence that these agents increase the risk of retention; data on longer term administration are needed.Clinicians are adopting less invasive approaches (eg pharmacology or catheterization) to treating patients who present with the symptoms, sign, and condition of urinary retention. Faced with an abundance of new data on acute urinary retention, urologists need to reach a consensus about the risks of urinary retention; this may promote movement toward patient centered prevention strategies with tailored treatment options.",

      "title": "Medication used in Nausea and Vomiting of Pregnancy - A Review of Safety and Efficacy",
      "abstract": "Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms experienced by 50– 90% of women’s in early pregnancy. ‘Morning sickness’ is a misnomer frequently used to describe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP), although the symptoms may persist the whole day and/or night. Pregnant women experience these symptoms mainly in the first trimester between 6 and 12 weeks of gestation, few of them continue till 20 weeks of gestation while in few others it continues throughout the pregnancy. The problem peaks at 9-week gestation, and approximately 60% of NVPs resolve by the end of first trimester. In a very small minority of these patients, the symptoms become severe leading to dehydration, weight loss, excessive vomiting, and mandate hospital admission; this condition is known as Hyperemesis Gravidarum.\r\nFairweather D.V proposed the most widely used definition of Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG). He defined HG based on the symptoms, vomiting exceeding three times a day with significant ketonurea or weight loss more than or equal to 5% of pre pregnancy weight, electrolytic imbalance or fluid depletion, and onset occurs at 4 to 8 weeks of pregnancy till 14 to 16 weeks. Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is of multifarious etiology (fluctuating levels of progesterone, estrogens, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), slow peristaltic movement of Gastrointestinal (GI) tract); however, the exact mechanism remains still unclear.\r\nGiven the uncertainty in treatment of NVPs, both patients and healthcare practitioners often fear the use of antiemetic medications in pregnancy due to the potential risk to fetus and mother. The manifestation of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy is different among each woman, so its management should be tailored similarly. An early treatment of nausea and vomiting is important and beneficial since it prevents a more severe form of occurring, or a possible hospitalization, and prevents both emotional and psychological problems. It is very important for the women and the healthcare providers to understand that a safe and effective NVP treatment benefits both fetus and mother, thus all the treatment options should be open and considered.\r\nNonetheless, given the widespread prevalence of nausea and vomiting, its adverse effects and effects on psychological conditions of pregnant women, it is necessary to be treated effectively and safely during embryonic and fetal developmental stages. First trimester exposure is important to be assessed to monitor the teratogenic potential of the drug; however, randomized control trials are rarely conducted for pregnant women for ethical reasons. Whereas the epidemiological studies done are observational and lack population strength to establish safety and risk involved. This review will mainly focus on pharmacological drugs used in treatment of NVP, and explore their safety and efficacy and evidence based practice. There have been many studies examining the safety of drugs used in NVPs and few of them are covered in this review. The dietary, lifestyle modifications, and nonpharmacological approaches are not covered in this section.",

Climacterium often causes or worsens sleep disturbances. Thus, effective management already at the acute phase will lead to the best outcome. According to women's own judgment, HT significantly improves sleep quality, although studies using polysomnography have reported inconsistent results. HT can thus be considered as a first line therapy for menopausal sleeping problems, especially if other climacteric symptoms are also present. Part of the sleep disturbances may just coincide with the menopausal period and are thus not of endocrinological origin. Therefore, if no relief during HT has been achieved within a few months, or if symptoms and signs direct on other underlying causes, further medical examinations are warranted.",

We present and discuss a case with the onset of obsessive-compulsive disorder in the fourth month of gestation, which fully recovered two weeks after delivery. The phenomenology of the observed disorder was similar to earlier reports of obsessive-compulsive disorder in pregnancy, i.e. the obsessions and compulsions were predominantly related to the concern of contaminating the foetus resulting in washing compulsions. Despite the initial success with anti-obsessional drugs, the patient stopped the medication in the last month of gestation. Nevertheless, she fully recovered two weeks after the delivery without any psychiatric intervention. There were no obsessive-compulsive symptoms at one-year follow up. The possible mechanisms involved in the aetiology of this case, and future research directions in understanding the role of pregnancy in OCD are discussed.",

      "title": "Women with Gastrointestinal Symptoms: Implications for Nursing Research and Practice",
      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome and functional bowel disorder are diagnoses used to describe chronic GI symptoms for which no overt pathological condition can be identified. Symptoms are more common in women and are frequently followed in gastroenterology clinics. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the research linking GI symptoms and reproductive cycling and to discuss implications for practice. GI symptoms such as stomach pain and nausea are highest during menses compared with other cycle phases; also, stool consistency is loosest at menses. This pattern is present in control subjects. In women with irritable bowel syndrome the same pattern is seen but with higher symptom intensity. Although animal studies have demonstrated that estrogen and progesterone modulate contractile function of some GI segments, in humans, symptoms are highest when these hormones are at the lowest levels. Thus symptoms in women may be related to decreasing ovarian hormone levels or to other circulating hormones or factors which vary with the menstrual cycle. Additionally, other factors such as stress aggravate symptoms. Therapeutics directed toward increasing patient awareness of cyclic patterns in symptom complaints, for example, via the use of daily symptom diaries may be a useful adjunct to dietary, pharmacological, and other therapies. In individuals with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms for which there is no overt pathological condition the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is frequently given or they are said to have functional bowel distress (FBD). One report estimated that up to one-half of patients seen by gastroenterologists have IBS (Harvey, Salih, & Read, 1983). In the United States, IBS and FBD are reported more frequently by women as compared to men(Crouch, 1988). Despite the link between the report of chronic gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and gender, little systematic study of this relationship has been made. The authors' research has focused on probing the interaction between reproductive cycling and GI symptoms and on identification of potential mechanisms accounting for symptoms in women. Nurses who counsel and manage women with regard to their symptoms need to understand the links between reproductive and GI physiology so that appropriate interventions can be planned. This article provides an overview of the current state and future directions for research linking GI symptoms and the menstrual cycle and then gives implications for nursing practice and additional nursing research.",

      "title": "Comparative study of Mifepristone with Vaginal Misoprostol and Vaginal Misoprostol alone for second trimester medical termination of pregnancy",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: \r\nAbortion is defined as the termination of pregnancy after implantation of the blastocyst in the endometrium but before fetus has attained the period of viability, before 20 weeks of gestation or weight less than 500 grams.(WHO). Abortions can be classified as either Spontaneous or Induced. About 85% of the induced abortions are in the first trimester and 15% in the second trimester. Ideally if the first trimester termination is done, prognosis is better. Morbidity and mortality rates in second trimester are 3-4 times higher than that of the first trimester terminating. There are various reasons for delay in seeking abortion:\r\n1. Lack of information on the availability of abortion facilities. \r\n2. Ignorance and / or psychological denial of pregnancy. \r\n3. Ambivalence regarding the desirability of abortion \r\n4. Late identification of Medical disorders contraindicating the continuation of pregnancy. \r\n5. Late discovery of fetal malformation. \r\n6. Lack of financial resources to reach the hospitals. \r\nInduction of medical abortion in India is a hallmark in women's health. Medical abortion is an approach to pregnancy termination which is non invasive with minimal side effects. The mortality and morbidity rates are higher in second trimester termination of pregnancy than in first trimester termination of pregnancy. There is a search for better, safer, quickest, costeffective, convenient and feasible method for termination in second trimester. So in this study, medical method of termination of second trimester pregnancy with mifepristone and misoprostol is compared with misoprostol alone. \r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n1. To compare the outcome of tablet mifepristone and vaginal misoprostol versus vaginal misoprostol alone for second trimester medical termination of pregnancy. \r\n2. To evaluate induction abortion interval.\r\n3. To study and evaluate failure rate, complications, and side effects. \r\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: \r\nInclusion criteria: \r\n1. Pregnant women who need MTP from 13 — 20 weeks in family planning OPD.\r\n2. Pregnant women with anomalous baby from 13-20 weeks of gestation. \r\n3. Pregnant women with obstetric & medical indications for 2nd trimester termination from 13-20 weeks.\r\nThe study to be conducted in women admitted in GRH for second trimester termination of pregnancy. They were grouped into two GROUP A-mifepristone &misoprostol GROUPB-misoprostol alone Group A : T. mifepristone 200mg orally given . 48 hrs later, under strict aseptic precaution , misoprostol 400p.g is kept in the posterior fornix. The dose is repeated after 8hrs, 6hours, 4hours,4hours to the maximum of 5 doses. Group B : Under strict aseptic precaution 400iug misoprostol is kept in the posterior fomix. The dose is repeated after 8 hrs, 6 hours, 4 hours, 4 hours to the maximum of 5 doses. Analgesics and antibiotics are given. In each groups the following parameters and noted.\r\n➢ The time of application of tablets.\r\n➢ Number of doses of misoprostol.\r\n➢ Monitoring of pulse, blood pressure, temperature.\r\n➢ Progression of abortion assessed. \r\n➢ oxytocin augmentation is done with oxytocin 10 units in 500m1 of normalsaline at 10 to 20 drops/minute is done when the cervix is effaced and 2-3 cm dilated with poor progression of abortion. \r\n➢ Side effects like rigor, fever, nausea, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dizziness. ➢ Complications like retained products, bleeding, rupture, infection noted.\r\n➢ Interval between induction and abortion interval noted. \r\n➢ Whether the placenta expelled into noted. Inj. Oxytocin 10 units in 500m1 of normal saline at 20-30 drops per minute started if the placenta did not expelled in 30-60minutes. \r\n➢ The placenta is examined for its completeness. routine check curettage is not done. It is done only when there is suspicion of retained products. \r\n➢ After expulsion the women is kept in the labour ward for two hours to monitor vitals and bleeding. \r\n➢ Inj. Anti D is given for Rh negative mothers. \r\n➢ Milk suppression is given with cabergoline in women who undergo MTP more than 15 weeks. \r\n➢ USG is done to rule out retained products after 24 hours. if there is significant retained products check curettage done. \r\n➢ Repeat hemoglobin is done after 48 hours. \r\n➢ Advise regarding contraception given. Patient is followed at the end of one month and the end of three months to enquire about menstrual regularity and general status. \r\nRESULTS: \r\n42% of patients are between 25-30 years of age in mifepristone and misoprostol group and 52% in misoprostol group. \r\n➢ 56% are multigravida in mifepristone and misoprostol group and 62% in misoprostol group. \r\n➢ Mean gestational age is 16.54 weeks mifepristone and misoprostol group and 16.20 weeks in misoprostol group. \r\n➢ There is no statistically significant difference in age, parity, and gestational age in weeks between mifepristone with misoprostol group and misoprostol group. \r\n➢ Induction to abortion interval is (12.93hrs.) shorter in mifepristone and misoprostol group than( 19.18 hrs.) in misoprostol group and is statistically significant. (p=0.001).\r\n➢ The number of doses of misoprostol needed in mifepristone with misoprostol is less than misoprostol alone group and is statistically significant (p=0.008).\r\n➢ Requirement of oxytocin augmentation was much less in mifepristone and misoprostol group (4%) than misoprostol group (10%) but not statistically significant. (p=0.481).\r\n➢ The success rate is 98% in mifepristone with misoprostol group than 90% in misoprostol group, and is statistically significant. (p=0.027). \r\n➢ Complete abortion occurred in 90% in mifepristone &misoprostol group and 60% misoprostol group. ➢ There is no statistically significance of age in relation to induction outcome in both the groups. (p=0.282). \r\n➢ There is no statistically significance of parity in relation to induction outcome in both the groups. (p=0.662) \r\n➢ There is no statistically significance of gestational age and relation to induction outcome in both the groups. (p =0.380).\r\n➢ Side effects & Complications occurred in less number of patients 18% in mifepristone with misoprostol group than misoprostol group 52% and is statistically significant. (p=0.012). \r\n➢ Incomplete abortion requiring curettage is more with misoprostol group (15/50) 30% than mifepristone with misoprostol group (4/50) 8% and is statistically significant(p=0.038). \r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe combination of mifepristone and misoprostol is now an established and highly effective, safe method for second trimester medical termination of pregnancy. The combination of mifepristone and misoprostol significantly reduces the induction abortion interval. Mifepristone followed by misoprostol reduces the number of doses of misoprostol and hence the incidence of side effects and complications are reduced. Where mifepristone is not available or affordable, misoprostol alone has also been used and is shown to be effective, although higher total dosage is needed and the efficacy is lower than for the combined regimen. Therefore, whenever possible, combined regimen should be used. Future studies should focus on improving the pain management, treatment of women with failed medical abortion after 24 hrs and the safety of medical abortions regimens in women with a previous caesarean section or uterine scar.",

      "abstract": "Observations involving over 600 sheep and extending over 4 years were made on the effect of acute stress on the oestrous cycle and ovarian morphology of ewes. In anoestrous ewes ovulation unaccompanied by oestrus was often induced by severe stress. Injections of ACTH did not induce ovulation in anoestrous ewes. During the breeding season severe stress appeared sometimes to lengthen the oestrous cycle by a few days. The presence of a large cavity in the corpus luteum (C.L.) often seemed to have been induced by stress, but the amount of luteal tissue and its microscopic appearance did not usually appear much different from solid C.L. Oxytocin injections did not affect oestrous cycles or ovarian morphology, but in some circumstances injections of ACTH or stilboestrol appeared to cause an increase in cycle length.",

      "abstract": "Female bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) remains a controversial topic in terms of definition and diagnosis. It is a condition that is far less common in women than in men and has an estimated incidence of 2.7e8%.1,2 The etiology for organic BOO or anatomic BOO (but not including functional BOO) is more diverse in women because of various anatomical or iatrogenic changes affecting vaginal support, the urethra, and/or the bladder. Some changes such as prolapse are related to aging, whereas other changes are related to urethral pathology or previous surgeries (e.g., sling procedure, urethropexy). Furthermore, the urethral anatomical sites for BOO can be further subcategorized by extrinsic compression, urethral wall conditions (e.g., fibrosis, urethral diverticulum), or luminal factors (e.g., stricture disease).3 Owing to the complexity of etiology and nonspecific voiding symptoms, the diagnosis of female BOO requires a high index of suspicion and recourse to a variety of modalities, and includes a thorough history, questionnaires, noninvasive flow and residual assessment, physical examination, cystoscopy, imaging, and urodynamic or videourodynamic studies.",

      "abstract": "The phenomenon of pregnancy is one of the most important factors in the formation of a specific complex of anatomical-physiological, neuro-psychological, psychological and socio-psychological formations and changes of women, which are most often described in the literature by the term «maternal sphere of personality», «maternity» At the same time, the pregnancy in women and the phenomena caused by it are, firstly, the specific phase of gender and individual ontogeny, and secondly, multilevel, multidimensional education, causing the above specific changes in its gender status. Pregnancy and depression often go hand in hand. This condition affects about every tenth pregnant woman. According to recent research, sudden surges and changes in the hormonal background that accompany the entire pregnancy can really affect brain biochemistry, which in turn can lead to real clinical depression. If a woman had problems with conception or she was treated for infertility, the probability of her depression in her pregnancy increases by 10 times. Depression may be more likely to eclipse pregnancy and women who have suffered mental illness, anxiety, or depression before conception. This disorder may also occur in problematic relationships, as well as in situations where relatives have had a depression or mental illness, a woman has already had a miscarriage or her current pregnancy is a high-risk group. Depression during pregnancy has significant implications for pregnancy outcomes and maternal and child health. There is a need to identify which family, physical and mental health factors are associated with depression during pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Endometriose é descrita como a presença anormal de tecido endometrial fora do útero, o que resulta em uma condição inflamatória crônica benigna, dependente de estrogênio e frequentemente associada à dor e infertilidade. Esta condição afeta aproximadamente 10% das mulheres em idade fértil e atinge mais de 170 milhões de mulheres globalmente. Normalmente ocorre com mais frequência entre os 25 e 45 anos de idade e é mais comum em mulheres que sofrem de dismenorreia, infertilidade e/ou dor pélvica. Os mecanismos por trás dessa condição ainda não são totalmente compreendidos, porém, incluem fatores de diferentes origens como genéticos, ambientais, autoimunes e endócrinos. Os sintomas da endometriose são variados, sendo mais comuns a dor pélvica crônica, cólicas menstruais e dificuldade para engravidar. Durante a consulta médica e o exame físico, é frequente a queixa de dor em diferentes intensidades, durações e regiões, incluindo dor pélvica durante o ciclo menstrual, cólicas, dor ao redor da ovulação, dor pélvica crônica contínua, dor durante o sexo, dificuldade de evacuação e dificuldade para urinar. Os genes comumente associados ao risco de endometriose estão localizados em partes do DNA que influenciam a regulação da expressão gênica. O ultrassom transvaginal é um exame importante para o diagnóstico da endometriose e é a primeira opção de imagem em pacientes suspeitos. A tomografia computadorizada não é rotineiramente utilizada para avaliar a endometriose, sendo indicada em casos específicos. O padrão-ouro para o diagnóstico é a laparoscopia com confirmação por exame histopatológico. O tratamento visa aliviar os sintomas, melhorar a qualidade de vida, preservar a fertilidade, reduzir as chances de recorrência e evitar cirurgias. A abordagem cirúrgica, embora não seja sempre necessária, pode ser benéfica dependendo da gravidade do caso, sendo a videolaparoscopia a técnica mais utilizada.",

Ehteebas tams or Habs heyz in Iranian traditional medicine is the equivalent of amenorrhea and oligomenorrhea. The purpose of this paper is to review the anatomic causes of amenorrhea, especially from the perspective of traditional medicine, Avicenna, and comparison with modern medicine. This is a literature review study that investigates views of Avicenna and other reference in Iranian traditional medicine. On the other hand, the contents of modern medicine were collected and compared. Anatomical causes of amenorrhea in aspect of Avicenna and others include: Ratqh, healing the wounds of the uterus, uterine warts, uterine hemorrhoids, uterus protrusion, Mayalan, short size of vagina. These factors were compared with anatomical causes of amenorrhea in modern medicine including: septom of the vagina, Imperforated Haymen, vaginal or cervical or uterine or ovarian hypoplasia or agenesis, Asherman syndrome, cervical stenosis. Many of anatomical causes of amenorrhea in Iranian Traditional medicine is approved in modern medicine but there are also some of the traditional medicine that are not found in modern medicine and today there is need for more research in this area.",

The effects of menopause are closely related to the lack of ovarian hormones, a fact that induces a physical and emotional instability of the woman with a direct impact on the health of the oral cavity. This paper reviews the changes in the oral mucosa in the peri- and post-menopause phases. The most frequently reported changes are: dryness of the oral cavity, sensation of decreased amount of saliva, burning sensation, dysgeusia, altered tolerance to pain and the possibility of neurological manifestations. The dentist and general practitioner must recognize the variety of signs and symptoms that occur in the context of this physiological stage and, at the same time, must focus on the symptomatic management of oral health changes.",

      "abstract": "Thyroid hormones affect practically all organs in the body and control the organism's basal metabolism. The stomach and viscera are not spared, and thyroid dysfunction causes a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, the true prevalence of which is unknown. Digestive symptoms or manifestations may also disclose thyroid disease clues, and if ignored or underestimated, diagnosis may be delayed, with dangerous consequences. Thyroid interactions with the gastrointestinal system have been widely recorded, however, there is no comprehensive report on the various effects of hypothyroidism in the literature. Although gastrointestinal motor dysfunction is largely acknowledged as the primary cause of symptoms, many complex phenomena remain unknown.Hemorrhoids are a prevalent gastrointestinal condition that is being identified in general health screenings. Many clinical signs, such as asymptomatic piles or rectal bleeding, have a negative impact on quality of life.High intra-abdominal pressure and a fragile supporting structure are also risk factors for hemorrhoids. Obesity, constipation, diarrhea, chronic or persistent cough, pregnancy or delivery, and prolonged standing are all circumstances that might raise intra-abdominal pressure. Hypothyroidism manifests itself in a variety of organs and tissues. Constipation is the most prevalent gastrointestinal complaint in individuals with hypothyroidism, which can lead to hemorrhoids. Recent research suggests that a thyroid hormone deficit causes the muscles that lining the digestive system to contract less forcefully. The accumulation of mucopolysaccharides, particularly hyaluronic acid, in the digestive tissue, which causes intestinal edema, is the most likely pathogenic cause. This decrease in motor activity lengthens the time that feces spend transiting through the digestive tract, allowing more water to be absorbed and finally leading to constipation that increases the intraluminal pressure, and causes compromisation of blood supply to the posterior anal wall and finally causes anal fissure.",

Number of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, cross-sectional area and wall thickness of the uterine artery were measured in nulliparous mice (n = 11) and until the 93rd day after parturition in primiparous mice (n = 44). Inner diameter and wall area were calculated. Three months after the first pregnancy, uterine artery wall thickness was not altered compared to nulliparous mice. In contrast, inner diameter increased 1.6-fold, wall area 1.5-fold and the numbers of endothelial and smooth muscle cells increased 1.5 times. These changes were completely stable during the whole observation period. The increased blood flow during the first pregnancy might be a mandatory mechanical stimulus for uterine arcade maturation. This physiological maturation process could result in abortion explaining the higher prevalence of unexplained pregnancy losses in primiparous women.",

      "title": "MENSTRUAL CYCLE AFFECTIVE CHANGE AS A DIMENSIONAL CLINICAL PHENOMENON IN PSYCHIATRIC OUTPATIENTS AND CONTROLS: SUPPORT FOR CONTINUOUS RATHER THAN CATEGORICAL CONCEPTUALIZATION",
      "abstract": "The fluctuating ovarian hormones of the menstrual cycle can affect psychiatric symptom patterns of almost any disorder, ranging from mild, transient symptoms (often termed “premenstrual syndrome”), to clinically significant exacerbation of a chronic underlying disorder (perimenstrual exacerbation), to severe symptoms that arise exclusively prior to menses and remit completely (premenstrual dysphoric disorder). Regardless of severity or underlying diagnosis, each of these examples represent a manifestation of Menstrual Cycle Affective Change (MCAC), or affective symptoms that are influenced by predictable fluctuations in estradiol and progesterone during the normal menstrual cycle. MCAC is often studied in case-control research designs; however, MCAC as a biological phenomenon likely exists on a continuous spectrum, without a natural cutoff point that would separate cases or controls in a biologically meaningful way. In the present study, we argue that MCAC is often better conceptualized for research studies as a continuous outcome variable, rather than a dichotomous grouping variable. We then run multilevel models to identify the best-fitting model parameters for analyses where both menstrual cycle time and MCAC symptom trajectories are represented as continuous variables. While case-control designs are necessary and appropriate in many clinical contexts, the present work illustrates an example whereby with a transdiagnostic psychiatric sample, continuous variables are a truer representation of the data distribution than artificial dichotomization. This work lays the foundation for future studies of MCAC in this transdiagnostic sample of psychiatric outpatients.",

Typically, hymen anomalies are isolated findings and do not have long-term implications on sexual function, fertility, or obstetric outcomes. Menstrual outflow obstructions – i.e. imperforate hymen – increase the risk of endometriosis. Women with a history of an imperforate hymen should be evaluated if they have ongoing dysmenorrhea. Virginity is a sociocultural construct, rather than a medical diagnosis, and is not affected by a hymenectomy (removal of excess hymen tissue) nor can virginity be determined based on a hymenal/physical examination. Gentle labial traction as well as asking the patient to Valsalva are helpful maneuvers to aid in visualization of the hymen. There are reports of several nonspecific prepubertal hymenal findings – including periurethral/perihymenal bands, hymenal tags, hymenal bumps/mounds.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Infertility is a disease of the male or female reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. In the female reproductive system, infertility may be caused by a range of abnormalities of the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and the endocrine system, among others. Infertility can be primary or secondary. Primary infertility is when a pregnancy has never been achieved by a person, and secondary infertility is when at least one prior pregnancy has been achieved. Objectives: Describe the epidemiology of female infertility. Review the most common findings of female infertility. Outline the management for known causes of female infertility. Explain the importance of improving health care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance and improve outcomes for female infertility patients.",

      "abstract": "Limited guidance exists regarding how to assess postpartum recovery. In this article, we discuss various aspects of inpatient and outpatient postpartum recovery.The postpartum period for many women includes sleep deprivation, maternal-neonatal bonding, breastfeeding, and integrating a new life into the family unit. Factors which impact inpatient quality of recovery include pain, nausea or vomiting, dizziness, shivering, comfort, mobilization, ability to hold and feed the baby, personal hygiene maintenance, and feeling in control. Outpatient recovery domains include psychosocial distress, surgical/medical factors, feeding and breast health, psychosocial support, pain, physical function, sleep, motherhood experience, infant health, fatigue, appearance / cosmetic factors, sexual function, and cognition. Postpartum recovery is likely to take longer than six weeks; however, no consensus regarding recovery duration exists among professional societies. Obstetric quality of recovery (ObsQoR) is a recommended measure of inpatient postpartum recovery; however, studies are needed to determine the optimum outpatient recovery assessment tool.Postpartum recovery is an important area that requires clinical and research attention. Future studies should focus on identifying and developing valid, reliable, and responsive measures of recovery as well as tracking and optimizing recovery domains following all delivery modes.http://links.lww.com/COOG/A65.",

Amenorrhea can be classified as either primary or as secondary. The basic principles in menstrual function provide a framework to understand the causes of amenhorrhea. This chapter explains how is amenorrhea evaluated and what are the causes of amenorrhea. Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) is the term used to describe amenorrhea which is diagnosed after ruling out other etiologies of amenorrhea. Most pituitary dysfunction is acquired after menarche and therefore presents with normal pubertal development followed by secondary amenorrhea. Women with prolonged hypoestrogenic amenorrhea resulting from conditions such as hypothalamic amenorrhea or from premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) should be offered hormone treatment in maintaining or prevention of bone loss.",

      "abstract": "Osteopenia of prematurity (OP) – also called metabolic bone disease (MBD) or rickets of prematurity – is a late complication of preterm birth, consisting of decreased bone mineralization in patients with low gestational age and birth weight. The disease can be expressed in various degrees of severity, mostly mild. The real incidence of the disease is not known due to the lack of international consensus regarding its definition, but it is approximated at 50% of babies under 1000 g. Despite the actual knowledge about its physiopathology and advances in the nutritional strategies for very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants, osteopenia of prematurity is still present, probably underestimated. Most of the times, no specific signs or symptoms are identified. If present, these are represented by growth and length deficits, signs of classical rickets, respiratory distress syndrome, or difficulty to wean from ventilatory support, due to impaired thoracic compliance. The risk factors for an increased gravity of OP are both prenatal and postnatal, and the genetic predisposition could be involved. We report the case of a 24-week gestation ELBW baby with a complicated clinical course, involving respiratory, neurologic, cardiovascular and digestive alterations, who was diagnosed at 5 months of age with a severe osteopenia of prematurity expressed as multiple subsequent fractures which raised problems of differential diagnosis and management. The retrospective case analysis showed that a combined effect of prenatal and postnatal risk factors (extreme prematurity, maternal chorioamnionitis, prolonged TPN, use of corticotherapy, methylxanthines, diuretics, immobilization and sedation) have conducted to the extreme severity of the disease in our patient. This article intends to emphasize the importance of surveillance of the nutritional status of both mother and infant. The correct pregnancy monitoring and promoting an aggressive nutritional strategy for extremely-low-birth-weight infants could prevent an aggressive course of the disease and poor long-term outcomes.",

      "abstract": "It has been well documented that female sex is a significant risk factor for the development of various autoimmune diseases. While the reason for this has been debated, one well-regarded theory is that increased estrogen and decreased testosterone play a role in this predisposition. Interstitial cystitis (IC), also known as painful bladder syndrome (PBS), is an autoimmune disorder that affects over nine million women in the United States. It presents with pelvic and bladder pain and urinary symptoms, both of which significantly and negatively affect the quality of life. Even so, very few studies have examined the pathophysiologic relationship between autoimmune disorders and hormonal contraceptives. In this report, we present a case of IC likely precipitated by oral contraceptives (OCPs) in a premenopausal female. Shortly after beginning OCPs, this patient developed symptoms of severe pelvic pain and increased urinary frequency. Over the course of a year, the patient was diagnosed and treated for a variety of conditions, such as urinary tract infection (UTI), fungal vaginitis, and nephrolithiasis. After consultation with a gynecologist, a normal abdominal CT scan, and unsuccessful cystoscopy due to pain, she was finally diagnosed with IC. The patient independently learned of a potential link between hormonal contraceptive pills and IC and decided to discontinue this method of birth control. Following this, her symptoms completely resolved within several months. The timing of her initiation and discontinuation of OCPs, alongside her symptomatology, suggest a connection to the development of IC. A literature review was performed, which supports this association. We, therefore, highlight this case as an important example of IC precipitated by OCPs.",

It is a condition which is highly prevalent and distressing for patients, yet is often underdiagnosed and undertreated and proves challenging to health care providers. Traditionally, female sexual pain disorder was divided into two categories, dyspareunia and vaginismus. Most recently, these categories have been combined with a new definition 'genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder' as described later in this manuscript. Sexual pain disorders often have a biological, psychosexual and functional component. Attention should be focussed on the predisposing, precipitating and maintaining factors of the condition. Diagnosis requires careful history taking and examination and treatment should be individualised and may require a multidisciplinary approach.",

Estrogen or sequential estrogen-gestagen treatment for 25-day periods can induce a menstruallike in castrated women called an estrogen discontinuation bleeding. Continual treatment with estrogens and gestagens can induce an estrogen breakthrough bleeding up to about the 40th or 50th day of treatment. Ovarian amenorrhea can be treated with sequential estrogen-gestagen treatment; amenorrhea due to hypothalmic-pituitary gland dysfunction can be treated in the same manner though not as effectively. Anovulation can be treated with estrogens to institute regular menstrual cycles and gestagens to substitute for the hormonal production of the corpus luteum. Metropathia is treated with estrogens and gestagens to decrease the volume of and institute normal menstrual cycles. Irregular or incomplete expulsion of the endometrium can be treated with estrogens to stimulate the hypothalamic-pituitary glandular production of luteinizing hormone or with gestagens to simulate the function of the corpus luteum. Menorrhagia can be treated with gestagens or preparations that are known to cause amenorrhea.",

Still a confusion exists in relation to the real effects of the female hormones on the perception of pain. The existing data refer mainly to experimental studies and have provided results not always useful in the clinical practice. Data source This study was designed to detect whether there are differences in the perception of the postoperative pain in women, during two clearly defined phases of hormonal asset: luteal and follicular phases. Conclusion The results of this study have demonstrated that in postoperative female patients pain is perceived significantly more in the luteal phase of the menstrual period, than in the follicular phase. This could suggest that female in child‐bearing age should be scheduled for elective surgery preferentially during the follicular phase, unless differently necessary. It would guarantee a more comfortable postoperative period, with reduced necessity of analgesics.",

Low-back and buttock pain is a common complaint during pregnancy and the postpartum period and is usually attributable to mechanical lesions of the pelvis. Sacral stress fractures are unusual but important causes that should be considered in differential diagnosis. To date, only eight postpartum sacral stress fractures have been reported in the literature. A 32-yr-old woman presented with low-back and right buttock pain that started 15 days after uneventful cesarean section delivery. Imaging studies revealed a right sacral stress fracture. Lumbar spine and femoral neck bone mineral density were normal and, except for pregnancy and lactation, no risk factors for osteoporosis were identified. There was no history of trauma, excessive weight gain, strenuous physical activity, or contribution of mechanical factors. The question remains whether this is an insufficiency fracture or a fatigue fracture. Clinicians should consider sacral fracture during pregnancy and the postpartum period as a diagnostic possibility in patients with low-back and/or buttock pain.",

      "abstract": "To determine the role of afferent input from the penis and copulatory experience on the ontogeny of reproductive behavior, 49 bulls were randomly assigned to the following groups: control; surgical penile deflection (penis deviation), which prevents intromission; penile neurectomy; or penis deviation plus neurectomy. Sexual performance tests were conducted at 3-month intervals from 9 to 24 months of age. Bulls deviated but not neurectomized mounted more frequently than bulls in the other groups. The low mount frequency for control bulls in tests in which copulation occurred was due to the sexually quiescent postejaculatory refractory period. Preventing control bulls from copulating by affixing cloth patches to females' perinea increased mount frequency to the level of deviated bulls. It is concluded that copulatory experience is not essential to the development and maintenance of normal mounting activity. However, sensory stimulation from the penis facilitates the expression of sexual behaviors.",

      "title": "Mirena Intra-Uterine System: Does it Improve Long Term Symptoms in Women with Chronic Pelvic Pain and/or Endometriosis after Laparoscopy? A Multicentre Randomized Controlled Trial",
      "abstract": "Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a complex clinical scenario, which affects 15% of women. The published literature lacks a consistent definition of CPP. However according to Vercillini et al., CPP is defined by the duration and type of pelvic pain. CPP is present if the pelvic pain persists for more than 3 months duration and is constant or intermittent, cyclical or noncyclical in nature. Four types of pelvic pain have also been described and these include: cyclical pain during menstruation (dysmenorrhoea), deep dyspareunia, dyschezia and noncyclical pelvic pain. Therefore for the purposes of this study, CPP will be defined by these aforementioned types of pelvic pain and duration.Multi-centre randomised controlled trial comparing Mirena IUS versus expectant management in women with CPP and/or dysmenorrhoea who undergo laparoscopic surgery. All women aged 18 - 45 years with CPP scheduled for laparoscopy will be eligible for inclusion. Women with a non-gynecological cause of pelvic pain, contraindications to the use of Mirena IUS, previous hysterectomy, contraindications to laparoscopy and/or general anesthesia, use of hormonal treatment in the preceding three months, underlying gynaecological malignancies or known ovarian cysts other than endometriomata will be excluded. Importantly, all randomised women with endometriosis noted at the time of surgery will have the disease excised laparoscopically. Routine excision of endometriosis at laparoscopy will be performed according to the anatomical location and type (superficial or deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE)). Women will be followed for up to 24 months after laparoscopic surgery.The primary outcome measure is improvement of pelvic pain and/or of dysmenorrhoea post-laparoscopic surgery for women. Assuming a 30% reduction in pain for the expectantly managed group in order to detect a reduction in pain in the study group of 50% with an alpha of 0.05 and a beta of 0.20, the sample size was estimated at a minimum of 103 women per trial arm.This trial will provide evidence to validate the effectiveness or otherwise of progestogen-releasing IUS in treating women with CPP who undergo laparoscopy surgery. The pros and cons of both trial arms will offer guidance to clinicians in making the right treatment choice.",

      "title": "The Cow in Endocrine Focus Before and After Calving",
      "abstract": "Contents During the period 1 month before and 1 month after parturition in the cow, several events take place. The dam has to be prepared for the impending parturition and the uterus and ovaries must return to a certain stage to be prepared for a new pregnancy. Most of these processes are due to or reflected in endocrine changes. A special interest is of course the status of the foetus –‘foetal well being’. The processes could either be considered as normal in a clinical perspective or as impaired (dystocia, small calves, stillbirth, retained foetal membranes, etc.). The main question for this presentation is if normal and impaired performance could be mirrored in endocrine parameters. Many studies have been performed to follow endocrine changes during the periparturient period in the cow. The following parameters have been shown to be the most important and seem to be the most suitable for an endocrine supervision: Endocrine parameter Parameter of: Progesterone Corpus luteum, maternal adrenals, placenta Prostaglandin (PG) metabolite Placenta, uterus, inflammation Cortisol Regulator of prostaglandin synthesis, stress Free oestrogens Placenta, ovaries Oestrone sulphate Placenta, calf weight Pregnancy‐associated glycoproteins (PAG) Placenta",

      "title": "The role of progesterone and GABA in PMS/PMDD",
      "abstract": "The relationship between the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and symptom development in premenstrual dysphoric disorder/premenstrual syndrome (PMDD/ PMS) is self-evident. Symptoms starts after ovulation and then increase in parallel with the rise in serum progesterone during the luteal phase. The symptom severity reaches a peak during the last five premenstrual days or the first day of menstruation. Thereafter, the symptoms decline and disappear 3-4 days after the onset of menstrual bleeding. During the postmenstrual phase there is a period of well-being, closely following estrogen production, to the estradiol peak. This suggests that there is a symptom-provoking factor produced by the corpus luteum of the ovary.1 This is further supported by the fact that in anovulatory cycles, spontaneous or induced, when a corpus luteum is not formed, no symptom cyclicity occurs.2-4Further evidence that progesterone and progestogens induce negative mood symptoms similar to those in PMDD/PMS is seen in postmenopausal women receiving estrogen/progesterone hormone therapy.5-7 As discussed above, there are strong indications that steroids from the corpus luteum are the symptom-provoking factor in the central nervous system (CNS). But the classical hormonal receptor for progesterone seems not to be involved in the pathophysiology of PMS/PMDD; treatment with the progesterone receptor antagonistmifepristone (RU-486) fails to reduce the physical or behavioral manifestations of PMS.8",

      "title": "ELECTRO-MYOGRAPHIC STUDY OF THE HUMAN ABDOMINAL MUSCLES AFFECTED BY SEXUAL HORMONES",
      "abstract": "The action current of the abdominal muscles was studied with the technique of EMG, using diverse subjects-normal female and male adults, juveniles and castrated individuals. To supplement the observations, some animal experiments and the observation on the cases of Adison's disease were performed.1. Normal female adults. They are the only subjects who show periodic changes in the discharge-occurring simultaneously with the menstruation cycle. The electrical discharges are very much weakened in a few day before and after the menstruation, or totally vanished during the menstruation proper. The active discharges in the mid menophase can very effectively be suppressed by progesterone, and less so by chorionic gonadotrophin. Following a pretreat ment with progesterone and the muscles made electrically silent, testosterone, estradiol or corticosterone brings about a new outburst of the electrical activity.During the menstruation, the decreased or vanished discharges can be made active by estradiol or in lesser degree by the placental hormone, anterior pituitary hormone or chorionic gonadotrophin.2. Prepuberal females. Juveniles, age over 7 years, show the inhibitory response to progesterone, but those age below 6 years indicate a faint response, if any.3. Females in menopause. These show a distinct progesterone inhibition.4. Totally oophorectomized females. No periodicity was detected. Progesterone inhibits effectively the discharges. Testosterone, estradiol, corticosterone, anterior pituitary or placental hormone revives the discharge which has been suppressed by progesterone.5. Normal male adults. No periodicity was observed. Progesterone is nonreactive.6. Juvenile males. Those age over 6 years can hardly respond to progesterone and those below show a faint response, if any.7. Castrated males. No periodicity was observed. After the progesterone inhibition, testosterone, estradiol or anterior pituitary hormone brings back the electrical discharge.Animal experiments. A large dose of progesterone given to the female or castrated male rabbit induces a decrease or totally suspension of the electrical discharge of the abdominal muscles. The male animal responses with much lesser degree.A very large dose of progesterone administered to the female rat brings a quiet state or even stupor. The abdominal muscles decrease or loose the discharges faster than all the others.Adison's disease. In severe cases, the disappeared electrical activity of the abdominal oblique muscles can be made active by the injection of estradiol or corticosterone.",

      "abstract": "Ejaculation is the most important part of male sexual response. It is related not only to human reproduction, but also to sexual satisfaction of both men and women. Premature ejaculation or anejaculation is likely to cause male infertility and seriously affects the patient's quality of sexual life as well. In recent years, the study of male sexual dysfunction has attracted more and more biomedical researchers. However, previous studies have focused on the relationship between ejaculatory and peripheral or central neurotransmitters. The central physiological and pathological mechanisms underlying ejaculation and ejaculatory dysfunction, including premature ejaculation, remain unclear. This article reviews the central regulatory mechanism of ejaculation function and offers a deeper insight into the correlation of ejaculation behavior with the central nervous system and psychological factors, aiming to promote the development of more effective and practical biological indicators for the diagnosis and therapeutic effect evaluation of ejaculatory dysfunction.",

      "title": "Difficult fetal extraction in cesarean section: Number 8 – 2024",
      "abstract": "The main causes of difficult fetal extraction during cesarean section are deeply impacted fetal head and floating presentation of the fetus. Studies of management techniques for difficult fetal extraction during cesarean section and the maternal and neonatal results lack scientific evidence, as these predominantly come from case reports, small case series and expert opinions. The deeply impacted fetal head is usually associated with prolongation of the expulsion period and/or unsuccessful attempts at operative vaginal delivery. The main maternal complications associated with the management of the deeply impacted fetal head are lacerations in the lower uterine segment, hematomas in the uterine ligaments and injuries to the uterine vessels, cervix and/or urinary tract. The main neonatal complications associated with the management of a deeply impacted fetal head are intracranial hemorrhage, fractures of the skull and/or cervical spine, nerve injuries, perinatal asphyxia and even death. Among the maneuvers for delivery of the deeply impacted fetal head, the abdominovaginal delivery (push method) seems to be the most associated with maternal and neonatal complications. In the non-insinuated and floating fetal head, the internal podalic version followed by pelvic extraction differs from the reverse breech extraction (pull method). When the fetal head is high in the pelvis, the fetus is internally ejected before the extraction of its body segments, similar to the internal version performed in the vaginal delivery of the second twin with floating presentation of the fetus.",

      "abstract": "Postpartum urinary retention occurs in 10-15% of women and is likely to be multifactorial in origin. Long labour, epidural analgesia, instrumental delivery, nulliparity, significant vaginal and perineal laceration or a previous history of voiding difficulty are risk factors for altered voiding parameters. Previous literatures have defined two types of urinary retention, first, overt retention and the other covert variety. Overt variety represents the acute retention while covert variety is of subacute in nature. Being subacute in nature, it damages the detrusors slowly. Sometimes the damage is so much so that it may take substantial time to recover or may not recover at all and the patient may have lifelong detrusor hypotonia with persistent urinary retention, requiring lifelong intermittent self-catheterization. This badly affects her personal as well as social wellbeing and also poses her for recurrent urinary tract infection. Here, we report a case of 25 yrs old, 36 weeks primigravida having persistent postpartum urinary retention following vaginal delivery, Who was enough fortunate to have recovery of detrusors. But, still it took 3-4 weeks for complete recovery of the urinary bladder.",

      "title": "Urinary incontinence: Is vaginal delivery a cause?",
      "abstract": "Urinary incontinence (UI) is a distressing symptom negatively impacting quality of life and constitutes a worldwide problem, affecting 10–40% of women around the globe.1 Genetics, family history, race, age, pregnancy, parity, mode of delivery, history of pelvic or lower abdominal surgery, and chronically increased abdominal pressure, such as chronic cough, constipation, obesity, and spinal cord diseases, are reported to be related to the development of UI.2 Among these factors, pregnancy-related risk factors are well-identifiable risk factors for UI, including weight gain during pregnancy, smoking, pregestational body mass index (BMI), BMI at term, duration of the first and second stages of labor, spontaneous or assisted vaginal delivery, perineal or vaginal trauma, newborn weight, and maneuver procedure during labor, such as forceps, vacuum, episiotomy, and analgesia methods.2 Furthermore, more than half of these factors, such as the duration of the first and second stages of labor, assisted vaginal delivery, perineal or vaginal trauma, and of the most importance, maneuver procedures during labors, including the use of forceps, vacuum, episiotomy, and analgesia methods, occur in women with normal vaginal delivery, thereby contributing to the rational of the study published by Kokabi and Yazdanpanh3 in this issue of the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association.3 In fact, it is not surprising that Kokabi and Yazdanpanh3 found that women after vaginal delivery had a significantly higher risk of postpartum stress UI than those after cesarean section. Consistent with the well-known pregnancy-related risk factors,2 Kokabi and Yazdanpanh3 showed that assisted vaginal delivery, episiotomy, birth weight, and higher BMI were positively correlated with the increased risk of postpartum stress UI. In addition to the abovementioned factors, the authors also found that psychosocial and economic factors might also contribute to the increased risk of postpartum stress UI since women with lower incomes, lower neighborhood residence, and elderly women were associated with a higher risk of stress UI. Moreover, women undergoing cesarean section could not be totally free from postpartum stress UI, even though in general, these were primiparous women undergoing vaginal delivery compared with those after elective cesarean section. However, there are several findings of Kokabi and Yazdanpanh's study that merit additional discussion. First, the frequency of postpartum stress UI was the highest at the end of 1 month after delivery (11.2%), regardless of the delivery mode that was analyzed, which slowly decreased to 9.4% and 6.4% at the end of 6 postpartum months and 12 postpartum months, respectively. Most interestingly, the frequency of postpartum stress UI showed a similar trend of recovery in both delivery modes, declining from 14.2% to 9.5% in the vaginal delivery and from 7.9% to 3.6% in the cesarean section,3 suggesting that term pregnancy and postpartum status could be important for the development of postpartum stress UI. A variety of clinical observations might explain the phenomenon. Hormone factor, especially progesterone, and a dramatic increase of abdominal pressure and/or body weight might be a key factor. Female sex hormones are important not only for maintaining normal functioning of many organs and systems, including genital urinary tract, the cardiovascular system, and bone,4,5 but also for contributing to the development of diseases, such as endometrial cancer and breast cancers.6,7 Progesterone, a muscle relaxant and female sex hormone, is believed to be a critical factor in maintaining a successful pregnancy and is often used as a tocolytic reagent.8 Due to the muscular relaxation effect and significantly increased intra-abdominal pressure, this can partly explain why pregnancy itself is a risk factor for the development of stress UI, and how postpartum stress UI could be ameliorated as a prolongation of postpartum interval because of loss of both precipitating factors. Therefore, some of the strategies could be applied to minimize the risk of postpartum stress UI. One strategy is body weight control since obesity is a long-term health problem.9 Therefore, all women who plan to conceive should be well educated about prepregnancy body weight and term pregnancy body weight. Second, it is relatively unfair to compare the frequency of postpartum stress UI between vaginal delivery and elective cesarean section. Both prolonged course of labor and assisted vaginal delivery are precipitating factors for postpartum stress UI. However, to minimize these factors, the comparison between cesarean section due to dysfunction labor and assisted vaginal delivery might provide a better understanding of the superior delivery mode choice because both had a similar “stress” and/or “trauma” on the pelvic floor during labor. If the result supports the proposition that cesarean section is a better choice to decrease the risk of postpartum stress UI, we might suggest that the choice of instrument to use for assisted vaginal delivery might be carefully balanced by consideration of a risk and benefit ratio. The cesarean section rate has increased worldwide, reflecting a trend in obstetric practice that is not wholly consistent with the common concept of improving women’s health and public health insurance policy. In fact, the cesarean section rate is generally considered a negative indicator of national health.10 The study by Kokabi and Yazdanpanh3 supported the protective role of the development of postpartum stress UI in primigravida pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean section, hinting of the potential benefits of cesarean section if disorders of the pelvic floor are taken into consideration. This might further exacerbate the tendency to use an elective cesarean section for the first babies of primiparous women, especially after widespread broadcast within a certain population, such as movie stars or singers. Therefore, representation of the data, for example, through a publication by Kokabi and Yazdanpanh3 in the current issue, should be cautiously evaluated and carefully understood.

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain in women, stages and methods of diagnosis (Literature review)",
      "abstract": "Usually, women suffering from chronic pelvic pain experience it for some time and do not seek treatment until the pain becomes so severe that it adversely affects a woman’s normal daily functioning, preventing her from maintaining a normal lifestyle and leading to development of chronic pain syndrome. Chronic pelvic pain syndrome is often accompanied by behavioral disorders, cognitive, psychoemotional and sexual disorders, as well as symptoms of dysfunction of the lower urinary and digestive systems, pelvic organs, gynecological dysfunction, which are the result of neurobiological, physiological and sometimes anatomical changes in the body and central nervous system.Often a gynecologist automatically focuses exclusively on gynecological organs, assuming that they are the cause of the problem, but most often the cause of chronic pelvic pain is a group of factors. Disorders of the gastrointestinal, urological, and musculoskeletal systems are at least as common as disorders of the reproductive system in women with chronic pelvic pain. Therefore, diagnostic measures should be aimed at identifying all the causes which requires doctors to take a multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of chronic pelvic pain. The causes of the problem in most cases can be identified by a thorough history taking and physical examination, which should be more detailed than usual. As a diagnostic tool, it can minimize the need for expensive laboratory testing and imaging or risky surgery. The use of specialized assessment forms and questionnaires for chronic pelvic pain can be important and useful to ensure coverage of all critical points.When planning a diagnostic plan for women with chronic pelvic pain, it is important to consider the key role of the nervous system in the perception of pain. Experiencing pain for a long period of time can change how the brain perceives and processes pain signals, leading to an amplification of pain and cross-organ sensitization.Complicated differential diagnosis often causes the absence of a definitive diagnosis in most patients who complain of chronic pelvic pain. Therefore, during the first visit of the patient, it is sometimes impossible to immediately determine the cause of pain. Because the causes of many disorders associated with chronic pelvic pain have not been identified, most clinicians treat them empirically. Therefore, in the presence of several etio-pathogenetic factors, treatment of only some of them will lead to incomplete relief.The definition of «chronic pelvic pain» can hide many diseases, the detection of which requires the involvement of a multidisciplinary team of gynecologists, urologists, gastroenterologists, nephrologists, vascular surgeons, orthopedists, psychiatrists, psychologists and doctors of other specialties. However, it is mostly gynecologists who are the first to come into contact with this pathology because, in most cases, women who suffer from chronic pelvic pain first turn to them for help. That is why they should be the main members of the multidisciplinary team and take responsibility for its creation. Unfortunately, physicians often lack an interdisciplinary approach to the management of chronic pelvic pain, which complicates comprehensive assessment, diagnosis, and treatment and leads to frustration among women who go from one specialist to another without an adequate solution to their problem.",

      "title": "Menopause and sexuality",
      "abstract": "Many women spend a third of their lives in postmenopause, and it’s a given that sexual life must go on after menopause since its benefits were vastly proven. A number of factors influence sexuality in postmenopause: the age at which menopause sets in, how menopause sets in, physical and mental state, quality of sexual life in perimenopause and the quality and duration of the relationship with the partner. The hypoestrogenism that characterizes menopause leads to a decrease in libido, to changes in the genital apparatus (vaginal atrophy, dyspareunia) or other changes (hot flushes, impaired urination, depression), which negatively affect sexual health. Assessing sexual dysfunction is not easy. The interplay between the types of factors that predispose, precipitate and maintain sexual dysfunction requires preparation on the part of the clinician in identifying the elements of interest and indicating appropriate therapy. Research on the quantification of sexual dysfunction in women has led to the development of various scales or questionnaires to assess the impact of menopausal-related changes on sexual function and quality of intimate life. The ultimate goal of the clinician is to find an optimal method of treatment that will improve the condition and enhance the quality of sexual life. The available knowledge about menopausal sexuality may still be the tip of the iceberg in both medical practice and society and further research and information campaigns are greatly needed.",

      "abstract": "Summary. Hysterectomy on the 5th day of the luteal phase inhibited the dioestrous cycle for at least 8 months. The corpora lutea persisted throughout this period and, at the end, contained an appreciable amount of progesterone. Hysterectomy on the 10th day of the luteal phase caused the corpora lutea to enlarge as in pregnancy and to persist for a period about equal to that of gestation. Hysterectomy on the 15th day of the luteal phase prevented the impending ovulation and oestrus in 70 % (24/35) of animals. In these, the major effect was the arrest of the regressive changes in the corpora lutea, which became only slightly enlarged. In the remaining animals, ovulation and oestrus occurred shortly after the operation. The regression of the corpora lutea occurred normally but the corpora lutea that formed post-operatively responded in the same way as those in animals operated on the 5th or 10th days of the luteal phase. The nature of the stimulus of hysterectomy on the corpus luteum of the guinea-pig is discussed briefly.",

      "title": "Health-related Quality of Life and Preferred Sexual Activity Amoung Women With Endometriosis After Surgical Treatment",
      "abstract": "Background: The quality of life (QoL) is a multidimensional concept relating to different areas of life and human behavior. The World Health Organization defines quality of life as the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). HRQoL is an assessment of how the individual's well-being may be affected over time by a disease. Endometriosis is a disease defined as the presence of the endometrium (glandular and stroma cells) outside the uterine cavity. The endometrium outside the uterine cavity functions similar to in the uterine cavity. This consequences are very serious, because the menstrual excretions gather at the site for implantation. This disease puts the most commonly on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, sacral ligaments and ligaments cross - uterine, as well as other organs: brain, lung, urinary bladder or intestines. Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological diseases. It applies from 6% to 10% of women of childbearing age. The chronic pain in the pelvic, dyspareunia, and dysmenorrhea (abundant or scarce, irregular bleeding) are associated with this disease. Endometriosis is one of the most important causes of the infertility. The removal of outbreaks of the disease pain relief and fertility restoration are an important goal of treatment. The treatment of endometriosis in most cases carried out by surgical intervention. Endometriosis impossible to meet the many important for a woman needs, including sexual needs and may impair functioning in a relationship. This may affect the quality of life of these women. The aim of the study is to examine correlations between the level of quality of life and sexual activity in women with endometriosis after surgical treatment. We formulated the following research questions in relation to the basic aim of this research: 1.\tWhat is the level of general quality of life among women with endometriosis after surgery? 2.\tWhat is the level of quality of life in the dimension of somatic, psychological, social and environmental among women with endometriosis after surgery? 3.\tWhich sexual activity give the greatest pleasure to women with endometriosis? 4.\tHas the quality of life a relationship with preferred sexual activity by this patients? \tMethods: 24 women aged from 27 to 38 participated in the study. The mean age of patients was 31.5 years. The subjects were recruited from patients who were: 1) over 18, 2) with diagnosed endometriosis, 3) the form of surgical treatment was used, 4) and gave informed consent to be part of the study. All patients gave informed consent. Medical and psychosocial variables were analyzed in this study. The medical variables included: 1) the stages of endometriosis, 2) duration of endometriosis, calculated to the date of diagnosis to this study, 3) the location of endometriosis. The psychosocial variables were: 1) the general quality of life and its four dimensions: somatic, psychological, social, environmental, 2) sexual activity, 3) current marital status, 4) the level of education. Two research tools were used in the study: 1)\tthe WHOQoL-BREF. This questionnaire was developed by the World Health Organization and is an abbreviated version of the WHOQoL-100. It can be used to assess quality of life in both healthy people and patients, for both cognitive and clinical purposes. The WHOQoL-BREF has 26 items. Respondents respond on a five-point Likert scale. A quality of life profile can be charted for four aspects of life: psychological, physical, social and environmental. The higher the score on a given scale, the better the quality of life. 2)\tSexual Stimulus Scale (SSS) by Z. Lew-Starowicz. SSS consists of 43 sexual activity structured to reflect a wide range of sexual behavior. Respondents evaluated each activity on a 4-point scale (1 - not suit me to 4 - I very like it). All sexual stimulus were divided into four groups: face and body caresses, sexual positions, sexual activity, non-standard sexual behavior and orgasm as a result of stimulation. The data were analyzed statistically using SPSS 18 software. The p?0.05 criterion of statistical significance was adopted. Findings: Patients with endometriosis were characterized by good quality of life (M=4). Women also highly assessed their quality of life in terms of four aspects: psychological (X=16,20±1,41), physical (16,67±1,91), social (16,40±2,59) and environmental (17,20±1,62). There were no statistically significant relationship between the general quality of life and duration of endometriosis. Similar observations were reported in the case of the analyzed dimensions of quality of life - somatic psychological, social and environmental. The hugging (86,7%) and face’s kisses (73,3%) provide the most pleasure patient with endometriosis in terms of face and body caresses. Sexual behavior associated with stimulation of the vagina by hand (53,3%) provide the least pleasure. The level of general quality of life was characterized by a positive correlation with the pleasure of hugging (rho=0,389;p=0,017) and kissing face (rho=0,379;p=0,020). Similar relationships were recorded in the case of dimension psychological and environmental functioning. Women had the most pleasure from the classical position (66,7%), but the least from the back position (53,3%) and a standing position (46,7%). The pleasure of making sex in classical position positively correlated with the general quality of life (Rho=0,600;p=0,000) and four aspects of life: psychological (Rho=0,554;p=0,001), physical (Rho=0,585;p=0,000), social (Rho=0,372;p=0,022) and environmental (Rho=0,536;p=0,001). The most pleasure provided advantage of active partner in sexual intercourse (60%) in women with endometriosis. The patients had the smallest pleasure from the advantage of themselves activity in sexual intercourse (46,7%). The pleasure of provided advantage of active partner in sexual intercourse positively correlated with the general quality of life (Rho=0,423;p=0,010) and four aspects of life: psychological (Rho=0,567;p=0,001), physical (Rho=0,588;p=0,000), social (Rho=0,381;p=0,019) and environmental (Rho=0,539;p=0,001). Patients with endometriosis declared the smallest pleasure from making sexual activity associated with group sex (20%) and intercourse with two partners (20%). Women declared the greatest pleasure from the use of elongated techniques of sexual intercourse (53,3%) in terms of non-standard sexual behavior. The pleasure of use of elongated techniques of sexual intercourse positively correlated with the general quality of life (Rho=0,603;p=0,00), and four aspects of life: psychological (Rho=0,887;p=0,000), physical (Rho=0,797;p=0,000), social (Rho=0,669;p=0,000) and environmental (Rho=0,801;p=0,000). Women with endometriosis declared the greatest pleasure from orgasm due to excite by hand (46,7%), and the smallest of achieving orgasm due to excite by water during shower (33,3%). The pleasure from orgasm due to excite by hand positively correlated with the general quality of life (Rho=0,407;p=0,013) and four aspects of life: psychological (Rho=0,872;p=0,000), physical (Rho=0,833; p=0,000), social (Rho=0,679;p=0,000) and environmental (Rho=0,801;p=0,000). Discussion: The pain is a major cause of physical, psycho-social and emotional problems among women with endometriosis. The surgical treatment relieves pain and can affect the quality of life of these patients. Our research showed that the quality of life of women with endometriosis characterized by a significant correlation from pleasure of sexual activity. This may affect the quality of the closed relationship of these women and satisfaction with life and their sexual activity. Further research is warranted to evaluate the impact of endometriosis on HRQL. The studies concerning the relationship between quality of life and pleasure of sexual activity are a new area of interdisciplinary research combining the achievements of health psychology and other sciences.",

      "abstract": "Couvade syndrome occurs when expectant fathers experience psychological and somatic symptoms typical of pregnancy. Common somatic symptoms include gastrointestinal problems, toothache, heartburn, fatigue and back pain, while anxiety is the most commonly reported psychological symptom. Symptoms typically manifest during the first trimester of the partner’s pregnancy, decrease or disappear during the second trimester, increase during the third trimester, and usually resolve after delivery. The aetiology of Couvade’s syndrome remains unclear, with psychoanalytic theories suggesting paternal anxiety and feelings of marginalisation. Hormonal changes, including increased cortisol, estradiol, prolactin and decreased testosterone levels during the third trimester, are also thought to be contributing factors. The prevalence varies widely, from 11% to 97%, depending on the population studied. Despite its reported prevalence, research into Couvade’s syndrome is limited, especially studies involving closely related women with similar symptoms. The findings highlight the need for further research to better understand this phenomenon and its impact on family dynamics during pregnancy.",

The occurrence of postpartum depression may be a few days, weeksor even months after childbirth. A woman with postpartum depression may have feeling of low level of mood, anxiety,irritability to severe degree.it could also associated with the antenatal depression, young maternal age, hyperemesis,marital status, and previous affective disorders. Postpartum depression having the most common complications ofchildbearing and is usually associated with impairments in mother–infant interactions that can lead to severe consequencesfor the infant such as illness, poor growth and development. These mothers’ infants had more commonly symptoms andillnesses, especially infantile colic, and they were less likely to be breastfed. Similarly, among depressed mothers low levelof support from spouse and significant others and physical family violence were more common, likewise poor basic andprofessional education, poor economic and housing situation can also cause postpartum depression, As it is alarming theresearchers conducted a study on screening of postpartum depression among postnatal mothers.Methods and Materials: Quantitative research approach, descriptive research design was carried out. The sample of56 postnatal mothers were selected by using purposive sampling technique. The study was conducted at tertiary carehospital, Kelambakkam, Chengalpet district. Phone number of postnatal mother who delivered from 2-6 weeks after delivery was obtained earlier from MRD. Telephonic interview was carried out to collect the data by using modifiedEdinburg postnatal depression scale. Data was analysed by using descriptive and inferential statistics.Results: This study showed that 21.4% of postnatal mothers having postpartum depression whereas, 78.6% were notdepressive. The findings implies that P value is more than 0.05 so there is no significant association between prevalenceof postpartum depression with demographic and obstetrical variables.",

      "abstract": "Physiological hyperventilation and dyspnoea in pregnancy are well-established phenomena and commonly lead to a chronic respiratory alkalosis with compensatory renal excretion of bicarbonate. However, the underlying mechanism of dyspnoea during normal pregnancy remains largely undefined. Increasing progesterone levels are a primary factor leading to increased respiratory drive to ensure the rising metabolic demands of the pregnancy are met. Dyspnoea symptoms typically begin in the first or second trimester, are mild, and do not interfere with activities of daily living. We report the case of a 35-year-old female with severe physiological hyperventilation of pregnancy presenting with profound dyspnoea, tachypnoea, and presyncope from 18 weeks of gestation until delivery. Subsequent investigations revealed no identifiable underlying pathology. There remain limited reports of such severe physiological hyperventilation of pregnancy. This case highlights interesting questions regarding the respiratory physiology of pregnancy and underlying mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "Adolescents are prone to abnormal uterine bleeding. The most common cause of AUB in this age range is immaturity of the hypothalamus pituitary ovarian axis.2 As detailed in this chapter, several characteristics of underlying hereditary or acquired blood disorders increase the anticipated hormonal imbalance at this age, increasing the morbidity of the underlying condition. Despite the fact that blood problems can cause AUB, uterine structural and/or endocrine abnormalities are frequently missed when a blood disorder is present.5Haematologists and gynaecologists, as well as adolescent medicine specialists, must work together to treat a complex cause.  Main symptoms and/or important clinical findings: A 42 year old female was admitted in AVBRH in gynaec ward  Sawangi Meghe Wardha with chief complaint of abnormal uterine bleeding since 2 month, abdominal pain since 1 week, weakness. The main diagnoses, therapeutic interventions, and outcomes: After physical examination and investigation, this case was diagnosed having abnormal uterine bleeding since 2 month, abdominal pain since 1 week, weakness. Also she was provided calcium supplement and iron supplement. Present case was stable but blood investigation revealed sign of anemia. Nursing perspective: Fluid replacement i.e. DNS and RL, monitoring of vital signs per hourly. Conclusion: Dysfunctional bleeding is most common during the start and end of a woman's reproductive years, with 20% of instances occurring in adolescents and more than 50% in women over 45. The majority of abnormal uterine bleeding is of the dysfunctional type, however this diagnosis is only made after all other reasons have been ruled out. The most common cause of dysfunctional uterine haemorrhage is uninterrupted oestrogen levels, which cause uterine mucosa expansion.",

      "abstract": "FOCUS ON CLINICAL SPECIFICITIES Denial of pregnancy corresponds to an evolving pregnan¬cy without the woman being aware of being pregnant. It is generally associated with an absence of gravidic signs such as amenorrhea, abdominal swelling, breast tension, morning sickness, or maternal perception of fetal move¬ments. Although this phenomenon is not well known and is sometimes considered a myth by the medical world, it represents a significant public health problem. Indeed, the lack of obstetric monitoring and preparation for pa¬renthood are the cause of maternal, fetal and neonatal morbidity. The discovery of a denial of pregnancy should lead to the exploration of its clinical characteristics, its risk factors and the keys to its management. Although its causes are still unknown, recent discoveries in the neu¬roscience of maternal interoception could provide a better understanding of this phenomenon.DÉNI DE GROSSESSE : MISE AU POINT SUR LES SPÉCIFICITÉS CLINIQUES Le déni de grossesse correspond à une grossesse évolu¬tive sans que la femme ne soit consciente d’être enceinte. Il est généralement associé à une absence de signes gravidiques comme l’aménorrhée, le gonflement abdomi¬nal, la tension mammaire, les nausées matinales, ou en¬core la perception maternelle des mouvements foetaux. Phénomène méconnu, parfois considéré comme un mythe par le monde médical, il représente pourtant un problème conséquent de santé publique. En effet, l’absence de suivi obstétrical et de préparation à la parentalité font le lit de morbidités maternelle, foetale et néonatale. La découverte d’un déni de grossesse doit amener à ex¬plorer ses caractéristiques cliniques, ses facteurs de risque et les clés de sa prise en charge. Bien que ses causes soient encore inconnues, les découvertes récentes en neurosciences sur l’intéroception maternelle pour¬raient permettre de mieux comprendre ce phénomène.",

      "title": "Female genital cosmetic surgery: beyond a mechanistic view of sexual satisfaction",
      "abstract": "We appreciate the interest of Prof. Petros in our commentary on female genital cosmetic surgery 1, as well as his insightful considerations on some anatomical and biomechanical aspects of sexual intercourse. Certainly, physiological pelvic floor functioning, resulting from undamaged muscular and suspensory ligament systems, plays an important role in sexual satisfaction. An association between pelvic floor dysfunctions – such as urinary stress incontinence, cystocele, rectocele, and genital prolapse in general – and female sexual dysfunctions has been observed 2. Moreover, female sexual functioning may improve after successful surgery for pelvic floor dysfunctions. In this regard, as suggested by Prof. Petros, vaginal excision or laser treatments of the vaginal walls do not seem to be the best options. Vaginal delivery, especially when operative, is a risk factor for pelvic floor disorders, as muscles, ligaments, and nerves may be injured during the second stage of labor 3. However, there is no consensus regarding the definite impact of parity and mode of delivery on future sexual function and satisfaction 4. Some investigators have observed improved sexual functioning after vaginoplasty performed in women with a postpartum perception of “wide vagina” and decreased sensation at intercourse 5. However, with the exception of advanced-degree anatomical alterations, we believe that sexuality may not merely depend on the relation between ligaments, muscles, nerves, forces, and vaginal tensions. Understanding female sexual functioning requires a non-mechanistic, “holistic” approach, and sexuality should be considered as the result of the interaction of multiple dimensions (i.e. anatomical, biomechanical, physiological, sexological, psychosocial, and relational). Indeed, when women are asked to examine their sexual problems and identify possible causes, they often focus on relational and socio-cultural issues, so confirming that surgery may not always be the correct answer to their problems. For this reason, gynecologists and plastic surgeons should be cautious in performing female genital cosmetic surgery as well as vaginoplasties, especially when the main complaint is sexual dysfunction in the absence of major vulvovaginal anomalies, and the patients should be informed that their expectations may be unrealistic.",

      "title": "Die postpartale Harnretention – klinisch bedeutungslos?",
      "abstract": "Postpartum urinary retention (PUR) continues to be a not very well understood clinical condition. The incidence varies in literature between 0.05 to 14.1%, after vaginal delivery, and between 3.3 to 24.1% after cesarean section, depending on the criteria used and reflecting differences in obstetrical practice. A commonly used definition is the lack of spontaneous micturition 6 hours after vaginal delivery or after removing an indwelling catheter. After helping measures, bladder drainage, which can be done in different ways is most important in the treatment. Though it is a distressing condition, prognosis is normally good, and there are only few published data on long-term sequelae. But overstretching the bladder wall during pregnancy or delivery can result in severe detrusor damage, followed by voiding dysfunction. There are different independent risk factors such as prolonged first and second stage of labor, isolated length of the second stage, forceps delivery or vaccum extraction, perineal laceration and nulliparity. Epidural analgesia may also increase the risk of PUR, but is controversially discussed in literature. The lack of guidelines is one of the major problems in treating women with PUR.",

These results confirm those of Matthews.Both hypophysectomized adult male Fundulus and fish which received blank operations were maintained until sexual regression was well established. Implantations of twenty or fifteen pituitaries from normal male Fundulus caused within two weeks a recrudescence of the testes. Non-implanted controls showed none of this activity. It is concluded that the pituitary of the adult male Fundulus contains gonadotropic material and that the testes of adult Fundulus, hypophysectomized or not, are responsive to this material.The normal relation of the pituitary to the annual sexual cycle is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Hormonal contraceptives have been on the market for over fifty years and, while their formulations have changed, the basic mechanism of action has remained the same. During this time, numerous studies have been performed documenting side effects, some of which appear over time, some within weeks or months, but all can have a serious impact on health and quality of life. An effort was made to perform a series of comprehensive literature surveys to better understand immediate and long-term side effects of these agents. The results of this literature review uncovered a number of potential side effects, some of which are acknowledged and many of which are not noted in the prescribing information for these agents. Among the unacknowledged side effects are: an increased risk of HIV transmission for depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), and for combination contraceptives breast cancer, cervical cancer, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, depression, mood disorders and suicides (especially among women twenty-five years of age and younger, in the first six months of use), multiple sclerosis, interstitial cystitis, female sexual dysfunction, osteoporotic bone fractures (especially for progesterone-only contraceptives), and fatty weight gain. Misleading prescribing information regarding cardiovascular and thrombotic risks are also noted. Women seeking birth control have a right to be informed and educated about risk avoidance through the use of effective nonhormonal methods like fertility awareness methods. In one case-that of DMPA-the increased risk of HIV acquisition has been conclusively demonstrated to be both real and unique to this drug. Considering the availability of numerous alternatives, there is no justification for the continued marketing of DMPA to the public.We reviewed the effect of hormonal contraceptives on women's health. A number of potential side effects were noted including increased risks of breast cancer, cervical cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis, cystitis, bone fractures, depression, mood disorders and suicides, fatty weight gain, and female sexual dysfunction. With the long-acting injectable contraceptives there is an increased risk of getting HIV. Misleading prescribing information regarding the risks of heart attacks, strokes and blood clotting problems were also noted. Women seeking birth control have a right to know about how to avoid these risks by using effective hormone-free Fertility Awareness Methods.",

The aim of the review is to understand why the affected women do not recognize the signs of pregnancy. Recent Findings Twelve case reports of pregnancy denial were published in the last ten years. While in five cases the women had an underlying mental disorder, the rest of the cases involved women who either exhibited no physical symptoms or perceived themselves to be not pregnant despite the symptoms (i.e., repression mechanisms). Summary Pregnancy denial is considered to be a pathological issue, a likely consequence of trauma, the wish to not have a child, or a psychiatric problem. However, it appears that the majority of cases cannot be linked to any of the above reasons. We argue, therefore, that, in most cases, pregnancy denial is not associated with mental or physiological problems. Under certain circumstances, it can affect any woman.",

An imbalance in the ratio of estrogen to androgen tissue levels is postulated as a major cause in the development of gynecomastia. Endocrine investigations may include the measurement of serum testosterone, estradiol, gonadotrophin, prolactin and thyroid function tests, but not all patients with gynecomastia require extensive laboratory analysis. There are three management considerations for gynecomastia: observation, drug therapy and surgery (mastectomy). Surgical removal is recommended: if a trial of medical therapy is unsuccessful; if no regression is present after 1 year observation; if the condition worsens; if psychosocial problems rise due to gynecomastia and in patients after completing pubertal period.",

The searches included the key words (Mesh): menstruation, menstrual period, menstrual cycle, dysmenorrhea, primary dysmenorrhea, inflammatory substance and inflammatory markers. Publications from January 1980 to February 2021 were reviewed. Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecologic condition experienced by menstruating women. It is characterized by crampy lower abdominal pain that can range widely in severity, and associated to others symptoms. Its overall impact often has significant medical and psychosocial implications. The hallmark of primary dysmenorrhea is painful menses in the absence of any associated macroscopic pathologic process, and it occurs in up to 50% of menstruating females and causes significant disruption in quality of life and absenteeism. An excessive or imbalanced amount of prostanoids and possibly eicosanoids released from the endometrium during menstruation have been mentioned as the main cause of primary dysmenorrhea. The uterus is induced to contract frequently and dysrhythmically, with increased basal tone and increased active pressure. Uterine hypercontractility, reduced uterine blood flow and increased peripheral nerve hypersensitivity induce pain. Diagnosis rests on a good history with negative pelvic evaluation findings. This narrative review investigated and analyzed the pathophysiology of primary dysmenorrhea and the implications of other chemical substances.",

La dismenorrea primaria es el dolor menstrual en ausencia de patologías pélvicas. Hemorragia uterina anormal, dispareunia, dolor no cíclico, cambios en la intensidad y duración del dolor, y los hallazgos anormales del examen pélvico sugieren una patología subyacente (dismenorrea secundaria) y requieren más investigación. Se debe realizar una ecografía transvaginal si se sospecha una dismenorrea secundaria. La endometriosis es la causa más común de dismenorrea secundaria. Los síntomas y signos de adenomiosis incluyen dismenorrea, menorragia, y un útero uniformemente agrandado. Las opciones de manejo para la dismenorrea primaria incluyen medicamentos antiinflamatorios no esteroideos y anticonceptivos hormonales. Los anticonceptivos hormonales son el tratamiento de primera línea para la dismenorrea causada por la endometriosis. El calor tópico, el ejercicio y la suplementación nutricional pueden ser beneficiosos para pacientes con dismenorrea; sin embargo, no hay pruebas suficientes para apoyar el uso del yoga, la acupuntura o masaje.",

      "abstract": "To review reports of the supine hypotensive syndrome with reference to clinical presentation, suggestions on the mechanism of onset, and the possibility of advance detection.We used worldwide obstetric, anesthesia, and general medical journals from 1922 onward, a Medline search from 1966 onward, and manual cross-referencing for prior publications.We selected approximately 100 case reports of supine hypotensive syndrome and studies on supine blood pressure responses during late pregnancy.Publications that recorded novel clinical observations, specific hemodynamic or biochemical measurements, or associated complications were included.Supine hypotensive syndrome is characterized by severe supine symptoms and hypotension in late pregnancy, which compel the unconstrained subject to change position. Rarely, it may manifest even from the fifth month of pregnancy or postpartum, as well as in the pelvic tilt or sitting positions. Although inferior vena cava compression, influenced primarily by the size of the uterus and exact maternal and fetal position, is the major determinant in its development, other factors may also be important in modulating the circulatory effects of such compression. Advance recognition of susceptibility to the syndrome depends on a history of severe supine symptoms or supine intolerance and an increase in maternal heart rate and decrease in pulse pressure in the supine position. As there seems to be a spectrum of severity from minimal central cardiovascular alterations to severe syncopal shock resulting from supine inferior vena cava compression, it is difficult to define a cutoff point at which the syndrome occurs. Although usually recognizable by maternal symptoms, severe hypotension without symptoms has been reported on three occasions.",

      "abstract": "Light bleeding is frequent in women who just started to wear an intrauterine device. If the bleeding does not disappear after a couple of months following the insertion, it may reveal several problems: the IUD may be stuck in the cervix; much more rarely, the bleeding indicates the beginning of an infection. If the bleeding persists outside the menstrual period for a few months after the insertion, this may indicate a real intolerance. If this intermenstrual bleeding appears at a certain time after the insertion of the intrauterine device, either there is a calcareous deposit, or the device has shifted, or there is an infection. In this last case, a thorough gynecological examination may reveal a light case of endometritis when the uterus is tender under pressure. The disorder should disappear after a few days of antibiotherapy. The IUD may not have to be removed, provided the physician performs an ulterior gynecological check-up. Bleeding between periods may also reveal an organic pathology such as a small fibroma, a polyp or endometriosis. Therefore, if there is no logical explanation for intermenstrual bleeding, one must perform a hysterography, which may be done without removing the intrauterine device.",

However, endocrinological disorders and psychological factors are mentioned as possible causes. Vomiting usually stops after the end of the first trimester of pregnancy. Case report A case of persistent, severe vomiting during pregnancy is reported. The patient was admitted to the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics in Novi Sad in the 29th week gestation due to persistent vomiting from the beginning of pregnancy. A psychological evaluation including current psychological status was performed. The obtained results showed that hyperemesis gravidarum was a consequence of associated psychosocial factors, and conflicts causing somatic disorders. Conclusion Such cases point to the importance of psychotherapy in pregnancy either with or without drug therapy. In addition, we underline the importance of psychological preparation before pregnancy and better information about pregnancy and motherhood.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDPregnancy is associated with major hormonal changes and other physiological changes.Several neurological conditions may appear during pregnancy that are either unique to or occur with increased frequency during pregnancy and puerperium.Preexisting disorders such as epilepsy may worsen in one-third of pregnant patients and seizures are common during peripartum period.Changes in haemodynamics, blood volume and hormonal effects on the vessel wall increase risk of cerebrovascular disorders during pregnancy and the postpartum period.Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is common in the postpartum period.Brain tumours may enlarge during pregnancy because of fluid retention and the presence of oestrogen and progesterone receptors on the tumour cells.Neurological disorders may influence the management of obstetric outcomes.In this study, the common neurological problems during pregnancy and six weeks of postpartum period are discussed.Aim-To study the neurological disorders and clinical features occurring during pregnancy and 6 weeks of postpartum. MATERIALS AND METHODSThis was a descriptive study carried out in Osmania, Hyderabad (December 2015 -January 2018).Source of Data: All the pregnant women attending OP and admitted as inpatients in Osmania General Hospital.Total 67 patients attending Outpatient Department of Neurology and admitted in the hospital with neurological disorders were included.Patients with neurological disorders due to trauma, infections and obstetrical procedures were excluded from the study.A total of 67 patients were included in the study and consent was taken from them.Demographic data and data of history and detailed examination were collected.Basic and relevant investigations were done including Brain Imaging, CSF analysis, EEG, NCS, 2D Echocardiography and ANA profile whenever necessary. RESULTSMost patients were in the age group of 21 -25 years (61%).Age of patients ranged between 19 -35.Most patients presented in postpartum period (41%).Seizures (46%) was the most common presentation followed by stroke (36%).Most of the patients (45%) with seizures were in 2 nd trimester.87.5% patients with stroke presented in postpartum period.3 patients had facial palsy. 2 patients presented with astrocytomas and 3 patients had chorea. CONCLUSIONMany neurological disorders are encountered in pregnancy.In our study, we have identified 7 different conditions, of which seizures was the most common presentation.Effect of the condition and its treatment on pregnancy and vice versa should always be kept in mind.Appropriate management with collaborative effort of obstetricians, neurologists, neurosurgeons and paediatricians at specialised centres should be undertaken for successful maternal and foetal outcomes.",

Abnormal vaginal bleeding is any vaginal bleeding that appears independently of regular and orderly menstruation. This is one of the most common problems in gynecology.There is a huge difference in meaning, diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of vaginal bleeding in pregnancy and out of pregnancy, and then in women of different ages.Vaginal bleeding can result with abnormal shock.Symptoms of shock are: damp, cold and sticky skin, rapid and weak pulse, thirst, possible collapse or loss of consciousness.",

Uterine torsion occurs more often in dairy cows than other species and many factors affect its incidence like parity, age, season, confinement, etc. The condition can be classified based on the degree and direction of twist as well as the site of twist. A cow suffering from uterine torsion manifests an array of symptoms like partial anorexia, dullness, depression, restlessness, back arching, colic, etc. The condition can be diagnosed using history with rectal and vaginal examinations. Many approaches have been used to manage the condition, like rolling of the dam, rolling of the fetus, laparotomy, and laparo-hysterotomy. Uterine torsion can lead to various complications, including fetal and maternal death, uterine rupture, vaginal rupture, and reduced fertility after correcting a long-standing case of torsion. Peritonitis, or the expulsion of the fetus into the abdominal cavity after uterine rupture, can occur in some cases. The prognosis of torsion is good to poor, depending upon the degree of torsion.",

It is a condition where there will be painful menstruation associated with abdo minal cramps, backache, nausea and vomiting, stiffness in thighs, cramps in calf muscles. Pain usually last for 2 or 3 days and tends to happen in the first few days of the period. Up to 15% of women have period pains, severe enough to interfere with their daily activities. This can lead to missing days at work or diseased participation in social or sporting activities. Dysmenorrhoea is of two type namely primary and secondary dysmenorrho ea. Primary dysmenorrhoea is used to describe normal period pain experienced by many women during the ti me of their period and there is no underlying medical problem. Secondary dysmenorrhoea is used to describe pain results of an underlying gynecological problem. There are number of measures like sitz bath, simple morning walk and dietotherapy.

La esperanza de vida ha aumentado significativamente. Por ejemplo, mientras que en la década de 1940 las mujeres vivían en promedio 41 años, hoy alcanzan aproximadamente 87 años. Considerando que la edad promedio de entrada a la menopausia es entre los 49 y 51 años, las mujeres pasan entre 36 y 38 años en una etapa no reproductiva, enfrentando desafíos fisiológicos, emocionales, cognitivos y sociales propios de este periodo. Esta prolongada etapa menopáusica y posmenopáusica representa un importante problema de salud pública que requiere una atención integral y cuidadosa.

      "abstract": "At rest, continence of urine depends on intraurethral pressure being higher than intravesical pressure. Intraurethral pressure is produced by elastic fibres and engorged urethral venous sinuses. Low intravesical pressure is preserved by bladder muscle relaxation. Urgency incontinence will result if bladder muscle does not relax. A sudden increase in abdominal pressure may overcome this urethral-vesical pressure gradient and cause stress incontinence. The mechanisms that prevent this from happening are unclear. The pressure gradient would not change if the abdominal pressure was transmitted equally to the urethra and the bladder. Continence could also be protected by pressure of the urethra against the symphysis pubis or pelvic muscles. Stress and urgency incontinence cannot be differentiated clinically with certainty. If surgical correction of stress incontinence is planned, preoperative urethrocystometry is mandatory. The Burch colposuspension is the operative procedure of choice. The suspension is done with Prolene sutures; their correct placement is ensured through the use of intraoperative cystostomy.",

Inclusion criteria were: age &gt;18 years, reporting voiding symptoms (intermittent stream, hesitancy, straining and/or a feeling of incomplete emptying), uroflowmetry maximum flow rate (Q&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) under 12 ml and/or presence of postvoid residual greater than 50% of the voiding volume. Exclusion criteria were: patients suffering from any other anatomical or functional disorder such as urethral stenosis, pelvic organ prolapse, neurological disturbances, or systemic diseases that could impact upon bladder voiding. Tamsulosin was administered in a single daily dose of 0.4 mg for at least 30 days. Primary outcomes were clinical efficacy and Q&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; improvement; secondary outcomes were tolerability and safety. Voiding and storage symptoms and uroflowmetry results were assessed before and at the end of the α-blocker therapy. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Tamsulosin therapy was well tolerated. After therapy voiding symptoms improved in 71.4% of patients (45/63; p &lt; 0.0001), and if associated with storage symptoms in 66.67% (26/39; p &lt; 0.00001). Recurrent infections were reduced by 50% in 81% (21/26) of patients. Uroflowmetry parameters improved in 36/63 patients (57.1%). Postvoiding residue improved in 62.5% (10/16) and disappeared in 25% (4/16) with no significant changes in voided volume. An improvement was observed in 66% (16/24) of patients with isolated voiding symptoms, in 51.2% (20/39) with associated storage symptoms and in 65% (17/26) of women with associated recurrent urinary infections. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; These results suggest that α-blocker may be an effective treatment option in women with voiding dysfunction due to functional BOO.",

      "abstract": "La continence urinaire est un equilibre permanent entre le fonctionnement du reservoir vesical et les mecanismes sphincteriens. La vessie doit posseder une capacite suffisante et une bonne compliance (rapport de l’augmentation des volumes aux pressions intravesicales), sans contraction non inhibee involontaire. Les mecanismes sphincteriens doivent permettre une cloture de l’uretre, qu’il s’agisse du col vesical ou de la fermeture du sphincter strie. Devant une incontinence urinaire feminine, il est indispensable d’identifier la ou les causes et, donc, le ou les mecanismes responsables afin de pouvoir proposer a la patiente le traitement le plus approprie. Au niveau uretral, l’incontinence peut etre liee a une anomalie de statique, ou hypermobilite, des tissus de soutien sous-uretro-cervicaux et/ou a une anomalie sphincterienne, dite insuffisance sphincterienne. Le plus souvent, les femmes souffrant d’une incontinence urinaire d’effort avec insuffisance sphincterienne ont deja subi des interventions chirurgicales ou des traumatismes (fractures du bassin) de la region uretro-cervico-vesicale. Elles peuvent egalement etre porteuses d’anomalies neurologiques acquises (chirurgie pelvienne), traumatiques (traumatismes medullaires) ou congenitales (spina-bifida). Cliniquement, ces patientes presentent une incontinence liee au moindre effort. Il n’y a habituellement pas de fuites nocturnes en decubitus sauf en cas d’insuffisance sphincterienne majeure lors des mouvements a vessie pleine. La cystographie montre un col vesical ouvert au repos, en l’absence de toute contraction du detrusor, avec ou sans anomalies de mobilite de la region cervicale. L’objectif du traitement de ce type d’incontinence est de retablir un obstacle uretral passif creant une resistance aux fuites lors de l’effort et retablissant des moyens anatomiques de cloture uretro-cervicale. De nombreuses techniques chirurgicales ont ete imaginees et commencent maintenant a etre suffisamment evaluees pour que leurs resultats et leurs indications puissent etre analyses. Malgre plusieurs tentatives pour standardiser la definition de l’insuffisance sphincterienne et classer les patientes pouvant beneficier des differentes techniques chirurgicales, un consensus n’est pas encore etabli sur la definition stricto sensu de l’insuffisance sphincterienne.",

But little could be done for the great number of women with slight or moderate complaints. As operation is not indicated in such cases, temporizing procedures had to be applied that all too often resulted in dissatisfaction of patient and physician alike. In the meantime, however, it has been demonstrated that in the overwhelming majority of cases, 2 even with a history of childbirth injury, urinary stress incontinence is due to inherent weakness of the muscles surrounding bladder neck and vagina.

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory and estrogen-dependent disease affecting about 10 % of the female population in fertile ages. There is no cure for endometriosis. The main symptoms include severe menstrual pain, ovulation pain, dyspareunia, dysuria and painful bowel movements. Endometriosis is associated with infertility. Endometriosis affects every day life with pain and fatigue and a negative impact on education, career, social life and quality of life. Endometriosis can emerge at the first menstruations and also continue to give symptoms after menopause. The symptoms can vary greatly between individuals and also during life. The pathofysiology is unknown but the most accepted theory is retrograde menstruation where endometrial cells implant into the peritoneum affecting different abdominal organs. The immune system fails to clear the endometrial cells which results in endometriotic lesions that might cause inflammation, pain and adhesions. The treatment includes hormone treatment, surgical treatment, pain medication, physiotherapy, counseling and sometimes multi-disciplinary pain rehabilitation. It is important to increase the knowledge of this common disease both among the public and health professionals since early treatment is of great importance to reduce the risk for chronic pain and severe effects on quality of life. We hope that the recently published clinical guidelines will result in better and more equal care for patients with endometriosis in Sweden.",

      "abstract": "SLE is a multi-organ autoimmune disease that affects women of childbearing age. Renal involvement in the form of either active lupus nephritis (LN) at the time of conception, or a LN new onset or flare during pregnancy increases the risks of preterm delivery, pre-eclampsia, maternal mortality, fetal/neonatal demise, and intrauterine growth restriction. Consequently, current recommendations advise that the affected woman achieve a stable remission of her renal disease for at least 6 months before conception. Hormonal and immune system changes in pregnancy may affect disease activity and progression, and published evidence suggests that there is an increased risk for a LN flare during pregnancy. The major goal of immunosuppressive therapy in pregnancy is control of disease activity with medications that are relatively safe for a growing fetus. Therefore, the use of mycophenolate mofetil, due to increasing evidence supporting its teratogenicity, is contraindicated during pregnancy. Worsening proteinuria, which commonly occurs in proteinuric renal diseases toward the end of pregnancy, should be differentiated from a LN flare and/or pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy-specific condition clinically characterized by hypertension and proteinuria. These considerations present challenges that underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach when caring for these patients, including a nephrologist, rheumatologist, and obstetrician who have experience with these pregnancy-related complications. This review discusses the pathogenesis, maternal and fetal risks, and management pertinent to SLE patients with new onset or a history of LN predating pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Study question Exploring the Current Levels of Emotional Suppression in Women Undergoing In Vitro Fertilization-Embryo Transfer and Analyzing its Influencing Factors. Summary answer Factors influencing emotional suppression in infertile women: residence, treatment costs, infertility causes, miscarriage history, personality type, marital adjustment, self-pity, and medical coping. What is known already Emotional suppression refers to the conscious suppression of negative emotional expression and the behavior of hiding negative emotions. Emotional suppression often hides beneath a cheerful exterior and isn’t easily detected by medical professionals. If left unchecked, it can easily lead to the breakdown of a patient’s psychological defenses. Long-term emotional suppression can result in severe anxiety and depression. Clinical studies have found that couples seeking in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment exhibit significant levels of stress, depression, and anxiety, which often indicate poor pregnancy outcomes. it’s necessary to understand the levels of emotional suppression and influencing factors in women undergoing IVF-ET. Study design, size, duration Cross-sectional survey was conducted in Hunan Province from May 1, 2023, to September 30, using a random sampling method to select a reproductive specialized hospital According to Sun’s book “Medical Statistics” (2014), the sample size for a multifactorial study should be 10-20 times the number of variables. With 36 variables in this study and accounting for a 10% rate of invalid questionnaires, the required sample size was 396-792. 810 questionnaires were distributed, and 791 were collected. Participants/materials, setting, methods Inclusion criteria: Infertility diagnosed per WHO standards; Eligible for assisted pregnancy via IVF-ET and enrolled in a cycle. Exclusion criteria:History of mental illness or psychiatric disorders;Hearing, visual, language impairments The surveys utilized in this study included the Emotional Suppression Scale, Locke-Wollance Marital Adjustment Questionnaire, Self-Pity Scale, and Medical Coping Style Questionnaire. Statistical analyses, such as descriptive analysis, t-tests, analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney U test, Pearson correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis, were conducted using SPSS 26. Main results and the role of chance The average emotional suppression score of 791 women undergoing IVF-ET was 27.97±6.39. Correlation analysis indicated a negative relationship between emotional suppression and marital adaptation, self-pity, and medical coping styles, while a positive association was observed with the production dimension of medical coping styles. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that factors such as place of residence, infertility cost, infertility factors, history of miscarriage, personality type, marital adaptation, self-pity, and confrontation and yielding dimensions of medical coping styles significantly influenced emotional suppression in women. The independent variables in the regression equation explained 50.1% of the variance in emotional suppression and the equation was statistically significant. Women exhibited a moderate level of emotional suppression, with the emotional camouflage dimension scoring the highest. Healthcare professionals need to assess emotional suppression in patients and provide personalized psychological counseling interventions. Encouraging positive coping strategies, involving patients in treatment decisions, providing education, and facilitating communication with successful pregnancy cases can help patients face their condition more effectively. Mindfulness interventions and meditation can also be recommended to enhance self-compassion and acceptance. Additionally, comprehensive health education for both patients and their partners, promoting open emotional communication, and fostering mutual support can contribute to reducing emotional suppression in infertility patients. Limitations, reasons for caution This study is a cross-sectional survey. Future research could adopt a longitudinal design to further explore the levels of emotional suppression in women at different stages. This study only investigated women in Hunan Province, which may introduce bias. The emotional suppression levels of infertile couples across China could be investigated. Wider implications of the findings Medical professionals should prioritize addressing the emotional distress of introverted women residing in rural areas, who have spent over 10,000 yuan, undergone three or more abortions, and are experiencing female-factor infertility. Patients can be encouraged to adopt positive coping mechanisms by enhancing their self-compassion levels and adjusting their marital relationships. Trial registration number 2023372",

      "abstract": "Symptoms related to menstruation are the commonest cause of gynaecological complaints during the reproductive years, and cause more work absences than any other disorders commonly seen in women. These disturbances of menstrual bleeding and menstruation-associated pain can have major impacts on quality of life, and can lead to the development of significant symptoms due to iron deficiency and anaemia. There is a range of common and rare underlying causes of abnormal uterine bleeding, which have been well classified using the PALM-COEIN system. Investigations should be targeted at defining the underlying causes and assessing the degree of iron deficiency. Treatment depends on the underlying cause, and a range of surgical and medical approaches can be considered—improved quality of life is the key aim. Effective treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding should be accompanied by effective treatment for iron deficiency. Amenorrhoea (absence of menstruation for a specified period of time) may be due to disturbances of almost any part of the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian–uterine system. Investigations should focus on the interplay of reproductive hormones and exclusion of structural pathology. Treatment is aimed at managing the underlying cause, taking into account the desires of the patient in relation to pregnancy. Menstrual pain may be caused by an imbalance of prostaglandin metabolism (primary dysmenorrhoea) or by structural pathologies, such as endometriosis (secondary dysmenorrhoea). Symptoms can vary greatly and a careful history can often distinguish realistically between primary and secondary dysmenorrhoea. Treatment is often medical, although structural pathologies may require surgical excision.",

This lack of evidence may be attributable to a paucity of research on maternal stress during the earliest gestational stages. Most human studies have focused on “clinical” pregnancy (&gt;6 weeks after the last menstrual period). The majority of miscarriages, however, occur earlier, within the first 3 weeks after conception (≈5 weeks after the last menstrual period). Studies focused on clinical pregnancy thus miss the most critical period for pregnancy continuance. We examined the association between miscarriage and levels of maternal urinary cortisol during the first 3 weeks after conception. Pregnancies characterized by increased maternal cortisol during this period (within participant analyses) were more likely to result in spontaneous abortion ( P &lt; 0.05). This evidence links increased levels in this stress marker with a higher risk of early pregnancy loss in humans.",

      "abstract": "Uterine incarceration is an uncommon but serious presentation in the emergency department that requires early recognition to improve maternal and fetal outcomes.A 29-year-old female, at 12 weeks gestation, presented to the emergency department (ED) with complaints of fever, sacral pain and urgency. Based on history and physical examination, she was found to have a retroverted, incarcerated uterus. After a failed attempt at reduction in the ED, her uterus was successfully reduced under general anesthesia.Pain and urinary difficulties, such as retention and hesitancy, are frequent in pregnancy, yet incarcerated uterus is an uncommon emergency department diagnosis that often presents with these symptoms. Clues to the diagnosis include a retroverted uterus, urinary retention, and pain in a patient presenting in the third to fourth months of gestation. Treatment is by manual reduction of the uterus. Complications range from spontaneous abortion to uterine rupture.",

Any pataent whose labour has begun wathm three hours: after eatang or who has taken food after labour has begun must be considered to have a full stomach. If labour is at all prolonged ileus and gastric dllatataon are likely to be present to some degree. Some nurses msxst on glvmg, or are ordered to gave, iquads to a patient in prolonged labour in an ill-advised attempt to maintain the pataent's fluid balance.

      "abstract": "Stillbirth (fetal death) is death before complete extrusion or extraction of the fetus at the 28th week of gestation. Causes may include pregnancy complications such as problems with the placenta or umbilical cord, congenital malformations, infections or birth complications such as asphyxiation, but most of the time the cause is unknown. Stillbirth may be suspected when no fetal movement is felt, and it is confirmed by ultrasound. If labour doesn't occur spontaneously after two weeks, it is induced vaginally to prevent complications related to retention of a dead fetus. The role of the midwife is very important in the stillbirth. The midwife is constantley supporting the pregnant woman psychologicaly and emotionaly to help her go through birth as easily as possible. Talking to mother at such moments is impossible, difficult to follow, irrational and closed. Nonetheless, the midwife must be patient and have an understanding of the childbearing mother. If the mother expresses her desire to see and touch the stillborn, the midwife brings her wrapped in a diaper and gives her plenty of time to say goodbye to the baby. The midwife respects mother's decisions and desires, communicates with her in a verbally and non-verbally acceptable manner at such situation. The stillborn is wrapped in a diaper and remains in the maternity ward for 2 hours after delivery and it is then sent to the pathology department for autopsy along with the placenta. Autopsy is important for the prognosis of the next pregnancy because it helps determine the impact of maternal disease and pregnancy disorders on fetal growth, development and death. After two hours from delivery, the mother is placed in a ward where the midwife continues to provide effective support, provide emotional support and counseling after the loss of child as a prevention of postnatal depression or long-term failure to accept the reality of death.",

      "title": "Injectable Botulinum Toxin for Pelvic Pain: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness, Cost-Effectiveness, and Guidelines",
      "abstract": "Gynecological conditions of the pelvic floor region can include vulvodynia (vulvar pain lasting at least 3 months with no identifiable cause), vaginismus (or genito-pelvic pain or penetration disorder, the inability to achieve non-painful vaginal penetration of any kind), endometriosis (in which cells of the endometrium grows outside of the uterus), and provoked vestibulodynia (localized pain in the vulvar vestibule caused by physical contact). Gynecological conditions of the pelvic floor region are generally considered to occur as a result of a multifactorial process that includes genetics, hormonal changes, inflammation, musculoskeletal issues (such as hypertonic muscles), neurologic mechanisms, psychosocial factors (often related to sexual functioning), and structural issues (such as perineal descent), but etiologies are often unknown.,, First-line treatments for these conditions include physiotherapy, dilation therapy, sex counseling, psychotherapy, or a combination of therapies., Increasingly, botulinum toxin has become an alternative therapy option for individuals with pelvic pain.Botulinum toxin is a toxin produced by the Clostridium bacteria. Botulinum toxin is used in neuromuscular disorders, ophthalmic disorders, chronic pain, cosmetic and dermatological applications, pelvic floor disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and spasticity. In pelvic pain, it is typically injected into the muscle, where it inhibits release of acetylcholine, causing blockage of muscle spasms.Pelvic pain disorders can affect an individual’s feelings of self worth, quality of life, sexual functioning, psychological well being, and relationships.– According to a 2017 cross-sectional study, the average hospital-associated cost of chronic pelvic pain (pelvic and perineal pain, dysmenorrhea, or dyspareunia) in Canada amounted to C$25 million per year between 2008 and 2012. Many cases of pelvic pain go undiagnosed, as patients often do not report sexual dysfunction, and it has been reported that patients with vulvodynia had the condition for an average of 7 years before seeking help., Additionally, as vulvodynia is not well understood, individuals with the condition may wait an average of 5 years to receive a diagnosis after seeking treatment.There is uncertainty regarding the of effectiveness of botulinum toxin for some chronic pelvic pain conditions. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness and safety of botulinum toxin compared with other treatments or placebo for patients with chronic pelvic floor dysfunction and pain. Evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of botulinum toxin for pelvic pain was also sought to support decision making. Evidence-based recommendations were sought to provide guidance on the use of botulinum toxin for these conditions.",

There is mounting evidence to indicate that parents who develop childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder do so as a direct consequence of a traumatic childbirth experience. High-risk groups, such as those who experience preterm birth, stillbirth, or preeclampsia, have higher prevalence rates. The main risks include antenatal factors (eg, depression in pregnancy, fear of childbirth, poor health or complications in pregnancy, history of trauma or sexual abuse, or mental health problems), perinatal factors (eg, negative subjective birth experience, operative birth, obstetrical complications, and severe maternal morbidity, as well as maternal near misses, lack of support, dissociation), and postpartum factors (eg, depression, postpartum physical complications, and poor coping and stress).The link between birth events and childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder provides a valuable opportunity to prevent traumatic childbirths and childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder from occurring in the first place. Childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder is an extremely distressing mental disorder and has a substantial negative impact on those who give birth, fathers or co-parents, and, potentially, the whole family. Still, a traumatic childbirth experience and childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder remain largely unrecognized in maternity services and are not routinely screened for during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In fact, there are gaps in the evidence on how, when, and who to screen.Similarly, there is a lack of evidence on how best to treat those affected. Primary prevention efforts (eg, screening for antenatal risk factors, use of trauma-informed care) are aimed at preventing a traumatic childbirth experience and childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder in the first place by eliminating or reducing risk factors for childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder. Secondary prevention approaches (eg, trauma-focused psychological therapies, early psychological interventions) aim to identify those who have had a traumatic childbirth experience and to intervene to prevent the development of childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder. Tertiary prevention (eg, trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing) seeks to ensure that people with childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder are identified and treated to recovery so that childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder does not become chronic.Adequate prevention, screening, and intervention could alleviate a considerable amount of suffering in affected families. In light of the available research on the impact of childbirth-related posttraumatic stress disorder on families, it is important to develop and evaluate assessment, prevention, and treatment interventions that target the birthing person, the couple dyad, the parent-infant dyad, and the family as a whole. Further research should focus on the inclusion of couples in different constellations and, more generally, on the inclusion of more diverse populations in diverse settings. The paucity of national and international policy guidance on the prevention, care, and treatment of psychological birth trauma and the lack of formal psychological birth trauma services and training, highlight the need to engage with service managers and policy makers.

      "abstract": "In the daily clinical routine, clarification of menstrual irregularities is one of the major essentials for consultation in gynaecological practice. For an effective therapy, it is necessary to know the exact cause of the bleeding disorders. Menstrual irregularities can be the expression of a disturbed ovarian function or another disorder, usually uterine pathology. The type of menstrual irregularity is not necessarily indicative of the underlying disorder so that the examination of the levels of hormones is indispensable. Moreover, an organic cause of the bleeding disorder should be excluded. Whether the ovulatory cycle is associated with normal follicle maturation and corpus luteum function has to be clarified in the treatment of childlessness. The existence of anovulatory cycles or cycles with corpus luteum insufficiency can be normal in specific phases of life, e.g., puberty or peri-menopause. The issue of therapy should be addressed briefly. Firstly, the symptoms such as bleeding disorders and the disease patterns which are responsible for it should be highlighted. The clarification of menstrual irregularities is not only important in sterility therapy, they also influence the quality of life (1). Furthermore, hormonal disorders which are associated with chronic oestrogen or progesterone deficiency have an impact on the overall health (2). The following review represents the diagnostics of hormone-related menstrual irregularities in the fertile phase of life. The issue of bleeding disorders with the application of hormone preparations is not addressed.",

Essa condição tem grande importância clínica na medicina veterinária, especialmente na reprodução de equinos. Diante do exposto, este presente trabalho tem como objetivo descrever os sinais clínicos da ruptura do tendão pré-púbico em éguas, consequências e possiveis meios de oferecer uma melhor qualidade de vida ao animal. Para tanto, realizou uma pesquisa bibliográfica dos últimos 10 anos de artigos cientificos publicados a cerca do assunto. Observou-se que a presente patologia é rara nas outras espécies domésticas, sua etiologia não é bem esclarecida, mas há algumas relações à gestação que podem predispor a sua ocorrência, como em animais de tração que são submetidas a maior esforço, volume exagerado de líquido fetal e gestação gemelar. Os sinais clínicos podem variar de acordo com a extensão da lesão. O diagnóstico é frequentemente confirmado por meio de exames clínicos, ultrassonografia e, em alguns casos, radiografias. A mesma não tem tratamento eficiente porém a terapêutica deve ser aplicada de acordo com o estado clínico do animal. Logo, a ruptura do tendão pré-púbico em éguas representa uma condição clínica grave e de manejo desafiador, especialmente quando ocorre em fases avançadas da gestação. Mais informações sobre prevenção ou outras condutas veterinárias para o acompanhamento das fêmeas gestantes faz-se necessário, visando assim evitar o aparecimento da patologia e maior taxa de fetos vivos.",

      "title": "Approach to dysmenorrhoea in primary care",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Ms. Lim is a 14-year-old girl who visited your clinic with her mother. She complained of lower abdominal cramps that were worse at the start of her menstrual cycle. She is a cross-country runner, but the pain has been limiting her participation in sports activities. Additionally, she has had to take sick leave from school almost every month due to the pain. She has tried heat therapy and paracetamol with minimal symptomatic improvement. Her mother asked if there were any other treatments available, as she was concerned that her daughter's grades would be affected owing to the frequent absenteeism. She was also worried this might impact her daughter's future fertility.WHAT IS DYSMENORRHOEA? Dysmenorrhoea refers to recurrent pelvic pain related to menstruation. It can be categorised into two groups: primary and secondary. Primary dysmenorrhoea occurs without any pathological cause whilst secondary dysmenorrhoea occurs as a result of a pelvic pathology or medical condition.[1] Dysmenorrhoea occurs when there is excessive secretion of endometrial prostaglandin F2 alpha.[2] This results in uterine hypercontractility with consequent uterine muscle hypoxia and ischaemia.[3] Central sensitisation may also play a role in primary dysmenorrhoea. This occurs when repeated episodes of dysmenorrhoea result in an increased pain response within the central nervous system.[3] HOW COMMON IS THIS IN MY PRACTICE? Dysmenorrhoea is the most common gynaecological condition in women of childbearing age[1] and can be associated with significant morbidity. The prevalence of dysmenorrhoea varies from 45% to 95%, worldwide.[3] In Singapore, it was reported by 83.5% of adolescent females aged 12–19 years.[4] Dysmenorrhoea has been found to have a significant negative impact on schooling, work life and interpersonal relationships, resulting in poorer quality of life.[3] It is the main reason for repeated short periods of school and work absenteeism.[3] In Singapore, almost one in four girls reported time-off from school.[4] This is similar abroad, where 10%–30% of women who are working or studying lose 1–2 days a month due to dysmenorrhoea.[3] It has also been associated with poorer mental health, including depression and anxiety.[5] Despite the high prevalence and significant impact of dysmenorrhoea, many individuals either do not seek medical attention or undertreat with over-the-counter medications.[2,4] Adolescent patients and their caregivers may feel that pain is 'normal' and medications are unnecessary.[4] Some reasons for this include a lack of knowledge on dysmenorrhoea and its available treatments, misconception regarding what is normal and a lack of awareness of the potential consequences of non-diagnosis and treatment.[4,6] Primary care physicians are well positioned to explore and provide evidence-based education and management for this condition, as many patients present to primary care clinics. WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Given the potential implications of dysmenorrhoea, it is necessary to adopt a holistic approach. This includes exploring for associated symptoms, taking a complete menstrual and sexual history and performing a focused physical examination. This is then followed by patient education, investigations to rule out secondary causes and management that addresses the impact dysmenorrhoea has on the patient's life. The initial step would be to determine if there is an underlying cause for the patient's symptoms. History taking should include evaluation of the menstrual symptoms and other systemic symptoms, impact on day-to-day living and quality of life, previous analgesia use and its effectiveness and any family history of dysmenorrhoea. Risk factors associated with dysmenorrhoea include a younger age at menarche, nulliparity and a positive family history of dysmenorrhoea.[1,7] Further details on history evaluation are illustrated in Box 1.Box 1: Medical history to evaluate patients with dysmenorrhoea.[ 7 ]Patients with a history suggestive of primary dysmenorrhoea but have never been sexually active should not undergo a vaginal examination.[1,7] However, a rectal examination can elicit general tenderness, tender nodules along the uterosacral ligaments or recto-vaginal septum or pelvic masses. For those who are or have been sexually active, both vaginal and rectal examination should be performed. A bimanual examination of the uterus should be performed to identify its size, texture, position, presence of tenderness, masses and whether it is fixed or mobile. The adnexa and uterosacral ligaments should also be examined for any tenderness or nodularity.[7] A speculum examination may identify a nodule, vaginal or cervical discharge as well as uncommon anatomical abnormalities such as a vaginal septum, which can cause partial outflow tract obstruction. Most patients with primary dysmenorrhoea, however, will have a normal pelvic examination. Figure 1 illustrates the evaluation process for patients who present with dysmenorrhoea.Figure 1: Flowchart summarises the evaluation and management of a patient with dysmenorrhoea. aAntibiotic regimen: Intramuscular ceftriaxone 500 mg once, with oral doxycycline 100 mg twice a day and oral metronidazole 400 mg twice a day for 14 days. bPatients not suitable for outpatient antibiotics include those with suspected pelvic abscess, those with inability to take oral medications due to nausea and vomiting, immunosuppressed individuals, those with a poor response to previous antibiotics and those who have inability to arrange for review 72 h after initiation of treatment. COCPs: combined oral contraceptive pills, ED: emergency department, NSAIDs: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsWHAT RED FLAGS TO LOOK OUT FOR? Patients with the following red flags should undergo prompt evaluation for secondary causes of dysmenorrhoea. Dysmenorrhoea with poor response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or hormonal contraception after three cycles[2] Patients in whom dysmenorrhoea started more than 2 years after the onset of menarche or who present with progressively worsening dysmenorrhoea[8] Pelvic mass or abnormal vaginal or rectal examination Symptoms suggestive of secondary dysmenorrhoea, such as abnormal uterine bleeding (menorrhagia and intermenstrual bleeding), mid-cycle or acyclic pain, deep dyspareunia, subfertility and mucopurulent vaginal discharge Family history of endometriosis or adenomyosis Renal, spine, cardiac or gastrointestinal anatomical anomalies, as these can be associated with gynaecological structural anomalies[8] PRIMARY DYSMENORRHOEA Primary dysmenorrhoea frequently begins 6–12 months after menarche, when cycles become ovulatory.[3] The pain in primary dysmenorrhoea is typically worse on the first day of the menstrual cycle and usually subsides within 2–3 days. It may radiate to the back or down the legs. Other associated symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating and migraine.[3] The patient with primary dysmenorrhoea will typically have normal physical examination and tend to respond to NSAIDs. TREATMENT Treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea includes non-pharmacological, pharmacological and surgical methods. The patient's mood should also be explored. Non-pharmacological or complementary therapies While there is limited high-quality evidence for non-pharmacological management of patients with primary dysmenorrhoea, several options can still be considered. These methods may also encourage self-empowerment. It is also necessary to educate the patients to equip them with medical knowledge associated with their symptoms, which may in turn improve adherence to medication and decrease pain.[8] Heat therapy Topical heat applied to the lower abdomen has been shown to reduce pain intensity, compared to placebo.[9] This is easily available as heat packs or heated water bottles.[1] It is thought that the topical heat activates thermoreceptors and reduces the response to nociceptors, consequently reducing pain signals to the brain. Exercise While there is limited quality evidence for exercise, it is unlikely to be harmful and can benefit physical health. Of the different exercise intensities, low-intensity exercise has been shown to have the greatest benefit in reducing dysmenorrhoea and improving overall quality of life.[9] Such exercises include yoga and stretching. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation/acupuncture/traditional Chinese medicine There is some evidence for the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture in improving dysmenorrhoea. However, the trial findings are limited by small numbers.[7,8,10] Similarly, traditional Chinese medicine has also been shown to have some benefit in small studies. However, evidence evaluating the adverse effects of these medications is limited.[11] Cautionary advice should be given to patients who wish to try these options, as there is limited data regarding their efficacy and adverse effects. Diet There may be a potential for certain supplements such as ginger, fish oil, magnesium and vitamin B1 in improving dysmenorrhoea.[12] However, the evidence is limited to small studies. Behavioural interventions Behavioural techniques such as biofeedback, as well as cognitive behavioural therapy such as relaxation training and desensitisation, may be used as adjuncts to pharmacological treatments.[1] Pharmacological treatment Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs are the first-line treatment and have been shown to be more effective than paracetamol.[13] They inhibit the cyclooxygenase pathway, preventing the formation of prostaglandins.[2] A Cochrane review found no superiority between the different NSAIDs; therefore, doctors are encouraged to opt for the most cost-effective option, usually ibuprofen or mefenamic acid.[13] To be most effective, patients should take NSAIDs 1–2 days before the start of the menstrual cycle. If a patient has irregular cycles and is unable to predict the start date, NSAIDs should be taken on the first day of their menstrual cycle and stopped when symptoms resolve, typically around day 2 or 3.[2] Patients can be advised to take a loading dose followed by regular dosing, as this has been shown to improve dysmenorrhoea to a greater extent compared to only a regular dose regimen [Table 1].[2] NSAIDs should be taken with meals to reduce the risk of adverse gastric side effects. Avoid use of NSAIDs in patients with comorbidities such as asthma, peptic ulcer disease, cardiovascular diseases or renal impairment. Specific cyclooxygenase isoform 2 (COX-2) inhibitors may be used in those with known peptic ulcer disease. If one agent does not work, consider trying a different one.[8]Table 1: Suggested nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs dosing regimen for primary dysmenorrhoea.[ 2 ]Hormonal treatment Hormonal treatments that can be considered include combined hormonal contraception (CHC) and progestin-only contraceptives, including depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), etonogestrel subdermal implant (Nexplanon®) and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (Mirena®). Combined hormonal contraception, which includes combined oral contraceptive pill and patch, may be used as the second-line treatment in those who fail to respond or are unable to tolerate NSAIDs. However, this can be the first-line treatment for those requiring concomitant contraception. The hormones released suppress ovulation and reduce endometrial growth, thereby reducing prostaglandin secretion.[2,14] CHC has been shown to improve pain, with no difference found between the different preparations.[14] When used in continuous or extended regimens (more than 28 days of active hormone), CHC may result in improved pain control compared to the traditional cyclical regimen (21 days of active hormone with seven hormone-free days).[1,15] It is, therefore, reasonable to consider switching a patient to a continuous or extended regimen if she does not show improvement in her symptoms while on cyclical therapy.[15] Progestin-only contraceptives may provide pain relief by inducing endometrial atrophy. This option is particularly useful in patients with contraindications to the oestrogen component of CHCs, such as high body mass index (BMI) or the risk of thrombosis. There is evidence that DMPA, Nexplanon and Mirena may alleviate dysmenorrhoea.[1,2] These methods may be considered in patients who desire long-term reversible contraception, have contraindications to oestrogen or desire the convenience of long-acting treatment. Surgical options Most women will experience improvement in symptoms with either non-pharmacological or pharmacological treatment. However, those who show no improvement should be referred to a gynaecologist for further evaluation. If primary dysmenorrhoea continues, the patient may be referred to a chronic pain team for a multidisciplinary approach to optimise analgesia through a biopsychosocial model. Two main surgical techniques have been reported: uterosacral nerve ablation and presacral neurectomy. While both can be performed laparoscopically, they are not common procedures. Evidence to support these approaches in the long term is limited, with adverse effects reported.[1,8] If symptoms remain refractory, patients who have completed their family or do not desire to have children may be offered hysterectomy after a successful trial of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. FOLLOW-UP MANAGEMENT FOR PRIMARY DYSMENORRHOEA Patients with presumed primary dysmenorrhoea should be monitored for response to treatment, as this would support the diagnosis. If there is no improvement in symptoms within 3–6 months of treatment, the clinician should evaluate for treatment adherence and secondary causes of dysmenorrhoea, such as obstructive structural causes.[8] Pelvic imaging is recommended. DYSMENORRHOEA AND MOOD Dysmenorrhoea has also been shown to be associated with psychological disorders such as depression and anxiety.[5] This relationship can be bidirectional.[3] Dysmenorrhoea may contribute to the development of psychological disorders due to the pain experienced. Conversely, patients with concomitant psychological disorders may have greater sensitivity to pain, exacerbating dysmenorrhoea. It is, therefore, important to explore the impact of dysmenorrhoea on the patient's mental well-being, with appropriate follow-up and psychologist support. SECONDARY DYSMENORRHOEA Secondary dysmenorrhoea usually begins a number of years after menarche.[3] It can be further subdivided into gynaecological and non-gynaecological causes [Table 2]. Endometriosis and adenomyosis are the most common gynaecological causes. This is also more likely to occur in societies where childbearing is delayed and eschewed. A quick reference guide to the diagnosis and management of endometriosis can be found here: https://virtual.miceneurol.com/protocol.pdf. Non-gynaecological causes may arise from the genitourinary, gastrointestinal or musculoskeletal systems.Table 2: Causes of secondary dysmenorrhoea and their characteristics.[ 1 , 7 ]Pelvic imaging with ultrasonography is the initial imaging modality of choice to evaluate for gynaecological causes of secondary dysmenorrhoea.[8] Transvaginal ultrasound is less influenced by body habitus and bowel shadows, and can identify pelvic pathology better than transabdominal ultrasound. However, the former is not suitable for patients with an intact hymen. Ultrasound scans done on day 2 or 3 of the menstrual cycle may avoid physiological changes that may be interpreted as pathology such as follicle development. TAKE-HOME MESSAGES Dysmenorrhoea may negatively affect women's quality of life. Primary care physicians are well positioned to proactively explore the symptoms and provide appropriate education and management. In the initial evaluation of dysmenorrhoea, it is important to determine if it is primary or secondary in nature. If secondary dysmenorrhoea is suspected, the patient should be referred to a gynaecologist for further evaluation. Holistic approach of patients with dysmenorrhoea includes symptomatic treatment as well as consideration of the psychosocial issues that often accompany the disorder. NSAIDs are the recommended first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhoea. Combined hormonal or progesterone-only contraceptives can be used in those who desire contraception. Most adolescents will have primary dysmenorrhoea. Referral to a gynaecologist should be considered if symptoms do not improve with treatment after three menstrual cycles, as these patients are more likely to be diagnosed with an organic cause. Closing Vignette You evaluated Ms. Lim further and found no history or risk factors suggestive of secondary dysmenorrhoea. A patient health questionnaire-2 screen for depression was negative. You prescribed her with mefenamic acid (500 mg initial dose, followed by 250 mg every 6 h) and advised her to start the tablets 1–2 days before her menstrual cycle. She asked if there was anything else she could do besides medications to improve her pain. You advised her to continue heat therapy and exercise and guided her through some relaxation techniques that can be used for self-management. You reviewed her again 2 months later, and she reported significant improvement of her menstrual pain and she had not had to miss a day of school in the past 2 months. You advised her to continue with the current treatment and to return in the event of any recurrence or worsening dysmenorrhoea.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

Symptomatic endometriosis can result in long-term adverse effects on personal relationships, quality of life, and work productivity. As there is no clarity regarding the etiopathogenesis to date, researchers have shown a keen interest in the history of endometriosis over the past few decades. The natural history of endometriosis remains obscure. Literature search results for early descriptions of the condition we name endometriosis related either to symptoms associated with endometriosis or, alternatively, to identifying researchers who described pathological features associated with the presence of various phenotypes of endometriosis. There is no evidence that in early times anyone delineated the macroscopic features of endometriosis, as descriptions of menstrual or cyclic pain cannot be categorized as endometriosis.",

      "title": "Female factor problems",
      "abstract": "Female factor problems are said to be present, either alone or in combination with male factor problems, in about 50% of infertile couples. These female factor problems arise following disturbance of function of the female genital organs. Thus a problem related to the vagina may prevent or limit sexual intercourse. Likewise, the cervix may not allow spermatozoa to reach the upper genital tract. There may be problems with ovulation or tubal pick–up of the ovulated oocyte. These and other female factor problems will be considered in this chapter. The incidence of each problem varies from place to place and even amongst different social classes in an area. This is because certain problems are related to the individual's environment and lifestyle factors. Thus the pattern of sexual activity will influence the incidence of pelvic infection and resulting damage to the tubes. Some ovulatory problems are associated with either overeating and obesity or starvation and underweight. It is therefore not possible to give an incidence of these problems that will hold true in all parts of the world. The example in Figure 5.1, however, gives an idea of the relative importance of the various female factor problems to be described below.",

In simple words, the number of embryos conceived, as observed via ultrasonographic examination in early pregnancy, differs from the number of fetuses delivered. This phenomenon occurs in multi-fetus pregnancies, commonly during the first trimester.Twin loss can happen in the form of miscarriage, of which the mother is aware or in the form of vaginal bleeding or spotting in the first trimester without any knowledge of the mother, as vaginal bleeding is instead a frequent obstetric complication during the first trimester of pregnancy so that the twin loss may go unnoticed. This phenomenon can range from the disappearance of an early empty gestational sac to a sac that had developed a fetal pole to a fetus with documented heart activity.",

Prevalence rate of endometritis in India ranges from 3 to 25% in cows. The rate of endometritis in buffaloes which were covered under Amul and Dudhsagar dairy ranged from 10 to 48 per cent in Gujarat. The classification of endometritis is based on vaginal mucus viz., mild, mucopurulent, purulent and endometritis with mucopurulant or purulent fluid in uterus and severity of infection viz., acute, sub clinical and chronic endometritis. Clinical endometritis is manifested by presence of a purulent uterine discharge detectable in the vagina after 21 days or more post partum, or mucopurulent discharge detectable in the vagina after 26 days post partum. The metabolic disorders like milk fever and ketosis are related to an increase risk of developing endometritis. The endometritis is the complex of diseases that includes retained placenta, puerperal metritis, endometritis, pyometra and other non-specific infections of the uterus. The FSH concentrations from the pituitary are unaffected by uterine disease and so waves of ovarian follicles emerge in the first weeks after parturition. Classical diagnosis of endometritis on the basis of clinical manifestation and rectal examination is common. New diagnostic device Metricheck, Cytobrush and ultrasonography is adequate to diagnose endometritis. Endometritis is often self-limiting with recovery occurring after subsequent estrous cycles. The effective treatment is one which increases the uterine defense and excludes bacterial infections, but should not inhibit the normal uterine defense mechanism. PGF2α in combination with intrauterine antibacterial drugs, immunomudulators and herbals agents like Garlic extract, Neem oil are the treatment of choice for Endometritis in bovine with variable success rate.",

Possible pathology that could appear in the given time is the main cause\r\n of maternal morbidity and mortality. Urinary tract infections, wound infections,\r\n thrombosis and thromboembolism appear in this period. During the postpartum period a\r\n women goes through post-birth recovery, but postpartum psychiatric disorders and postbirth\r\n depression appear. After the child's birth (called a newborn for the first 28 days of\r\n his life), first supply for the newborn, vitality assesment and midwife's intervention (in\r\n case of complications for both the mother and the child) are required. Breastfeeding is a\r\n process in which a women feeds the newborn baby with her breast milk. During the\r\n breastfeeding possible complications might appear and therefore a maximum hygiene\r\n and midwife's intervention (in case of more serious complications) are required.\r\n Education about breastfeeding is also required and all parents-to-be should be given\r\n information about the advantages of breastfeeding as well as the normal process of the\r\n beginning of breastfeeding after the childbirth and how can it be facilitated e.g. 10\r\n steps to successful breastfeeding. Women always had the need for a close female\r\n friend to stand next to them during the childbirth to feel safe and taken care of. Today,\r\n midwife has an important role in enlightening of women, families and wider\r\n community. Midwifery care is based on the understanding of social, emotional, cultural,\r\n spiritual, psychological and physical experiences of woman as well as the best available\r\n proofs.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to help nurses understand how to quickly and effectively manage the nursing care of patients with perinatal hemorrhage. The etiology, symptoms, medical management, and nursing care of the patient experiencing a perinatal hemorrhage are discussed. Hemorrhage during the antepartum, intrapartum, or postpartum period is a life-threatening emergency for the mother and/or fetus. Early antepartum hemorrhage (before 20 weeks gestation) can be related to abortion/miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or gestational trophoblastic disease; late antepartum hemorrhage (after 20 weeks gestation) may result from placental abruption and placenta previa. Intrapartum hemorrhage is most commonly due to placental abruption, or to uterine rupture, uterine inversion, invasive conditions of the placenta, or complications of Cesarean birth. Postpartum hemorrhage is defined as blood loss greater than 500 ml in a vaginal delivery or 1000 ml in a Cesarean birth; early postpartum hemorrhage occurs during the first 24 hours after delivery; late postpartum hemorrhage occurs after the first 24 hours after delivery. The most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage is uterine atony; however, lacerations, hematomas, and subinvolution of the uterus can also cause postpartum hemorrhage. Nurses who understand how to assess, plan, intervene, and evaluate outcomes for perinatal hemorrhage are in the position to prevent the major tragedies that can accompany hemorrhage in pregnancy and shortly afterward.",

Greater sexual satisfaction and some health rewards are given by coitally obtained orgasms even though those from masturbation may be more physiologically intense. The functionality of the circulatory, neural and muscular systems of the male and female genitalia are maintained by arousal and orgasm (maintenance functions) both in the conscious state and when asleep. Prophylactic actions (preventative functions) occur in relation to prostate cancer, implantation and dysmenorrhoea. In the male, ejaculations keep sperm morphology and semen volume within normal ranges while leukocyte numbers are increased. In the female, with coital vaginal deposition of semen mood enhancement occurs, menstrual cycles are more often of the ovulatory (fertile) type and postmenopausal vaginal atrophy is counteracted.

      "abstract": "Many gynecological and sexological problems (like urine incontinence, chronic pelvic pains, vulvodynia, and lack of lust, excitement, and orgasm) are resistant to standard medical treatment. In our work at the Research Clinic for Holistic Medicine in Copenhagen, we have found that vaginal acupressure, or Hippocratic pelvic massage, can help some of these problems. Technically, it is a very simple procedure as it corresponds to the explorative phase of the standard pelvic examination, supplemented with the patient's report on the feelings it provokes and the processing and integration of these feelings. Sometimes it can be very difficult to control the emotions released by the technique, i.e., regression to earlier traumas from childhood sexual abuse. This review discusses the theory behind vaginal acupressure, ethical aspects, and presentation of a case story. This procedure helped the patient to become present in her pelvis and to integrate old traumas with painful emotions. Holistic gynecology and sexology can help the patient to identify and let go of negative feelings, beliefs, and attitudes related to sex, gender, sexual organs, body, and soul at large. Shame, guilt, helplessness, fear, disgust, anxiety, anger, hatred, and other strong feelings are almost always an important part of a sexual or functional problem as these feelings are “held” by the tissue of the pelvis and sexual organs. Acupressure through the vagina/pelvic massage must be done with great care by an experienced physician, with a third person present, after obtaining consent and the necessary trust of the patient. It must be followed by conversational therapy and further holistic existential processing.",

During this time, balance is also affected, resulting in symptoms like vertigo and unsteadiness. These symptoms can lead to physical impairment and disability and can develop at any time. Vertigo in pregnancy has not been extensively written about. The subject of a narrative review is vertigo in pregnant patients. In pregnant women, hormonal alterations in the peripheral tissues and inner ear organs may contribute to vertigo. Meniere's disease, mild convulsive positional dizziness, and oculomotor migraines are all commonly exacerbated by pregnancy. Between the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, specific modifications to proprioception and hearing are also detected during physical examination. Patients who are pregnant typically experience these symptoms throughout this time. Some vertigo conditions can worsen during pregnancy, while others can appear at any time. Understanding audio-vestibular symptoms' pathological and clinical relationship during pregnancy requires more study.",

Rarely, it may manifest even from the fifth month of pregnancy or postpartum, as well as in the pelvic tilt or sitting positions. Although inferior vena cava compression influenced primarily by the size of the uterus and exact maternal and fetal position, is the major determinant in its development, other factors may also be important in modulating the circulatory effects of such compression. As there seems to be a spectrum of severity from minimal central cardiovascular alterations to severe syncopal shock resulting from supine inferior vena cava compression, it is difficult to define a cut-off point at which the syndrome occurs. This syndrome is a major consideration in dental treatment of a pregnant patient.",

The initial evaluation occurs in the family physician's office and generally does not require urologic or gynecologic evaluation. The basic workup is aimed at identifying possible reversible causes. If no reversible cause is identified, then the incontinence is considered chronic. The next step is to determine the type of incontinence (urge, stress, overflow, mixed, or functional) and the urgency with which it should be treated. These determinations are made using a patient questionnaire, such as the 3 Incontinence Questions, an assessment of other medical problems that may contribute to incontinence, a discussion of the effect of symptoms on the patient's quality of life, a review of the patient's completed voiding diary, a physical examination, and, if stress incontinence is suspected, a cough stress test. Other components of the evaluation include laboratory tests and measurement of postvoid residual urine volume. If the type of urinary incontinence is still not clear, or if red flags such as hematuria, obstructive symptoms, or recurrent urinary tract infections are present, referral to a urologist or urogynecologist should be considered.",

      "abstract": "S tress urinary incontinence (SUI) is the common condition of involuntary urine leakage that occurs when intra-abdominal pressure suddenly increases (e.g., coughing, sneezing, lifting, running).The primary causes of SUI are pregnancy and childbirth, which decrease pelvic muscle tone, but other risk factors are hysterectomy, obesity, menopause, or nerve damage attributable to surgery. 1 SUI negatively affects a woman's quality of life and can lead to embarrassment, social withdrawal, and diminished activity. 2 The clinical standard of care for SUI is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), which can positively affect women with mild-to-moderate SUI symptoms. 3Although PFMT is effective, long-term adherence to training is uncommon.Subsequently, the sustained benefits of PFMT can be negligible, and SUI can become a long-term condition. 4 Pilates exercises improve core and pelvic floor strength 5 and may be executed with breath work.During exhalation, the transversus abdominis and pelvic floor contract, whereas during inhalation, the diaphragm contracts and the pelvic floor lengthens.These synergistic muscles protect and support the lumbopelvic and urogenital structures and their function. 6 Pilates classes have become widely accessible and are relatively inexpensive.Commonly instructed as a group class, Pilates promotes social connectedness and accountability, which can facilitate exercise adherence. 7 Our research objectives were to (1) ascertain the feasibility of a Pilates program (twice weekly, 12 weeks) that emphasized pelvic floor strengthening and (2) determine whether it improved self-reported measures of SUI in women of age 45-70 years.We posited that a community intervention for women with SUI could serve as an affordable accessible complement to clinical care and support long-term sustainable management of SUI.",

In general, they are not recognized till during andrological examination on account of a barren marriage. A transient or permanent inhibition of male fertility by drugs is possible, if one of the following functions interferes: spermatogenesis, sperm maturation within the epididymis, sperm transport, sperm metabolism and motility, semen liquefaction, capacitation, acrosomal reaction, or ovum penetration. Best known is the impairment of spermatogenesis by direct inhibition of the germinal epithelium (antispermatogenic agents: cytostatics, immunosuppressive agents, psychopharmacological compounds, antibiotics) or indirectly by influencing the axis between hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and gonads (hormones: estrogens, gestagens, androgens, anabolics, antiandrogens). Sperm transport may be impaired by neuroleptic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, antihypertensive drugs like guanethidine, and ganglionic blocking agents. Inhibition of sperm motility is possible by antibiotics, psychopharmacological agents, anthelmintics, and beta receptor blockers. In future, it will therefore be necessary to pay more attention to side effects of drugs on male fertility, particularly with regard to patients at the age of reproductiveness.",

      "abstract": "Because abortion is illegal in Senegal, it is not easy to determine its frequency. Women suffering complications of illegal abortions are often unwilling to aid in their own treatment by divulging the means used to induce the abortion. Clandestine abortions are associated with poor hygienic conditions exposing the woman to risk of infection. Abortion operators are often ignorant of elementary notions of genital anatomy and unskilled in gynecological surgery. Death may result in a few minutes from shock or embolism. The operator is unable to take any action because of the illegal status of the abortion. Secondary complications may appear because of local trauma, infection, or from caustic or toxic agents. Hemorrhage may be external and abundant, originating in the cervix, vagina, or uterine cavity. It may occur within the abdominal cavity if an organ is perforated. In both cases surgical treatment may be required to save the woman's life. An infection or a state of toxicity may result from the abortion, or both may occur simultaneously. Infections of varying degrees of seriousness may be localized in the genital organs (pelviperitonitis), spread throughout the abdomen (general peritonitis), or spread throughout the organism. Pelviperitonitis results from performing abortions under septic conditions and from uterine retention of part of the embryo. Symptoms include abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and arrest of intestinal transit. Symptoms are often masked by uninformed use of antibiotics, which allows the infection to spread to the other abdominal organs. Generalized peritonitis results from grave lesions of the genital or intestinal tracts produced by traumatizing instruments. In the absence of medical and surgical treatment, the patient's condition rapidly deteriorates and death ensues. Generalized infection may be due to septicemia, tetanus, or hepatonephritis. Hospitalization in a specialized service is required. Thromboembolic complications may also follow clandestine abortions. Late complications and sequelae may include chronic abdominal pain, menstrual disturbances, secondary sterility, or inability to have sexual relations because of vaginal lesions caused by caustic agents. Later pregnancies may be ectopic, or may spontaneously abort because of cervical lesions caused by trauma. Psychic sequelae may include depression or confusion. Information and contraceptive services should be made available to young girls to prevent illegal abortions. Social legislation should be modified to assist future mothers.",

Haemorrhage between 24 h and 6 weeks post partum is termed \"delayed PPH\". Common causes include retention of gestational products or endometritis. Bleeding can be sudden and profound, resulting in rapid cardiovascular collapse. A case of massive PPH 7 weeks after a caesarean section caused by a pseudoaneurysm of the uterine artery is reported. This case highlights diagnostic and therapeutic issues concerning this rare but potentially life-threatening condition and presents clinical features distinguishing it from other causes of PPH. Delay in diagnosis can result in repeated and catastrophic bleeding.",

It may be caused by a congenital anomaly, an organic lesion, or a functional disorder of the vulva or vagina, or it may be psychic in origin. Although its cause can usually be determined relatively easily, a conditioned reflex created by a preexisting organic lesion, an anatomic malformation, or a deep-seated psychogenic problem producing fear of or aversion to sexual contact may tax the examiner's diagnostic ability. Reassurance, sexual counseling, deconditioning by vaginal dilation, and psychotherapy help most patients overcome dyspareunia. Surgery for the correction of congenital anomalies or the removal of organic lesions is sometimes required, but diligent evaluation to exclude a psychogenic factor for dyspareunia is first advisable.",

      "title": "Addressing Anxiety and Fear during the Female Pelvic Examination",
      "abstract": "To review the anxiety and fear risk factors, pathophysiology, symptoms, screening and diagnosis while highlighting treatment considerations for women undergoing a pelvic examination. Methods: We reviewed the literature pertaining to anxiety and fear surrounding the pelvic examination to help guide health care providers’ on available screening options and to review options for individualized patient management. Results: Anxiety and fear are common before and during the pelvic examination. In fact, the pelvic exam is one of the most common anxiety-provoking medical procedures. This exam can provoke negative physical and emotional symptoms such as pain, discomfort, anxiety, fear, embarrassment, and irritability. These negative symptoms can interfere with preventative health screening compliance resulting in delayed or avoided care and significant health consequences. Conclusion: Assessing women for anxiety related to pelvic examinations may help decrease a delay or avoidance of examinations. Risk factor and symptom identification is also a key component in this. General anxiety questionnaires can help identify women with anxiety related to pelvic examinations. Strategies to reduce anxiety, fear and pain during a pelvic examination should routinely be implemented, particularly in women with high-risk factors or those identified with screening techniques as having anxiety, fear or pain with examinations. Treatment options should be targeted at understanding the patient’s concerns, starting conversations about pelvic examinations early, educating patient’s about the examination and offering the presence of a chaperone or support person. During an examination providers should ensure the patient is comfortable, negative phrases are avoided, the correct speculum size is utilized and proper lubrication, draping, dressing and positioning are performed. Treating underlying gynecologic or mental health conditions, consideration of cognitive behavioral therapy and complementary techniques such as lavender aromatherapy and music therapy should also be considered when appropriate.",

Abstract Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) or premature rupture of membranes (KPSW) is often referred to as premature return of the membrane (PROM) which is defined as the rupture of the membranes before the time of delivery. The rupture of membranes before delivery or dilatation in primiparas is less than 3 cm and in multiparas less than 5 cm. This can occur in pregnancy at term or in preterm pregnancy. In this situation, the risk of infection for mother and child increases. Premature rupture of membranes is an important problem in obstetrics which can also cause infection in mothers and babies and can increase morbidity and mortality in mothers and babies. Excessive activity can trigger premature rupture of the membranes, initially causing His (uterine contractions) or vaginal bleeding. His strength is getting stronger and stronger, followed by the discharge of blood mucus. The bleeding comes from a ruptured blood vessel in the cervical canal when cervical effacement occurs. Sometimes the membranes rupture first before a regular his is present. The purpose of this literature review is to examine more deeply the publication of research results related to the effect of work on the incidence of premature rupture of membranes in pregnant women. The method of writing this literature study is to refer to published articles in national and international journals with topics related to the effect of work on the incidence of premature rupture of membranes in pregnant women and presented in the form of articles. The results of the search for related publication articles overall state that there is a relationship between work and the incidence of premature rupture of the membranes in pregnant women. The conclusion that can be drawn is that there is a relationship between working mothers and the incidence of premature rupture of membranes.",

      "title": "POI: Premature ovarian insufficiency/pregnancy or infertility?",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor,\r\n\r\nPremature ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a condition associated with female infertility that affects approximately 1% of women under the age of 40.[1] It is characterized by amenorrhea, hypoestrogenism and elevated level of gonadotropins. Although the causes of POI are largely unknown, autoimmune diseases, chromosomal abnormalities and environmental factors seem to play an important role in the etiopathology.[2] Most women have normal menstrual history, age of menarche and possible fertility prior the onset of POI symptoms (i.e., vaginal dryness, night sweats, or hot flushes). A definitive diagnosis of POI is difficult to make, and the diagnostic criteria are not always standard.[3] Most clinicians would make the diagnosis based on (i) 3-6 months of amenorrhea, (ii) Follicular Stimulating Hormone (FSH) levels above 40 mIU/ml and (iii) low estrogens levels.[2] In this syndrome, the ovarian failure is not permanent. Indeed, some women experience intermittent and unpredictable ovarian function and in some cases may even conceive spontaneously.[4]\r\n\r\nWe report a case of a 28-year-old woman, who was presented to our infertility unit, with 16 months of primary infertility. Her personal history for previous surgery or other relevant pathologies was negative. Menarche occurred at age of 12, followed by regular menstrual bleeding. At 22, she commenced on birth-control pill that stopped 2 years later. Before starting any treatment, hormonal profile of the couple and a sperm test for the partner were planned. They all resulted normal. After 4 failed intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles, the couple underwent 2 in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles preceded by a karyotype analysis that resulted normal. They both ended with few oocytes retrieved (3 and 1 respectively) and none fertilized. Before all procedures, the patient was stimulated with high doses of recombinant-FSH, followed by daily dose of GnRH antagonist ganirelix when at least two follicles had reached 14 mm diameter. Ovulation triggering was performed using a subcutaneous injection of corio gonadotropin alpha. Five months after the last IVF-cycle, the patient came back referring amenorrhea. Laboratory tests revealed FSH level at 65 and 75 mUI/mL (menopause > 40 mUI/mL), estradiol (E2) at 33 and 26 pg/mL (menopause < 40 pg/mL) and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) at 0.0 ng/mL in two serial determinations. A diagnosis of POI was made. The couple was then listed for oocyte donation. One year later, the patient experienced a menstrual bleeding and a month after a pregnancy test resulted positive. Nine months later a healthy baby was delivered.\r\n\r\nAlthough pregnancy in POI patients is a rare event, it should be always taken into consideration, given the possibility of spontaneous resumption of the ovarian function.",

      "title": "A successful pregnancy by intracytoplasmic sperm injection using ejaculate sperm from an infertile man with 46, XX/46, XY true hermaphrodite",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, True hermaphroditism is a condition in which the gonads, genital morphology, and sexuality simultaneously show both male and female characteristics (ovaries and testes) or in which both types of gonadal tissue exist in a single gonad (known as an ovariotestis). True hermaphroditism associated with a chimeric or 46, XX/46, XY karyotype is extremely rare, and the genitalia of those affected can be characterized as female, male, or mixed.123 The cause of true hermaphroditism has not been determined because the condition is relatively rare and has a diverse phenotype.4 The majority of masculine individuals experience varying degrees of low fertility or sterility because the chimeric karyotype prevents complete development of the male and female gonads, though there are some exceptions.5 Dysfunctional spermatogenesis usually is characterized by severe oligospermia, asthenospermia, or azoospermia. Some masculine individuals experience dyszoospermia, leading to varying degrees of low fertility or sterility,6 which is typically not observed in feminine patients with true hermaphroditism,78 Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is an ideal alternative for true hermaphrodites.9 In 2005, Sugawara et al. reported a case of successful delivery by a woman impregnated through intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) using frozen-thawed sperm obtained by testicular biopsy from an infertile 46, XX/46, XY true hermaphrodite.10 Here, we report a successful pregnancy obtained by ICSI using ejaculate sperm from an infertile man with 46, XX/46, XY true hermaphrodite. The patient described in this manuscript has provided written informed consent to publish this case. In August 2014, a 33-year-old man with his wife attended our infertility clinic. In June 2007, he observed the presence of female breasts and an abnormally small penis compared with that of normal age-matched men. His blood estradiol (E2) level was 193 pg ml−1 (reference range: 20–47 pg ml−1). The patient was preliminarily diagnosed with congenital hypospadias (penile type) and left cryptorchidism, though hermaphroditism was not ruled out. Color Doppler imaging showed normal adrenal glands. Karyotype analysis of peripheral blood using the G-staining method revealed a 46, XX/46, XY chimeric karyotype. Pelvic computed tomography (CT) indicated possible uterine and female reproductive tissue, which was later confirmed by histopathology as uterine tissue with a secretory endometrium, partial polypoid changes, and myometrium; a left ovary with an organized corpus luteum and a fallopian tube. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with true hermaphroditism. In August 2014, the patient and his wife presented to our facility for the treatment of his primary sterility. In ejaculate semen, sperm density was 1.2 × 106 ml−1 with about 28% motility. Sex hormone levels were as follows: FSH, 72.47 mIU ml−1 (reference range, 1.27–19.26 mIU ml−1); LH, 30.47 mIU ml−1 (reference range, 1.24–8.62 mIU ml−1); E2, 29 pg ml−1 (reference range, 1.27–19.26 pg ml−1); T, 3.52 ng ml−1 (reference range, 1.75–7.81 ng ml−1); and PRL, 23.30 ng ml−1 (reference range, 2.64–13.13 ng ml−1). The patient was diagnosed with severe oligospermia, and ICSI was deemed as the only feasible option for conception. Ovulation for his wife was triggered by combined administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist (GnRH-a; Enantone; Takeda Osaka Plant, Osaka, Japan), recombinant FSH (r-FSH; Gonal-F; Serono Laboratory Co. Ltd., Geneva, Switzerland), highly purified menotrophin (HP-HMG; Menopur; Ferring International Center SA, Kiel, Germany), and 250 μg recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (r-HCG; Ovidrel; Serono Laboratory Co. Ltd., Japan). GnRH-a was administered at 0.75 mg on day 4 of menstruation, followed by another 1.875 mg 28 days later. r-FSH and HP-HMG were administered daily until the dominant follicle achieved a mean diameter of 18 mm; subsequently, r-HCG was administered to induce ovulation. A vaginal ultrasound-guided follicular puncture was performed 36 h after r-HCG injection, and seven mature oocytes were retrieved. The patient ejaculated after masturbation on the day of oocyte retrieval. The semen was centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 10 min, and the sperm pellet was re-suspended to 150 μL of medium. Three days after performing ICSI, two embryos were transferred into his wife's uterine. She was prescribed 300 mg oral progesterone to be taken twice daily (Utrogestan; Laboratories Besins International, Montrouge, France) for 12 days and 90 mg of topical 8% progesterone to be applied daily (Crinone; Fleet Laboratories Limited, Watford, England). Her qualitative serum HCG level 12 days after embryo transfer was 206.96 mIU ml−1, which increased to 571.34 mIU ml−1 two days later. At 45 days of gestation, a singleton pregnancy with fetal heartbeat was confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound. At 16 weeks, amniotic fluid analysis was performed with a normal 46, XY fetal karyotype. A healthy male child was delivered. In most cases of the true hermaphroditism, the ovarian structures are completely developed and can secrete estrogen from the onset of puberty. Our patient was identified as a male at birth and was always treated as a boy. However, his feminine breasts, abnormally small penis, and high E2 level suggested hermaphroditism. Several urogenital surgeries resolved his abnormal micturition, and the uterine and other feminine tissues were excised, thus correcting the external and physiologic manifestations of his hermaphroditism. After surgery, his E2 level was normal, and he maintains a consistent physiologic sex and gender. There are several cases involving male hermaphroditic patients associated with successful pregnancy and delivery.10 In cases with azoospermia, sperm may only be obtained by testicular biopsy. In our case, there were some motile sperms found in ejaculate and so ICSI was performed with fresh ejaculate sperm. In summary, a successful clinical pregnancy was obtained by ICSI using ejaculate sperm from an infertile man with 46, XX/46, XY true hermaphrodite. Our report suggests that sperm can be found in ejaculate in some infertile men with true hermaphrodites, and infertile men with this severe infertility condition can be treated by ICSI.

      "title": "Genetic basis for primary ovarian insufficiency",
      "abstract": "Approximately 1% of women under the age of 40 years and 0.1% under the age of 30 years experience “premature menopause” [1]. “Premature menopause” or “premature ovarian failure” (POF) has generally been defined as 4–6 months of amenorrhea in women under the age of 40 years associated with serum gonadotropin concentrations in the postmenopausal range and hypoestrogenism (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism). Depending on the age of onset, the disorder can manifest as failure to enter pubertal development and the associated primary amenorrhea (PA), or secondary amenorrhea (SA) after the onset of menarche and the associated pubertal development [2, 3]. Substantial published evidence has demonstrated that POF may have a long and variable clinical course with the possibility of spontaneous remission and even pregnancy many years after the diagnosis. Therefore, the term primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is now generally accepted as a less stigmatizing term to young women. It is, as well, a more scientifically accurate definition, to describe more clearly a continuum of intermittent and unpredictable ovarian function [4, 5]. The continuum is divided into two categories of clinical states: (1) POI that is overt, meaning that menstrual cycles have become irregular, and (2) POI that is occult (oPOI), meaning that the menstrual cycles are still regular but other evidence supports a conclusion that ovarian function is impaired [5].",

Its potential consequences are numerous and include anal and/or fecal incontinence, sexual problems and perineal pain, which can be aggravated by future pregnancies and childbirth. One common issue after OASI is the assessment of anorectal function to discuss the delivery modalities during the next pregnancy. This dedicated assessment includes a clinical and paraclinical evaluation, with an ultrasound and/or a manometry. This personalized assessment for each patient with a history of sphincter injury allows for a detailed discussion to decide on the route of delivery in an informed manner.La lésion obstétricale du sphincter anal (LOSA) survient lors d’un accouchement vaginal. Ses conséquences potentielles sont l’incontinence anale et/ou fécale, les troubles sexuels et les douleurs périnéales, qui peuvent être aggravés par de futures grossesses et accouchements. Un des enjeux après LOSA est l’évaluation de la fonction anorectale dans le but de discuter les modalités d’accouchement lors de(s) prochaine(s) grossesse(s). Elle comprend une évaluation clinique et paraclinique spécialisée, incluant l’échographie et/ou la manométrie. Cette évaluation personnalisée pour chaque patiente avec antécédent de lésion sphinctérienne permet une discussion circonstanciée pour décider de la voie d’accouchement de manière éclairée.",

      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhea, or painful menstruation, is a common gynecological condition affecting more than half of all women. This chapter presents a study whose purpose was to investigate responsiveness to laboratory-induced pain in dysmenorrheic and nondysmenorrheic women over the course of the menstrual cycle. Sixty-five introductory psychology students volunteered for this study for course credit. Subjects were categorized as dysmenorrheic or nondysmenorrheic, according to their response to a question about the presence or absence of menstrual pain/cramps. The normal and regular 28-day menstrual cycle is usually divided into four phases: the menstrual phase, the follicular phase, the luteal and the premenstrual phase. Pain judgment in dysmenorrhea, as investigated in this study, does not lend itself to interpretation in terms of the adaptation levels model or the hypervigilance model. Dysmenorrheic women were neither less sensitive nor more sensitive than nondysmenorrheic women in their experience of cold pressor pain.",

Amenorrhea of 6-12 months' duration in a 50-year-old woman almost always indicates menopause. The diagnosis can be confirmed if there are accompanying hot flashes or through cytological study of vaginal mucosa. Patients in their 40s taking oral contraceptives (OCs) should continue them as long as they are needed. A t age 50 they may be stopped to determine if menopause has started. During this time other means of contraception should be used. OCs may be continued if menstruation occurs although pregnancy after the age of 50 is rare, even in apparently ovulating women. If the woman remains amenorrheic after stopping OCs, menopause may be presumed.",

      "title": "Uterovaginal prolapse in a primigravida presenting in active first stage of labor: a case report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Uterovaginal prolapse is the descent of the uterus and vagina down the birth canal toward the introitus. The occurrence of uterovaginal prolapse in a primigravida is very rare. It can cause preterm labor, fetal demise, spontaneous abortion, postpartum hemorrhage, maternal urinary complications, sepsis, and death. This case report presents the rare occurrence of uterovaginal prolapse in a primigravida woman with no major risk factors identified for prolapse, who presented in active first stage of labor and delivered vaginally. Case presentation A 30-year-old Oromo primigravida woman who did not remember her last normal menstrual period but claimed amenorrhea of 9 months duration presented with the urge to bear down of 12 hours duration and passage of liquor of 8 hours duration. She was referred from the local health center to Jimma Medical Center with a diagnosis of prolonged labor. At presentation, she was in active first stage of labor with cervix 5–6 cm and fetal heartbeat was negative. She was followed for the progress of labor, and 4 hours after admission to the labor ward, she delivered a freshly dead male neonate weighing 3000 g. Her postpartum period was uneventful, and she was discharged on her third postpartum day and referred after 6 weeks to the outpatient department. Conclusion Uterovaginal prolapse occurring in primigravida and during labor at first recognition is very rare, with congenital weakness being a possible underlying pathology. Management of uterovaginal prolapse during labor should be individualized on the basis of fetal condition and the severity of prolapse. For a patient with pelvic organ prolapse in labor, expectant management is a good option when there is no severe edema resulting in obstructed labor, as in our case, where the patient delivered vaginally and the prolapse resolved postpartum.",

      "abstract": "Midwives play an important role in providing instructions on sexual activities and birth control during pregnancy and postpartum. The appropriate time and place for such instructions will take place at outpatient clinics at the time of pregnancy tests, monthly check-ups during pregnancy, postpartum check-ups, check-ups following abortions and miscarriages. Public health rooms and expectant mothers' classes are also good candidates for providing such instructions. The instructions aim at equipping the public with basic knowledge of family planning and protecting them from fear, inhibition, and abuse stemming from ignorance and misconceptions. Specifically the following information is often sought. Sexual activities during pregnancy should be in moderation but abstinence is not necessary under normal circumstances until after \"dropping,\" and they may be resumed only after the 1 month postpartum check-up. The absence of menstruation and/or lactation after child births does not guarantee freedom from pregnancy. Therefore, the couples should discuss family planning in advance possibly during the 1st trimester of pregnancy. Careful consideration should be given in cases of pregnancy combined with chronic illnesses or multiple health problems. Some of the problems in carrying out these instructions are as follows: taboo about discussing sex openly, midwives' insensitivity to the needs and right timing for such discussions, lack of husband's participation, women's insensitivity to male sexuality, and lack of communication in obstetrics and other areas of medicine.",

After a woman's reproductive years, there is a 5- to 10-year period of menopause-related alterations in hormone patterns. These patterns terminate in a sharp decline of female hormone levels. The lack of ovarian estrogens appears to be associated with the onset of several postmenopausal diseases, most notably osteoporosis and heart disease. Oral discomfort has been reported as a complaint among postmenopausal women. It includes occurrences of pain, burning sensations, altered taste perception and dryness of the mouth. On this background this paper presents a review on the postmenopausal discomfort in women.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Pregnancy and the postpartum are generally characterized by positive feelings and expectations but they may also disguise maternal stress and difficulties. These are typical periods for the onset or relapse of psychiatric symptoms and disorders. Even though suicide during pregnancy and postpartum is rare, it is among the leading causes of maternal perinatal mortality. Objectives To provide an overview on the risk of suicide during pregnancy and postpartum. Methods PubMed database was searched using combinations of the terms “suicide”, combined with “pregnancy” and “depression”. Results The major risk factors for suicidal ideation are previous suicide attempts, self-harm, current or past history of psychiatric disorder, young maternal age, being unmarried, an unplanned pregnancy, substance use disorders, lack effective psychosocial support and discontinuation of psychotropic drugs. Pregnant women with suicidality behavior have also an increased risk for various adverse obstetric outcomes, including miscarriage, preterm delivery, maternal hemorrhage, and stillbirth. Furthermore, the postpartum period is often associated with the onset of mood and psychotic disorders with an increased risk of both suicide and infanticide. Women who have suffered from serious psychiatric conditions either after childbirth or in other phases of life should be informed about the possibility of relapse after subsequent pregnancies, thus presenting a higher risk of suicide. Conclusions During pregnancy and postpartum, it is fundamental to investigate suicide risk, including suicidal ideation, thoughts, and intent, especially (but not only) in women affected by mental pathology. Moreover, maternal suicide behaviour affects the child’s neuropsychological development and can also increase the infant´s suicide risk. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

XIV, H. 8), studying the effect of various poisons and medicines on the surviving tubes, round ligaments and the uterus of a rabbit in various generative phases: immature, mature, at the beginning and at the end of pregnancy and in the postpartum period .. F. comes to the conclusion that adrenaline, pilocarpine, quinine, nicotine, pituitrin, etc. not only have a different effect on the tested organs in connection with different physiological moments , but the same drug at the same time has a different effect on the tubes, round ligaments and uterus. The action of the drug is expressed either by excitement (E), then by inhibition (H), then the drug remains without effect on the organs (0). Pilocarpine is produced at lig. rotunda in all: stages of inhibition (H), on the tubes weak excitement, on the uterus there is always strong excitement. Pituitrin in ligg. rot. in the late stages of pregnancy produces N., in the uterus E., does not act on the tubes (0). Adrenaline on ligg. rot. and pipes in the immature period almost always has an effect E, on the uterus in the postpartum period H. Based on the results of experiments with adrenaline and pilocarpine, the author comes to the conclusion that ligg. rotunda and tubes are equipped with two kinds of sympathetic fibers, and at an immature age, inhibitory fibers are more sensitive than excitatory, during pregnancy, the relationship is reversed. In addition, due to the loss of reaction with pilocarpine (H. - ligg. Rot. And pipes), it can be assumed that the parasympathetic fibers are either little sensitive, or there are fewer of them in the pipes and ligg. rot., than in the uterus, and maybe they are completely absent. Since physostigmine, in contrast to pilocarpine, always excites, the author suggests that, in addition to the effect on the nerves, there is also the effect of these funds on the muscle.",

Specifically in the male, the onset of sexual differentiation is signaled by the elaboration of an androgenlike material (possibly testosterone) and a Mullerian-inhibiting factor from the testis. In the absence of these two influences, or one of them, the reproductive tract remains essentially female in configuration, a normal situation in the female and in abnormal males in which the urogenital sinus and Wolffian structures are incapable of hormonal responses due to the lack of specific enzymes or receptors. Male differentiation in particular involves enlargement of the penis and its canalization by the urethra, scrotal development and descent of the testis, and the formation of accessory glandular structures from the urogenital sinus or Wolffian ducts (bulbourethral gland, seminal vesicles, ampulla, prostate). Remnants of the Mullerian system may persist at the upper pole of the testis and are normally present (uterus masculinus) in relation to the prostatic part of the urethra.The emergence of the characteristic parts of the male reproductive system in higher mammals in relation to phylogeny and the detailed origin of these in individual ontogeny are described. The use of the guinea pig as a model animal system for the study of transplacental effects of hormones (diethylstilbestrol, estradiol) and teratogens is briefly discussed.",

There is evidence that somatic dysmenorrhea is caused by action of progesterone upon the uterus. And there is indication also that the cause may lie in some abnormality of the cervix or abnormal effect upon it.\r\n\r\nTraditional association of menstruation with “illness,” “curse” and the like is indicative of the psychic roots of dysmenorrhea. It has been observed that there is striking parallel between dysmenorrhea in adulthood and psychological maladjustment in childhood. Cure of psychogenic dysmenorrhea may be difficult. Proper anticipation—emotional preparation of the girl from infancy on, then sound instruction in biologic fact—would seem to be a major means of prevention.",

      "abstract": "Neonaticide, or the killing of an infant within the first month of life, presents many difficulties for pathologists and courts. Births are often concealed and the victims' bodies hidden. Pathological findings tend to be nonspecific, particularly where deaths have been caused by suffocation, drowning, or failure to provide adequate care and support of newly born infants. Determination of live or stillbirth may not be possible in cases of concealed births as independent witnesses are usually not available to verify mothers' histories. Whereas changes of maceration indicate intrauterine death, a vital reaction in the umbilical cord stump with milk within the stomach indicates survival for some time after birth. The latter findings will not, however, be present in most deaths that typically occur soon after delivery. Failure to demonstrate inflation of lungs or gas within the stomach does not exclude live birth, and conversely such aeration may occur from resuscitation or postmortem putrefaction. The flotation test is an unreliable indicator of prior respiration. Lack of precise pathological markers for live birth, and/or cause of death, often precludes definitive statements about the manner of death. Stillbirth cannot be excluded in cases where considerable doubts exist.",

      "title": "Anxiety and depression in patients with endometriosis: impact and management challenges",
      "abstract": "Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological diseases and affects ~10% of women in reproductive age. The most common clinical signs of endometriosis are menstrual irregularities, chronic pelvic pain (CPP), dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia and infertility. Symptoms of endometriosis often affect psychological and social functioning of patients. For this reason, endometriosis is considered as a disabling condition that may significantly compromise social relationships, sexuality and mental health. Considering this point, the aim of this narrative review is to elucidate the impact of anxiety and depression in the management of women with endometriosis. Psychological factors have an important role in determining the severity of symptoms, and women who suffer from endometriosis report high levels of anxiety, depression and other psychiatric disorders. In addition, endometriosis is one of the most important causes of CPP; women with endometriosis suffer from a wide range of pelvic pain such as dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, nonmenstrual (chronic) pelvic pain, pain at ovulation, dyschezia and dysuria. Several studies have underlined the influence of CPP on quality of life and psychological well-being of women with endometriosis. Data suggest that the experience of pelvic pain is an important component of endometriosis and may significantly affect emotive functioning of affected women. It has been demonstrated that high levels of anxiety and depression can amplify the severity of pain. Further studies are needed to better understand the relationship between psychological factors and perception of pain. Treatment of endometriosis may be hormonal or surgical. Surgery is the primary treatment for more severe forms of endometriosis. There are few data in the literature about the influence of psychological factors and psychiatric comorbidities on the effectiveness of treatments. It is important to evaluate the presence of previous psychiatric diseases in order to select the most appropriate treatment for the patient.",

The uterine activity of women taking Lyndiol Orgametrial and Duphaston was recorded via a small vinyl catheter filled with a heparine-saline solution and connected to an Elma 490 A pressure transducer and a Siemans 1-channel Compensograph inkwriter. Laborlike contractions were observed during menstruation. The contractions increased during the proliferative phase. A typical pattern of uterine contraction consisting of a high frequency and low intensity was observed during the ovulatory phase. The lowest pressure recordings between contractions in the ovulatory phase were lowered as the pattern came to resemble the premenstrual phase. Basal pressures often exceeded 20 mm Hg during the ovulatory phase. The typical ovulatory pattern was not observed during Lyndiol treatment; rather a premenstrual phase or laborlike pattern occurred. Patterns recorded during the postmenopausal state were similar to those obtained during contraceptive medication. The results support the hypothesis that gestagens may owe part of their effectiveness to a form of myometrial dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Summary. Pregnancy and pseudopregnancy both failed in a high proportion of mice when the recently mated female was housed with or near strange males, particularly males of a different strain, or when she was housed with a castrated male. In these circumstances, the female returned to oestrus 4 to 5 days after the original mating and implantation did not take place. The use of genetically marked test males of a different strain from the stud males showed that superfoetation did not occur. By contrast, pregnancy was not blocked when the female was returned to her own stud male after being separated from him for 24 hr, or when she was kept in the presence of other females. The evidence suggests that the presence of other females may even help towards stabilizing a pregnancy. The histology of the ovaries from females having blocked pregnancies showed a varying degree of pituitary-gonadotrophin stimulation. The fate of the blastocyst from the first mating remains as yet undetermined.",

Se debe entender el parto como “experiencia de parto”, siendo un proceso unico, complejo y multidimensional, estrechamente relacionado con el nacimiento de un bebe sano, y el proceso fisico y mental del parto que culmina con la adopcion del rol de madre. Durante el proceso de analisis, de los articulos revisados, se ha comprobado que las emociones que mas frecuentemente aparecen son: el dolor, el miedo, el temor o el sentido del control. Y todas estas emociones seran utilizadas por la mujer como determinantes para la genesis de una experiencia de parto positiva o negativa. Una experiencia positiva esta relacionada con altos niveles de confianza, afianzamiento en el desempeno del nuevo rol, una lactancia eficaz y servira para definir las expectativas para futuros embarazos y partos. Mientras, una experiencia de parto negativa, puede inducir a la depresion postparto, al estres postraumatico, a posibles problemas de pareja o familiares y problemas con posteriores partos.  El objetivo de esta monografia es conocer el concepto de experiencia de parto, conocer los sentimientos que se generan en la madre.

This article not only offers how the process of normal human childbirth is if not it also shows a wide definition of de concept of childbirth. It is necessary to understand the birth as “an experience childbird” because it is an unique, complex and multidimensional process, which is closely associated  with the delivery of a healthy baby and the physical and mental process that ends up with taking on the roll of being mother.  During the review process it has been verified that the most frequent emotions which appear in the birth are: pain, fear, worry and the sense of control sense. All these feelings will be used by the woman as determinants for the development of a positive or negative birth experience. A positive experience is related to: High-levels of confidence. Reinforcement the performance of the new role. An effective breastfeeding.  This will serve to define the expectations for future pregnancies and childbirths. While, a negative experience can cause: Postpartum depression. Post-traumatic stress. Potential marital or relatives. Problems in later deliveries. The aim of this monograph is to know the concept of experience childbirth and about the feelings mother’s.

The bouts of crying are generally thought to be triggered by abdominal colic (over-inflation of the still immature gastrointestinal tract), and treatment is prescribed accordingly. According to this line of reasoning, excessive crying is harmless and resolves by the end of the third month without long-term consequences. However, there is evidence that it may cause tremendous distress in the mother-infant relationship, and can lead to disorders of behavioral and emotional regulation at the toddler stage (such as sleep and feeding disorders, chronic fussiness, excessive clinginess, and temper tantrums). Early treatment of excessive crying focuses on parent-infant communication, and parent-infant interaction in the context of soothing and settling the infant to sleep is a promising approach that may prevent later behavioral and emotional disorders in infancy.

      "abstract": "Menstrual patterns can be an indicator of overall health and self-perception of well-being. Amenorrhoea is the absence of menses in women of reproductive agewhich may be primary or secondary. Primary amenorrhoea refers to the absence of menarche at the age of 16 and secondary amenorrhoea is the cessation of menses for at least 6 months in already cycling women. Secondary amenorrhoea is more common than primary amenorrhea. Ihtibas al-Tamth (amenorrhoea) is defined in the Unani system of medicine as the absence of monthly bleeding for more than 2 months or a decrease in the quantity of menstrual blood. The etiologies of amenorrhoea may be considered categorically as outflow tract abnormalities, primary ovarian insufficiency, hypothalamic or pituitary disorders, other endocrine gland disorders, sequelae of chronic disease, physiologic, or induced. The causes of Ihtibas al-Tamth are related to Quwwat Dafia al-Badan, Madda and Johar Khun-i-Hayd, or Ala Makhraj -i-Hayd. Su’-i-Mizaj Barid, Yabis, Harr or Harr wa Yabis, Su’-i-Mizaj Maddi or Sada can lead to Du’f al-Quwwat-i-Dafia. Abnormality in quality and quantity of Madda in Su’-i-Mizaj Maddi can also lead to ihtibas al-tamth. Amenorrhoea is not a diagnosis but a symptom indicating anatomical, genetic and neuroendocrine abnormalities. It can be determined by two different groups of causes: (a) anatomical defects of the genital organs; (b) endocrine dysfunctions. Both congenital and acquired anomalies in the structure of the uterus and vagina could produce amenorrhoea; nevertheless, in most patients, amenorrhoea is related to an ovarian malfunction. Symptoms usually associated with amenorrhoea are headache, nausea, back ache and lower abdominal pain, tiredness, and some respiratory problems. Main principle of treatment includes Tawleed-i-Dam, Tanqiya-i-Akhlat Ghaleeza, Talteef-i-Khilt, Tafteeh-i-Uruq Raham and Tahzeel if obesity is the cause. Surgical intervention if hymen is imperforated. Some regimenal therapies are also beneficial in amenorrhoea, such as Fasd-i-Safin, Hammam-i-Murattib and Hijama-i-Nariya on calf area. Some Unani drugs, which are beneficial in amenorrhoea, are Habb-i-Mudir, Safoof-i-Baboona, Kushta Faulad, and Safoof Muhazzil. In the present scenario, it is utmost important to educate the patients to live a healthy and hygienic life and to avoid those factors which cause amenorrhoea.",

      "abstract": "Several diseases of the female bladder are accompanied by stress incontinence or some other form of incontinence. By using micturition cystourethrography, visualizing the bladder in lateral views, with simultaneous recording of micturition pressure and flow, a distinction may be made between the individual diseases, as they often exhibit characteristic radiological configurations and urodynamic patterns. It is also possible, by comparing with measurements in control material, to decide the best physiological method of abolishing the incontinence. This method of examination has proved particularly suitable in cases with a history of unsuccessful operation for incontinence. Stress incontinence has been found to be associated mainly with descent of the bladder, a reduced urethral resistance, and cystoceles; it also occurs as a sequel to radical operations on the true pelvis and in a number of neurological diseases. In practically all cases it has been possible to abolish incontinence by the following surgical plan: descent of the bladder to be treated by colpoperineoplasty, reduced urethral resistance and incontinence following radical hysterectomy or extirpation of the rectum by colposuspension, and cystoceles by reduction of the cystocele and colpoperineoplasty.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review To evaluate recent evidence regarding gender differences in sleep. Recent findings Women have better sleep quality compared with men, with longer sleep times, shorter sleep-onset latency and higher sleep efficiency. Despite this, women have more sleep-related complaints than men. The amount of slow-wave sleep decreases with age in men and women. Normal physiologic periods, including puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause, are associated with alterations in sleep patterns. Gender differences in normal sleep may underlie the observed differences in risk of sleep disorders. Studies of insomnia support a female predominance, with increased divergence of prevalence between men and women with older age. Recent findings for the gender differences in obstructive sleep apnea have focused on differences in local neuromuscular reflexes and central ventilatory control. Restless legs syndrome has a slight female predominance, whereas rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and Kleine–Levin syndrome are more common in men. Summary Gender differences in sleep become apparent after the onset of puberty. Menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and menopause can alter sleep architecture. Gender-related differences in sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, and restless legs syndrome, include differences in prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and response to therapy.",

      "title": "Advancing menopause care in Australia: barriers and opportunities",
      "abstract": "Lack of clinician knowledge, poor access to services, negative attitudes, and lagging research have led to substandard menopause-related health care Hot flushes and night sweats, low wellbeing, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and disturbed sleep are common symptoms. Moderate to severely bothersome hot flushes/night sweats are experienced by 28% of post-menopausal women younger than 55 years2 (Box 1). Yet despite readily available, safe menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and non-hormonal interventions, over 85% of Australian women with bothersome symptoms are not receiving effective, approved therapy.5 Although over 50% of post-menopausal women have vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms (vaginal dryness, itching, burning, dyspareunia, and urinary symptoms), fewer than 7% are prescribed effective, safe vaginal oestrogen therapy.5 Menopause causes accelerated net bone loss. This commences about two years before the final menstrual period in naturally menopausal women, peaking about two years after menopause,6 setting the stage for the development of osteoporosis and fragility fracture. In Australia, post-menopausal MHT is approved for the prevention of bone mineral density loss as well as for symptom relief. First line management of menopause-associated issues should be occurring at the level of primary care, yet menopause is not among the top 15 conditions most frequently managed by GPs.7 Our research has shown that GPs, gynaecologists and pharmacists understand that some women have severe symptoms that may last many years.8 However, GPs and specialists mostly lack the skills and confidence in managing menopause, and frequently recommend unproven and mostly ineffective complementary and alternative medicines before prescribing MHT or effective non-hormonal therapy.8 Concurrently, Australian women rely on self-help and complementary and alternative medicines to manage menopausal symptoms, as they view MHT negatively, with concerns about cancer risk and overprescription.9 Furthermore, most women are unaware that menopause is associated with bone loss or that it affects their cardiometabolic health.9 Contributing to this health care knowledge gap are two decades of widespread dissemination of conflicting, and often frightening, information about menopause treatment, and omission of menopause from most undergraduate and post-graduate medical and allied health training. Thus, state-of-the-art menopause care is not available to most Australian women. Meanwhile, treatment options and recommended prescribing have changed. After publication of the early findings of the Women's Health Initiative Study, the strong recommendation was that MHT use be limited to five years.10 This has been superseded. The current guidance is not time-limited but the duration of therapy should be based on an individual's symptoms and personal risk–benefit evaluation.11 Unfortunately, Australian prescribing information has not caught up and continues to recommend women receive treatment for the shortest duration. Consequently, the authors' experience is that many women are incorrectly told they must cease MHT after five years, including women with premature ovarian insufficiency, who should be using MHT at least until the age of 50 years.12 With respect to hormone therapy, the general leaning is now towards transdermal oestrogen (specifically as oestradiol), as observational data indicate that non-oral oestrogen confers a lower risk of venous thromboembolic events (VTE) than oral therapy.13 Thus, diabetes, smoking and overweight and obesity are considered indications for non-oral oestrogen.1 However, for women at low VTE risk, the absolute difference in risk between low to standard dose oral (≤ 1 mg/day) and non-oral oestradiol (≤ 50 μg/day) appears small.13 Concurrently, progesterone and dydrogesterone are now viewed as the preferred progestogens for endometrial protection for women with a uterus using oestrogen therapy.14 This has been driven by studies suggesting progesterone may have a better cardiovascular safety profile than other progestogens,15 and observational data indicate that less than five years of oestrogen with either progesterone or dydrogesterone is not associated with increased breast cancer risk.16 However, clinicians need to be aware that major cardiac event data for these progestogens are lacking and breast cancer risk beyond five years remains uncertain.16 In addition, the evidence for adequate endometrial protection is limited to standard dose continuous progesterone (100 mg/day) or cyclical progesterone (200 mg for at least 12 days per month) paired with oral oestrogen (≤ 1 mg)17 and conjugated oestrogens (0.625 mg).18 Standard dose progesterone may not provide endometrial protection for women requiring high dose oestrogen therapy, and caution in that context is advised. So, although progesterone and dydrogesterone may be safer progestogens for women needing combined MHT, clinicians should not overstate the cardiovascular or breast safety of these preparations and exert considerable caution when prescribing standard dose progesterone with high dose oestrogen until more data are available. For symptomatic women choosing not to take (or unable to take) MHT, several prescribed non-hormonal therapies are available, but all are substantially less effective than MHT.1 Fezolinetant, a selective neurokinin 3B receptor antagonist that acts in the brain to reduce vasomotor symptom frequency and severity, is presently under consideration for approval for this purpose in the United States.1 Estetrol, a novel oestrogen produced by the fetal liver, is also being evaluated for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, and holds promise as a new treatment option. Estetrol has neutral lipid effects and does not appear to have significant procoagulant effects.19 A troubling time for many women is the menopause transition, when menstruation is erratic, symptoms fluctuate, and contraception is often required. At this time, oestradiol-containing combined oral contraceptives (COCs) can provide cycle control, contraception, and symptom relief. Alternatively, the newly available COC that contains estetrol and drospirenone may offer symptom relief with potential, but yet to be established, lower VTE risk than other COCs.20 An off-label alternative, when oral oestrogen is contraindicated (eg, high VTE risk, migraine with aura), is the drospirenone (progestogen-only) oral contraceptive to inhibit ovulation combined with transdermal oestradiol for symptom relief. Presently, Australia is the only country in the world with an approved testosterone formulation specifically for women. Its prescribing indication is in line with the evidence of efficacy of transdermal testosterone for the treatment of post-menopausal women with low sexual desire associated with personal distress (hypoactive sexual desire disorder).21 Important caveats on the evidence are that studies supporting efficacy were of testosterone preparations that resulted in blood levels that approximated physiological concentrations of pre-menopausal women, as opposed to supraphysiological dosing, and that most studies excluded women with major morbidities, such as concurrent depression and antidepressant use.21 However, one study has shown benefit of transdermal testosterone for women with antidepressant-emergent hypoactive sexual desire disorder.22 Despite public opinion being expressed to the contrary, evidence from randomised, placebo-controlled trials that testosterone will improve mood, wellbeing, musculoskeletal health or cognitive function remains lacking.21 Internationally, there is agreement that testosterone should not be prescribed for any symptoms, including low mood or depressive symptoms, or any condition other than hypoactive sexual desire disorder in post-menopausal women without new evidence.23 Education is key to improving the lives of women at menopause and beyond. This can be achieved with public information campaigns, improved sexual and reproductive health education and accurate information in the media. Evidence-based education reduces fear and stigma for women and equips them to optimise their health at menopause. Another potential setting for menopause education is in the workplace. Ideally, women at perimenopause or menopause should have a comprehensive assessment in primary care, including evaluation and management of risk of future diseases, updating relevant screening activities and offering appropriate lifestyle advice. For women with symptoms, an individualised discussion about MHT and other treatment options should occur. However, menopausal women have been underserved in Australia, and many struggle to access appropriate assessment and treatment.9 This is due to a combination of lack of education of health professionals and poor access to appropriate services that urgently needs to be addressed (Box 2).8 In addition, poor clinical care at menopause is limited by the existence of structural barriers to long consultations in general practice. The Medicare system incentivises short consultations for simple issues. Due to underfunding and staff shortages, GPs are under pressure to increase throughput and find it increasingly difficult to offer longer appointments. This especially affects patients in rural or disadvantaged areas. Another barrier to patient-centred comprehensive menopause care is the lack of integration of health services in primary care. Nurses and allied health practitioners, such as physiotherapists, exercise physiologists, dietitians and psychologists, can play an important role in promoting health at menopause. Current systems make it difficult or expensive for patients to access these practitioners. Specialist menopause clinics or accredited menopause practitioners may improve access to treatment, particularly for women with complex care needs. However, most clinical care of women at menopause will continue to occur in general practice, and GPs need to be educated and supported to fulfil this role. Further research is needed in areas such as the safety of MHT and the role of hormones in treatment of mood disorders at perimenopause and menopause. The impact of menopause on women's work engagement in Australia is not known. Research is also needed to determine the impact of menopause on employment and the work performance of women in paid and unpaid employment, including roles as carers and volunteers. Equally important is an understanding of the impact of menopause on workplace retention or as a potential barrier to engagement in paid or unpaid work. This information is essential before evidence-based and effective workplace policies around menopause can be developed and implemented.

      "title": "Differentiation of sexual behaviour in pigs.",
      "abstract": "Behaviour in pigs is sexually dimorphic as early as 1 month of age; mounting of penmates is observed more frequently for males than for females. This mounting reaches its highest frequency during the 2nd month of life and then declines to a low frequency in prepubertal pigs. During the prepubertal period (3-5 months of age), bipotentiality of sexual behaviour is apparent in boars because they will not only mount oestrous females but they are also receptive to mounts by older, mature boars. If males are castrated during neonatal development (first 2 months of life) and treated acutely with oestrogen during adulthood, they display sexual behaviour that is characteristic of females; i.e. show a selective preference to remain near mature boars in a choice test, are receptive to mounts by mature boars, and have a short latency to receptivity after contact with a mature boar. Males that are castrated at 6 months of age or later, or males that are castrated neonatally and treated chronically with oestrogen or testosterone during the prepubertal period, display significantly less female behaviour after acute oestrogen treatment than do males castrated neonatally. Additionally, exposure of females to elevated testosterone during early fetal development results in no detectable changes in oestrous behaviour as adults. These observations support the hypothesis that defeminization of sexual behaviour in boars occurs as a result of elevated testicular steroids during pubertal development. The limited data available on masculine sexual behaviour in pigs indicate an activational role for gonadal steroids with little evidence for true masculinization per se. After prolonged testosterone treatment of mature females or males that are castrated before puberty, considerable courtship and mounting behaviours are exhibited by these individuals when placed with oestrous females. Studies have not evaluated differential sensitivity of such animals to dosage or duration of testosterone treatment. Differentiation of sexual behaviour in boars therefore involves primarily a loss of sensitivity to display female-typical behaviours. Presently, pigs differ from other mammals that have been investigated because sexual differentiation of reproductive behaviour occurs during pubertal development and not during gestation.",

Women with DKA in pregnancy typically present with generalized malaise, weakness, nausea, vomiting, polyuria, polydipsia, abdominal pain, tachypnea, and signs of dehydration. Expected physiological changes of thyroid function during pregnancy are important to understand in order to interpret physiologic versus pathologic derangements. Adrenal insufficiency is more commonly diagnosed during the puerperium rather than earlier in pregnancy, in part due to the similar symptoms of pregnancy including nausea, fatigue, and increased pigmentation.

      "abstract": "The pathogenesis of uterine leiomyoma is controversial. Studies on the development of smooth muscle cells in the endoderm-derive ducts (digestive and urinary tracts) and in the mesoderm-derived ducts (mullerian duct) during the fetal period revealed that the development of smooth muscle in the mesoderm-derived ducts (until at least 30 weeks of gestation) is slower than that of smooth muscle in the endoderm-derived ducts (until 12 weeks of gestation). The undifferentiated cells which proliferate and differentiate into smooth muscle in the uterus during the fetal period thus have a longer duration of unstable period being affected by many maternal environmental factors such as sex steroids and/or growth factors. The undifferentiated cells affected by some unknown maternal factors during the fetal period probably become the progenitor cells of leiomyomas. The progenitor cells of leiomyomas probably reside in the myometrium and begin to grow after menarche, and thrive during the years of greatest ovarian activity under the hormonal influence of both estrogen and progesterone, and following the menopause, with regression of ovarian steroids, growth of leiomyomas usually ceases. The growth pattern of leiomyomas indicates that LH-RH analogue, which induces temporal regression of ovarian steroids, becomes one of candidates for the conservative treatment of uterine leiomyomas. However, if we may treat leiomyomas with drugs, the definite diagnosis of uterine leiomyoma is essential. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful diagnostic method for uterine leiomyomas. MRI gives us an information of the location and numbers of leiomyoma in the uterus. Moreover, it also informs us the characteristics of leiomyomas.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

The mother's heart rate, arterial blood pressure, systolic ejection fraction and cardiac output undergo the same changes during exercise in the pregnant and non-pregnant patient. The increase in the fetal heart rate during maternal physical exercise does not adversely affect the fetal outcome. The uterine blood flow is diminished during exercise. The respiratory rate increases equally in pregnant and non-pregnant women. The maternal response to effort is also modified by weight gain during pregnancy, by changes in the musculo-skeletal system, and by maternal temperature control during exercise. Weight gain, uterine contractility, duration of pregnancy, labour and neo-natal conditions are not altered by sport during pregnancy. Contra-indications to sport during pregnancy include threatened premature labour, and conditions associated with an increased risk of prematurity. A previous history of fetal growth retardation, acute fetal distress, or the presence of diabetes or arterial hypertension is a contra-indication to sport during pregnancy. The advice which should be given to a pregnant woman wishing to continue her sporting activities during pregnancy is outlined.",

Es descrito como una crisis vital, a la cual contribuyen muchos factores, y se traduce en un gran desgaste emocional, por su caracter ciclico. Se repite una y otra vez la vivencia de esperanza (al inicio del ciclo) y fracaso (cuando llega la menstruacion). Impacta el elevado costo economico del tratamiento, el sometimiento a procesos quirurgicos y la invasion a la privacidad sexual. En parejas infertiles se han encontrado sentimientos de inadecuacion, desesperacion, pena, envidia y celos hacia la mujer embarazada, miedo, perdida de la libido, disfuncion erectil, inestabilidad emocional, perdida de la autoestima, culpa, depresion e ideacion suicida. Se han descrito trastornos psicosomaticos, represion de las reacciones emocionales, deseo frenetico de adoptar un hijo rapidamente o incorporarse a algun programa de fertilizacion asistida. Luego del fracaso terapeutico, desenlace habitual (70%), el 50% de las parejas presenta alguna alteracion psicologica importante. Los autores revisan la literatura reciente sobre el tema y subrayan la necesidad de la participacion activa de los profesionales de la salud mental junto a los equipos de medicina reproductiva",

      "abstract": "Uterine inversion is a potentially life-threatening complication of childbirth that occurs between one in 2148 and one in 6407 births. There is little published information on the pathophysiology or anesthetic management of this problem [1]. The cause of acute uterine inversion is usually reported as mismanagement of the third stage of labor, with premature traction on the umbilical cord and/or fundal pressure before the placenta has separated. Other factors that have been implicated include nulliparity; use of magnesium sulfate during labour; manual removal of the placenta after vaginal delivery or at Caesarean section before complete placental separation [2].",

      "title": "Spontaneous erection and masturbation in equids.",
      "abstract": "Spontaneous erection accompanied by ‘masturbation’ occurs in equids. Spontaneous erection involves extension of the penis from the prepuce with engorgement to its full length and rigidity, in a nonsexual context. Masturbation involves rhythmic bouncing, pressing or sliding of the erect penis against the abdomen achieved by rhythmic contraction of the ischiocavemosus muscles and/or pelvic thrusting. The significance and regulation.of these behaviours are not well understood. Spontaneous erection and masturbation in equids have been viewed traditionally as aberrant behaviours resulting from regimentation or restricted activity of captive or domestic existence or, alternatively, a ‘venting’ of sexual frustration, either from inherent hypersexuality or from thwarted access to heterosexual activity. Often it is assumed that masturbation limits the potential fertility of a stallion by depleting sperm reserves and sexual energy. This report summarizes a series of studies of spontaneous erection and masturbation in equids in a number of different management and breeding environments.",

      "abstract": "Menopause is a natural biological process, but the physical symptoms such as hot flashes and certain emotional symptoms may disturb the sleep, lower down energy and affect the emotional health. The menopause begins with the Perimenopause during which skipping periods is common and expected. The periods may skip for couple of months and start over again or may be absent for a year and start again. Periods often tend to happen in shorter cycles. Despite irregular periods, pregnancy is possible. The physical changes that occur before and during menopause may be bothersome, but they are normal part of the menopause transition however, risk for more serious complications increases after women reach menopause that is post menopause stage. Exercises prove to be helpful in making physiological and psychological adaptations in such women.",

      "abstract": "At present stage due to modern lifestyle, nuclear family and working motherhood, the rest needed for the women during menses time and during and after delivery have been reduced. Protrusion of the pelvic organs into or out of the vaginal canal is termed as Pelvic organ prolapse. It is also called pelvic relaxation. It results from weakening or damage to pelvic supporting structures, which can occur generally throughout the vagina or at specific sites. This problem may develop after child birth, progression of age, and injury to the muscles and organs situated there. Anything that causes increased pressure in the abdomen can lead to pelvic organ prolapse. Some common causes include: pregnancy, labour, and childbirth (the most common cause) etc. Acarya Susrutha mentions that in Prasramsini, any irritation causes excessive vaginal discharge/displacement and labour is difficult/abnormal. Dalhana explains the reason for difficult labour is abnormality in passage. Clinical features of Pitta vitiation i.e., burning sensation and heat etc. are present.&#x0D; According to WHO estimation, the global prevalence of uterine prolapse is 2- 20%. As Prasramsini is a Pittaja yoni vyapat and Vata is the main Dosa involved in all the Yoni vyapat, the drug selected for the study is mainly Vata pitta hara and Balya. Hence an attempt was made by giving tablet Neo (Charak pharmaceuticals) orally, and Mahamasha tailam for Abyangam and Yoni pichu dharana.",

      "title": "Does the phase of the menstrual cycle really matter to anaesthesia?",
      "abstract": "The menstrual cycle is a physiological phenomenon that is accompanied by several hormonal fluctuations involving oestrogen and progesterone. Oestrogen and progesterone exert several physiological effects. There are many questions pertaining to the influence of the physiology of menstruation on anaesthesia. We attempted to find out whether the phase of the menstrual cycle can alter the physiological functions during anaesthesia, the perioperative management and outcomes. We performed a literature search in Google Scholar, PubMed and Cochrane databases for original and reviewed articles on the phases of the menstrual cycle and their relation to anaesthesia-related physiological parameters to find an answer to these questions. Many studies have shown that women, perimenstrually, may have increased pain perception, exacerbation of systemic diseases, vocal cord/peripheral oedema and post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Some of the other notable findings in most studies were sleep disturbances in the luteal phase (LP), increased occurrence of PONV in the ovulatory phase and a lower requirement of intravenous sedative and anaesthetic drug requirements in the LP. We found contradictory results concerning pain perception and PONV in relation to the follicular and LPs. However, we found that literature regarding the phase of the menstrual cycle and the haemodynamic response to intubation, anaesthesia-induced hypnosis and perioperative blood loss is relatively scarce. Thus, there is a need to conduct good quality research on these topics.",

Fetal tolerance test to uterine contractions should also be done whenever possible to evaluate the tolerance of these fetuses to uterine contractility during labor.

      "abstract": "Case of advanced ovarian pregnancy are exceptional because ovarian pregnancy itself is very rare. The authors describe a case of prolonged ovarian pregnancy with retention of the dead fetus for more than a year and associated with an intra-uterine pregnancy. Usually ovarian pregnancy finishes in rupture which occurs before the end of the first trimester. It is then difficult to make out the intergrity of the organs and in particular of the tube and indeed to recognize them. On the other hand when the mass persists intact with the development of the pregnancy in a retort shape, it is easy to see how confusion is possible and arises between it and an intra-uterine pregnancy. In this case, however, the different anatomical forms are clear and an almost definite diagnosis can be made at the time of operation (the three first criteria of Spiegelbery). The diagnosis of ovarian pregnancy is never made before operation. At the very best one can say, when things happen early, that an extra-uterine pregnancy has ruptured, or in certain particular circumstances like in the case we are reporting lithopedian. The presence of ovarian tissue in the wall of the sac--which is the fourth criterion of Spiegelberg-is easier to recognize in early accidents than in advanced cases of ovarian pregnancy in which the parenchyma of the ovary is compressed, distended and laminated by the increasing development of the fetus and the adnexae. The absence of the placenta being adherent to other organs than the ovary can then be kept as a worthwhile criterion of ovarian pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "It is well known that vaginal birth, even under apparently normal circumstances, involves a significant mechanical straining of the various muscular connective structures which make up the pelvic floor and that an unusual strain of the perineal plates can cause morphologic-functional alterations which are not entirely reversible. The integrity of structures which make up the \"pelvic floor\" and the \"endopelvic fascia\" is the fundamental element to maintaining a normal anatomic position of the pelvic organs in the various functional conditions. Consequently prolapse of female pelvic organs can be linked back to the functional limitations of perineal plates (muscular support fascia system) and/or of the ligaments of the sub-peritoneal endopelvic connective tissue (ligament suspension system).After birth 537 mothers underwent a urological and gynecological examinations as follows: collection of clinical data regarding pregnancy development and birth; medical history regarding the number of day- and night-time urinations, urinary volume, possible encouraging factors and pre-urinary sensations; objective urological and gynecological examination (pubo-coccygeal test, highlighting of possible agonistic and antagonistic muscular synergies, stress test, evaluation and staging of vaginal prolapse according to Baden and Walker; instrumental evaluation in cases of post-partum urinary incontinence. Simple regression analyses were carried out where prolapse of various vaginal segments were proportionately related to the various risk factors.Maternal age at birth, parity, weight before pregnancy and at term, weight increase, duration of second stage of labour, development and characteristics of the birth, perineal condition and neonatal weight were all variables considered risk factors while prolapse in each vaginal segment, PC-test, involuntary reflex execution of opposite command and uterine retroversion were all \"response variables\" whose dependence on various risk factors was studied. Analysis of the associations between the various pairs of variables showed a correlation, both positive and negative, whether the population considered was that of all mothers or that of primiparae.In the light of the results of this study, it can be said that there are two important pathogenetic factors: the tissue factors and the iatrogenic factor. Elevated maternal age and multiparity underline the role of the tissue factor in the pathogenesis of obstetric perineal damage. With regard to the iatrogenic factor it is interesting to note a higher concentration of symptomatic women cases where labour had been induced or birth had been achieved through instrumental delivery.",

This ritualistic practice has affected the physical, mental, and social well being of women and undermined the basic reproductive and sexual health rights of the female population. Worldwide, 85-114 million girls and young women are subjected to this dreadful practice. It is mostly practiced in Africa and Middle East. Various authors classify female genital cutting differently. The World Health Organization classifies FGM in to FOUR types. Female genital mutilation is associated with immediate, intermediate and long-term complications (1-4). The complications are strongly related to the variant of the mutilation, especially of the third and the fourth types where introcision or vaginal scraping is performed.

But what is even more uncommon is the finding of a dead and retained, supra hepatic, abdominal pregnancy co-existing with a live intra uterine pregnancy at different stages of development. This is an extremely rare case of a 22-year old multigravida, who presented with 6 months amenorrhoea, abdominal distension and difficulty in breathing. She had a previous history of a preexisting advanced abdominal pregnancy diagnosed a year earlier which had not been delivered. Evaluations revealed a viable intra-uterine gestation at 24 weeks, co-existing with a non-viable, sub-diaphragmatic/supra-hepatic abdominal pregnancy at term. She had the macerated abdominal pregnancy delivered at laparotomy and the intra-uterine pregnancy was left to continue. She developed Preeclampsia and eventually had pre-term premature rupture of membranes PPROM at 28 weeks of gestation with a live birth of a female fetus that weighed 800 grammes. There have been very few reports on advanced abdominal pregnancy and even more rarely, human superfetation in multiple pregnancy, but not a report on an intrauterine conception with a pre-existing advanced, abdominal ectopic pregnancy until now. This report is thus the first of its kind. We report an extremely rare case of a woman conceiving an intrauterine pregnancy, carrying it to the age of viability in the presence of a previously conceived, undelivered, dead, advanced abdominal pregnancy",

Even though epidural analgesia is considered very safe, there is a tendency to blame the epidural whenever there are neurological complications after labour.This paper presents a case report on a woman who developed femoral mononeuropathy after labour. The various neurological complications after labour are discussed.Gynaecologists, neurologists, mid-wives and even anaesthesiologists seem unaware of the fact that the incidence of neurological complications are four to five times higher as a result of the labour per se than complications caused by the epidural. Peripheral neurological symptoms after labour occur in 1:2-3,000 labours. Postpartum drop-foot and femoral mononeuropathy are the most frequent complications. Half of all parturients will experience low back pain during pregnancy and/or labour, and one in four will complain of headache in the immediate postpartum period. Urinary bladder dysfunction after pregnancy is not uncommon, but the incidence is the same among mothers who have received epidural analgesia and those who have not. Complications after epidural analgesia, such as haematoma, abscesses and direct nerve damage are extremely rare, but need immediate treatment.",

It may affect both sexes in all age groups and result in considerable morbidity. The frequency depends upon the type of operation and its duration but statements in the literature vary greatly on account of inaccurate and varying definitions and uncertain diagnostic criteria. Intervention in the true pelvis results in the highest frequencies of postoperative urinary retention. The method of anesthesia is of lesser significance. Spinal anesthesia and epidural morphine constitute, however, a particular risk for the development of postoperative retention of urine. The pathological physiology is complex and includes: 1) disturbance of the balance between the sympathetic/parasympathetic influence on bladder and urethral function, 2) drugs which inhibit the miction reflex, 3) anaesthesia and sedation which cloud the awareness of bladder filling, 4) rapid filling of the bladder with subsequent overdistension, 5) lesion of the nerve fibres to the lower urinary tract, 6) mechanical obstruction and 7) difficult positions and/or situations for miction. Preoperative information about difficulty in emptying the bladder constitutes a predisposing factor and may require preoperative elucidation and treatment. Postoperative retention of urine may be countered by informative and practical measures and restriction of fluid intake. In selected cases, prophylactic treatment with alpha-blockers and prostaglandin may reduce the frequency. Therapeutically, oral parasympathomimetica do not appear to be effective while alpha-blockers may be employed. In cases where catheter treatment is employed and which is anticipated to be required for more than 48 hours, suprapubic drainage is recommended as this results in fewer cases of urinary infection than transurethral indwelling catheters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Unexpected delivery: cryptic pregnancy",
      "abstract": "Cryptic pregnancy was first described in the early 17th century and occurs when the pregnant person is unaware of their pregnant state and discovers this late in pregnancy or when labour starts. Historically, the term ‘concealed pregnancy’ has been used synonymously. In a concealed pregnancy, the patient is aware of their pregnancy but chooses to hide it. Cryptic pregnancies can be divided into psychotic or non-psychotic types (affective, pervasive or persistent); however, it can also occur without any clinical manifestation of a psychiatric disorder. Lack of antenatal care may result in adverse maternal and fetal outcomes such as pre-eclampsia, small for gestational age babies or untreated diabetes. The risk factors for pregnancy denial include young age, low level of education, a precarious work situation and being single. The psychological and developmental impact of pregnancy denial on children and mothers is still unknown. The authors present the case of a nulliparous woman with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in her early 40s presenting to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain and hypertension with proteinuria. Her body mass index (BMI) was 51.6 kg/m 2 . Physical examination revealed a gravid uterus, and the woman was in labour. Further investigation with a transabdominal ultrasound scan confirmed a term fetus. She was unaware that she was pregnant. She was diagnosed with pre-eclampsia and commenced treatment with labetalol. The woman presented to primary care with non-specific symptoms of weight gain, lethargy, carpal tunnel syndrome and acid reflux over a 6-month period. Despite being sexually active and not using contraception, a pregnancy test was not offered. She was delivered of a live neonate by an emergency lower segment caesarean section at 9 cm dilatation. The neonate plotted on the 45.2nd centile. This case emphasises the need for doctors to request a pregnancy test in women of reproductive age who present with recurrent pregnancy-related symptoms irrespective of their BMI, history of PCOS or inability to conceive over a long period. This case also highlights the need for primary care and emergency physicians to be aware of the phenomenon of cryptic pregnancy. It also provides a cautionary reminder of having a high index of clinical suspicion to establish the diagnosis due to the paucity of cases in the literature.",

Perinatal risk factors for the development of Tourette syndrome include older paternal age, severe maternal psychosocial stress during pregnancy, maternal smoking during pregnancy, more and earlier prenatal care visits, delivery complications, and low Apgar score at 5 minutes after birth. Risk factors for more severe tics include older paternal age, maternal psychosocial stress during pregnancy, maternal severe nausea and/or vomiting during the first trimester, maternal smoking during pregnancy, maternal medication use during pregnancy, low birth weight, and delivery complications. Maternal smoking during pregnancy and low birth weight are risk factors for the presence of comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in individuals with a tic disorder. Older paternal age; maternal use of coffee, cigarettes, or alcohol during pregnancy; and forceps deliveries are risk factors for the presence of comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder in individuals with a tic disorder.",

Two hours after childbirth, the patient had bilateral painful ecchymotic vulvar swelling suggesting post-partum thrombus of the vulva. Given the clinical stability of the size of this hematoma, the absence of unbearable pain and the stable hemodynamic status, conservative medical treatment (ice bag + NSAIDs). Output was favorable with progressive decrease in the size of the hematoma until disappearance 8 weeks after delivery. Thrombus or genital hematoma is a rare but potentially very serious post-partum haemorrhagic complication. There are four major types of genital hematomas: hematoma of the vulva, vulvo-vaginal hematoma, vaginal hematoma and pelvic-abdominal hematoma. The contributing factors are primiparity, instrumental extractions, toxaemia of pregnancy, twin pregnancies and vulvovaginal varicose veins. It is essential to suspect it in patients with pain and/or internal postpartum hemorrhage, and, if any doubt exists, to perform vulvovaginal inspection. Early treatment is necessary and should be associated with hemodynamic resuscitation, first-line surgery and percutaneous radiologic arterial embolization in case of failure of surgery.",

      "abstract": "Stress urinary incontinence due to urethral sphincter incompetence (genuine stress incontinence) afflicts some 5–15% of women. The mechanism of continence is imperfectly understood, as is the precise mode of its cure, whether conservative or surgical. The pathophysiology is a reduction in urethral resistance in the absence of detrusor activity. Aetiological factors include congenital malformation of the bladder neck, denervation of the pelvic floor and sphincter mechanism following childbirth, trauma causing disruption of the urethral sphincter mechanism, fibrosis associated with bladder neck surgery for prolapse, oestrogen deprivation at the menopause, and urethral relaxation or instability. Conventional investigations include urethral pressure measurement, urethral electric conductance, electrophysiological tests, and cystometry or videocystourethrography (the latter procedures diagnose by exclusion). A more precise evaluation of the role of urethral resistance is hampered by lack of suitable techniques for measuring urethral and sphincteric function. Treatments include pelvic floor exercise, drugs to increase urethral resistance, and surgery, either to evaluate the bladder neck or to increase urethral resistance.",

      "title": "Infertility in patients with uterine fibroids: a debate about the hypothetical mechanisms",
      "abstract": "Abstract Fibroids are benign tumours of the myometrium and are the most common gynaecologic abnormality. Although most fibroids are asymptomatic, they can cause symptoms like heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction, pressure complaints, and infertility. The association between fibroids and infertility has been debated for decades. It is generally acknowledged that the closer the fibroid is to the uterine cavity and the endometrium lining, the more unfavourable effect it might have on fertility, reducing the odds for successful implantation and gestation. Based on the limited available literature, we propose and discuss seven hypotheses on the underlying mechanism by which fibroids may reduce fertility. (i) Fibroids can cause sexual dysfunction, as fibroids can cause dyspareunia, pelvic pain, and prolonged and heavy menstrual bleeding, which could interfere with sexual arousal and as a consequence the frequency of intercourse, resulting in a reduced probability of conception. (ii) Mechanical compression by fibroids on theinterstitial part of the fallopian tubes or deformation of uterine cavity could disturb oocyte and sperm transport. (iii) Fibroids can disturb peristalsis of the junctional zone in the myometrium, which could negatively influence oocyte and sperm transport as well as implantation. In addition, fibroids could induce a detrimental environment for implantation in other ways, by: (iv) changing the vagino-uterine microbiome; (v) disturbing the levels of inflammation and autophagy; (vi) inducing molecular changes in the endometrium; and (vii) inducing aberrant angiogenesis and altering the endometrial blood supply. After the discussion of these hypotheses, the implication of the influence of fibroids on early pregnancy loss is discussed. Surgical fibroid treatment is not tailored nor focussed on the pathophysiology of the fibroid; consequently it may be accompanied by recurrence of fibroids and risks of complications. Unravelling the pathogenic mechanisms about how fibroids influence fertility is essential to evolve classic surgical fibroid treatment. Instead of treatment of fibroid-related symptoms, the research should supports development of fibroid-targeted (pharmaceutical) treatment that is compatible with an active wish to become pregnant.",

      "abstract": "Evidence is growing that active management of the third stage of labor using prophylactic uterotonics may be associated with lower breastfeeding rates. The reasons underlying this relationship are incompletely understood. The aim of this article is to examine the experiences of mothers who stopped breastfeeding in relation to administration of parenteral uterotonics for postpartum hemorrhage prophylaxis.Two hundred eighty-eight mothers with an infant 0-6 months of age who had a vaginal birth completed a self-report questionnaire examining injections of uterotonics during the third stage of labor, breastfeeding at birth, breastfeeding duration, and, where applicable, reasons for breastfeeding cessation, whether physical, social, or psychological.No significant association was found between infant feeding mode at birth (breast/formula) and injection of uterotonics. However, mothers who had received uterotonics were significantly less likely to be breastfeeding at all at 2 and 6 weeks. Among mothers who had stopped breastfeeding, those who had received parenteral prophylactic uterotonics were significantly more likely to report stopping breastfeeding for physical reasons such as pain or difficulty.These findings suggest that injection of prophylactic uteronics may reduce breastfeeding duration, but not initiation. This may be attributable to the effects of oxytocin or ergometrine on the physiology of lactation, leading to difficulties with infant latch and milk supply. If breastfeeding rates are to be optimized, this hypothesis needs to be explored in randomized controlled trials of third-stage management. Meanwhile, mothers who receive parenteral uterotonics may need additional support to establish breastfeeding.",

This study describes a case of preeclampsia in a 37-year-old primiparous woman in the 30th week of pregnancy with a lack of prior thrombotic history. The birth of a dead neonate and the findings of placenta thrombosis raised the suspicion of APS, which was confirmed by the finding of antibodies. A description of the treatment, which is still under investigation, follows. In our case, tissue sections were stained followed by observation. Various placental changes were detected with the presence of placental intravascular thrombi. The most important finding of this case study is the presence of severe preeclampsia in the setting of APS, with no previous medical history. In conclusion, antiphospholipid syndrome can be directly related to preeclampsia during pregnancy, leading to complications that may be preventable if immediate medical intervention is available.",

      "title": "Pelvic floor disorders following vaginal or cesarean delivery",
      "abstract": "Pelvic floor disorders affect women of all ages and are associated with significant economic burden and poor quality of life. Current literature suggests an association between childbirth and these disorders. In this review, we summarize recent advancements in our understanding of this association.Vaginal childbirth appears to be strongly associated with stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. There is less evidence to suggest an association between vaginal delivery and overactive bladder symptoms. History of more than one perineal laceration increases the likelihood of developing prolapse. Similar association has not been established for episiotomy. Disruption or denervation of structural components of pelvic floor support system, particularly levator ani muscle complex, is associated with later development of pelvic floor disorders. Imbalance in homeostasis of connective tissue remodeling of the vaginal wall from overstretching during childbirth is another possible mechanism.Pelvic floor disorders represent a significant health problem affecting women of all ages. Identification of potential modifiable risk factors and advancement in understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is crucial for primary and secondary prevention of these disorders and for improvement in treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review The pathophysiological mechanisms of female voiding phase dysfunction are poorly understood, and there are neither standard definitions nor guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. The aim of this review is to present up-to-date data and controversies associated with non-neurogenic female voiding dysfunction. Recent findings Conceptually, voiding phase dysfunction may have bladder or urethral causes. Bladder causes include detrusor contraction of inadequate magnitude or duration to effect bladder emptying (detrusor underactivity), or the absence of detrusor contraction (detrusor arreflexia). Urethral causes consist of bladder outlet obstruction as a result of urethral overactivity (functional obstruction), or anatomical (mechanical obstruction) pathologies. The specific prevalence and contribution of each of the above mechanisms is unknown. Furthermore, a correct and timely diagnosis may be difficult, because clinical features are very similar to those of other lower urinary tract symptoms, and diagnostic modalities are often inconclusive or even misleading. A full urodynamic evaluation is essential in making the diagnosis; however, standard urodynamic definitions are still lacking. In the following review, we will present recent findings associated with the prevalence, etiology and diagnosis of each of the different categories of female voiding phase dysfunction, and highlight new advances presented during the past year. Summary Further epidemiological and pathophysiological investigations are needed to evaluate the causes and main risk factors of voiding dysfunction in women. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with this challenging condition may provide the possibility to use appropriate diagnostic and treatment modalities, thus avoiding unnecessary interventions.",

      "abstract": "The effect of pregnancy on the intensity of murmurs of aortic and mitral regurgitation has not been reported previously. Twenty-five women with these murmurs, singly or in combination, were examined when pregnant as well as when not pregnant. During pregnancy the murmur of aortic regurgitation decreased in intensity or became inaudible in 10 patients, remained unchanged in four, and increased in one. The murmur of mitral regurgitation decreased in intensity or became inaudible in eight patients, became shorter in duration in two, was unchanged in three, and became louder in one. Three of the patients who did not show a decrease in intensity of the mitral or aortic regurgitation murmur and the patient whose murmurs increased during pregnancy had the appearance or persistence of systemic hypertension during pregnancy. Phenylephrine consistently increased the loudness of the murmurs, usually to the level present in the nonpregnant state. The diminished intensity of these murmurs may be related to the decrease in peripheral resistance known to occur during pregnancy. It is apparent that (1) aortic regurgitation or mitral regurgitation may be missed during pregnancy, since these murmurs may become inaudible, and (2) the severity of these cardiac lesions may be underestimated clinically because of a decrease in intensity of these murmurs during pregnancy. It is important to determine the existence of valvular heart disease, since endocarditis is a hazard during parturition, and prophylactic antibiotic therapy should be given to these patients.",

      "title": "When endometriosis is the barrier for fertility",
      "abstract": "Endometriosis is a common disease with severe impact on quality of life but its etiology is still poorly understood and diagnosis and adequate treatment is frequently delayed. In this theme issue of AOGS we have included reviews and original research articles, which provide an update on current knowledge and practice. “When love hurts” is the title of one of the reviews included in this theme issue. Sexual function is important in most people's lives and has serious impact on women's physical and psychological health. Pain caused by endometriosis may increase anxiety for intercourse, resulting in lower frequency or even avoidance of sexual intercourse and may also interfere with arousal and orgasm. The reason why some, but not all, women with endometriosis experience dyspareunia and infertility remains unclear. There are no clear and consistent correlations with symptoms, and staging stage of the disease or anatomic location of the disease. Furthermore, surgical and medical interventions may not necessarily lead to relief of dyspareunia and pelvic pain, definitive resolution of sexual function or increased improved fertility in women with endometriosis. Although dyspareunia may influence fertility by reducing frequency of sexual intercourse, whether endometriosis per se influences fertility outcome remains controversial 1, 2. Whether the removal of endometriomas may affect ovarian function has also been debated. A systematic review included in this theme issue shows that surgery does not improve reproductive outcome, and that women with endometriosis may benefit from direct referral to specialists in ART instead of undergoing cystectomy. Surgery may be favored before IVF only in case of pain. Adenomyosis is another aspect of endometriosis characterized by invasion of endometrium into the myometrium. Similarly to endometriosis, this variation is also associated with pain, bleeding and infertility, and consequently impairs affected women's quality of life. So far, resection of adenomyosis is difficult and new treatment methods that could be offered to women with adenomyosis are urgently needed. Recently, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been described to relieve symptoms and improve fertility in these women, but further studies will be needed to determine if this may be an option for women with adenomyosis who wish to preserve their fertility. Of great interest is the possibility of developing non-hormonal treatment targeting pain and chronic inflammation, which are features of endometriosis 3. However, pain is difficult to evaluate and the importance of inclusion of a placebo group is demonstrated in this issue by the clinical trial evaluating the antagonist to CCR1, a cytokine, which has been proposed as a contributory factor to endometriosis-associated inflammation. Among other challenges, interpreting conflicting research data on endometriosis is difficult due to the heterogeneous nature of the disease, insecurity regarding correct diagnosis, influence of possible hormonal treatment and the huge variation in timing of sample collection. Greaves and colleagues point out the importance of careful experimental design and give an overview of appropriate in vitro and in vivo laboratory models of importance for developing non-surgical treatment options. The development of new treatment options is hindered by the limited understanding of the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Since Sampson presented his theory on retrograde menstruation in the 1920s, many new hypotheses have been proposed. Despite active research in the field, reliable data on pathogenic mechanisms and management of endometriosis are still lacking. Patel et al describe, in this issue, that endometriosis in adult women may be a consequence of “preconditioning” in the fetal life, wherein newborn progesterone resistance persists through early adolescence. Newborn menstruation occurs as a result of withdrawal of placental steroid hormones postpartum. It has been proposed that since the neonatal cervix is occluded retrograde, influx of endometrial cells may initiate endometriotic lesions. In addition, post-maturity has been described as a significant risk factor for the development of endometriosis, possibly because newborn uterine bleeding appears to be more common in these neonates. Environmental toxins may be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Dioxin, a well-known toxin found especially in food sources, is postulated to instigate progesterone resistance and endometriosis. Additionally, humans are constantly confronted by estrogens in their everyday environment. Estrogen in the form of chemicals (xenoestrogens), or from plants (phytoestrogens), mimics the action of endogenous estrogen and can alter hormonal signaling. However, more studies are needed in order to explore the impact of these newly described factors on the development of endometriosis 4. Endometriosis is generally considered benign, but has been associated with an increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer 5. Endometrial adult stem/progenitor cells involved in the cyclic regeneration of the endometrium are suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis 6, 7. Aberrant expression levels of proteins relevant to attachment, adhesion, and invasion within ectopic endometrium may facilitate the formation of pre-malignant lesions 7. Chronic inflammation, and hypoxia may further instigate malignant transformation of both endometrial and endometriotic tissue; however, the early molecular mechanisms that accompany these changes remain undefined 8. Thomsen et al present, in this issue, epithelial ovarian cancer associated risk factors and identify a subgroup of women who, if confirmed in further studies, may be offered increased surveillance for early diagnosis or even prophylactic measures in the future. In this respect it may be worth remembering the protective effect that combined hormonal contraception offers against ovarian cancer 9. Berlac and colleagues present new data demonstrating that endometriosis also impacts fetal life, as endometriosis in the mother has been associated with low birth weight, preterm birth before 28 weeks, congenital malformations and neonatal death. Endometriosis may also affect maternal health as severe preeclampsia and other complications during pregnancy are more common in women with endometriosis. We hope that this theme issue will shed new light on endometriosis and how the disease impacts women's health, along with hopefully encouraging further studies in this area. Further research is also needed on women's perspectives in relation to the impact of endometriosis on their health and wellbeing.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, pregnancy was considered to be a period of personal contentment for women; and this was also the accepted wisdom within the medical and psychiatric professions. Probably as a consequence of this, research into mood disorder in relation to reproductive events has been almost exclusively focused on the postpartum period. This is difficult to understand, since excellent studies published from the 1980s onwards uncovered significant affective morbidity during pregnancy. These reports, however, were ignored until more recent years. The findings from the main studies examining mood symptoms and/or mood disorder during pregnancy and the postpartum period are consistent and demonstrate high levels of depressive symptoms from the second trimester of pregnancy through to the postpartum period, falling following delivery. The point is best illustrated by comparing the findings from two of the most methodologically rigorous studies from different decades: those by O'Hara et al1 and Evans et al.2",

In the following a case is described of a patient presenting with recurrent vomiting episodes, whose condition improved spontaneously during pregnancy and breast feeding. A woman with recurrent vomiting episodes over several years was examined by esophagogastroduodenoscopy. This showed a non-peristaltic ventricle. Treatment with the procinetic drug cisapride (Prepulsid®) improved the peristalsis and reduced the symptoms. During pregnancy and breast feeding, she was free of symptoms, in spite of having discontinued her medication with cisapride (Prepulsid®). The fact that the patient improved during pregnancy and breast feeding, would seem to indicate the involvement of factors in the physiology of pregnancy and breast feeding that are of importance for gastric motility.

Most of these papers do not report medical data or observations from genital examination. We report in such detail on six cases of persistent genital arousal disorder (PGAD) in women. We further advance the hypothesis that in many cases the objective genital component may be induced by a variety of psychophysiological and pathological factors such as anxiety, genital prolapses and dermatoses. Genital engorgement so produced may not be continuous but when present may be enhanced and perpetuated by both anxiety focussed on the genitals and masturbation used in an attempt to relieve the sensations. Premorbid affective psychological illness negatively colours the subjective perception of this genital engorgement, leading to either elicitation or maintenance of PGAD. We discuss this hypothesis in relation to our six cases.",

      "title": "A RCT addressing the impact of delivery mode after asymptomatic obstetric anal sphincter injury. (Mini-commentary on BJOG-20-0320.R1)",
      "abstract": "Mini-commentary on BJOG-20-0320.R1: Cesarean section in the second delivery to prevent anal incontinence after asymptomatic obstetrical anal sphincter injury: the EPIC multicenter randomized trialAn obstetric anal sphincter injury poses an important clinical dilemma for subsequent vaginal deliveries, which may be complicated by recurrent obstetric anal sphincter injury and / or worsening or de novo anal incontinence.Recurrent obstetric anal sphincter injury has a similar incidence to primary obstetric anal sphincter injury (6.3% vs 5.7%), and similar associated risk factors including instrumental delivery with either forceps [OR 3.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.42-4.01) or ventouse (OR 2.44, 95%CI 1.83-3.25), birth weight ≥4 kg (OR 2.29, 95%CI 2.06-2.54) and previous fourth-degree tear (OR 1.7, 95%CI 1.24-2.36) (Jha S, Parker V: Int Urogynecol J. 2016 Jun;27(6):849-57).The risk of long-term anal incontinence is also related to the degree of sphincter tear. Women with a fourth-degree sphincter injury in the first delivery are at higher risk for anal incontinence compared to women with a third-degree injury (58.8% vs. 41.0%). (Jangö H et al. 2018 Feb;218(2):232.e1-232.e10. Am J Obstet Gynecol). Although primary caesarean may be protective against anal incontinence, the previous observational evidence is consistent in finding that adjusted odds of long-term anal incontinence do not differ significantly by mode of second delivery after obstetric anal sphincter injury, and specifically that subsequent elective cesarean delivery is not protective (Jangö H et al, Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2016;214(6):733.e1-733.e13.) However, previous observational studies may suffer from confounding by indication, due to widespread adoption of planned caesarean for subsequent deliveries in women with incontinence symptoms or persistent sphincter defectsThere have been no previous randomised trials to test whether anal incontinence could be prevented by planned cesarean section for the second delivery. Abramowitz and colleagues’ (Abramowitz L et al. BJOG 2020) RCT provides us with a better understanding of the role of caesarean in women with asymptomatic third degree anal sphincter injury. There was limited cross-over between groups: of the 112 women randomized to the vaginal delivery group, 17 (15.6%) had a caesarean section for obstetric indications. For those randomized to the planned cesarean section, 18 (16.58%) delivered vaginally. One fifth of the randomized women did not complete the post-partum follow-up, but their characteristics did not differ between the two study groups. In this RCT, planned cesarean section in the second delivery was unequivocally not protective against anal incontinence at 8 months post-partum, with low rates of symptoms in both groups (Vaizey score 1/24 vs. 1/24 p=0.34). As rates of incontinence were lower than expected, the trial may have been underpowered for a clinically relevant difference between groups. In an unplanned analysis, there was however, an interaction between baseline Vaizey score, and worsening symptoms after vaginal delivery, with significantly worse symptoms after vaginal delivery for women with pre-existing mild symptoms.The authors rightly suggest that the findings are useful when counseling women about risks and benefits of caesarean at their second delivery. These results do not support advising systematic cesarean after asymptomatic third degree obstetric anal sphincter injury. The medicalization of pregnancy associated with planned caesarean is undesirable from both individual and societal perspectives, and cesarean delivery is associated with a number of health risks when compared to vaginal delivery (NICE Clinical Guideline CG132, https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg132/). Important questions remain for future work whether subsequent cesarean section may be useful in the long term, among women with mildly symptomatic anal incontinence, or for women with asymptomatic fourth degree obstetric anal sphincter injury.Disclosure of interests: Tähtinen declares honoraria from Olympus.

      "title": "Towards universal Kangaroo Mother Care: recommendations and report from the First European conference and Seventh International Workshop on Kangaroo Mother Care",
      "abstract": "Abstract The hallmark of Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is the kangaroo position: the infant is cared for skin‐to‐skin vertically between the mother’s breasts and below her clothes, 24 h/day, with father/substitute(s) participating as KMC providers. Intermittent KMC (for short periods once or a few times per day, for a variable number of days) is commonly employed in high‐tech neonatal intensive care units. These two modalities should be regarded as a progressive adaptation of the mother‐infant dyad, ideally towards continuous KMC, starting gradually and progressively with intermittent KMC. The other components in KMC are exclusive breastfeeding (ideally) and early discharge in kangaroo position with strict follow‐up. Current evidence allows the following general statements about KMC in affluent and low‐income settings: KMC enhances bonding and attachment; reduces maternal postpartum depression symptoms; enhances infant physiologic stability and reduces pain, increases parental sensitivity to infant cues; contributes to the establishment and longer duration of breastfeeding and has positive effects on infant development and infant/parent interaction. Therefore, intrapartum and postnatal care in all types of settings should adhere to a paradigm of nonseparation of infants and their mothers/families. Preterm/low‐birth‐weight infants should be regarded as extero‐gestational foetuses needing skin‐to‐skin contact to promote maturation. Conclusion: Kangaroo Mother Care should begin as soon as possible after birth, be applied as continuous skin‐to‐skin contact to the extent that this is possible and appropriate and continue for as long as appropriate.",

Twice weekly assay of urinary estronc glucuronide and pregnanediol demonstrated absence of ovulation and suppression of estrogen excretion to within or below the early follicular phase range. Physical and psychological symptoms, measured by daily self assessment, were significantly improved during therapy. However, some subjects continued to record intermittent episodes of swelling and adverse mood in the absence of changes in ovarian activity. Three women reported marked but transient worsening of anxiety and/or depression soon after the onset of ovarian suppression, one later withdrawing from the study. Return of ovulatory menstruation was preceded by recurrence of symptoms at pretreatment levels, although breast discomfort which was consistently improved during therapy showed a more sustained improvement. Although conclusions are limited by the lack of a placebo control, the results support a link between the hormonal events of the menstrual cycle and mood and physical symptoms. However, they demonstrate that the relationship is not clear-cut.",

We have analysed: perinatal, neonatal and maternal factors, and their clinical features and treatment: There is a great incidence of perinatal asphyxia, acidosis, premature rupture of the fetal membranes, etc. The newborns are usually premature or of low birth weight for their gestational age. They present diverse pathology: syphilis, HBsAg +, HIV +, gonorrhea, congenital malformations, etc. The mothers are often prostitutes, belong to a low socioeconomic status, have had previous abortions and have had no control of the actual pregnancy, etc. The syndrome of abstinence presents with: jitteriness, sweating, high-pitched or continuous crying, vomits, diarrhea, and even seizures. The neurological and digestive manifestations are the most difficult to treat. The treatment consists of general measures (little stimulation dim light, etc.), phenobarbital, and chlorpromazine.",

      "abstract": "A woman’s reproductive system is one of the sensitive indicators of the female health. Its disorders indicate the development of any pathological process in the organism, which is often manifested by changes in specific functions. The impact of constant stress during the war on women who are in the frontline territories is becoming especially relevant today. In modern conditions, when psycho-emotional stress is a part of daily existence, it leads to the formation of pathologies that reduce the quality of life and fertility of a woman.The objective: to study the impact of stress on the female organism and the formation of stress-induced disorders of the menstrual cycle and to analyze the effect of phytotherapy in the complex treatment of such conditions in women.Materials and methods. 50 women of reproductive age (18–45 years old) with various forms of stress-induced menstrual cycle disorders, which developed during their stay in the front-line territories, were under observed. The patients were diagnosed with the following disorders of the menstrual cycle: absent of menstruation, light and infrequent menstruation, heavy, frequrnt and irregular menstrustions, pain and other contitions related to female sexual organs and menstrual cycle.All patients had clinical and laboratory, hormonal and instrumental examinations to determine the form of menstrual cycle disorder. Together with the basic therapy of the specified pathologies, all patients were prescribed a dietary supplement, which included a mixture of plant powder extracts: Vitex agnus-castus – 43,87 mg, Angelica sinensis – 43,87 mg, Filipendula vulgaris – 43,87 mg, Petroselinum crispum – 18,06 mg, Apium graveolens – 18,06 mg, Galium verum – 16,13 mg, Calendula officinalis – 16,13 mg, for 3 months, 2 capsules 2 times a day with with the aim of achieving hormone-correcting, sedative, analgesic, diuretic effects. Control clinical-hormonal and instrumental studies were conducted after 3 months.Results. During the study reduction of complaints was observeed (emotional lability – by 68%, periodic headache – by 36%, sleep disturbances – by 48%, anxiety – by 50%, fatigue – by 60%), as well as the normalization of the hormonal level – a decrease of prolactin concentration in 2 times, cortisol and follicle-stimulating hormone – 1.5 times, luteinizing hormone – 1.7 times, estradiol – 1.3 times, and an increase of progesterone level – in 7 times.A decrease or disappearance of clinical symptoms the menstrual cycle disorders, namely, a normalization of the frequency, duration and regularity of the menstrual cycle, a decrease in the amount of blood loss and manifestations of dysmenorrhea were determined.Conclusions. Phytotherapy, the composition of which contains a preparation with a blend of plant powder extracts: Vitex agnus-castus– 43,87 mg, Angelica sinensis – 43,87 mg, Filipendula vulgaris – 43,87 mg, Petroselinum crispum – 18,06 mg, Apium graveolens – 18,06 mg, Galium verum – 16,13 mg, Calendula officinalis – 16,13 mg, is effective in complex treatment of various forms of stress-induced menstrual cycle disorders.",

Oxytocin for induction or augmentation of labor should not be started when there is a previous scar on the body of the uterus (such as previous classical cesarean section, uterine perforation or myomectomy when uterine cavity is reached) or in any other condition where labor or vaginal delivery are contraindicated. (Moderate quality evidence +++-; Strong recommendation).2. Oxytocin should not be started before at least 1 h has elapsed since amniotomy, 6 h since the use of dinoprostone (30 min if vaginal insert) and 4 h since the use of misoprostol (Low quality evidence ++- -; Moderate recommendation).3. Cardiotocography (CTG) should be performed and a normal pattern without tachysystole should be documented for at least 30 min before oxytocin is used. Continuous CTG, with adequate monitoring of both fetal heart rate and uterine contractions, should be maintained for as long as oxytocin is used, and thereafter until delivery (Low ++- - to moderate +++- quality evidence; Strong recommendation).4. For labor induction, at least 1-h should be allowed after amniotomy before oxytocin infusion is started, to evaluate whether adequate uterine contractility has meanwhile ensued. For augmentation of labor, if the membranes are intact and there are conditions for a safe amniotomy, the latter should be considered before oxytocin is started (Very low quality evidence +- --; Weak recommendation).5. Oxytocin should be administered intravenously using the following regimen: 5 IU oxytocin diluted in 500 mL of 0.9% normal saline (NaCl) (each mL contains 10 mIU of oxytocin), in an infusion pump at increasing rates, as shown in Table 1, until a frequency of 3-4 contractions per 10 min is reached, a non-reassuring CTG pattern ensues, or maximum rates are reached (Low quality evidence ++ - -; Strong recommendation). If the frequency of contractions exceeds 5 in 10 min, the infusion rate should be reduced, even if a normal CTG pattern is present. With a non-reassuring CTG pattern, urgent clinical assessment by an obstetrician is indicated, and strong consideration should be given to reducing or stopping the oxytocin infusion. The minimal effective dose of oxytocin should always be used.

The main complication is decreased fertility, between 50% to 75% of women. Objective: Determine the nursing activities for a patient with cervical endometriosis. Methodology: Qualitative publication, with a single clinical case design based on the nursing care process (PAE) method, Marjory Gordon's assessment guide was applied to a 39-year-old patient who presented with pain in the lower abdomen, postcoital bleeding and pruritus. Results: Eight nursing diagnoses were identified, prioritizing (00132) Acute pain r/c biological harmful agent m/p analgic position, expression of pain, moaning, defensive behavior and VAS 8/10. The interventions carried out improved the bleeding process; Given the problem of hemorrhage complication, the results are still indefinite due to the few hours of intervention and evaluation. Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the patient corresponding to cervical endometriosis and the risk factors that increase the possible complication were identified. It is important to apply preventive actions against the risk of bleeding caused by endometriosis. This entire process framed in the PAE that identified main problems and risks allowed the development of a personalized care plan to provide adequate, timely care that covers basic needs, improving the skills of the nursing professional using the NANDA I, NOC, NIC, and the collaboration problems of Linda Carpenito's Area Model",

OBJECTIVE: This article outlines the range of clinical presentations of women in midlife and discusses assessment of these presentations in the context of the individual woman's life. DISCUSSION: Women in midlife present to doctors for a variety of reasons including information and preventive health, vasomotor or other symptoms of oestrogen deficiency, menstrual disorders, breast disorders, sexual difficulty, relationship and family issues, or mood disorders. Forming an effective doctor- patient partnership to address these issues requires time, empathy, good interpersonal skills, comprehensive and sensitive history taking and examination skills, and a good knowledge of relevant research.

Metode merangkum daftar referensi terupdate sebagai bahan artikel yang dapat menjadi pedoman dan tatalaksana prolaps organ panggul. Hasil tidak semua prolaps alat genitalia membutuhkan terapi, karena banyak penderita tidak mempunyai keluhan, terutama stadium I dan kadang-kadang stadium II.

Prolaps uteri stadium II dan III dipilih vaginal histerektomi dan disertai dengan kolporafi anterior dan kolpoperineorafi, Hal ini terutama bila penderita sudah mengalami manaupose atau tidak memerlukan lagi organ reproduksi. Kesimpulan, walaupun tidak mengancam nyawa, akan tetapi prolapsus alat genitalia dapat menurunkan kualitas hidup wanita. What is Prolapse Abstract Purpose to find out more about descent or genital prolapse can be likened to a hernia, in which a genital organ descends into the vagina, possibly even out of the vaginal canal. This is due to weakness of the fascial muscles and ligaments that support them. Damage to the vaginal support can occur in one location only (eg, anterior vaginal wall only), but is more common in combination. Although it does not cause death, pelvic organ prolapse can reduce the quality of life for women. Method summarize an updated list of references as material for articles that can guide and treat pelvic organ prolapse. Result not all prolapse of the genitalia needed therapy, because many patients had no complaints, especially stage I and sometimes stage II. Those who have complaints, of course, need to be handled properly so that the sufferer feels better. Uterine prolapse stages II and III were chosen by vaginal hysterectomy and accompanied by anterior colporaphy and kolpoperineorafi, especially if the patient has menopause, or no longer needs reproductive organs. Conclusion, although not life threatening, genital prolapse can reduce a woman’s quality of life. Key word : Prolap genitalia, quality of life for women",

      "title": "Laparoscopic bilateral oophorectomy – feasible migraine management?",
      "abstract": "Sir, Migraine is a huge health issue and the prevalence is higher among women. One type of migraine is menstrual or catamenial migraine. Women who experience menstrual migraine have attacks of longer duration and the attacks are more resistant to treatment than other migraine attacks. Exclusively menstrual episodes, anywhere from two days prior to onset of menses to three days following onset of flow in at least two of three cycles, may occur in 15% of women with migraine (1,2). If women also experience attacks non-menstrually, their migraine is classified as a menstrually related migraine. There is a link between female sex hormones and migraine (3). Many women obtain complete relief from their migraine headaches at menopause. We wish to call attention to the possibility of surgical treatment for women suffering from severe and frequent menstrual migraine attacks. We encountered a 40-year-old G4P1 Caucasian woman in generally good health with more than 20 years’ history of migraine attacks related to menstruation. The attacks were initially infrequent, lasting a few hours, and were relieved with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and rest. Later on, the attacks became more frequent and severe, occurring monthly three days before her period. Heralding auras consisted of spots or tunnel vision and feeling sick and tired, with the headache starting behind the left eye and radiating to the back of the head ipsilaterally. She had accompanying phono- and photophobia as well as touch sensitivity. Sometimes she also developed neurologic deficits including hemi-face drooping and aphasia. During her pregnancy and breastfeeding in 2003 she experienced substantial relief, followed by three miscarriages and severe attacks following each of these failed pregnancies. She has a strong family history for migraine. The patient has kept a detailed headache diary since the birth of her child in 2003. She had several imaging studies, both CT (computerized tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). She utilized several treatment options including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, tryptans, anti-epileptic drugs, botox, acupuncture, nerve blocks, stress reduction, oral contraceptives, cyclic estrogen supplement, large doses of corticosteroids and lastly, a GnRH agonist (LUPRON DEPOT®, 3.75 mg i.m. Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) to induce medical menopause. Two weeks into that treatment, she had one of the worst headaches she had ever experienced, lasting two weeks. Estrogen add-back therapy was then implemented and her migraine attacks became less severe in the following months. Daily intra-vaginal progesterone gel treatment was added as she still had her uterus. The progestogen triggered a severe attack, so she discontinued it. A continued medical menopause trial with GnRH agonist and estrogen add-back therapy for a total of 14 months demonstrated successful resolution of her migraine attacks. She subsequently underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy with bilateral salphingo-ooophorectomy to enable the estrogen add-back treatment to continue and induce a surgical menopause. She has remained headache free now, two years after surgery. On searching the literature for articles on oophorectomy or ovariectomy, headache or migraine, only one article was found suggesting surgical oophorectomy after successful treatment of migraine with GnRH agonists, but without mentioning the postoperative migraine results (4). Women who experience menstrual migraine seem to have several things in common; their attacks are of longer duration and are more resistant to treatment and they may suffer from dysmenorrheal and premenstrual syndrome (5). The ICHD-II (International Classification of Headache Disorders) diagnosis of menstrual migraine (2) requires that attacks occur without aura, but in clinical practice it is common that women complain of aura symptoms in relation to their menstrual headache (6). Our patient had a pattern of migraine that qualified for the designation of menstrual migraine but with aura. Many treatment modalities have been recommended but outcome has been variable. Preventative efficacy has been demonstrated for the GnRH analog, leuprolide acetate, in women with medically refractory menstrual migraine (4) but the effects of long-term use are not known. If a medical menopause trial with GnRH agonist demonstrates successful resolution, the present case raises the possibility that surgically induced menopause and hysterectomy with estrogen add-back therapy may represent an alternative treatment option for severe refractory menstrual migraine.",

To compile an inventory of the disabilities of patients with peripartum pelvic pain, analyze factors associated with the risk for development of the disease, and to formulate a hypothesis on pathogenesis and specific preventive and therapeutic measures. Summary of Background Data. Pregnancy is an important risk factor for development of chronic low back pain. Understanding the pathogenesis of pelvic and low back pain during pregnancy and delivery could be useful in understanding and managing nonspecific low back pain. Methods. By means of a questionnaire, background data were collected among patients of the Dutch Association for Patients With Pelvic Complaints in Relation to Symphysiolysis. Results were compared with the general population. Subgroups were compared with each other. Results. Peripartum pelvic pain seriously interferes with many activities of daily living such us standing, walking, sitting, and all other activities in which the pelvis is involved. Most patients experience a relapse around menstruation and during a subsequent pregnancy. Occurrence of peripartum pelvic pain was associated with twin pregnancy, first pregnancy, higher age at first pregnancy, larger weight of the baby, forceps or vacuum extraction, fundus expression, and a flexed position of the woman during childbirth; a negative association was observed with cesarean section. Conclusions. It is hypothesized that peripartum pelvic pain is caused by strain of ligaments in the pelvis and lower spine resulting from a combination of damage to ligaments (recently or in the past), hormonal effects, muscle weakness, and the weight of the fetus.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> Labour pain is among the severest pains primigravidae may experience during pregnancy. Failure to address labour pain and anxiety may lead to abnormal labour. Despite the many complementary non-pharmacological approaches to coping with labour pain, the quality of evidence is low and best approaches are not established. This study protocol describes a proposed investigation of the effects of a combination of breathing exercises, foot reflexology and back massage (BRM) on the labour experiences of primigravidae. <h3>Methods and analysis</h3> This randomised controlled trial will involve an intervention group receiving BRM and standard labour care, and a control group receiving only standard labour care. Primigravidae of 26–34 weeks of gestation without chronic diseases or pregnancy-related complications will be recruited from antenatal clinics. Eligible and consenting patients will be randomly allocated to the intervention or the control group stratified by intramuscular pethidine use. The BRM intervention will be delivered by a trained massage therapist. The primary outcomes of labour pain and anxiety will be measured during and after uterine contractions at baseline (cervical dilatation 6 cm) and post BRM hourly for 2 hours. The secondary outcomes include maternal stress hormone (adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol and oxytocin) levels, maternal vital signs (V/S), fetal heart rate, labour duration, Apgar scores and maternal satisfaction. The sample size is estimated based on the between-group difference of 0.6 in anxiety scores, 95% power and 5% α error, which yields a required sample size of 154 (77 in each group) accounting for a 20% attrition rate. The between-group and within-group outcome measures will be examined with mixed-effect regression models, time series analyses and paired t-test or equivalent non-parametric tests, respectively. <h3>Ethics and dissemination</h3> Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethical Committee for Research Involving Human Subjects of the Ministry of Health in the Saudi Arabia (H-02-K-076-0319-109) on 14 April 2019, and from the Ethics Committee for Research Involving Human Subjects (JKEUPM) Universiti Putra Malaysia on 23 October 2019, reference number: JKEUPM-2019–169. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Results from this trial will be presented at regional, national and international conferences and published in indexed journals. <h3>Trial registration number</h3> ISRCTN87414969, registered 3 May 2019.",

      "title": "Fertility after contraception or abortion",
      "abstract": "There is a very small correlation, if any, between the prior use of OCs and congenital malformations, including Down's syndrome. There are few, if any, recent reports on masculinization of a female fetus born to a mother who took an OC containing 1 mg of a progestogen during early pregnancy. However, patients suspected of being pregnant and who are desirous of continuing that pregnancy should not continue to take OCs, nor should progestogen withdrawal pregnancy tests be used. Concern still exists regarding the occurrence of congenital abnormalities in babies born to such women. The incidence of postoperative infection after first trimester therapeutic abortion in this country is low. However, increasing numbers of women are undergoing repeated pregnancy terminations, and their risk for subsequent pelvic infections may be multiplied with each succeeding abortion. The incidence of prematurity due to cervical incompetence or surgical infertility after first trimester pregnancy terminations is not increased significantly. Asherman's syndrome may occur after septic therapeutic abortion. The pregnancy rate after treatment of this syndrome is low. The return of menses and the achievement of a pregnancy may be slightly delayed after OCs are discontinued, but the fertility rate is within the normal range by 1 year. The incidence of postpill amenorrhea of greater than 6 months' duration is probably less than 1%. The occurrence of the syndrome does not seem to be related to length of use or type of pill. Patients with prior normal menses as well as those with menstrual abnormalities before use of OCs may develop this syndrome. Patients with normal estrogen and gonadotropin levels usually respond with return of menses and ovulation when treated with clomiphene. The rate for achievement of pregnancy is much lower than that for patients with spontaneous return of menses. The criteria for defining PID or for categorizing its severity are diverse. The incidence of PID is higher among IUD users than among patients taking OCs or using a barrier method. The excess risk of PID among IUD users, with the exception of the first few months after insertion, is related to sexually transmitted diseases and not the IUD. Women with no risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases have little increased risk of PID or infertility associated with IUD use. There appears to be no increased risk of congenital anomalies, altered sex ratio, or early pregnancy loss among spermicide users. All present methods of contraception entail some risk to the patient. The risk of imparied future fertility with the use of any method appears to be low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)This is a comprehensive review of the risk of infertility or adverse effects on pregnancy outcome, such as chromosomal or congenital birth defects, amenorrhea, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), or spontaneous abortion, after use of oral contraceptives, IUDs, induced abortion or spermicides. The sequelae reported for orals are chromosomal abnormalities, the VACTERL anomalies, masculinization of female fetus, Down's syndrome and post-pill amenorrhea. Several large studies found no increased risks for birth defects, although the risk of malformations when pregnant women inadvertently take the pill in early pregnancy was high in 1 of 2 such studies. Masculinization was reported with high dose combined hormone treatment and in 2 infants of a woman who took Enovid. the bulk of recent studies on secondary amenorrhea indicate that it is rare, but just as likely to occur in women with prior normal or abnormal menstrual patterns. One study found that amenorrhea is 7.7 times more likely to develop in women who took the pill to regulate menses. It is recommended that women with amenorrhea be screened for pituitary tumors and counseled before prescribing pills, and that those who fail to ovulate after stopping the pill be treated at least 6 months with clomiphene. A massing of all studies on the impact of 1st trimester induced abortion on subsequent fertility, premature delivery and spontaneous abortion, shows all relative risks around 1.0. After multiple abortions, the results are conflicting. In contrast, prior series analyzing illegal abortion have an unquestioned adverse effect on fertility and pregnancy outcome. Asherman's syndrome, a rare disorder of intrauterine adhesions, menstrual abnormalities, infertility and habitual abortion, has been associated with D & C abortion concurrent with pelvic sepsis, or traumatic pregnancy with D & C. This condition can be treated with moderate success. The bulk of IUD studies conclude that there is no overall decrement in fertility, while some disaggregated studies point the Dalkon shield as a higher risk and copper IUDs as a lower risk. PID and its consequences are now considered related to the immediate post-insertion time frame, or specifically to women who are at risk of contracting sexually transmitted disease, i.e., those with multiple partners, those with prior PID and nulliparas. Comprehensive review of current large series on spermicides shows no relationship between their use and spontaneous abortion or congenital malformation.",

      "abstract": "Sex and the bladderIn the female both the lower urinary and the lower genital tracts derive from the primitive urogenital sinus, and in adult women the urethra and the bladder base are next to the vagina.It is not therefore surprising that sexual activity may cause urinary symptoms and that lower urinary tract dysfunction may cause sexual problems.Many women have an urge to void urine during or immediately after sexual intercourse.'`This has been associated with a rigid perineum and nulliparity causing the posterior wall of the bladder to be irritated with repeated penile thrusting.4The resultant postcoital dysuria is known as \"honeymoon cystitis,\" and is often followed by a urinary tract infection.Organisms are massaged into the bladder during intercourse, and if they are not voided soon after they multiply and cause infection.5Some women are particularly susceptible to such urinary tract infections.They find voiding after intercourse difficult, possibly because of a high intraurethral pressure.6Contraceptive diaphragms may reduce urine flow rate,7 and in a recent epidemiological study the risk of referral to hospital for urinary tract infection was two to three times higher among diaphragm users than among well matched controls.8Postmenopausal women are also at risk of dysuria, urgency, and urinary tract infection after coitus because of the atrophic changes that occur after oestrogen withdrawal and the failure of adequate lubrication during intercourse.4Urinary tract infection in women is so common that self help guides have been published.9For most women acute attacks are associated with sexual activity, and simple measures such as perineal hygiene, change of coital tech- nique, and voiding after intercourse may solve the problem.Diaphragms should be avoided in women with recurrent urinary problems, and postmenopausal women should be given vaginal lubricants and oestrogen replacement therapy.A high fluid intake combined with bicarbonate to alter the pH of the urine and a short course of antibiotics such as trimethoprim or nitrofurantoin are recommended for acute attacks.Chlamydia is difficult to identify as a causative organism but responds to 14-21 days of doxycycline. 10 Urinary incontinence is common among women and appears to have a profound effect on sexual function.Sutherst studied 103 women attending an incontinence clinic; 46% said that their urinary disorder had adversely affected sexual relations.1'Women with unstable bladders (detrusor instability) had a significantly higher incidence of sexual dysfunction than women with genuine stress",

      "abstract": "____________________________________________________________________________________ Objective: To explore the relationship between anemia and preterm birth at the Obstetrics Service of the Rafael Angel Calderon Guardia Hospital during the year 2006. Methods: A Case and Control study was made obtaining the sample from the statistical base of the Labor and Delivery Ward. There were 110 cases and 220 controls.Inclusion criteria were: age between 18 and 35 years, first pregnancy, pregnancy of more than 32 weeks, single pregnancy and live born. Exclusion criteria were: pregnancy complicated by a chronic medical illness or acquired during pregnancy, history of vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, history of urinary tract infection or of other system, alcohol or drug abuse, presence of fetal malformation, induced delivery or elective cesarean section, extrahospitalary delivery and absence or incomplete information. The patients from the control group were admitted to the hospital in the same period of time. Two controls were selected randomly, pared by quinquenal group of age and delivery date. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as in the case group. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin less than 11 g/dl. The magnitude of the association between anemia and preterm birth was evaluated by the odds ratio. Results: The mean hemoglobin value of the cases was 12.3 g/dl (DS + 1.2) versus 12.9 g/dl (DS + 1.1) in the control group. The mean hematocrit of the cases was 36.2% (DS + 3.6) and 38.2% (DS + 3.1) (p < 0.001) in the control group. The percentage of patients with anemia in the control group was 10.9% (n=12) and 4.1% (n=9) in the control group (p< 0.016). The odds ratio showed a positive association between anemia and preterm birth (2.87; CI 95% 1.08-7.69). Conclusion: The present study demonstrated an association between anemia and preterm birth during the third trimester.",

Despite the long history of its study and the gradual decrease in the incidence of such cases, uterine rupture remains one of the most severe manifestations of obstetric trauma. In most cases, without timely assistance, a patient with uterine rupture dies. However, there are situations that, seemingly, can be attributed to casuistry, but personal experience as an obstetrician-gynecologist in the 80-s of the last century in one of the African countries and communication with colleagues who had similar cases in their practice suggest the opposite. The article presents four clinical observations, when women lived for a long time with uterine rupture. Conclusion. When analyzing the clinical signs of uterine rupture which occurred during childbirth, attention should be paid to such a pathognomonic sign as termination of labor activity. This symptom has no other explanation than complete uterine rupture, and should be taken into account when monitoring women in labor, even if the pain syndrome is not pronounced, and hemorrhagic shock has not occurred.

      "abstract": "Background: Vulvovaginal hematoma is a bleeding complication that can occur after vaginal delivery. In this incident, it was found that the delivery assistant was alert in primary care, even though if this complication was not immediately recognized and treated, it could prolong treatment time and even cause death. Purpose: To provide information about cases of vulvovaginal hematoma complications that occur after vaginal delivery to increase the vigilance of birth attendants in primary care. Method: Systematic literature review research on case reports that have been published in international journals in the last 5 years, originating from various countries, using the Google Scholar application and Mendeley.com with the keywords vulvovaginal hematoma. The search results found 7 manuscripts that met the inclusion criteria. Results: Vulvovaginal hematoma after vaginal delivery occurs due to trauma to the internal pudendal blood vessels due to the birth process and/or actions to assist with delivery. This hematoma can occur spontaneously or several hours after delivery and is characterized by the emergence of pain and swelling in the perineal area. This complication can appear with mild to severe clinical manifestations such as shock, so an immediate diagnosis is needed to decide what treatment will be carried out. Conclusion: This literature review provides evidence that there is still no clear consensus regarding the management of vulvovaginal hematoma after vaginal delivery. Immediate resuscitation needs to be carried out to prevent the patient from losing more blood, minimize tissue damage, relieve the patient from pain and avoid the danger of infection. Keywords: Conservative Management; Vaginal Delivery; Vulvovaginal Hematoma. Pendahuluan: Vulvovaginal hematoma merupakan salah satu komplikasi perdarahan yang dapat terjadi pasca melahirkan pervaginam. Pada insiden ini ditemukan kurangnya kewaspadaan penolong melahirkan di layanan primer, padahal jika komplikasi ini tidak segera dikenali dan tangani dapat memperpanjang waktu rawatan bahkan menyebabkan kematian. Tujuan: Untuk memberikan informasi tentang kasus komplikasi hematoma vulvovaginal yang terjadi pasca melahirkan pervaginam sehingga mampu meningkatkan kewaspadaan penolong melahirkan di layanan primer. Metode: Penelitian tinjauan literatur sistematis terhadap laporan kasus yang telah terpublikasi di jurnal internasional 5 tahun terakhir, berasal dari berbagai negara, menggunakan aplikasi Google Scholar dan Mendeley.com dengan kata kunci vulvovaginal hematoma. Hasil penelusuran didapati 7 naskah yang masuk dalam kriteria inklusi. Hasil: Hematoma vulvovaginal pasca melahirkan pervaginam terjadi akibat trauma pembuluh darah pudenda internal akibat proses melahirkan dan atau tindakan dalam menolong melahirkan, hematoma ini dapat terjadi secara spontan maupun beberapa jam setelah melahirkan yang ditandai dengan timbulnya nyeri dan pembengkakan di daerah perineum. Komplikasi ini dapat muncul dengan manifestasi klinis ringan hingga berat seperti terjadinya syok sehingga diperlukan penegakan diagnosis yang segera untuk memutuskan tatalaksana yang akan dilakukan. Simpulan: Tinjauan literatur ini memberikan bukti bahwa, tatalaksana hematoma vulvovaginal pasca melahirkan pervaginam masih belum ada konsensus jelas yang mengaturnya. Resusitasi segera perlu dilakukan untuk mencegah pasien kehilangan darah lebih banyak, meminimalisir kerusakan jaringan, membebaskan pasien dari rasa nyeri serta menghindari bahaya infeksi.

It is classically diagnosed by the presence of hypertension associated with proteinuria manifested in a previously normotensive pregnant woman after the 20th week of gestation. Pre-eclampsia is also considered in the absence of proteinuria if there is target organ damage. The present review takes a general approach focused on aspects of practical interest in the clinical and obstetric care of these women. Thus, it explores the still unknown etiology, current aspects of pathophysiology and of the diagnosis, the approach to disease prediction, its adverse outcomes and prevention. Management is based on general principles, on nonpharmacological and on pharmacological clinical treatment of severe or nonsevere situations with emphasis on the hypertensive crisis and eclampsia. Obstetric management is based on preeclampsia without or with signs of clinical and/or laboratory deterioration, stratification of gestational age in &lt; 24 weeks, between 24 and less than 34 weeks, and ≥ 34 weeks of gestation, and guidance on route of delivery. An immediate puerperium approach and repercussions in the future life of pregnant women who develop preeclampsia is also presented.",

Este é o padrão comportamental mais comum, com o qual um homem se sente sexualmente seguro. Quando isto não ocorre, ele tanto fica preocupado com o tempo de sustentação do pênis, como com o número de penetrações.

Este estudo, realizado durante 15 anos a partir de questionários respondidos por 719 pacientes de diversas faixas etárias, tem dois obje- tivos: chamar a atenção para as causas do sintoma de “ejaculação pre- coce”, que certamente favorece o aumento do número de casos de impotência sexual e eliminar o critério: “precoce” do comportamento se- xual masculino, já que as mulheres estão cada vez mais liberadas, obtendo orgasmo clitorianamente.

The benefits of bed-rest-exercise may alleviate or even prevent physiological distresses or deconditioning associated with activity restriction, thus, eliminating or stabilizing, factors that may augment existing complications. This is the first study to investigate the feasibility of incorporating a bed-rest exercise program in a specific hospitalized twin pregnancy case. The maternal physiological responses of heart rate, blood pressure and uterine contractions to a four week bed-rest resistance program were measured in a woman hospitalized due to complications during her twin pregnancy. A second participant (same diagnoses) was included as a control. The bed-rest-exercise reduced the degree of swelling in the lower extremities, promoted more energy during the day and a better night’s sleep. There were no significant differences in uterine contractions pre vs. post protocol and all babies were born healthy.",

      "abstract": "The postpartum period or puerperium is the period after childbirth is complete, up to 6 weeks or 42 days. During the postpartum period, the reproductive organs will slowly experience changes to the condition before pregnancy. This process of physical change sometimes causes discomfort known as postpartum pain (afterpain). The pain or afterpain is like heartburn caused by contractions of the uterus. This afterpain lasts for 3-4 days post partum and often occurs in multiparas, because the uterus is stretched, uterine contractions tend to occur twice as often as in primiparas. One treatment that can be used to overcome this problem is by applying non-pharmacological therapy to post-partum mothers. Effleurage massage can improve blood circulation throughout the body, maintain health, help reduce pain and fatigue, stimulate the production of endorphins which function to relax the body, reduce stress hormones (cortisol), and balance the work of the body's organs and overcome fatigue. This case study describes the application of effleurage massage to a post partum mother who complained of after pain. After midwifery care was implemented, Mrs. B experienced a decrease in after pain so that the problem could be resolved.",

      "abstract": "Antenatal myomectomy is usually avoided owing to the fear of complications such as miscarriage, damage to the growing foetus due to direct trauma during surgery or due to the drugs that are being used during perioperative period, postoperative complications such as uncontrolled haemorrhage, which may require caesarean hysterectomy, etc. However, if surgery is unavoidable due to various reasons such as intrauterine growth retardation, severe pain, etc., it is usually performed in the second trimester. We report a case of successful antenatal myomectomy during the 20th week of pregnancy. A 29-year-old primigravida presented to the outpatient department of obstetrics and gynaecology in the People's College of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, Bhopal, with chief complaint of abdominal pain with a history of amenorrhoea for 5 months with uterine broid. She is a known case of hypothyroidism. No other signicant history was elicited. Ultrasonography revealed a large subserous broid measuring 22.7 mm×22.8 mm×16.4 mm over the right posterior aspect of uterine fundus. Antenatal myomectomy was performed successfully without any complications, and pregnancy continued until 38 weeks when a caesarean section was performed.

      "title": "[Psychological resistances of women to the principal female methods of contraception. Clinical classification].",
      "abstract": "According to the literature and to the experience of the authors gathered at the family department at the Louvain Faculty of Medicine, these psychological resistances may schematically be classified as follows: normative and socio-cultural resistances; medical resistances (wish of pregnancy, personality traits, narcissm, sexual and technical resistances); psychopathological resistances (unspecific neurotic behavior, phobias, hypochondriasis, obsessive-compulsive neurosis, character neurosis); secondary resistances.Resistance to contraception was classified into sociocultural, medical psychological, and psychopathologic types. Normal sociocultural resistance includes ideas that contraception is unnatural, immoral, mutilating, or too much responsibility. Medical resistance either realistic, subjective, or objective fear of side effects, can occur before a woman begins contraception, e.g., fear of sterility, pain, or gynecologic exams, or resistance after experience with contraception, e.g., resistance due to frequent phychosomatic pill side effects. Psychological resistance may derive from desire for pregnancy, fear of loss of femininity, unresolved oedipal conflicts, need for a child for status, affection, creativity, or to cement a marital relationship. Normal female traits such as passivity, impulsive or irrational tendencies, laziness, fatalism and fear of change can contribute to resistance to contraception. Narcissism can generate resistance to the cost, inconvenience, or side effects such as loss of libido, weight gain, acne, or profuse menses caused by pills or IUDs. Pathological conduct that compromises contraception includes sexual inhibition, frigidity, homosexuality, phobias, obsessions, and hysteria. Women accustomed to tampons or douching and those who have experienced abortion or painless childbirth are less opposed to contraception. The attitudes and information conveyed by physicians, families, and partners are important in lessening contraceptive resistance.",

      "title": "[Steroid intra-uterine contraception: progesterone-releasing devices. II. Insertion, clinical problems and contraceptive dependability].",
      "abstract": "The advantages and disadvantages of the progesterone-releasing intrauterine device (IUD), Progestasert, are investigated, relying on the published literature and the authors' own experiences. Insertion of the Progestasert presents very few problems except in certain cases, particularly in nulliparous women. A complete gynecologic examination is indispensible before insertion to guarantee the absence of contraindications (e.g., pregnancy, anatomically abnormal uterus, tumors, pelvic inflammatory disease, acute cervicitis). Pain or discomfort at insertion appears infrequently, except among nulliparas. Similarly, pain after insertion is rare, but occurs most often in nulliparous women. Because of the insertion technique required for this IUD, cases of perforation of he uterus or cervix are virtually nonexistent. Expulsion of the Progestasert is very infrequent; it appears that incorrect insertion is the primary cause of expulsion. All studies verify a decrease in the expulsion rate after the 1st month of use. The incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease in Progestasert users is significantly lower than in users of other IUDs. This may be due, in part, to the shape of the device, which does not have wide surface areas and has no sharp or pointed edges which can become embedded in the endometrial wall. Additionally, the nature of the insertion device, guaranteeing lack of contact between the transverse arm of the IUD and the vagina, assures the sterility of the IUD even at the moment of introduction into the uterus, limiting the transport of bacteria into the cavity. Lack of sufficient data on ectopic pregnancies in Progestasert users impedes a complete evaluation and definition of the problem with this particular device. One of the most frequent reasons for discontinuing use of the IUD is distrubance of the menstrual cycle. Increase in menstrual blood loss, prolongation of the menstrual period, and intermenstrual bleeding are disturbances found in users of most IUDs. The Progestasert, however, appears to decrease menstrual bleeding and shorten the menstrual period in all cases. The advantages of the Progestasert are indisputable in treating dysmennorhea. All studies agree on the attributes of topical release of progesterone in treating this illness. Studies report disappearance of symptoms in 35% of dysmennorheic patients and a marked reduction of symptoms in 65%. Not enough data exist to draw any conclusions about the teratogenic action of the Progestasert. In normal pregnancies, however, natural progesterone is found in much higher levels than that released by the IUD. Theoretically, the hormone released by the IUD should not interfere with normal fetal development. The failure rate of Progestasert is equal to or lower than that of other IUDs. Overall, the Progestasert represents a remarkable improvement over conventional IUDs.",

      "title": "Vaginal bleeding in adolescents.",
      "abstract": "Abnormal vaginal bleeding in the teenage years usually has nonorganic causes; however, a careful elimination of organic causes is necessary before the diagnosis of dysfunctional uterine bleeding is made. The differential diagnosis in the case of such a complaint and a management plan are discussed.This discussion of vaginal bleeding in adolescents reviews the causes of dysfunctional uterine bleeding (complications of pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease and/or complications of the use of oral contraceptives or IUDs, blood dyscrasias, trauma and foreign bodies, tumors, and other causes) as well as the diagnosis and treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Menstrual irregularities are the most common cause of abnormal vaginal bleeding in adolescence and can be managed easily in the office. On occasion an adolescent needs to be hospitalized for acute menorrhagia; very rarely a surgical procedure such as dilatation and curettage is necessary. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is defined as abnormal uterine bleeding without local anatomic causes. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and requires an adequate examination of the vagina, cervix, and other pelvic organs. Some local bleeding presents as irregular vaginal bleeding in adolescents and is diagnosed as dysfunctional bleeding. The diagnosis of pregnancy and related complications (threatened abortion, incomplete or complete abortion, ectopic pregnancy, and postabortal trophoblastic disease) may present as irregular bleeding in the practitioner's office. A teenager may give a history of pregnancy if she is questioned about it closely and confidentially. A high index of suspicion will help the clinician to make this diagnosis. Salpingitis should be suspected in any teenager who presents with low abdominal tenderness, pain, abnormal bleeding, low grade fever, and tenderness on cervical movement. Approximately 10% of teenagers with blood dyscrasias present with cyclic hypermenorrhea. Vaginal ulcerations and objects introduced into the vagina occasionally cause irregular bleeding. Such tumors as clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vaginal and sarcoma botyroides may present as metrorrhagia. These etiologic factors comprise as most only about 5% of adolescents who complain of irregular vaginal bleeding. The most common cause of such bleeding is anovulation or oligoovulation due to the noncyclic release of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) during adolescence. Although the most common cause of this cyclic disturbance is the hypothalamic pituitary ovarian axis, some well known endocrine disorders can also produce this picture. 95-97% of adolescents will have no organic reason for their irregular bleeding. The diagnosis of dysfunctional uterine bleeding is then made. Detailed suggestions are provided on how to proceed which will prevent grave errors in the diagnosis and treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding in adolescents. The patient who has been bleeding very heavily and has a hematocrit less than 30 may have to be hospitalized. A medical D and C can be done with a progestational agent. Such patients may need a transfusion of packed cells and should be kept on oral iron. They also need cycling with Ovral for 2-3 months and must be followed carefully.",

The girl whose mother had a bad obstetric history may be vulnerable to extra psychological disturbance if she has obstetric troubles herself when she grows up. If mourning is achieved, another pregnancy will offer consolation and fulfilment. Unfortunately, the new pregnancy very often cuts short the mourning process, predisposing to mental disturbance. Normal recovery from a loss involves taking in what has happened, and sorting out mixed feelings and lost hopes so that memories of the dead recede to a healthy perspective. During pregnancy after a stillbirth, it is particularly difficult for a woman to think through mixed feelings towards the dead baby pictured inside herself whilst at the same time trying to grapple with her thoughts and feelings about the new baby whose safety is her immediate chief concern.",

Of those who do, some will require only information and advice, but around 25% have problematic symptoms that may need treatment. Vasomotor symptoms are the main reason that women seek treatment. Hormone replacement therapy is effective for vasomotor symptoms, but for some it is unsuitable (due to preference or contraindications) and non-hormonal treatments can be considered.\n\nThis update provides an overview of the evidence supporting non-hormonal treatments for vasomotor and vaginal symptoms, and translates this into practical guidance on managing these symptoms in clinical practice.\n\nThe menopause is the final menstrual period. The “perimenopause” or “menopause transition” is the time from the onset of menstrual cycle changes until one year after the final menstrual period.1\n\nChanges in vaginal bleeding patterns and vasomotor symptoms characterise the menopause transition, but the overall experience is highly variable and may be influenced by psychological, social, and cultural factors.2 Common symptoms include hot flushes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms) and genital symptoms (vaginal dryness, dyspareunia), which may be accompanied by mood and sleep disturbance.3 …",

      "title": "Sleep disorders in pregnancy",
      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy. The spectrum of association between pregnancy and sleep disturbances ranges from an increased incidence of insomnia, nocturnal awakenings, and parasomnias (especially restless legs syndrome) to snoring and excessive sleepiness. These disturbances occur as a result of physiologic, hormonal, and physical changes associated with pregnancy. Although the timing and occurrence of different sleep disorders varies, they are most prevalent during the third trimester. Despite reports of the various sleep problems, the exact nature and incidence of sleep disorders in pregnancy is not known. Given that limitation, we are presenting an up-to-date review of the current understanding of the relation between sleep and pregnancy.Studies suggest that pregnancy affects sleep in multiple ways. There are hormonal changes, physiologic changes, physical factors, and behavioral changes in a pregnant woman-all of which may affect her sleep. They may affect the duration and quality of sleep and lead to a variety of sleep disorders. Pregnancy may also affect an existing sleep disorder. Particular attention may be given to obese pregnant women who would gain more weight during pregnancy or those who develop hypertensive conditions (eg, preeclampsia). Snoring may be more common in women with preeclampsia and the pressor responses to obstructive respiratory events during sleep may be enhanced in preeclamptic women when compared with those with obstructive sleep apnea alone. Several investigators have suggested that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may be common in pregnant women despite the presence of intrinsic mechanisms that seem to be geared towards preventing sleep apnea. However, the exact incidence and prevalence of sleep apnea in pregnant women is uncertain. In addition, it is unclear if criteria that are used to define sleep apnea in the general population should be applied to pregnant women. Further investigations are needed to determine if lower thresholds for management of OSA should be used in pregnant women to prevent harm to the fetus.In conclusion, sleep disturbances are common during pregnancy though the full extent of this relation remains undefined. Large, multi-center, prospective studies are needed for better understanding.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between heavy physical stress and reproductive function in sportswomen has received comparatively little attention. In some young sportswomen an onset of menarche which is later than average has been found. Studies of menstrual rhythm in women who train hard have not given any decisive answers, but individual observations indicate a certain deficiency of ovarian function or delay in ovulation. The performance level may be lowered during the actual period of menstruation, but even here the evidence is poor. Whether or not modern methods of contraception such as the pill and intra-uterine devices have any influence on performance is an open question. There is no objective evidence that training is harmful during pregnancy, or that it causes problems in labour, neither does the experience of labour appear to influence later performance.",

      "title": "Wann sind der Verdacht auf eine Berufskrankheit oder urologische Folgen eines Arbeitsunfalls anzuzeigen?",
      "abstract": "Physicians are obliged to report the suspected presence of an occupational disease to the German Social Accident Insurance Institutions or to the state authority responsible for occupational health and safety. In the field of urology, tumors of the urinary tract are the most common, followed by the less common renal cell cancer and mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis; however, for such a suspicion to arise at all, sufficient knowledge of urological occupational diseases must be present and the occupational or work history over the entire training and working life since the beginning of employment must be collected. In daily life the notification often fails at this point. In addition to the legal foundation and the principal course of the procedure, this article explains how a relevant comprehensive medical history by means of questionnaires can contribute to the fact that neither too many or all tumor diseases are unreflectedly reported, nor that occupational diseases are overlooked due to the lack of a medical history or detailed knowledge (or fear of this). Urological sequelae of accidents are often not adequately appreciated in the primary process or may take a long time to develop. In this case reporting the aggravation of the consequences of the accident is essential.Ärztinnen und Ärzte sind verpflichtet, den Verdacht auf das Vorliegen einer Berufskrankheit an den Unfallversicherungsträger oder an die für den medizinischen Arbeitsschutz zuständige Landesbehörde zu melden. Am häufigsten sind im urologischen Fachgebiet Tumoren der harnableitenden Wege, gefolgt von den selteneren Nierenzellkarzinomen und den Mesotheliomen der Tunica vaginalis des Hodens. Damit ein solcher Verdacht sich aber überhaupt einstellt, muss ein ausreichendes Wissen über die urologischen Berufskrankheiten vorhanden sein und die Berufs- bzw. Arbeitsanamnese über das gesamte Ausbildungs- und Erwerbsleben seit Beginn der Erwerbstätigkeit erhoben werden. Im täglichen Alltag scheitert die Meldung oft schon an diesem Punkt. Im vorliegenden Beitrag wird neben den rechtlichen Grundlagen und dem prinzipiellen Ablauf des Verfahrens erläutert, wie eine diesbezügliche umfassende Anamnese mittels Fragebögen dazu beitragen kann, dass weder unreflektiert zu viele oder alle Tumorerkrankungen gemeldet, noch dass durch mangelnde Anamnese oder Detailkenntnis (bzw. der Angst davor) beruflich bedingte Erkrankungen übersehen werden. Urologische Unfallfolgen werden oft im Primärverfahren nicht ausreichend gewürdigt oder können sich erst mit langer Verzögerung entwickeln. Hier ist eine Meldung der Verschlimmerung der Unfallfolgen essentiell.",

Blood testing and examination of the pelvis, ovaries and tubes, precede the operation. Local anesthetic is injected in several points around the cervix after insertion of the speculum into the vagina. The cervical canal is dilated by passing rods of gradually increasing size; when dilatation is completed a plastic tube is inserted into the uterus and connected to a suction apparatus with enough power to withdraw uterine contents without harming any other tissue. Very often the uterus is checked with a curette when the aspiration is completed. A rest of 1-2 hours is advisable before leaving the hospital. A woman undergoing this type of abortion will usually experience some degree of uncomfort but no pain; cramping sensations similar to period pain are also possible; spotting can be experienced after termination of the procedure.",

      "abstract": "La sindrome premestruale e rappresentata da un complesso di sintomi caratterizzati non solo da cambiamenti psicologici, che includono irritabilita, aggressivita, tensione, ansieta e depressione, ma anche da disturbi somatici dovuti alla ritenzione di liquidi come gonfiore, aumento di peso, edema, tensione mammaria e cefalea prima dell’inizio del ciclo mestruale. Le cause della sindrome premestruale non sono ancora del tutto chiare ma sono state attribuite a diversi fattori quali cambiamenti ormonali, neurotrasmettitori, prostaglandine, dieta, farmaci e stile di vita; di conseguenza risulta difficoltoso l’approccio terapeutico. Il ruolo degli ormoni ovarici non e chiaro, anche se i sintomi spesso migliorano quando l’ovulazione viene soppressa. Vitex agnus-castus e una pianta che contiene una miscela di iridoidi e flavonoidi ed alcuni componenti simili, per struttura, agli ormoni sessuali che sono stati isolati da foglie e fiori. Gli effetti di Vitex agnus-castus sono stati descritti come simili a quelli del corpo luteo. Abbiamo valutato gli effetti di Vitex agnus-castus in uno studio prospettico, randomizzato in un gruppo di adolescenti di eta compresa tra i 17 ed i 25 anni con sindrome premestruale. Il trattamento e stato effettuato per tre cicli mestruali consecutivi. Abbiamo arruolato 72 pazienti suddivise in tre gruppi; il primo gruppo ha eseguito trattamento con Vitex agnus-castus (una compressa al di), il secondo ha eseguito trattamento con contraccettivi orali contenenti drospirenone ed il terzo gruppo ha utilizzato placebo. I sintomi, quali ritenzione idrica, dolore, ricerca incondizionata di cibo, alterazioni nel tono dell’umore, sono stati documentati attraverso l’uso di un questionario compilato giornalmente dalle adolescenti e per mezzo del quale e stato calcolato un punteggio prima e dopo il trattamento. Il punteggio calcolato in base al PMSD (diario sindrome premestruale) nel primo gruppo trattato con Vitex agnus-castus ha mostrato un netto decremento; esso infatti e passato da 29.23±7.63 (punteggio iniziale) a 4.28±5.76 (dopo il trattamento). Il secondo gruppo trattato con contraccettivi orali ha mostrato un risultato sovrapponibile al primo; e passato infatti da 29.38±7.88 a 4.17±5.7 alla fine del trattamento. Infine, il terzo gruppo trattato con placebo ha riportato un decremento del punteggio da 28.76±8.23 a 11.79±11.78. Abbiamo dunque evidenziato un netto miglioramento della sintomatologia da sindrome premestruale nel gruppo trattato con Vitex agnus-castus rispetto al gruppo con placebo, mentre i risultati ottenuti con trattamenti con contraccettivi orali sono sovrapponibili a quelli di Vitex agnus-castus. La tollerabilita di Vitex agnus-castus e migliore rispetto a quella dei contraccettivi orali. In conclusione, Vitex agnus-castus ha mostrato di essere una sostanza sicura, ben tollerata ed efficace nelle adolescenti con sindrome premestruale moderata e severa.",

      "abstract": "In the context of the body, the essentially female; wombs, menstrual cycles, and concurrent hormones, have seen women ascribed madness, insatiability, untrustworthiness, and danger. Female bodies have been identified in selective parts, considered in abstract, or envisaged as having overwhelming power over the mind. “Hysteria”, the problematic neurosis of uterine origin was at the heart of early psychoanalysis. This diagnosis enshrines a slippage from the physical to the fantastical, and ultimately to the denial of the lived reality of women’s and girl’s bodies. In apparent collusion with patriarchy the neglect of some female bodily experience is perpetuated in contemporary psychoanalytic theory. Nowhere is this more evident than around menopause and hysterectomy (as experienced by either client or therapist). There has been little or no exploration of how practitioners might best support clients for whom menopause is significant, or how we might facilitate women before or after gynaecological surgery. It is as if removal and psychological loss of the same female body parts that our forebears used to so neatly differentiate, diagnose, and pathologise women are now not of note. I am interested as to how we as psychotherapists reclaim female body narratives from this outdated theoretical paradigm to best serve clients experiencing menopause, gynaecological surgery, and mid life in the twenty-first century.",

      "title": "Treatment of complete subacute postpartum uterine inversion: the case report",
      "abstract": "Acute postpartum uterine inversion is a rare and unpredictable complication, usually in the third stage of labor, with the development of massive hemorrhage and shock, which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. An even more rare scenario faced by the gynecologist is subacute uterine inversion. Most often, postpartum uterine inversion is caused by early or excessive traction on the umbilical cord and/or pressure on the fundus of the uterus before separation of the placenta (Crede maneuver) during the third stage of labor. The diagnosis is based on clinical data - the presence of a smooth round mass protruding from the cervix or vagina. When examining the abdominal cavity, the key finding is the absence of the uterine fundus during palpation in the area of its normal location. Management of postpartum uterine inversion includes: return of the uterine fundus to the correct position, prevention and treatment of postpartum hemorrhage and shock, prevention of repeated inversion. The aim is to describe the features of diagnosis and treatment of subacute postpartum uterine inversion of the IV degree. Clinical case. A report of a clinical case of subacute postpartum uterine inversion of the IV degree in a 29-year-old woman in labor, who was successfully treated using the Huntington's procedure and subsequent total hysterectomy with fallopian tubes, is presented. Conclusions. Given that acute postpartum uterine inversion is an extremely rare clinical phenomenon in obstetric practice, early recognition of this pathology is a difficult task, especially in cases of inversion of the I or II degree, when it can imitate a myomatous nodule. Although rare, uterine inversion should be carefully evaluated in any case of maternal collapse in the presence of signs and symptoms such as postpartum hemorrhage, lower abdominal pain, and/or the presence of a smooth, round mass protruding from the cervix or vagina. For the most favorable prognosis, not only early high-quality diagnosis is important, but also timely treatment in order to avoid the need for hysterectomy. In cases of subacute and chronic uterine inversion, surgical treatment should be considered, since the inverted walls of the uterus have reduced elasticity due to involution. This study did not involve any experiments on animals or humans. Written informed consent for treatment and publication of this case was obtained from the patient. No conflict of interests was declared by the authors.",

The influence of menstruation on the body of a woman with a nervous predisposition is more complex. In these cases, the influence of the appearance of the first menstruation is especially pronounced, when sometimes an insignificant moment is enough only for the girl to develop epilepsy, hysteria, atrial melancholy, etc. It also happens the other way around: the onset of menstruation improves the course of already existing nervous suffering, for example, chorea. The influence of each menstruation is less pronounced, when menstruation has already been established, while painful menstruation (amenorrhoea, menorrhagia) affect the nervous state of women more sharply",

      "title": "Migräne in speziellen hormonellen Situationen",
      "abstract": "ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Bei der menstruellen Migräne gibt es verschiedene spezifische Therapieoptionen. So kann ca. 4–5 Tage vor dem erwarteten Menstruationsbeginn ein Östradiolpflaster mit 50 µg pro Tag für wenigstens 7 Tage als Kurzzeitprophylaxe ausprobiert werden; bei Unwirksamkeit kann dies mit 100 µg pro Tag wiederholt werden. Eine hormonelle Kontrazeption mit einem Mischpräparat oder Mehrphasenpräparat kann probatorisch abgesetzt werden. In besonderen Fällen ist eine durchgehende hormonelle Kontrazeption bis zu 2 Jahre sinnvoll. Patientinnen mit Migräne und Endometriose zeigen während der Menstruation höhere CGRP-Werte als in der Zyklusmitte, wohingegen dies bei Frauen ohne Migräne und Kontrollprobandinnen umgekehrt ist. Dies deutet auf eine mögliche Rolle von CGRP in den perimenstruellen Schmerzattacken hin. Weiterhin ist die Lebensqualität bei Patientinnen mit Migräne und Endometriose deutlich stärker beeinträchtigt als bei nur einer Erkrankung. Daher ist es klinisch relevant, diese Komorbidität zu berücksichtigen. Eine hormonelle Frau-zu-Mann-Transition geht mit signifikant mehr Kopfschmerzen einher als die umgekehrte Transition. Bei der Mann-zu-Frau-Transition scheint sich dagegen häufiger eine Migräne zu bilden, insbesondere mit Aura. Die Behandlung der Kopfschmerzen und der Migräne erfolgt wie bei anderen Betroffenen auch, allerdings muss die erhöhte Thromboseneigung durch die Hormonbehandlung berücksichtigt werden.",

      "title": "‘Phantom Kicks’: Women’s Subjective Experience of Foetal Kicks after the Postpartum Period",
      "abstract": "During pregnancy, a woman will attribute increased abdominal sensations to foetal movement. Surprisingly, many women report that they feel kick sensations long after the pregnancy, however this experience has never been reported in the scientific literature. Here, we show that almost 40% of women in our sample experienced phantom foetal kicks after their first pregnancy, up to 28-years (average 6.8-years) post-partum. Using a qualitative approach, we found that women describe the phantom sensations as ‘convincing’, ‘real kicks’ or ‘flutters’. Twenty-five percent of women described the experience as positive, and 27% reported felt confused or upset by the experience. Our results demonstrate that phantom kicks in the post-partum period are a widely experienced sensation, that may have implications for a woman’s post-partum mental health. The mechanism behind the phantom kick phenomenon is unknown, but may be related to changes in the somatosensory homunculus or proprioception during pregnancy.",

Women typically become symptomatic from the bulging vaginal wall or related organ dysfunction once this descent reaches the introitus. POP is a common condition, affecting more than half of adult women. Many women presenting to an urologist for stress urinary incontinence or overactive bladder will have associated POP; therefore, it is important for urologists who treat these conditions to be familiar with its diagnosis and management. While POP is part of the core urology training curriculum in some jurisdictions, it is not in Canada.1 This article reviews the diagnosis of POP, including pertinent symptoms to query in the history, important facets of a systematic pelvic examination, and the appropriate use of ancillary tests. Treatment options are also discussed, including conservative measures, pessaries, and various reconstructive and obliterative techniques.",

Premenstrual exacerbation of psychiatric illness is a common phenomenon, and it is treatable; however, research is limited and evidence-based guidelines for treatment are sparse.

      "abstract": "Millions of girls and young women in resource-poor countries are living in shame and isolation often abandoned by their husbands and excluded by their families and communities. They usually live in abject poverty shunned or blamed by society and unable to earn money many fall deeper into poverty and further despair. The reason for this suffering is that these young girls or women are living with an obstetric fistula (OF) due to complications which arose during childbirth. Their babies are also probably dead which adds to their depression pain and suffering. An OF is an abnormal opening between a womans vagina and bladder and/or rectum through which her urine and/or faeces continually leak. Naturally these women are embarrassed that they are unable to control their bodily functions that they are constantly soiled and wet and that they smell. Their pain and shame may be further complicated by recurring infections infertility damage to their vaginal tissue that makes sexual activity impossible and paralysis of the muscles in their lower legs which may require the use of crutches if any are available. The greater tragedy is that these OF can largely be avoided by delaying the age of first pregnancy by the cessation of harmful traditional practices and by timely access to maternal and obstetric care. They can be repaired by simple surgery. (excerpt)",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION: La presencia de prolapso vesical o cistocele es un problema muy frecuente en las mujeres, que causa un gran deterioro en la calidad de vida. La perdida del soporte muscular a nivel pelviano, produce secundariamente el estiramiento de los ligamentos utero-sacros y la perdida del soporte apical de la vagina, que contribuye a empeorar el cistocele y produce un descenso cervical.\nEn la consulta pre-anestesica se evalua el estado fisico previo y las patologias que podrian influenciar, tanto el comportamiento intra-operatorio como posterior recuperacion, no solo anestesica sino quirurgica. Esto se realiza a traves de la clasificacion del estado fisico ASA. Los factores relacionados con el riesgo anestesico podrian influir en loa resultados del tratamiento quirurgico y el el pronostico de la enfermedad.\nLa recuperacion funcional de las pacientes sometidas a reparacion quirurgica del cistocele varia de una persona a otra y esto es debido a una serie de factores atribuibles al propio estado fisico de la paciente, ademas de otros factores no propios de la patologia a tratar.\nHIPOTESIS:\n Factores relacionados con el riesgo anestesico podrian influenciar en la recuperacion funcional despues de la correccion quirurgica del cistocele.\nOBJETIVOS:\n1. Conocer los diagnosticos secundarios identificados en el estudio de riesgo anestesico que estan presentes en las pacientes del estudio.\n2. Determinar la proporcion de mujeres intervenidas por cistocele que presentan complicaciones de la intervencion y que complicaciones retrasan la recuperacion funcional.\n3. Evaluar el tiempo que tardan en reincorporarse a su actividad habitual las pacientes operadas de cistocele.\n4.Conocer factores relacionadas con el riego anestesico que influyen en la recuperacion funcional de las pacientes con cistocele tratadas quirurgicamente.\n MATERIAL Y METODO:\n Se trata de un estudio observaciones, multicentrico de caracter retrospectivo. Se revisaron historiales clinicos de 1000 mujeres intervenidas de cistocele.\n La muestra se obtiene por seleccion secuencias de forma sucesiva y retrospectiva a todas las pacientes intervenidas.\n En el estudio se distinguieron tres grupos: Grupo A: Pacientes con cistocele sometidas a correccion quirurgica con riesgo anestesico ASA I.\nGrupo B: Pacientes con cistocele sometidas a correccion quirurgica con riesgo anestesico ASA II.\nGrupo C: Pacientes con cistocele sometidas a correccion quirurgica con riesgo anestesico ASA III.\nRESULTADOS Y CONCLUSIONES:\n1.Los diagnosticos secundarios mas presentes en las pacientes con cistocele son: Hipertension arterial, trastornos digestivos, dislipidemia y depresion y el tratamiento concomitante mas frecuente son las benzodiacepinas.\n2. Una de cada 10 pacientes intervenidas quirurgicamente de cistocele presentan una complicaciones relacionada con la intervencion, como sangrado, dolor o infeccion, que impide la reincorporacion a la vida laboral ordinaria o causa malestar y deterioro significativo en las pacientes intervenidas.\n3. La edad se relaciona con el riesgo anestesico, sin embargo, no se relaciona con el tiempo de recuperacion en caso de complicaciones de la intervencion.\n4. El indice de masa corporal se relaciona con el riego anestesico y con el tiempo de recuperacion en caso de complicaciones de la intervencion.\n5. El tiempo que tardan en reincorporarse a su actividad habitual las pacientes operadas de cistocele, si hay complicaciones de la intervencion ( 8,93 dias ), es superior a si no las hay ( 5,8 dias ).\n6. El factor que mas produce demora en la recuperacion funcional es el dolor, siendo de peor control en pacientes ASA II respecto a ASA III o ASA I.\n7. El sangrado como complicacion es mas frecuente en mujeres ASA III. Los tratamientos antiagregantes son mas frecuentes a mayor riesgo anestesico.\n8. La infeccion es un factor de retraso en la recuperacion sin diferencia entre los diferentes grupo de riego.",

Sebagian besar wanita tidak mengetahui masa klimakterium yaitu suatu proses perubahan yang alami menjelang menopause. Mereka khawatir dan bingung mengenai gejala- gejala yang menyertai, oleh karena itu perlu persiapan diri menghadapi masa klimakterium dengan pengetahuan yang memadai. Tujuan: penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui fenomena kecemasan wanita dalam menghadapi masa klimakte- rium. Metode: Jenis penelitian ini adalah kualitatif dengan menggunakan pendekatan fenomenologi. Populasi dalam penelitian ini adalah seluruh ibu masa klimakterium yang tinggal di RT 01 RW 01 Kelurahan Candi Kota Semarang. Subjek penelitian sebanyak 4 informan. Pengumpulan data dengan indept interview. Hasil: penelitian menunjukkan bahwa semua subjek pada umumnya telah memahami tentang masa klimakterium dan menopause. Pada tiga informan mengalami kecemasan terhadap masa klimakterium yang ditandai dengan beberapa gejala seperti pusing, susah tidur, rasa panas, takut, dan sebagainya. Pada subjek pertama hal tersebut tidak dirasakan, dan hal ini wajar karena subjek pertama telah melewati masa menopause. Simpulan : Para subjek penelitian umumnya memiliki cara-cara tersendiri dalam menghadapi kecemasan. Cara- cara koping yang baik dilakukan oleh para subjek untuk menyelesaikan berbagai permasalahan pada masa klimak- terium. ABSTRACT Background: Women climacterium will occur during certain changes that can cause disturbances in mild to severe. Most women climacterium not know that this change was a process of natural menopause. They were worried and confused about the symptoms that accompany therefore face the need to prepare themselves with sufﬁcient knowl- edge about climacterium. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the phenomenon of anxiety in the face of the climacterium woman . Method: The method in this research is qualitative by using a phenomenological approach. This study used the research subjects were four informants were all the climactrium mothers who live in Candi subdistrik Semarang. Data was collected by indept interview. Results: showed that all subjects in general have to understand what was meant the climacterium and menopause. In the three informants experiencing anxiety about the advent of this climacterium which was marked by several symptoms such as dizziness, insomnia, burning sensation, fear, and so forth. At the ﬁrst subject the matter was not felt, and this was reasonable because the ﬁrst subject has passed through menopause. Conclusion: The research subjects generally had their own ways in dealing with anxiety. Ways of coping were either done by the subject can ﬁnally solve the various problems well too.",

      "abstract": "• Adequate study of mother and fetus before the second stage of labor improves the chances for a successful delivery in cases of breech presentation. Normal labor is anticipated if the pelvis is adequate, the fetus of normal size, the cervix completely dilated, and the delivery proceeding spontaneously under light anesthesia. The delivery of choice is a spontaneous one with assistance offered for the delivery of shoulders and head. Obstacles that arise will generally be at the breech, the body, the shoulders, or the head. For each, certain procedures exist, and the obstetrician should be prepared to apply them as needed. The rule that the time allowed for delivery of the head after the umbilicus has reached the vulva should not exceed eight minutes needs reconsideration. A slow methodical delivery, extending the time to perhaps 15 minutes, is less likely to injure the fetus permanently than is the application of excessive pressure or undue haste in placing forceps. Post-partum examination of the maternal soft parts should extend to the interior of the uterus. Understanding, skill, patience, and consultation will save many lives.",

They are involved in maintaining normal life critical systems (nervous, cardiovascular, immune, etc.), determining the cellular synthesis of proteins, lipids, energy complexes, the activity of enzyme systems, basic electrolytes balance and activity of life processes in cells. As a result, the estrogen deficiency in menopause and sometimes in premenopausal period leads for various clinical manifestations of this deficiency in the form of disease states. Often they have a distinct character that is as the basis for the classifying them to separate nosological form – climacteric syndrome that manifests neuro-vegetative, psycho-emotionaland metabolic-endocrine complexes of symptoms.The clinical and laboratory examinations in 71 patients of the climacteric age were performed to detect the neuro-vegetative imbalance of hormonal status in women with the preserved menopause and preserved menstrual function.The main group included 42 women with physiological menopause an average age of 45.32 years and postmenopause duration of 2.08 year (subgroup Ia, n = 22) and 4,32 years (subgroup Ib, n = 20); control group included 29 women with retained physiological menstrual cycle an average age of 44.69 years.These women conducted a comprehensive examination, hormonal studies, instrumental examination (ultrasound study of genitals, thyroid and breast, colposcopy). The severity of climacteric syndrome was determined by Kupperman menopausal index in EV Uvarova modification.It was established that intensity of the neurovegetative syndrome symptoms decrease in 6.8% with increasing duration of menopausal. Steroid concentrations and hypothalamic hormones value depending on menopause duration and their levels changes in depending on the hypoestrogenia duration.",

If the breast development is deficient after the age of 14, further diagnostic steps should be undertaken in order to exclude abnormalities of sexual differentiation.

There is increasing evidence that chronic pain affects a higher proportion of women than men around the world; unfortunately, women are less likely to receive treatment. Moreover, women generally experience more recurrent pain, more severe pain and longer-lasting pain than men. Pain conditions are more prevalent in women such as fibromyalgia, chronic pelvic pain and lumbopelvic pain during pregnancy and postpartum. Gender differences in pain sensitivity, pharmacological therapy, and nonpharmacological pain interventions have also been reported. It is becoming evident that gender differences in pain and its relief arise from an interaction of genetic, anatomical, physiological, neuronal, hormonal, psychological and social factors that modulate pain differently.",

Intricately choreographed events leading to successful gestation are sometimes imperfect and accidents of gestation adversely impact reproductive success. Embryonic death is often arbitrarily subdivided into early embryonic death and embryonic death later in development, without a universally accepted definition of the stage of development separating the two. Most cases of fetal death resulting in a mummified fetus occur between the third and sixth month of gestation, with occasional reports in more advanced pregnancies. Severely deformed calves will not readily conform to the physical limitations imposed by the birth canal at parturition and result in memorable dystocias necessitating fetotomy or cesarean section.",

      "title": "PWE-001 Anal problems during pregnancy and postpartum: a prospective cohort study",
      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> Many pregnant women have anal symptoms during pregnancy and postpartum. The most common proctological problems reported are haemorrhoids, anal fissures and anal incontinence. Literature about this problem is scarce. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of anal problems and constipation during the second and third trimester of pregnancy, in the immediate postpartum and up to three months after childbirth. We also want to identify the risk factors for the development of anal symptoms. <h3>Method</h3> This is a prospective cohort study. Women between their 19th and 25th week of pregnancy are included. High-risk pregnancy and non-Dutch speaking are exclusion criteria. Ninety-four women were followed with a symptom questionnaire in the second and third trimester, in the immediate postpartum (within 3 days) and three months postpartum. Descreptive data were obtained from the patient files. A specific proctological diagnosis was presumed on the basis of combined symptoms (rectal bleeding, anal pain and swelling). Constipation was defined by the Rome III criteria. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS and risk factors were identified using multivariate analysis with binary logistic regression. <h3>Results</h3> Sixty-eight percent of the women developed anal symptoms during the whole study period. Anal symptoms occured in 50% of the women during pregnancy, in 56,2% in the immediate postpartum and in 62,9% during the three months postpartum. The most prevalent symptom was anal pain. Constipation was reported by 60,7% during the whole study period. The most prevalent diagnoses were: hemorrhoidal thrombosis (immediate postpartum), hemorrhoidal prolaps (3rd trimester and immediate postpartum) and anal fissure (not episode-related). Anal incontinence was only reported in 2% during the postpartum. Multivariate analysis identified constipation and a history of anal problems as significant risk factors for the development of anal complaints pre-and postpartum. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Two thirds of pregnant womed deal with anal symptoms during pregnancy and/or postpartum, especially hemorrhoidal complications and anal fissure. This high prevalence emphasises the clinical importance of this problem. The most important risk factor is constipation. Therefore, prevention of constipation pre-and postpartum is recommended. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None Declared",

      "title": "Neonaticide and Pregnancy Denial",
      "abstract": "Neonaticide is the killing of a newborn child within 24 hours of birth. It differs from filicide, a general term for a parent killing a child at any point in life, and infanticide, a parent killing a child between 24 hours and one year of life. Unlike infanticide or filicide, neonaticide is typically unrelated to underlying psychiatric illness. Instead, it has an established link with pregnancy denial. Pregnancy denial denotes pregnancy recognition after 20 weeks' gestation. Complete or pervasive pregnancy denial is the lack of recognition of pregnancy until the onset of labor or following delivery. Affective pregnancy denial occurs when a person has cognitive knowledge of the pregnancy but lacks emotional recognition of the pregnancy. Neonaticide can occur following pregnancy denial, commonly through psychological dissociation, a response that mentally separates the mother from the events occurring during the birth. The mother may then mistake the neonate for a stillborn, abandon the child, or actively kill the child during the dissociative reaction. Pregnancy denial occurs at a rate of 1 in 300–475 pregnancies. In isolation from pregnancy denial, neonaticide is rarer and occurs at a rate of 0.12–27.7 per 100,000 births, depending on geographic location. Women who commit neonaticide tend to be heterogeneous in age, marital status, and educational attainment. Risk factors for pregnancy denial and neonaticide include prior pregnancy, prior pregnancy denial, and irregular menses. Correlates of pregnancy denial include a lack of prenatal care, preterm birth, and giving birth alone. Babies born to mothers with pregnancy denial are more likely to be killed by neonaticide, require treatment in a neonatal intensive care unit, be of low birth weight, and have a psychomotor development issue or speech disorder. Immediate prevention of neonaticide includes screening for at-risk women. Policy change is one of the most significant factors to consider in the long-term reduction of neonaticide. Cultural considerations for neonaticide and pregnancy denial are most relevant when considering gender differences of affected neonates and the handling of neonaticide by criminal justice systems in different countries. In summary, pregnancy denial, the lack of awareness of pregnancy, is a misunderstood psychological phenomenon highly linked with an increased risk of neonaticide, the killing of a child within 24 hours of birth.",

Experimental, clinical and epidemiological studies, led on a wide scale, showed high therapeutically activity and good drug tolerability, especially for low doses in adult and children older then 6 months. Those data let to positioned ibuprofen to over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. However, unlike well-documented tolerability studies of the postnatal period the prenatal data are still unclear. Results of experimental studies showed ibuprofen-dependent: implantation disturbances, blocking of parturition, and contraction of ductus arteriosus what could produce persistent pulmonary hypertension. These data has been partially confirmed in human studies. Lack teratogenic effect was observed in in vivo animal studies. Gastroschisis is the only congenital ibuprofen-related malformation that was proved in big epidemiological human studies. Other congenital anomalies and disturbances, such as oligohydramnion, associated with maternal ibuprofen ingestion, and reported in available literature, have not been established in epidemiological studies.",

These may be positive, e.g. bringing a release from fears of pregnancy leading to an increased sexual enjoyment. More often though the perimenopause brings negative physical effects, such as erratic heavy periods, hot flushes and vaginal dryness and also negative psychological effects such as depression and low libido. Other negative factors may include psychosocial changes such as coping with ageing parents and teenagers, and increased vulnerability to disease of the reproductive organs, which obviously affects sexuality. Thus the perimenopause is a time of high risk for sexual problems of all kinds. As perimenopausal women may be reluctant to complain about sexual difficulties, it is helpful for health professionals to be aware of this and ask them about their sexual lives. Sexual problems will thus be identified early at a stage when they are easier to treat.",

      "abstract": "Background: Menopause is a condition in which women experience physiological failure of ovarian function, as a result of the loss of activity of the ovarian follicles. Menopause is the stage when a woman's menstrual bleeding stops. At the age of 50 years, women enter menopause so that there is a decrease or loss of the hormone estrogen which causes women to experience complaints or disorders that often interfere with daily activities and can even reduce their quality of life. Objectives: to determine risk factors, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and management of climacteric. Methods: collecting and analyzing journals using pubmed search media, google scholar, NCBI, ScienceDirect with keywords Conclusion: The climacteric phase consists of premenopause, perimenopause, menopause and postmenopause phases. The premenopause phase is the period for 4-5 years before the onset of menopause. This phase begins when a woman is 40 years old, characterized by irregular, prolonged menstrual cycles, little or a lot of menstrual blood, and sometimes accompanied by pain. The perimenopause phase is a transitional phase between pre-menopausal and postmenopausal. This phase is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles and levels of Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and highly variable estrogen (normal, high, or low). The menopausal phase is the condition of women who have no longer menstruating calculated after 12 months from the last menstruation, which is characterized by blood FSH levels &gt;35 mIU/ml and estradiol levels &lt;30 pg/ml.",

Kecemasan merupakan respons terhadap stress yang umumnya memiliki fungsi adaptif yang menyiagakan kita terhadap bahaya nyata dan memotivasi kita untuk bersiap dan menghadapi berbagai situasi. Akan tetapi, ketika perasaan kecemasan muncul berlebihan dan secara signifikan mengganggu fungsi individu. Wanita hamil sebagian besar mengalami kekhawtiran, kecemasan, dan ketakutan baik selama hamil dalam menghadapi persalinan maupun setelah persalinan. Kecemasan yang dirasakan umumnya adalah takut perdarahan, takut bayinya cacat, takut terjadi komplikasi kehamilan, takut sakit saat melahirkan dan takut bila dijahit. Selain itu juga rasa takut terjadi komplikasi pada saat persalinan, yang dapat menimbulkan kematian, hingga kekhawatiran jika kelak tidak bisa merawat dan membesarkan anak dengan baik. Tanpa disadari ketakutan proses melahirkan akan tertanam pada pikiran bawah sadar dan akhirnya tertanam sebagai program negative. Adanya perasaan takut melahirkan yang akan selalu diikuti dengan nyeri, akan menyebabkan peningkatan kerja sistem saraf simpatik. Tujuan; Memberikan terapi musik klasik pada ibu hamil trimester tiga untuk mengurangi kecemasan ibu hamil trimester tiga. Metode Penelitian; Menggunakan metode diskriptif dengan instrumen penelitian menggunakan kuesioner. Hasil; Setelah diberikan terapi musik klasik pada kedua responden sebanyak 7 kali dalam 7 hari dengan durasi 30 menit, kecemasan kedua responden menurun. Kesimpulan; Terapi musik klasik terbukti mampu mengurangi kecemasan pada ibu hamil trimester tiga.\r\nKata kunci : Terapi musik klasik, kecemasan, ibu hamil trimester tiga",

Socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to a wide range of maternity services including Cesarean section (CS), whereas the most common medical and non-medical factors are labor dystocia, fetal mal-presentation, multiple gestations, suspected fetal macrosomia, placenta previa, placenta abruption, prolonged labor, fetal distress, birth defects, repeated cesareans, chronic health condition, cord prolapse, cephalopelvic dis-proportion (CPD), preeclampsia, bleeding, IUGR (Intrauterine growth restriction), uterine rupture, gestational diabetes, pelvic tumors, vesico-vaginal fistula repair, AP (anterior and posterior) repair and IUD (intrauterine devices).The aim of this study was to determine the rate of CS and socio-demographic, obstetric and non-obstetric factors influencing the incidence of cesarean section (C-section). This study was conducted at Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Peshawar for a period of 8 months. A standardized questionnaire was made by investigator to evaluate social and physiological status, obstetric factors, and non-obstetric- factors. 400 CS patients participated in this study. The findings of this study showed different socio-economic factors (ethnic variances, age occupation, income status) affecting cesarean section (C- section) delivery rates. The highest CS rate (39.25%) was in the age group of 26-30 years and in non-working women (61.5%). Moreover the high education of pregnant females is greatly associated with C-section rates because of the frequent visits for antenatal care during their pregnancy. Frequency of CS in overweight and obese women were found 139 (34.75%) and 198 (49.5%) of the total cases. As far as obstetric code was concerned, nulliparous women (62.5%) are more likely to be delivered by caesarean section as compared to Multipara 36.8% and Grand Multipara 0.8% when labor is induced.",

      "abstract": "The pathologist encounters the early, first-trimester conceptus as a product of spontaneous or surgical abortion or as a specimen from ectopic, usually tubal, gestation. In the vast majority of cases of spontaneous abortion, the embryo/fetus has been dead for 1 week to several weeks and is most often lost in the process of uterine emptying; the placenta, accordingly, stands as the main \"witness\" of the abortive process. The fact of embryonic/fetal death is established and dated through an interpretation of gross and microscopic changes in the villous stroma, including its vessels and the embryonic erythrocytes therein. Elective abortions performed for social reasons occasionally yield abnormal findings that suggest gestations otherwise destined to eventual spontaneous abortion. Other therapeutic abortions are indicated by abnormal sonographic or cytogenetic findings that may be correlated with the morphologic features of the evacuated conceptus. Cytogenetic abnormalities correlate to a high degree with embryonic growth disorganization and with early death, usually before the fetal stage (30 mm) is reached. Adequate sampling of the placenta, its membranes, and of the embryo/fetus is recommended. For cytogenetic studies, clean, viable specimens must be obtained; these are most often required in cases of habitual abortion.",

The cause is often multifactorial, but physical activity often aggravates it. Because denial is commonplace, at each yearly gynecologic exam primary care physicians should ask patients about urologic problems. If a problem exists, a urinary questionnaire and voiding diary can help determine the nature of the condition. In addition, a thorough medical, urologic, and gynecologic history can help pinpoint the cause. Physical exam can reveal such conditions as neurologic deficits and pelvic floor weakness, and other tests can rule out infection and other disorders. Conservative treatment, which may involve drugs, pelvic floor strengthening, and mechanical devices, often restores continence.",

It has also been reported to follow sudden increases in intra-abdominal pressure such as coughing or, sneezing before contraction of uterine muscles, delivery of a baby with cord around the neck, giving birth in sitting or erect position, precipitated labour [4] and very rarely during caesarean section [1]. Even though individual risk factors do commonly occur, rarity of the condition indicates that these factors must act in unison to culminate in an inversion of the uterus.",

Bila dihitung dari saat fertilisasi hingga lahirnya bayi, kehamilan normal akan berlangsung dalam waktu 40 minggu atau 10 bulan atau 9 bulan. Selama proses kehamilan terdapat beberapa perubahan yang dapat terjadi dan dialami oleh ibu hamil. Perubahan ini berupa perubahan sistem tubuh ibu yang membutuhkan adaptasi baik fisik ataupun psikologis. Perubahan yang sering dialami ibu selama kehamilan adalah mual muntah, pusing, nyeri punggung, flek hitam pada wajah, kram pada kaki, kenaikan berat badan, insomnia, dan sering berkemih (Irianti, 2013). Pada kehamilan akupresur sering digunakan sebagai alternatif pengobatan non farmakologi untuk mengatasi ketidaknyamanan ibu selama kehamilan karena pengaruh perubahan-perubahan fisiologis. Perubahan fisiologis dalam kehamilan yang dapat menggunakan akupresure sebagai alternatif diantaranya seperti pusing, meningkatkan kualitas tidur, mual muntah, mengurangi kecemasan, dan nyeri punggung. Proses pengobatan dengan teknik akupresur menitik beratkan pada titik – titik saraf tubuh, di kedua telapak tangan dan kaki kita terdapat titik akupresur untuk jantung, paru – paru, ginjal, mata, hati, kelenjar tiroid, pankreas, sinus, dan otak (hasanudin Kep, 2015).&#x0D; Kegiatan intervensi mengajarkan Teknik serta menjelaskan teori akupresur Pericardium PC 6 ( Penekanan dengan ibu jari yang dilakukan dengan lembut membentuk lingkaran , 3 jari di Bawah pergelangan tangan dengan 30 kali putaran / 30 detik ) dilakukan sesering mungkin di saat ibu hamil masih ada rasa mual dan di saat melakukan akupresure ibu hamil harus rileks , posisi duduk nyaman dan tenang, akupuntur ini dilakukan selama 2 minggu.",

In spite of the tendency of the last few years to interfere less and less in obstetric cases without positive indications, it may be safely said that if the placenta is not spontaneously delivered within two hours after the birth of the child, some pathologic condition is present which necessitates interference. Usually the presence of hemorrhage or other symptoms will further an earlier diagnosis, and the question generally lies between two closely",

      "abstract": "This review evaluates the status of the evidence that exercise training affects the menstrual cycle beginning with evidence for the existence of delayed menarche, amenorrhea, and luteal suppression in athletes. A later age of menarche and a higher prevalence of amenorrhea and luteal suppression have been observed in athletes, but there is no experimental evidence that athletic training delays menarche, and alternative sociological and statistical explanations for delayed menarche have been offered. Cross-sectional studies of amenorrheic athletes have revealed abnormal reproductive hormone patterns, suggesting that the GnRH pulse generator in the hypothalamus is failing to initiate normal hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function. Longitudinal data show that the abrupt initiation of a high volume of aerobic training can disrupt the menstrual cycle in at least some women, but these women may be more susceptible to reproductive disruption than others, and some aspect of athletic training other than exercise (such as caloric deficiency) may be responsible for the observed disruption. Luteal suppression may be an intermediate condition between menstrual regularity and amenorrhea in athletes, or it may be the endpoint of a successful acclimation to exercise training. A potential endocrine mechanism of menstrual disruption in athletes involving the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is discussed. Finally, promising future directions for research on this topic are described.",

      "abstract": "Obesity has been identified as one of the risk factors for male sexual dysfunction, and it also has a certain impact on fertility. For people with obesity, sexual function is an important aspect of quality of life, but it is often overlooked. Society's stigma against obesity exacerbates the psychological stress of patients with obesity and negatively affects sexual function. Current studies have found that bariatric surgery can reduce body weight and improve sexual function in patients with obesity, and obesity-related gonadal dysfunction is also improved or even subsided after surgery. However, attention needs to be paid to postoperative body mass management and mental health status of patients to prevent postoperative body mass recovery and reversal of sex hormones and sexual function. In addition, there is still controversy about the change in sperm quality after bariatric surgery, and there is a lack of research data on sexual function and sperm parameters and mechanisms after bariatric surgery. Therefore, this article reviews the latest research progress of bariatric surgery and sexual dysfunction, as well as related mechanisms and sperm parameters, to provide a reference for bariatric surgery in patients with obesity with sexual dysfunction.肥胖已被确认是男性性功能障碍的危险因素之一，其对生育能力也有一定的影响。对于肥胖者来说，性功能是生活质量的一个重要方面，但经常被忽视。社会对肥胖的污名化使肥胖患者的心理压力加剧，对性功能造成负面影响。目前研究发现，减重手术可以使肥胖患者的体质量减轻和性功能改善，肥胖相关性腺功能障碍也在术后得到改善甚至消退。但是需要注意术后的体质量管理和评估患者的心理健康状态，防止术后体质量恢复导致性激素和性功能逆转。然而，针对减重术后精子质量的变化仍存在争议，国内目前也缺乏有关减重术后性功能、精子参数及其机制的研究数据。因此，本文综述了减重手术与性功能障碍以及相关机制和精子参数的最新研究进展，为肥胖合并性功能障碍的患者进行减重手术治疗提供参考。.",

      "abstract": "Disorders of sexual development (DSDs) are heterogenous group of disorders characterized by discrepancy in chromosomal, gonadal, and phenotypic sex. DSD is a Medico-Social Emergency. 5 α reductase type 2 deficiency is one of the rare causes of 46 XY DSD. The degree of under virilization varies from clinically female to a near male phenotype. Müllerian structures were absent. At puberty, there might be features of virilization. Gender incongruence or dysphoria occurs frequently during puberty. An important marker for diagnosis is an elevated testosterone to dihydrotestosterone ratio in the basal state or following HCG stimulation. All 46 XY DSD require an appropriate molecular diagnosis prior to gender assignment and gender reassignment surgery. Gender reassignment surgery and/or Gonadectomy should be performed only after 18 years if there are compelling indications like suspicion of malignancy or presence of gender dysphoria or gender incongruence.",

      "title": "Maternal microvascular dysfunction during preeclamptic pregnancy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy effecting ∼5–8% of pregnancies in the United States, and ∼8 million pregnancies worldwide. Preeclampsia is clinically diagnosed after the 20th week of gestation and is characterized by new onset hypertension accompanied by proteinuria and/or thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, impaired liver function, pulmonary edema, or cerebral or visual symptoms. This broad definition emphasizes the heterogeneity of the clinical presentation of preeclampsia, but also underscores the role of the microvascular beds, specifically the renal, cerebral, and hepatic circulations, in the pathophysiology of the disease. While the diagnostic criteria for preeclampsia relies on the development of de novo hypertension and accompanying clinical symptoms after 20-week gestation, it is likely that subclinical dysfunction of the maternal microvascular beds occurs in parallel and may even precede the development of overt cardiovascular symptoms in these women. However, little is known about the physiology of the non-reproductive maternal microvascular beds during preeclampsia, and the mechanism(s) mediating microvascular dysfunction during preeclamptic pregnancy are largely unexplored in humans despite their integral role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide a summary of the existing literature on maternal microvascular dysfunction during preeclamptic pregnancy by reviewing the functional evidence in humans, highlighting potential mechanisms, and providing recommendations for future work in this area.",

      "abstract": "To develop guidelines regarding prevention and treatment of pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence in patients qualified to hysterectomy. The Polish Gynecological Society formed a work group to develop guidelines. The work group formulated the following guidelines: 1. Since the hysterectomy per se is a risk factor for pelvic organ prolapse, more conservative procedures to hysterectomy should be considered and applied, whenever it is possible. 2. Pelvic organ prolapse is not the indication for hysterectomy. 3. Not all lesions of the uterine cervix without concomitant pathological changes of the uterine corpus are indications for hysterectomy. 4. During both abdominal and laparoscopic hysterectomy the fixation of vaginal vault to sacro-uterine and round ligaments, McCall procedure, Burch procedure and paravaginal defect repair should be done as a prevention or treatment of pelvic organ prolapse. 5. During vaginal hysterectomy, sacrospinal colpopexy or McCall procedure is recommended. 6. In cases of hysterectomy performed due to oncological indications, prophylactic fixation of the vaginal vault to sacro-uterine and round ligaments is recommended. In these cases, the repair of the defects of DeLancey second and third level are not recommended because of postradiotherapy vaginal vault shortening and stenosis. In most of oncological indications for hysterectomies, the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence should be postponed until the radiotherapy has been completed.",

      "abstract": "GSM includes wide spectrum of vulvovaginal Symptoms and urinary troubles replacing the term vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA). It is a silent epidemic condition affecting 50-60% postmenopausal women. Estrogen withdrawal causes thinning, narrowing, tissue loss & reduced blood supply in vulvo-vaginal area, which results GSM. GSM causes burning in vagina, dyspareunia, urinary urgency, repeated UTI. Dyspareunia affects all the domain of sexual function and deteriorates the quality of life. Irony is, women are oblivious to share and doctors are reluctant to discuss. So women keep continue suffering without knowing the restorative treatment. Repercussion of GSM/VVA intensifies the sorrows, distress and sufferings. It has profound effect on relationship and psychology and quality of life of women. Good history taking and clinical examination do diagnosis. Investigations are done to exclude other causes. Treatment is challenging. Maintenance of optimum body weight, exercise, regular coitus, quitting smoking & excessive alcohol intake are the key factors. Vaginal moisturizers are recommended as 1st line therapy for mild to moderate VVA or women who can’t take estrogen. Ideal moisturizers should have similarity with vaginal secretion of osmolality, pH and composition. Meta analysis shows local estrogen therapy is effective. It restores vaginal pH and maturation index. Systemic absorption is minimal so progesterone needs not to be added. Testosterone improves dyspareunia, sexual desire, lubrication and satisfaction. DHEA (Prasterone) penetrates vaginal wall better. It increases elasticity and vascularity of vagina. RCTs have not shown benefits of it’s systemic therapy. But local daily administration of DHEA reduces dyspareunia and GSM so improves the quality of life. Ospemifene is well tolerated. It’s agonist effect on vaginal mucosa and antagonist effect on endometrium and breast, makes it promising. Lasofoxifene, third generation SERM, is also very effective but it needs FDA approval. Laser is widely being used and very effective. It is simple, faster, painless procedure. It activates dominant fibroblasts, proteoglycans, hyaluronic acid, thereby improves GSM & sexuality. Black cohosh, Botox, G-shot, probiotics, gabapentin are not yet evidence based. Still there is significant unmet need for medical treatment. Women reports GSM but that is only tip of iceberg. Good communication and optimum treatment only can break the sorrows GSM/VVA.",

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that more than 50% of postmenopausal women suffer from at least one of these symptoms. They cause not only discomfort, but may also negatively influence sexual health. Many women are so embarrassed that they are unable to discuss their dilemma with other women or their doctor. Embryologically the female genital tract and urinary systems develop in close proximity, both arising from the primitive urogenital sinus. Animal and human studies have shown that the urethra is oestrogen sensitive, and oestrogen receptors have been identified in the urethra, urinary bladder, the vagina and the pelvic floor muscles. There is now a wealth of evidence to support the efficacy of exogenous oestrogens in the treatment of urogenital symptoms caused by postmenopausal ovarian insufficiency.",

Determination of the onset and possible causes of androgen deficiency or infertility is essential for determination of a rational diagnostic evaluation. For example, in the adult man who has testes are very small (≤6 cc each) has prepubertal onset of male hypogonadism. Congenital causes of hypogonadism such as Klinefelter syndrome and Kallmann syndrome become much more likely as aetiologies whereas acquired causes such as sellar masses and metabolic disorders such as hemochromatosis more commonly present postpubertally (because they take time to progress to hypogonadism) or there are clues to the acquired causes such as major testicular or hypothalamic disease or surgery when they occur pre- or peripubertally. Finally, the history and physical examination is indispensable in determining the potential benefits and risks of therapy for man with suspected androgen deficiency or infertility. This chapter introduces the reader into the rationale approach history taking and the physical examination of the man with possible hypogonadism.",

Recent evidence has suggested that certain medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism may cause PE.

      "abstract": "Pelvic organ prolapse (POP), caused by damage of the support system in the pelvic floor, is downward descent of female pelvic organs, resulting in protrusion of the vagina, uterus, or both. It has been reported recently that POP has a prevalence of 3%6% when defined by symptoms and up to 50% based on a vaginal examination [1]. POP is basically divided into anterior vaginal wall prolapse and posterior vaginal wall prolapse. The most common type of POP is anterior vaginal wall prolapse, clinically known as the cystocele [2]. Most POP patients have damages in the support muscles or ligaments or both of them. Biomechanical nature of POP is of great significance for clinical prevention and treatments. Risk factors for POP include vaginal delivery, chronic increased intraabdominal pressure caused by obesity, chronic respiratory disease and/or related cough, chronic constipation, repetitive occupational activities, and pregnancy [3,4]. However, the mechanism of POP remains unclear. Delancey [5] divided the support system of the pelvic floor into three levels (Figure 1). The first level is provided by the cardinal and uterosacral ligaments. The second level includes the “hammock-like” levator ani muscle and pelvic fascia that covers the muscles and provides reinforcements. The third level is the distal support by the perineal body, counteracting the downward gravity of the organs. Figure 1 (color online) Three levels of the support system of the normal pelvic floor.

      "title": "Efficacy of Connective Tissue Therapy and Abdominal Stretching Exercises in Individuals With Primary Dysmenorrhea: A Review",
      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhea is a menstrual disorder characterized by painful uterine cramps that occur during menstruation. There are two types of dysmenorrhea, primary and secondary. It affects 45-95% of all menstruating women worldwide. The prevalence in India is approximately 75%. Primary dysmenorrhea diagnosis is based on the patient's medical history and physical examination. If the history of start and duration of lower abdominal discomfort suggests secondary dysmenorrhoea or if the dysmenorrhoea does not respond to medical treatment, a pelvic examination is necessary to evaluate dysmenorrhoea. Because of the increasingly large number of women who are impacted by primary dysmenorrhea, it should be a public health concern that authorities must address. Abdominal stretching is a very simple, efficient, and risk-free workout. Some of the benefits of stretching exercises for dysmenorrhea include increased elasticity and strength of the spine and pelvic muscles and reduction in pain. The knee-to-chest exercise in combination with hydrocollator packs has a significant effect in improving the pain and the monthly irregularities in primary menstrual pain. Massage of connective tissue is a form of cutaneous stimulation that tries to stimulate the connective tissue's mechanical receptors. Connective tissue massage studies for treating a range of dysfunctions usually indicate that patients treated with this modality get pain alleviation and even complete remission.",

The owners were then contacted 2 weeks and 6 to 12 months after treatment to gather any information on effects noted over this period. The major questions were, was pregnancy prevented and if so what side effects were observed, if any, and whether any metropathies were diagnosed. Also noted was the beginning of the next heat and, if the bitch was mated, the fertility rate. Pregnancy was seen in only one bitch. In 51 bitches minor side effects, either singularly or in combination, such as a transient itch, vaginal discharge, reduced appetite, tiredness or attachment were observed. The fertility was not influenced by the treatment and the incidence of metropathies was unchanged.",

      "abstract": "Hemorrhage and maternal mortality in the world. It is universally defined as blood loss greater than 500 ml after vaginal delivery or 1,000 ml after a C-section. Early postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is that which occurs during the first 24 hours after delivery and is usually the most severe. The late is what happens after 24 hours after delivery until 6 weeks after it. The causes of PPH include uterine atony, traumas / lacerations, retention of products of conception and coagulation disorders, the most frequent being atony. The diagnosis is clinical and the treatment must cover general life support measures and other more specific ones of aetiological nature. Fortunately, it is largely avoidable in most cases if an adequate prevention strategy is followed, both actively and systematically in the delivery phase of all deliveries. As for the induction of labor, it refers to a set of maneuvers aimed at initiating and maintaining uterine contractions that modify the neck and cause fetal expulsion after the 28th week of gestation. In most hospitals around the world, induced labor represents a small number of total deliveries. Induced labor leads to greater morbidity than that which occurs naturally. Therefore, when choosing the artificial induction of labor it is necessary to rely on a clear indication and balance the risk-benefit ratio. On the contrary, the conduction of labor is the process by which the uterus is stimulated to increase the frequency, duration and intensity of contractions after the spontaneous onset of labor. The technique has been frequently used to treat prolonged labor when it is determined to be due to poor uterine contraction. Traditional methods used to speed up labor have been the use of intravenous infusion of oxytocin which is the drug of choice for the delivery of labor",

      "title": "Can time to menopause be predicted?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Menopause represents the definite end of a woman’s reproductive life and the onset of a persistent hypoestrogenic state. This postmenopausal period will for most women last several decades. Although mean menopausal age seems to have increased somewhat during the last century, there is a significant individual variation in age at natural menopause. With efficient contraception, women of reproductive age can now, to some extent, choose when they want to have children. As a consequence of this and other sociodemographic changes, age at first birth has increased significantly over the last 50 years. It is well documented that long before a woman enters the menopausal transition and subsequent menopause, fertility declines and finally ceases. Being able to predict when a woman will enter menopause would therefore, from a reproductive perspective, be of major interest. Several sociodemographic, morphometric, and endocrine factors are associated with age at menopause or time to menopause. Unfortunately the sensitivity and specificity of these in predicting time to or age at menopause are low. Therefore, with the exception of anti‐Müllerian hormone measurements, either alone or in combination with chronological age close to menopause, there are as of now no reliable ways of predicting when a woman will enter menopause.",

Recommendations• Measuring testosterone or other androgens is not indicated for the diagnosis of androgen deficiency.• Consider prescribing testosterone in physiological doses for women after natural or surgical menopause or those with premature ovarian failure who present HSD without any other cause (dyadic, iatrogenic, psychic, etc.) and without contraindications to its use.• During the reproductive period, including perimenopause, the prescription of testosterone in physiological doses is only indicated in the presence of HSD, and is not indicated for improving body composition or well-being.• When prescribed, the transdermal route is preferred.The oral route should be avoided.• As there are no industrialized products containing testosterone, manipulated testosterone is used.For this reason, serum testosterone measurement is recommended before starting use and after three months for the control and maintenance of physiological levels.• If there is no improvement in sexual function within three to six months, its use should be discontinued.• Available evidence points to low risk in using transdermal testosterone for up to three years.",

      "abstract": "Normal labor is characterized by regular and painful uterine contractions that conclude in progressive labor. A discussion on abnormal labor patterns is reviewed as abnormalities of the first stage (cervical dilation to complete cervical dilation) and the second stage (descent of the presenting part leading to delivery of the baby). The third stage of labor describes the expulsion of the placenta. An overview of labor abnormalities encompasses all the stages of labor. First and second-stage abnormalities are described either as protraction disorders (which means that delivery is progressing but is lower than normal) or as arrest disorders (complete cessation in progress). Abnormal third-stage labor meriting intervention is placenta retention beyond 30 minutes, as most third stages are concluded within the first 10 to 20 minutes of delivery.Normal labor is characterized by regular and painful contractions that conclude in delivering the fetus and placenta. Labor is divided into three stages and subsequent phases within each stage: First Stage: 0-10 cm Latent phase Active phase Second Stage: decent of presenting part leading to the delivery of the fetus Latent (complete cervical dilation to the onset of active maternal expulsive efforts) Active (beginning of active maternal expulsive efforts to the expulsion of the fetus) Third Stage: placental expulsion Abnormal labor patterns in the first and second stage are defined as either protraction or arrest disorders. Protracted labor stages indicate that labor is progressing but at a slower pace than expected. Arrest disorders indicate the complete cessation of the progress of labor. Abnormal third-stage labor warrants intervention when the placenta is retained > 30 minutes. The following criteria should be kept in mind when labeling the labor as First Stage Protraction and ArrestLatent PhaseProtraction: In nulliparas women: Not entered the active phase by 20 hours after onset of the latent phase. In multiparas women: Not entered the active phase by 14 hours after the onset of the latent phase. Arrest: Due to its slow progression, latent phase arrest is not considered a clinical entity.Active PhaseProtraction: Women at ≥6 cm dilation, dilating less than approximately 1 to 2 cm/hourArrest: Cervical dilation ≥6 cm in a patient with ruptured membranes and No change in the cervix for ≥4 hours despite adequate contractions (defined as >200 Montevideo units [MVU]) No change in the cervix for ≥6 hours with inadequate contractions Second Stage ProtractionThere is no appropriate length defined for the diagnosis. However, the following criteria can be utilized in the presence of favorable maternal and fetal condition: For nulliparous women: More than four hours for the second stage or three hours of pushing. For multiparous women: More than three hours for the second stage or two hours of pushing.",

Impairment in libido and excitement usually has a psychic cause, apart from rare endocrinological abnormalities such as hyperprolactinaemia and androgen depletion. Another possible cause is chronic use of certain drugs. Causes of erection disorders can be classified on the basis of psychogenous, vascular and neurogenous factors. Ejaculation disorders are caused by embryonal anomalies, neurological disorders and use of certain (psychoactive) pharmaceutical agents. Collecting sperm proves to be virtually always possible. According to current views, the treatment of infertility in ejaculation disorders or anorgasmy should be if possible, elimination of the primary cause or else: in-vitro fertilisation (IVF)/intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI) with semen obtained after processing a retrograde ejaculate or by means of vibro-ejaculation or electro-ejaculation.",

Women have a risk of experiencing depressive illnesses that is twice that of men. Women with depression also typically experience greater functional impairment. The incidence of depression dramatically increases during the reproductive years, which correspond to ages 25 to 44 years. During this time frame, women may experience several reproductive milestones or transitional events such as menarche, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, infertility, miscarriage, and perimenopause/menopause. These transitions evoke neuroendocrinologic changes that appear to influence the risk for depressive episodes. Common disorders associated with these hormonal fluctuations include premenstrual dysphoric disorder, postpartum depression, and depression in the perimenopausal transition. Although the specific pathophysiologic association is still unclear, evidence supports that these reproductive transitions influence the risk of depression in women.",

We report such a case in a 31-year-old primigravida with heterotopic pregnancy which is a fetus in the uterine cavity and the other in the abdominal cavity. Her pregnancy was initially misdiagnosed and managed as a di-amniotic di-chorionic gestation. The correct diagnosis was only made after term delivery of the intrauterine pregnancy. The patient was complicated with severe bleeding which led to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and massive transfusion. Two other operations were imposed on the patient because of bleeding.

La violencia obstétrica se ha definido como la apropiación del cuerpo de la mujer por parte del personal de salud a través de prácticas que redundan en la medicalización y patologización de sus procesos reproductivos. Esta violencia puede ser psicológica (p. e., regaños, negativa a responder a preguntas o realizar un plan de parto ajustado a sus expectativas), física (p. e., uso innecesario de la fuerza o querer causar dolor intencionalmente) y/o sexual (p. e. comentarios de naturaleza sexual referidos a su cuerpo o genitales, etc.). También se puede verificar mediante la realización de prácticas que están desaconsejadas o estrictamente prohibidas (p. e., monitorización fetal continua, uso de oxitocina sintética para agilizar el procedimiento, negación de la libertad de movimiento, maniobra de Kristeller, episiotomía de rutina, entre otros). No existen a la fecha escalas validadas que permitan detectar violencia obstétrica en la atención de salud. Método: Se analiza la fiabilidad (alfa y omega) y se aportan pruebas de la validez (análisis factorial confirmatorio) de la escala de VO. Las participantes de la muestra fueron 367 mujeres, mayores de edad, de la región de Valparaíso (Chile), que habían tenido alguna vez un parto. Los resultados apoyan la validez de la escala de VO y la estructura unifactorial propuesta muestra un buen ajuste (CFI = .94, NFI = .91, IFI = .94 y RSMEA = .067); también apoyan la idea de invarianza a través de diferentes muestras (ΔCFI &lt; .01 y ΔRSMEA &lt; .01), toda vez que la escala de VO demuestra ser un instrumento confiable (α = .83 y ω = .88). Por lo tanto se concluye que la escala de VO es un instrumento fiable y válido para la detección de este tipo específico de violencia contra las mujeres.",

      "abstract": "Importance Peripartum separation of the pubic symphysis is a rare but potentially severe complication of childbirth, which may lead to prolonged immobilization. Thus, prompt diagnosis and treatment are paramount. Objective The purpose of this review is to define peripartum separation of the pubic symphysis and provide a thorough review of its etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic imaging techniques, management, and prognosis. Evidence Acquisition This was a literature review using PubMed and Google Scholar. Results Peripartum pubic symphysis separation is defined as disruption of the pubic symphysis joint and ligamentous structures with greater than 1 cm of separation during delivery. Risk factors include fetal macrosomia, nulliparity, and precipitous labor. Patients often present with a sensation of something “giving way” in the pubic symphysis area at the time of delivery, or with severe pain in the pubic symphysis region with attempted mobilization postpartum. In severe cases, associated hematomas, pelvic fractures, sacroiliac joint disruption, and urinary tract injury may be seen. Imaging such as x-ray or ultrasound may be used to confirm the diagnosis. Although most patients recover well with conservative management, orthopedic surgical intervention may be indicated in more severe or unresolved cases. Conclusions and Relevance Pubic symphysis separation is increasingly identified peripartum due enhanced accessibility and utilization of imaging modalities. It can be debilitating and lead to prolonged immobility postpartum. Therefore, early recognition and diagnosis are important, as this can guide decision-making for management. A multidisciplinary team approach, including coordination with obstetrics, orthopedic surgery, physical therapy, and occupational therapy should be used for early detection and treatment to ensure optimal patient outcomes. Target Audience Obstetricians and gynecologists, family physicians. Learning Objectives After completing this activity, learners should be better able to define peripartum separation of the pubic symphysis and discuss the relevant anatomy involved; identify risk factors associated with peripartum separation of the pubic symphysis; describe the typical presentation of a patient with separation of the pubic symphysis and next steps in making the diagnosis; and explain both conservative and orthopedic surgical intervention methods for treatment of peripartum separation of the pubic symphysis.",

      "title": "Management of secondary amenorrhea induced by injectable contraceptive through Ayurveda: A case report",
      "abstract": "Secondary amenorrhea refers to the absence of regular menstrual periods for at least three menstrual cycles with previous regular cycles or for six months with irregular cycles. Depo-Provera is an injectable contraceptive containing 150 mg of Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA), which is a long-acting reversible contraceptive given intramuscularly. Menstrual abnormalities, especially secondary amenorrhea, is the most common side effect of this contraceptive method. Here, the case report of a 39-year-old female with absence of menstruation for three years after receiving five doses of injection DMPA intramuscularly consecutively at an interval of three months is being presented. The case may be correlated with Artavanasha (~absence of menstruation) due to Kapha avritta vata (~disorders of Vata occluded by Kapha ) in the Artavavaha srotas (~fallopian or uterine tubes), affecting Artava nirmana (~formation of menstrual blood) and its Nishkramana (~expulsion) as per Ayurveda classics. The patient was provided with oral medications, including Gandharvahastadi kwatha, Sukumara ghrita, Sahacharadi kwatha, and Balarishta for three months . There was significant relief in the associated complaints, such as dyspareunia and weight gain, with restoration of regular menstrual cycles without the need for further medication.",

      "title": "[Contraception and sexuality].",
      "abstract": "Earlier age at menarche, a longer reproductive life, and fewer desired births have been factors in the increasing importance of contraception in the life of women and couples. This work assesses the optimal contraceptive methods for different physiological phases of affective and sexual life and for various sexual problems. Contraception should prevent pregnancy, not promote sexually transmitted diseases and disorders of the genital tract, and preserve future fertility. The 1st gynecological consultation, even for very young girls, has 3 main objectives: detecting anomalies of the genital tract, ensuring that no physiological problems will arise in the 1st intercourse, and providing contraception if it will be needed in the relatively near future. The physician should speak directly to the young patient instead of to her mother. Hormonal contraception is preferred for adolescents with regular sexual activity, but for the majority who have episodic and irregular sexual relations other methods may be preferable. Condoms provide some protection against sexually transmitted diseases but require cooperation from the male partner. Vaginal sponges which can be left in place for 24 hours are easier to use than other vaginal methods. The \"morning after\" pill is available in case of unprotected coitus. The unplanned and unstable sexuality of adolescents is increasingly followed by a period of regular and continuous premarital sexual relations requiring reliable and continuous contraception. The pill remains the best choice for its efficacy, tolerance, and safety. Various formulations are available in case of contraindications to the classic combined pill. IUDs should be formally contraindicated because of the possibility of extrauterine pregnancy or salpingitis. Mechanical methods can be used for short periods but should not replace a more effective method on a permanent basis. The IUD may be a good choice for women who have completed their families. Oral contraceptives may be continued for premenopausal women without other cardiovascular risk factors. High dose progestins derived from 17 hydroxyprogesterone are recommended in case of luteal insufficiency. Premenopausal women whose sexual relations have become less frequent may prefer IUDs, local methods, or tubal ligation. Sexual difficulties of couples should be considered in selecting a method. Frigid women do not tolerate contraception well because fear of pregnancy is their excuse for avoiding sex. IUDs may be more satisfactory than pills in such cases because they do not require daily action. Pills may be the best choice in cases of premature ejaculation or impotence.",

      "title": "<i>The Pathophysiology of Amenorrhea in the Adolescent</i>",
      "abstract": "Menstrual irregularity is a common occurrence during adolescence, especially within the first 2–3 years after menarche. Prolonged amenorrhea, however, is not normal and can be associated with significant medical morbidity, which differs depending on whether the adolescent is estrogen‐deficient or estrogen‐replete. Estrogen‐deficient amenorrhea is associated with reduced bone mineral density and increased fracture risk, while estrogen‐replete amenorrhea can lead to dysfunctional uterine bleeding in the short term and predispose to endometrial carcinoma in the long term. In both situations, appropriate intervention can reduce morbidity. Old paradigms of whom to evaluate for amenorrhea have been challenged by recent research that provides a better understanding of the normal menstrual cycle and its variability. Hypothalamic amenorrhea is the most prevalent cause of amenorrhea in the adolescent age group, followed by polycystic ovary syndrome. In anorexia nervosa, exercise‐induced amenorrhea, and amenorrhea associated with chronic illness, an energy deficit results in suppression of hypothalamic secretion of GnRH, mediated in part by leptin. Administration of recombinant leptin to women with hypothalamic amenorrhea has been shown to restore LH pulsatility and ovulatory menstrual cycles. The use of recombinant leptin may improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of hypothalamic amenorrhea in adolescents and may also have therapeutic possibilities.",

ClassificationMany conditions cause pelvic pain, and a classification is of little practical use other than to remind the clinician of the possibilities to be considered.Problems of pregnancy-abortion, ectopic pregnancy, round ligament pain, degeneration of fibroids, unexplained uterine pain.",

Climacteric is also used interchangeably with the broader term menopause, which is originated from greek word meno and pausis (cessation) that means menstrual periods stops permanently. The word climactic is derived from Latin word climactericus and greek word klimacterikos which mean critical point of life. Mostly With these critical changes body image effect negatively. The aim of study is to assess how the negative impact change into positive with physical activates. Climacteric consist four phases premenopausal, perimenopausal, menopausal and postmenopausal. With the regular physical workout climacteric symptoms can be delayed.The most significant support with the work outis to provide strength to the bone mass and cardiorespiratory syste. If the women should focus on 30 minutes of moderate activity in every week oxygen consumption in the body increases simultaneously. So exercise is an indispensable piece of the study. Each women ought to know about the objective, awareness and education toward physical activity in middle age. Other profound yoga and aerobic activities can assist to positive mind set toward climacteric.

Questions The specific questions being asked are: • Do antenatal PFME prevent or reduce urinary incontinence following childbirth? • Do PFME following childbirth resolve or reduce subsequent urinary incontinence? • What is the most effective type of instruction of PFME in treating urinary incontinence? Criteria for considering studies for this review Types of participants Women who have delivered at more than 20 weeks gestation and who have experienced a spontaneous onset of labour. The labour may proceed to a caesarean section. Exclusions: Women who have had an elective caesarean section. Studies have demonstrated that there is a lower prevalence of incontinence in women who have undergone an elective caesarean section as no stress has been placed on the pelvic floor muscles Types of interventions a) Pelvic floor exercises b) Type of instruction of PFME e.g. timing, method, content. Exclusion: Electrical stimulation of pelvic floor muscles or other adjunct therapies. These have been excluded as they are not normally performed by midwives, but rather are part of the physiotherapist’s role. Types of outcome measures Outcomes that are of interest include but are not confined to: Resolution or reduction in (as appropriate) amount, length, or severity of urinary incontinence up to twelve months following childbirth. In relation to types of instruction: • effectiveness of pelvic floor contraction • period of time PFME continued after initial instruction • frequency of PFME undertaken • woman’s awareness of importance of PFME • satisfaction with instruction",

      "title": "Management of Concomitant Pelvic Disorders: The Urologic Perspective",
      "abstract": "The pelvic floor is a crossover of various complex functions, and can be considered from three aspects: urological, gynaecological, and coloproctological. The pelvic floor is at risk of damage in females because of its anatomy, since the pelvic organs are positioned in dynamic tensile structures that are subject to weakness over time. There are many factors to be considered, both intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic factors induce the reduction of collagen production, which might lead to deterioration of the fibroelastic support. Extrinsic factors (i.e., constipation, cough, and physical activities) induce an increase in abdominal pressure. Two critical moments in the life of a woman are pregnancy and delivery, which can result in injury. Birth trauma may lead to muscle and neurological lesions, and damage due to stretching. Further alterations are brought about by hormonal changes in the menopause. Symptoms of damage are voiding dysfunction, incontinence, urinary retention, gynecological disorders (such as dyspareunia or vaginal prolapse), and coloproctology dysfunctions (such as constipation and fecal incontinence). An overactive pelvic floor is frequently associated with voiding difficulties of the bladder, and constipation, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain. A reduced tone of the pelvic floor is associated with urinary stress incontinence and/or fecal incontinence, vaginal prolapse, and sexual problems. The most frequent urological symptom in females is stress urinary incontinence (SUI) due to sphincter deficiency, with involuntary loss of urine during activities requiring effort.",

      "abstract": "Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure post toweek twentieth of pregnancy, along with, proteinuria in urine samples and edema of the body. High blood pressure is one of the most common pregnancy crisis. In addition, how pregnancy causes severe high blood pressure or even how it is triggered, are considered to be the unsolved glitches in medicine. In most cases this ailment's onset is in pursuit of week 37 of gestational age, although, it may be seen at any time from the second half of pregnancy, during labor, and or after delivery (usually it becomes discrete in the first 24 to 48 hours after delivery). The occurrence of this phenomenon before week 20 of pregnancy is possible in rare cases of molar pregnancy. Most women with preeclampsia never experience or show signs other than mild to elevated blood pressures, and small excretions of protein in the urine. Maternal and neonatal consequences in patients with preeclampsia depends on the following factors: Mother's age at the time of delivery, disease severity, quality of care and treatment and other illness history, further more disseminated intravascular coagulation, intracranial bleeding, renal failure, retinal detachment, pulmonary edema, liver rupture, placental detachment, preterm labor, fetal distress and death might pursue preeclampsia. By average elevated blood pressures about more than a few weeks or months is usually not destructive. Harmful risks such as brain stroke, and heart attack are not usually common in chronic hypertension. Urinary protein loss due to preeclampsia is a sign of kidney injury. In women experiencing mild preeclampsia, the baby's overall health is generally good.",

Probablemente se producen debido a un pliegue anular del himen mas prominente y a la falta de relajacion de los tejidos vaginales en comparacion con los que puede tener una yegua pluripara. La nariz o los cascos del potro pueden desviarse hacia arriba y quedar atrapados en el pliegue anular del himen, en la union de la vagina y el vestibulo, penetrando en el vestibulo dorsal y en el recto. En estos casos, la falta de asistencia en este momento del parto puede dar como resultado una fistula recto vestibular, al producirse un desgarro a nivel del tabique recto vestibular. Esta lesion puede clasificarse en laceracion de primer, segundo y tercer grado, segun la extension y la gravedad del dano tisular. Como consecuencia puede observarse una perdida de la conformacion funcional vulvar y vestibular, con la consecuente infertilidad de la yegua debido a la instalacion de una endometritis. Por lo tanto, la reconstruccion de la laceracion perineal es necesaria para recuperar la salud reproductiva de la yegua. Se han publicado varios metodos y modificaciones de tecnicas para la reparacion de las laceraciones perineales de la yegua.

      "title": "Progestogens versus oestrogens and progestogens for irregular uterine bleeding associated with anovulation",
      "abstract": "Background Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is \"excessively heavy, prolonged or frequent bleeding of uterine origin which is not due to pregnancy or to recognizable pelvic or systemic disease\". Anovulation may be inferred from a number of observations but in the normal clinical situation, anovulation is often assumed when a woman presents with heavy, prolonged or frequent bleeding, particularly in those at the extremes of reproductive life and in women known to have the polycystic ovarian syndrome. Menstrual bleeding that is irregular or excessive is usually poorly tolerated by the majority of women. Changes in the length of the menstrual cycle generally imply disturbances of the hypothalamo‐pituitary‐ovarian (HPO) axis. In anovulatory DUB with acyclic (irregular) oestrogen production there will be no progesterone withdrawal from oestrogen primed endometrium and so cycles are irregular. Prolonged oestrogen stimulation may cause a build up of endometrium with erratic bleeding as it breaks down and is expelled. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen‐stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination are already widely used in the management of irregular or excessive bleeding due to DUB, but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used varies widely with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of progestogens alone, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the management of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders & Subfertility Group trials register (searched 14 April 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2004), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2004), EMBASE (1985 to April 2004), CINAHL (1982 to April 2004), Biological Abstracts (1969 to April 2004), Current Contents (1980 to 1998) and reference lists of articles. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials of progestogens (via any route) alone or in combination with oestrogens in the treatment of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. Data collection and analysis Study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two reviewers. Both reviewers were experts in the content matter. Main results No randomised trials were identified which compared progestogens with oestrogens and progestogens in the management of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. Only one small, non‐randomised study compared two progestogen regimes in the management of heavy and irregular bleeding in subjects with confirmed anovulation. One randomised study compared the effects of two progestogens on endometrial histology in subjects with a variety of menstrual symptoms, half of whom had cystic glandular hyperplasia. No studies were found which compared progestogens with oestrogens and progestogens in combination or with placebo in the management of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. Authors' conclusions There is a paucity of randomised studies relating to the use of progestogens and of oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the treatment of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. Further research is needed to establish the role of these treatments in the management of this common gynaecological problem.",

      "abstract": "In Brief Most obstetrician–gynecologists will encounter adolescents with disabilities in their practice, because developmental and physical disabilities are common in young patients (8.4%). Reproductive health issues such as puberty, sexuality, and menstruation can be more complicated for teenagers with disabilities and their families as a result of concerns surrounding menstrual hygiene, abuse risk, vulnerability, changes in seizure pattern, and altered mood. Teenagers with disabilities have gynecologic health care needs similar to those of their peers as well as unique needs related to their physical and cognitive issues. The gynecologic health visit for a teenager with disabilities should include an evaluation of the teenager's reproductive knowledge as well as an assessment of her abuse and coercion risk and her ability to consent to sexual activity. The menstrual history is focused on the effects of menstrual cycles on her daily life. Diagnostic testing is not different from other adolescents. Hormonal treatment is often requested by the patient and her family to alleviate abnormal bleeding, cyclic mood changes, dysmenorrhea, or a combination of these, to assist with menstrual hygiene, and to provide contraception. Menstrual manipulation can be used to induce complete amenorrhea, regulate cycles, or decrease regular menstrual flow. However, treatment risks and side effects may have a different effect on the lives of these adolescents. The comfort level of health care providers to respond to the special concerns of adolescents with disabilities is low, and several barriers exist. This review addresses the complex issues of puberty, menstruation, sexuality, abuse, and safety highlighting the distinctive needs of this population. The options and decisions around menstrual manipulation are highlighted in detail. The complex issues of puberty, menstruation, and sexuality can significantly affect the quality of life of adolescents with disabilities, and menstrual manipulation may be indicated.",

      "abstract": "Postpartum depression is the term used for depression that predominates in the postpartum period, which is increasingly seen in research and clinical practice up to 1 year after delivery. Other symptoms commonly seen in women with postpartum depression include mood swings or lability and excessive worry about the baby. In addition, postpartum depression is often associated with anxiety disorders or significant anxiety symptoms. Women with a history of psychiatric illness are prone to postpartum depression. Postpartum depression is a crucial psychological health ailment that confers a vast degree of disability in females and is often associated with significant emotional, behavioral, and cognitive dangers in children. It is a disorder that is often unrecognized and undertreated. Postpartum depression is a critical issue to be addressed because it interferes with a woman's self-care and parenting. It also affects a child's mental growth and development. For these reasons, evaluation of risk factors is required to consider every facet of postpartum depression in women. This article reviews the associated risk factors and management of postpartum depression in India. Traditional studies for risk factors in postpartum depression have typically categorized women according to a particular stage of pregnancy that follows them into postpartum depression. Pregnancy-associated risk factors are estimated during pregnancy and are looked up for their predictive association with postpartum depression defined by clinical diagnostic methods or self-report assessment. Treatment options include psychotherapy and antidepressant medication. The risk of postpartum depression in fathers also follows maternal postpartum depression. Paternal depressive disorder is associated with adverse effects on child development. Early intervention for postpartum depression and anxiety may decrease the severity and recurrence of symptoms as well as the negative effects on the baby's health and development.",

      "title": "Postpartum hemorrhages",
      "abstract": "Although any pregnant woman can be considered at risk for peripartum bleeding, the degree of risk is suggested by various medical and obstetrical factors. Preexisting coagulation disorders caused by hematological or systemic diseases, the therapeutic use of anticoagulants, anemia and nutritional deficiencies are some of the predisposing medical factors to which obstetrical factors such as uterine atony, abnormal placentation, obstetrical trauma and peripartum coagulopathy can be added. A number of high-risk entities, the most complex of which is coagulopathy, stand out among the numerous factors which contribute to the ever-present risk of peripartum hemorrhage. Obstetrical complications are patho-physiologically enmeshed with the adaptive changes which take place during pregnancy. Coagulopathies act either as a morphological substrate or a complication of obstetrical emergencies such as small and frequent, or, conversely, abundant hemorrhages, obstetrical shock from prolonged labor, retention of a dead fetus, important third-trimester dysgravidia, placental abruption or amniotic fluid embolism. Hemostasis differ between pregnant and non-pregnant women. The adaptative changes in hemostasis during pregnancy are mainly attributed to the higher level of estrogens and affect a number of concurrent elements: vascular capacity, platelet function, serum levels of the coagulation factors and fibrinolysis. Although changes in plasma factors, thrombocytopenia and alterations in blood flow do not alter hemostasis during pregnancy, labor or the puerperium, they may reveal the presence and/or aggravation of certain illnesses which are associated with or induced by pregnancy. Protective endothelial mechanisms and molecules such as antioxidants, natural antiaggregants and the balance between prostacyclin and endoxane have been described in normal pregnant women. The main causes of postpartum hemorrhage are uterine atony, abnormal placentation, obstetrical trauma, acquired coagulopathies and illnesses associated with and specific to pregnancy which are accompanied by coagulation disorders. In the present review, further inside in the coagulation disorders which accompany amniotic fluid embolism, dead fetus retention, sepsis, maternal hypertension, premature detachment of a normally inserted placenta and obstetrical trauma is presented. Moreover, bacterial endo- and exo-toxins and the antibodyantigen complexes produced in sepsis act as a trigger for disseminated intravascular coagulation is described. <br/><a href=",

      "title": "Uterine Prolapse in a Sheep and its Management: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "It is simply an eversion of the uterus which turns inside out as t passes through the vagina. Prolapse of the uterus generally occurs immediately after or a few hours of parturation when the cervix is open and the uterus lacks tone (Hanie, 2006). Post partum uterine prolapse occurs in all large animal species. It is most common in the cow and ewe, less common in the doe goat and rare in the mare. In sheep, the condition is usually seen in mature females in the last trimester of pregnancy. Predisposing factors include increased intra-abdominal pressure associated with increased size of the pregnant uterus, intra-abdominal fat, or rumen distention superimposed upon relaxation and softening of the pelvic girdle and associated soft-tissue structures in the pelvic canal and perineum. The prolapse is visible as a large mass protruding from the vulva, often hanging down below the animal’s hock. The placenta may likely be retained during this period (Roberts, 1982). Animals with uterine prolapse treated promptly recovers without complication while delay treatment could result in death of the animal in a matter of hour or so from internal hemorrhage caused by the weight of the organ which tears the mesovarium and artery (Noakes et al ., 2001). Success of treatment depends on the type of case, the duration of the case, the degree of damage and contamination.",

      "title": "Menstrual Cycle-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Several disruptive diseases or conditions can occur during menstruation for many women. These are known as catamenial diseases to indicate their monthly recurrence. They are caused by immunological, hemodynamic, hormonal, and metabolic changes that occur during menstruation. Pre-existing chronic illnesses can flare up; some during the pre-menstrual phase, others during menstruation itself. The most common of these menstrual cycle-related disorders is dysmenorrhea, or menstrual cramps. For many women, this can be an incapacitating affliction. For others, while tolerable, it is a monthly problem they dread. Migraine is the next most frequent catamenial condition and this complex syndrome can also be life-limiting. Endometriosis, a serious chronic disease, is actually caused by menstruation. Uterine lining cells sloughed off at the time of a woman’s period are discharged through the fallopian tubes into the pelvic cavity where they attach themselves to pelvic organs. Each month, these endometrial implants grow in response to hormonal changes of the cycle. Endometriosis affects about one in ten women and can be extremely painful. Frequently, it is the reason for pelvic pain and painful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia) and is a major cause of difficult to treat infertility. Additional conditions that can take on a catamenial character include asthma, insomnia, arthritis, epilepsy, and others that are exacerbated by menstruation. This chapter will discuss these disorders and their relation to a woman’s menstrual cycle.",

      "abstract": "Peritoneal closure is a controversial issue among obstetricians and gynaecologists. This article reappraises the issue of peritoneal closure. We conducted a thorough literature search using Medline, Pubmed and Embase as well as a hand-search for all references quoted in the relevant papers. The routine non-closure of the peritoneum reduces operation time by an average of 6 min. Most studies showed no difference in the other outcome measures including infection/febrile episodes, analgesic/anaesthetics requirement, bowel function restoration, post-operative stay and adhesion formation. There are insufficient data concerning adhesion formation. In conclusion, apart from a slightly shorter operation time associated with non-closure of the peritoneum, many studies showed no difference in short-term morbidity in the closure and the non-closure group. More studies are needed to examine the long-term morbidity associated with the closure or the non-closure of the peritoneum.",

      "abstract": "The venous muscle pump function was quantitatively assessed through pregnancy weeks 16, 30, 38 and 3 months (week 53) following delivery, in 24 pregnant women who completed a normal pregnancy. A statistically significant increase was found in the mean venous reflux (P&lt;0 01), which was restored to initial values postpartum. Expelled calf volume remained stable throughout pregnancy but increased following delivery. Venous outflow from the legs was significantly reduced in the third trimester. Subjective symptoms of venous insufficiency increased trough pregnancy, but, these symptoms had virtually disappeared post partum, corresponding to the muscle pump normalization. No statistical correlation was found between venous muscle pump values and changes in hormone concentrations of estradiol, estriol and progesterone. It is suggested that venous insufficiency development in pregnancy is caused primarily by mechanical obstruction, or hormonal influence other than that of etradiol, estriol or progesterone. 17% (4.7–37%) of the women with a normal pregnancy developed a pathological venous muscle pump function.",

      "abstract": "Introduction and purpose: Primary amenorrhea is not a common problem, but it is a cause for concern to the people who are affected by it as well as for their guardians. There are many factors which lead to this particular condition. Making an accurate diagnosis is pivotal in order to provide the patient with correct professional treatment and restore their health. Aim of the study: Systematic review of the existing evidence on most common reasons which lead to primary amenorrhea. Brief description of the state of knowledge: Primary amenorrhea is a medical state, defined as a deficiency of primary menstrual bleeding in girls during their adolescence. Primary amenorrhea is diagnosed by meeting the criteria: no period by the age of 14 in the absence of growth or development of secondary sexual characteristics, or no period by the age of 16 regardless of the presence of normal growth and development with the appearance of secondary sex characteristics. There are multiple causes of this condition. Searching for a solution is heavily dependent on additional symptoms. Lack of menarche can be caused by anatomical anomalies of the female genital system, ovaries dysplasia, dysfunction of hypothalamus and pituitary gland, as well as by medical circumstances which are not included in those groups. Summary: The important thing is to make the proper diagnosis of primary amenorrhea. Menstruation disorders are not only gynecological problems, they can also cause systemic, psychological and sexual difficulties. It might impact the future life of maturing young girls.",

      "title": "Influence of Conventional Therapy in Post Natal Women with Back Pain",
      "abstract": "Background: Post-partum period brings joy as well as pain for women. It is period after delivery till 42 days. In most of women, problems like leg pain, back pain, floppiness of abdominal muscles, edema and extremities, spinal problems, problems in breast feeding arise. Postnatal back pain including lumbosacral region, pelvic girdle and sacroiliac pain is very common presentation. Evidences show that post natal low back pain is very common. Various studies show that in first year after delivery it ranges from 21% to 82%. It also has on and off period. Re-occurrence of pain is seen in first 6 months. In caesarean section, 51% of women noticed pain back by 1 month and 78% by 6 months. In vaginal delivery it reoccurred in 55% women at 1 month and 85% in 6th month. Conventional physiotherapy interventions are worldwide accepted one and practiced on large scales in various circumstances. Conventional approaches for back pain which includes core muscle exercises, yogic postures, walks, runs, hydrotherapy exercises and cardiorespiratory fitness training. Role of physiotherapy for women’s health is an upcoming area in developing country like India. It needs to be evaluated in both rural and urban set ups. Method: 494 subjects fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. Conventional training was given for 6 weeks. Outcome measures used were focusing on Pain (Visual Analogue Scale), Range of motion (Modified Schober Test), abdominal muscle strength (Manual Muscle Testing) and quality of life (Oswestry Low Back Disability). Result: Student t-test was used for statistical analysis. The results showed significant changes in all the outcome measures but was time consuming lacked in establishing confirm evidences. Conclusion: Conventional therapy reduced back pain and improved quality of life but was time constrained. Further evaluation needs to be done for better results.",

      "abstract": "It is noted that advertisements in medical journals recommend treatment of emotional symptoms in menopausal patients with Premarin (Ayerst brand of conjugated estrogens), Ogen (Abbott brand of piperazine estrone sulfate), or other compounds. There are no acceptable studies proving the usefulness of such combinations for symptoms relating to the menopause and no persuasive evidence to justify use of conjugated or any other type of estrogen in the treatment of emotional symptoms in menopausal women. Vasomotor symptoms, flushing, and sweats respond to estrogens. Symptoms do not recur if treatment is stopped after 1 or 2 years. Systematic or topical use of estrogens fails to promote the appearance of youthfulness. Vaginal pruritus and dyspareunia due to atrophic vaginitis may be relieved by estrogens either applied locally or orally. Libido is not heightened by exogenous estrogens but sufficient androgen doses cause virilization. It is doubtful if osteoporosis is favorably influenced by long-term use of estrogens. Estrogen therapy may cause spotting, menarrhagia, nausea, breast tenderness, or fluid retention. Prolonged use may cause increase in size of uterine fibroids. Personal or even family history of breast or genital cancer are considered contraindications.",

      "title": "Enzootic abortion of ewes (ovine chlamydiosis) (infection with Chlamydophila abortus)",
      "abstract": "Description and importance of the disease: Ovine chlamydiosis, also known as enzootic abortion of ewes (EAE) or ovine enzootic abortion (OEA), is caused by the bacterium Chlamydia abortus. Chlamydial abortion typically occurs in the last 2–3 weeks of pregnancy with the appearance of stillborn lambs and inflamed placentas. However, infection can also result in the delivery of full-term stillborn lambs or weak lambs that do not survive longer than 48 hours. Infected ewes can also give birth to healthy lambs. There are rarely any predictive signs that abortion is going to occur, although behavioural changes and a vulval discharge can be observed in the last 48 hours of pregnancy.\r\nDiagnosis of enzootic abortion depends on the detection of antigen or nucleic acid of the causative agent in the products of abortion or vaginal excretions of freshly aborted females. A humoral antibody response may be detected following abortion. Goats as well as sheep and, less commonly, cattle, pigs, horses and wild ruminants, can be affected. Chlamydiosis of small ruminants caused by C. abortus is zoonotic and the organism must be handled with appropriate biosafety precautions. Pregnant women are particularly at risk.\r\nIdentification of the agent: The basis for a positive diagnosis of infection with C. abortus depends on a history of abortion in sheep or goats (often in late pregnancy), evidence of purulent to necrotising placentitis with vasculitis, and the demonstration of large numbers of the organism in affected placentae by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or antigen tests or in stained smears. The still moist fleece of fetuses or their abomasal content or vaginal swabs of females that have freshly aborted are also useful. It is important to distinguish cotyledonary damage caused by Toxoplasma gondii and, in stained smears, to be aware of the morphological similarities between C. abortus and Coxiella burnetii, the agent of Q fever.\r\nChlamydial organisms in tissues and smears can be detected by staining, or antigen-detection methods (immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence), whereas chlamydial DNA can be detected by PCR-based methods including real-time PCR and DNA microarray. Some of these methods are available in commercial kit form.\r\nChlamydia abortus can be isolated only in living cells; thus facilities for growth in cell cultures or chicken embryos, with appropriate biohazard containment, are required. Serological tests: A rise in antibody titre to C. abortus, which can be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), is common after abortion or stillbirth, but this does not occur in every case. Chlamydia abortus shares common antigens with other Chlamydia species and some Gram-negative bacteria, so that the complement fixation (CF) test or crude ELISAs are not specific and no longer recommended. Serological screening during the period after parturition helps to identify infected flocks, to which control measures can then be applied. Serological tests to differentiate between vaccinated and naturally infected sheep or goats (DIVA tests) are not currently available.",

In these cases, pessaries will probably not remain in place or prevent preterm labor. Patient discomfort, urinary tract infection, acute urinary retention, premature labor, and prenatal loss are still major complications, and prolapse usually persists or recurs after labor.

The researcher carries out three semi-structured interviews during the pregnancy. Shame and guilt can clearly be found during pregnancies after an MTP. The intensity and the type of expression of these two movements can either limit or contribute to the cathexis of the dead baby and of the living one. Shame and guilt can be understood as the two poles of a continuous gradient. Their study in the context of a pregnancy following a medically terminated one makes it possible to offer pertinent semiological and psychopathological markers in the framework of primary and secondary prevention of troubles in parenthood and in early relational disharmonies.",

      "title": "Stress Urinary Incontinence",
      "abstract": "To recap, stress urinary incontinence occurs when a woman leaks while coughing, laughing, sneezing, or lifting heavy items. Unlike urge incontinence, stress incontinence results from a problem with the support structures of the urethra, not with the bladder itself. Weakness of the muscles on which the urethra sits results in movement of the urethra with activity and leakage.

Medication, exercise therapy, and injectable agents can be tried first, but as of now, the only real cure for stress urinary incontinence is surgery.

      "title": "EFFECTS OF SEVERE MATERNAL PHYSICAL EXERCISE DURING EARLY PREGNANCY UPON THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOUSE EMBRYOS",
      "abstract": "The effects of maternal physical exercise during eary pregnancy upon the embryonic development of mice were studied as follows: A/Jax female mice at 10 to 16 weeks of age were imposed daily compulsory running at the speed of 15 meter/min. using a tread mill for 100 min. for the period from zero to 6th day of gestation (called severe exercise group) and for 50 min. from zero to 13th day of gestation (called mild exercise group) respectively. All mice together with the control group without the exercise were sacrificed at 18th day of gestation and the states of concep.uses as well as external and skeletal development of fetuses were observed. The results may be summarized as follows:1.Significant pregnancy-blocking effect was found in the severe exercise group and it is presumed that the treatment caused obstruction of implantation or maintaince of early pregnancy after implantation in most cases.2. No significant differences were observed in litter size, fetal mortality, fetal body weight and frequency of the malformed fetuses between pregnant mothers of each of experimental group and control group.3. The progress of ossification in the mild exercise group was slightly superior in some part of the skeleton to that of the control group.",

      "title": "LOW BACK PAIN IN PREGNANCY",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUNDLow back pain in pregnancy can be defined as pain between the 12th rib and the gluteal folds/ pubic symphysis may radiate to the posterolateral thigh, to the knee and calf during the course of pregnancy.It has been estimated that about 50% -80% of pregnant women will suffer from some kind of low back pain at some point during their pregnancies or during the postpartum period.Unfortunately, there is limited research available regarding low back pain in pregnancy and its management.This study was conducted to find out prevalence of low back pain during pregnancy, possible risk factors and its outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODSWe have done observational study of 510 pregnant women, who came to the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, BMC, Sagar, during April 2016 to May 2017.Of these, 290 women complained of back pain.After taking consent, we took detailed history of their age, parity, duration of pregnancy (trimester), height, Hb% (for nutritional status), history of back pain during previous pregnancy and before pregnancy, any other risk factors, history of subsided or persistent pain 12 weeks after delivery.All these women were sent to the Department of Orthopaedics for determining the exact sites of pain, its type (whether pelvic girdle pain, lumbar pain or both), severity (determine by visual analogue pain scale), aggravating and relieving factor and any pathological cause of pain.Of these 290 cases, 39 women have known pathological causes of low back pain.We have excluded these cases and remaining 251 cases were included in this study. RESULTSIn our study, we found that out of 510 pregnant women 290 (56.86%) women suffer from back pain.Of these 290 cases, 251 (86.55%) cases have no pathological cause of back pain detected.87 were primigravida and 164 were multigravida.92 (56.09%) women have low back pain during her previous pregnancy.106 (42.23%) women have Hb% below 10 gm%.59 (23.50%) women have persistent pain even after 12 weeks of delivery.106 (42.23%) women have pelvis girdle pain, while 63 (25.09%) have lumbar and 82 (32.66%) have both pelvic girdle and lumbar pain.72 (28.68%) women have first episode of pain that appears at 1 st trimester, while 134 (53.38%) have 2 nd and 45 (17.92%) have pain first appearing at 3 rd trimester.62 (21.37%) women complain of severe pain (visual analogue pain scale-6 or more), of these 58 (20%) women required analgesics for pain relief during their course of pregnancy.228 (78.62%) women complain of mild-to-moderate pain (visual analogue pain scale-5 or less) and their pain responding to conservative treatment like lifestyle modification, rest, posture change, physiotherapy and local gel application. CONCLUSIONLBP is the most common musculoskeletal complaints of pregnant women.Our study demonstrates that more than half (56.86%) of pregnant women suffer from low back pain.Unfortunately, there is limited research available regarding risk factors, physical therapy intervention for pregnant women experiencing low back pain, so a homogenous approach tends to be used.However, back pain is not homogenous; therefore, special considerations and precautions should be taken while treating this population.Our study try to find out risk factor associated with low back pain in pregnancy.This study is small.Further larger studies of longer durations are required for better understanding of risk factors in order to make protocol for prevention and treatment options.",

MM presents in two clinical forms: pure MM, where attacks are confined to the perimenstrual period (PMP), and menstrually related migraine, where attacks always occur during, but are not confined to, the PMP. MM episodes are usually longer, more intense, more disabling and more refractory than nonmenstrual attacks. Acute management of MM should initially be abortive and primarily sought with triptans. If this fails, short-term perimenstrual prophylaxis with NSAIDs, coxibs, triptans or ergotamine derivatives can be considered. Hormone manipulations, mainly application of percutaneous estradiol gel in PMP or administration of oral contraceptives in extended cycles, constitute an alternative approach for nonresponders.",

      "title": "Migraine in pregnancy",
      "abstract": "Migraine is a predominantly female disorder. Evidence suggests that migraine activity is influenced by hormonal factors, and particularly by estrogen levels and fluctuations. During pregnancy, estrogen may reach one hundred times the normal level, whilst progesterone levels decrease, rising again towards the end of the pregnancy; however, hormonal fluctuations are not as pronounced as during the non-pregnant state[1]. Most women with migraine report an improvement of their attacks during pregnancy, from the first to the third trimestre, particularly women with a history of menstrual migraine and with migraine without aura[2]. This improvement may be due to the lack of hormonal fluctuations but also to the increased levels of natural pain-killing hormones (endorphins) induced by pregnancy[1, 3]. If no improvement is seen toward the end of the first trimestre, migraine is likely to continue throughout pregnancy and postpartum. Most women with migraine improving in pregnancy will experience attack recurrence shortly after delivery, likely in the first weeks[2]. This decline might be due to the precipitous drop in estradiol and endorphin levels occurring in the postpartum period[1, 3]. A small number of pregnant women experience a worsening of their migraine while a few others may even develop de novo migraine symptoms. In this context, migraine usually occurs during the first trimestre and is most often with aura[2]. Women continuing to experience migraine attacks throughout pregnancy may require treatment but we need to consider that not all medications used for migraine are safe in pregnancy. Paracetamol is the preferred drug for acute treatment throughout pregnancy. If paracetamol is not sufficiently effective, sporadic use of sumatriptan can be considered. NSAIDs such as ibuprofen can also be used under certain circumstances, though their intake in the first and third trimestres is associated with specific risks and contraindications. For prevention, non pharmacological approaches are always first-line treatment, and should also be used to complement any drug treatment. Some vitamins and dietary supplements have been proposed, such as, magnesium, riboflavin and coenzyme Q10. Preventive drug treatment should only be considered in the most severe cases and should include low doses of β-blockers and amitriptyline[4]. A personal history of migraine headaches can affect pregnancy outcomes. There is increasing evidence showing that migraine is a risk factor for several vascular complications during pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, stroke, myocardial infarction, and venous thromboembolism; therefore, migraine should be considered a potential cardiovascular risk factor in obstetric care[5]. Further research is warranted to understand the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of vascular disease in pregnant migraineurs. Better understanding of those mechanisms could lead to potential treatment and earlier intervention, thereby reducing the health care costs of morbidity and mortality associated with adverse vascular events in this population.",

In some cases, this can lead to issues with urinary incontinence and pelvic organ descent postpartum, either immediately or in the woman's later years. Some factors during a vaginal delivery can be modified in attempts to preserve as much functional integrity to the PF as possible. A trend has evolved in recent years regarding maternal requests for primary cesarean section (CS), with one goal being the reduction in PF trauma. However, evidence to date refutes this as a foolproof practice in decreasing PF dysfunctions, including urinary incontinence.",

A hormonal affection on the uro-genital organs has been suggested to be causally related to pregnancy-related pelvic pain in some studies (1,2), but has been questioned by others who could not detect any association between serum relaxin levels and symphyseal distension or pelvic pain in pregnancy (3,4). Since obesity has been linked to stress incontinence previously (5), it is possible that the symptoms from the urogenital organs are not only affected by hormones, but may be part of the possible causal pathway from obesity to pregnancy-related pelvic pain, perhaps with an additional interaction between obesity and the laxity of the uterosacral ligaments. Unfortunately, our data do not allow a study of the hypothesis suggested by Prof. Petros. Information on maternal urgency, nocturia or abnormal bladder emptying was not collected in the Danish National Birth Cohort. On behalf of all co-authors",

The majority of studies have found no negative effects of vasectomy on sexual performance or frequency of sexual intercourse. In general, adverse psychological events are the least common in men who made the decision for vasectomy jointly with their wives. Possible predictors of psychosexual problems include pre-existing emotional instability, excessive concerns about masculinity, confusion of the procedure with castration, and post-surgical complaints. The major predictors of post-sterilization regret among both male and female sterilization acceptors are pre-operative motivation for further child bearing, poor couple communication, high levels of conflict during decision making, and dominance of decision making by one spouse.",

One of four women with abnormal genital bleeding may have serious physical problems.

Abnormal genital bleeding and secondary amenorrhea (cessation of menses) are common gynecologic complaints that can indicate serious physical problems. Abnormal genital bleeding is the most common reason for a gynecological office visit and a leading indication for dilatation of the cervix and curettage of the uterus. One of four women with abnormal genital bleeding may have serious physical problems. Although pregnancy is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea, other conditions related to abnormal pregnancy, functional disorders, physiological changes, or pathology also must be considered. Procedures for evaluating abnormal genital bleeding and secondary amenorrhea are discussed. Information is provided to assist nurses in collecting and assessing data and planning interventions to promote the health of women with these common problems. In the United States, where 90% of women marry and bear children, the normal menstrual cycle is welcomed as a fertility sign and the hallmark of sexual maturity. However, menses is also called The Curse, an epithet that reflects the chronicity and gravity of problems that may be associated with the menses. Because menstruation may generate a gamut of ambivalent emotions that can contribute to menstrual dysfunction, an evaluation of abnormal genital bleeding or secondary amenorrhea would not be adequate without an exploration of the client’s attitude toward her menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle is controlled by the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, which, in childhood, initiates the events that precede puberty or the development of secondary sexual characteristics. As the HPO axis matures, menstruation’s cyclic nature is established. Menstrual regularity is usually evident from one- and-one-half to two years after menarche, although monthly cycles may not occur until up to four years later. Normal menstrual bleeding lasts from three to eight days, with an average blood loss of from 25 to 100 ml. The interval between menses varies in the individual woman from 21 to 40 days, counted from the first day of bleeding to the first day of the next menstrual bleeding.1.Gynecologic Disorders.in: Pauerstein C. Grune and Stratton, 1982Google Scholar Variations in a woman’s cycle length are most common in the extremes of menstrual life, surrounding the events of menarche and menopause. However, irregular cycles during the active childbearing years are more significant to the clinician and the client. Predictable physiological changes occur during the menstrual cycle. These events produce signs, symptoms, and measurable physiologic alterations in body chemistry (Figure 1). Ovarian events are divided into two phases: the follicular (preovulatory) and luteal (postovulatory) phases. With hypothalamic influence the pituitary secretes follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulates the ovarian follicle to produce the estrogen, estradiol, from ovarian-produced an drogens. The pituitary also produces luteinizing hormone (LH), which initiates ovulation and also stimulates the production of androgens, which, in the normal female cycle, are converted to estrogen and prostaglandins, which aid follicle rupture.2.Women's Health Ambulatory Care.in: Sonstegard L. Gruen and Stratton, 1982Google Scholar In the normal ovulating female the conversion of androgens produces the main source of estrogen. As ovulation occurs, the empty follicle assumes the production of estrogen and progesterone; progesterone is formed from cholesterol derived from low-density lipoproteins (LDL). Estrogen ana progesterone are required for the maintenance of the endometrium. Under the influence of estrogen, produced during the ovarian cycle’s follicular phase, the endometrium proliferates and thickens. As estrogen stimulation continues, the cervical mucus develops a characteristic fern or palm leaf pattern when the mucus is dried and viewed under a microscope. As estrogen levels rise and ovulation approaches, the cervical mucus develops the tenacious attributes of raw egg white and becomes capable of stretching six centimeters or more. This characteristic, called spinnbarkheit, is closely associated with ovulation. At ovulation, the proliferative (estrogen) uterine phase is replaced by the secretory (progestational) phase. Progesterone causes the cervical mucus to lose the characteristics of ferning and spinnbarkheit.3.Fogel C. Woods N. Health Care of Women. C. V. Mosby, 1981Google Scholar Also associated with progesterone stimulation and ovulation are a shift in the vagina’s pH level from acid (4-5 pH) to alkaline (7-8 pH) and an increase in the vaginal cells’ glycogen content.4.Green T. Gynecology Essentials of Practice.3d ed. Little Brown & Co, 1977Google Scholar Bodily changes of a cyclic nature accompany menstruation. These premenstrual symptoms, called molimina, usually are associated with ovulation, especially if the symptoms consist of breast tenderness and menstrual cramping. Molimina are ubiquitous and occur in the vast majority of women. More than 60% of women report physical symptoms, such as breast or abdominal swelling, while more than 80% note irritability, tension, or anxiety.1.Gynecologic Disorders.in: Pauerstein C. Grune and Stratton, 1982Google Scholar Abnormal genital bleeding is the most common reason for a gynecological office visit and a leading indication for dilatation of the cervix and curettage of the uterus. For most women, the cause of abnormal bleeding is benign. Seventy-five percent of abnormal genital bleeding in adult women results from functional (nonorganic) causes; in adolescents functional causes reach 97%. However, the nurse clinician should bear in mind that 25% of abnormal genital bleeding results from organic causes, many of which represent life-threatening problems.1.Gynecologic Disorders.in: Pauerstein C. Grune and Stratton, 1982Google Scholar Because one of four women with abnormal genital bleeding may have a serious physical problem, organic causes of genital bleeding must be systematically excluded before a diagnosis of functional bleeding can be considered. Care should be exercised in this process. A significant portion of genital bleeding problems originally diagnosed as functional are later found to have organic causes. Pregnancy is the leading cause of uterine bleeding during a woman’s childbearing years. Abnormal genital bleeding may result from an intrauterine pregnancy as well as disorders such as an ectopic pregnancy, a threatened or incomplete abortion, and postabortal trophoblastic neoplasms. Other organic problems that may cause abnormal genital bleeding include infection, neoplasm or lesions, hormone administration, trauma, blood dyscrasia, and extragenital bleeding. The nurse clinician should investigate all of these possibilities. Most abnormal genital bleeding results from dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Through an inexplicable linguistic quirk, functional causes of uterine bleeding are termed dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Functional seems to refer to the lack of identifiable structural changes in the body that are associated with the abnormal bleeding. Of the 75% of abnormal uterine bleeding problems that can be classified as dysfunctional, the majority of episodes occur at the extremes of menstrual life; 50% of dysfunctional uterine bleeding is found in women more than 45 years old and 20% in adolescents less than 20 years old.1.Gynecologic Disorders.in: Pauerstein C. Grune and Stratton, 1982Google Scholar Dysfunctional uterine bleeding in adolescence may portend grave problems. Some studies indicate that as many as 50% of adolescents continue dysfunctional uterine bleeding for more than four years. Of the adolescents who continue their abnormal bleeding patterns into adulthood, 70-80% will manifest fertility problems and increased incidences of endometrial cancer between the ages of 23 and 33.1.Gynecologic Disorders.in: Pauerstein C. Grune and Stratton, 1982Google Scholar Dysfunctional uterine bleeding may be related to either ovulatory or anovulatory cycles. Eighty percent of dysfunctional uterine bleeding cases are anovulatory— the duration and magnitude of bleeding correlate with the level and duration of the unopposed estrogen. The remaining 20% of dysfunctional uterine bleeding cases are ovulatory. The most common cause of ovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding is a corpus luteum defect;5.Willocks J. Essentials of Obstetrics and Gynecology.2d ed. Churchill Livingstone, 1982Google Scholar however, many problems classified as ovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding actually result from organic causes. Most incorrect diagnoses related to abnormal genital bleeding are found in the ovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding category. Uncontrolled uterine or intraabdominal hemorrhage may prove fatal in less than 20 minutes. The nurse’s initial assessment of the bleeding woman should focus on the quantity of blood loss and the potential for ectopic pregnancy. Heavy bleeding may require immediate hospitalization. The nurse should immediately record and monitor the woman’s blood pressure. The woman at risk for pregnancy who presents the classic triad of unilateral abdominal pain, irregular menses, and vaginal bleeding should receive an immediate pelvic examination to exclude the possibility of an adnexal mass suggestive of ectopic pregnancy. Additional confirmatory examinations, such as a blood pregnancy test and ultrasound, may be required on an emergency basis.Pregnancy is the most common cause of abnormal genital bleeding and secondary amenorrhea. A woman with a suspected ectopic pregnancy should arrive at a referral location capable of emergency pelvic surgery less than 20 minutes after the diagnosis is made. Nurses should develop appropriate referral and transportation resources before an emergency occurs. The time required to arrange a referral and transportation network may prove fatal to the woman. After a life-threatening emergency has been excluded, a thorough history and physical examination will differentiate organic causes of genital bleeding from ovulatory and anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding.1.Gynecologic Disorders.in: Pauerstein C. Grune and Stratton, 1982Google Scholar A careful history of the present illness is critical to the diagnosis of abnormal genital bleeding. When eliciting the onset, course, and chronology of the abnormal bleeding, the nurse should note the client’s age of menarche. Late menarche suggests polycystic ovary disease (PCOD), also referred to as Stein-Leventhal syndrome, as a cause of the bleeding. The association of the onset of menstrual problems and interpersonal stresses, such as family problems, work difficulties, or sexual couple dysfunction, should be noted. The symptoms’ onset also may be associated with unusual weight gain or loss, which may alter menstrual function.6.Warren M. Effects of under‐nutrition on reproductive function in humans.Endocr Rev. 1983; 4: 363-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar Bleeding with sexual relations is an important sign that may indicate an infection or a structural abnormality, such as a polyp or lesion. Trauma to the genital organs should be carefully queried; rape and sexual violence frequently are the cause of bleeding. However, shame and denial, which interfere with disclosure of the event to the clinician, are common aftermaths of abuse. All genital bleeding in a premenarchal child should be viewed as sexual abuse until proven otherwise. Menstrual flow characteristics provide important diagnostic information. Short cycles or premenstrual spotting indicate low progesterone levels. Heavy, irregular, painless bleeding is associated with anovulatory cycles, which most often occur early or late in the menstrual years. Regular cycles with altered menstrual flow are not uncommon in early pregnancy. The date of the last menstrual period and the date of the last normal menstrual period should be recorded. These two dates may not coincide if pregnancy occurred after the last normal period. The presence of premenstrual symptoms or molimina differentiates the ovulatory from the anovulatory cycle. If progesterone is absent, breast tenderness and bloating do not occur. Mittelschmerz and dysmenorrhea also are absent in the anovulatory cycle. Progesterone alters the vaginal discharge. Some observant women may note that the tenacious, thick mucus associated with the first weeks of the cycle does not change to a thin, watery consistency because of the progesterone absence in the anovulatory cycle.1.Gynecologic Disorders.in: Pauerstein C. Grune and Stratton, 1982Google Scholar Other changes associated with the vaginal discharge—foul odor, increased quantity, irritation, dyspareunia, or itching—are symptoms associated with infection rather than progesterone absence.Uncontrolled uterine or intra-abdominal hemorrhage may prove fatal in less than 20 minutes. When eliciting past medical history, the nurse should note the client’s hormone exposure. The woman born between 1940 and 1975 should be asked about in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol.4.Green T. Gynecology Essentials of Practice.3d ed. Little Brown & Co, 1977Google Scholar The clinician may need to interview the client’s mother to obtain reliable information. A woman taking birth control pills may note breakthrough bleeding. If contraceptive education has been incomplete, the woman may not associate the abnormal bleeding with birth control pill use. Similarly, estrogen replacement therapy in the peri-menopausal years may cause breakthrough bleeding. Endometrial cancer must be considered in the diagnosis of any abnormal vaginal bleeding of the perimenopausal years, particularly if the woman is receiving estrogen treatment. The clinician must obtain a client’s history of chronic disease and medication use to identify drug-induced menstrual abnormality (Table 1). A family history of delayed menarche, infertility, or heavy irregular menses may raise the possibility of polycystic ovary disease in female relatives, while a family history of blood dyscrasias may indicate a bleeding disorder in the woman. Health-care practitioners estimate that 19% of adolescents with heavy, regular, painless periods have a bleeding diathesis.7.Danforth D. Scott J. Obstetrics and Gynecology.5th ed. J. B. Lippincott, 1986Google Scholar A family history of cancer or fibroid tumors could indicate a potential problem. An occasional client may fail to consider that bleeding noted on the underwear or in the toilet originated from nonvaginal sources. The nurse should discuss the possibility of bleeding occurring from nonvaginal sources, such as hemorrhoids or the urinary tract.Table 1Common Drugs That May Alter Menstrual BleedingGeneric NameTrade Name*May also produce galactorrheaAmphetamines*May also produce galactorrheaDesoxyn, ObetrolAnticoagulantsCoumadin, Heparin*May also produce galactorrheaBenzodiazepinesDiazepam, Oxazepam*May also produce galactorrheaValium, SeraxBenzomide DerivativesPronestyl, Matulane*May also produce galactorrheaButyrophenones*May also produce galactorrheaHaldol, InapsineCannabisMarijuanaChloriazeponideLibrium*May also produce galactorrheaCimetidine*May also produce galactorrheaTagametEthyl alcoholWhiskey, wine, beer*May also produce galactorrheaIsoniazid*May also produce galactorrheaINH*May also produce galactorrheaMethyldopa*May also produce galactorrheaAldometMonamine Oxidase InhibitorsEutonyl, Nardil*May also produce galactorrheaOpiates*May also produce galactorrheaMorphine, Heroin, Methadone*May also produce galactorrheaPhenothiazines*May also produce galactorrheaCompazine, Thorazine, PhenerganRauwolfiaRaudixinProstaglandin InhibitorsMotrin, Indocin*May also produce galactorrheaReserpine*May also produce galactorrheaSerpasil*May also produce galactorrheaSpironolactone*May also produce galactorrheaAldactoneSteroidsGonadal *May also produce galactorrheaEstrogens*May also produce galactorrheaPremarin, oral contraceptives *May also produce galactorrheaProgesterones*May also produce galactorrheaProvera, oral contraceptives *May also produce galactorrheaTestosterone*May also produce galactorrheaAndroidThyroid HormonesSynthroid, Cytomel*May also produce galactorrheaThioxanthenes*May also produce galactorrheaNavane*May also produce galactorrheaTricyclic Antidepressants*May also produce galactorrheaElavil* May also produce galactorrhea Open table in a new tab An obstetrical history is an important diagnostic tool. Repeated spontaneous abortions may indicate a luteal phase defect, while a history of infertility is most often associated with polycystic ovary disease. Intrapartum or postpartum difficulties may alert the clinician to Sheehan’s syndrome, a rare form of pituitary necrosis secondary to hemorrhage. Certain symptoms related to the endocrine review of systems are important. Hirsutism may indicate polycystic ovary disease or adrenal problems. Symptoms of thyroid dysfunction and galactorrhea are frequently associated with menstrual cycle alterations.1.Gynecologic Disorders.in: Pauerstein C. Grune and Stratton, 1982Google Scholar Pregnancy symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and urinary frequency, may be attributed to other causes if the pregnancy is unplanned. If the abnormal genital bleeding is prolonged or severe, or a complete examination has not been recently performed, a total physical assessment is needed. All physical evaluations should cover the entire gyn area, which extends from the chin to the pelvis. During the gyn examination, the thyroid is palpated for enlargement or nodules that may indicate dysfunction. The breasts are palpated for masses and galactorrhea. The abdomen is examined for masses and organomegaly, particularly of the uterus. The skin is assessed for evidence of atrophy or clotting disorders, such as bruises or petechiae. The estrogen level is assessed by observing the secondary sexual characteristics. Conducting a pelvic examination on a client is extremely important in evaluating abnormal genital bleeding. The client must be relaxed while the pelvic examination is conducted. Before examining an adolescent, the clinician should explain the examination and educate the adolescent in relaxation techniques. The clinician may need to use these same procedures for an adult woman who is anxious about the examination or about abnormal bleeding implications. To allay anxiety, the nurse should review with the client the examination procedures in detail using anatomic charts and models. The nurse should offer the client the opportunity to handle the speculum and examination equipment, and the client should be assured that she will be allowed to end the examination if discomfort becomes intolerable. This reassurance often will gain the woman’s cooperation and relaxation by giving her control of an anxiety-producing experience. To assess accurately the possibility of bleeding from sites other than the cervix, the clinician must view the external genitalia and vagina. The external areas should be cleansed and dried so that bleeding from a site can be observed. The clinician might simply provide the woman with the materials to wash her genitalia and perineal areas as she voids before the examination. The external genitalia, urethra, and rectal areas can then be inspected for bleeding, redness, hemorrhoids, or lesions. If no bleeding site is evident, the speculum is introduced and blood removed from the vagina. If the bleeding is heavy, a sponge forceps and a large supply of gauze may be needed. The clinician must identify the exact source of bleeding. A quick method is to locate and swab the cervix free of blood and observe whether bleeding recurs from the os. If the os or the cervix is not the source of bleeding, the vagina must be cleansed and inspected for bleeding sites. Occasionally an excoriated lesion, such as a venereal wart, can cause extensive bright genital bleeding. During the examination the cervix condition is observed. Abortion evidence may be present in the form of conceptus parts or os dilatation. Vaginal lesions, cervical polyps, or friability may be found if a history of postcoital bleeding has been obtained. During the bimanual examination, the clinician palpates the vagina and cervix for lesions, which, if found, should be inspected for bleeding. The nurse also palpates the uterus and ovaries for masses, tenderness, and enlargement. Cervical motion tenderness or the chandelier sign is of great diagnostic importance in conditions that cause adnexal inflammation, such as ectopic pregnancy or pelvic infection. The rectal examination may reveal hemorrhoids. Suprapubic and urethral tenderness are evident in lower urinary tract infections. Several common laboratory tests are helpful in diagnosing abnormal genital bleeding. If bleeding is light, assessing the cervical mucus for ferning to determine estrogen levels may be possible. Large amounts of blood interfere with the visualization of the fern pattern. The Papanicolaou test also will indicate estrogen levels. Cytology samples may be taken after excess blood has been wiped away so that cervical and vaginal cells are not obscured by red cells. Pregnancy tests are useful. However, they may yield negative, but misleading, results. During ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion, the human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) levels may be too low to detect.8.Bluestein D. Monoclonal antibody pregnancy tests.Am Fam Physician. 1988; 38: 197-204PubMed Google Scholar A hematocrit or complete blood count will determine anemia secondary to blood loss. If the clinician suspects blood dyscrasia, a coagulation evaluation, which includes a platelet count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and bleeding time, may be requested. If symptoms or signs of thyroid abnormality exist, thyroid studies should be obtained. If cervical motion tenderness is discovered, cultures for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and other common pathogens originating in the bowel are indicated. If vaginal irritation or discharge is evident, a mixture of the discharge with saline may be viewed under the microscope to detect monilia, trichomonas, bacteria, or clue cells. When forming a diagnosis, the clinician should be particularly suspicious of an intrauterine or abnormal pregnancy. Symptoms of nausea and breast tenderness, signs of an enlarged uterus, and a soft, bluish cervix and vagina associated with a normal adnexal examination should alert the clinician to an intrauterine pregnancy. An abnormal pregnancy also may manifest the same signs and symptoms. Bleeding, abdominal cramping, cervical dilatation, and the presence of conceptus parts may indicate a spontaneous abortion is impending or in progress. Unilateral adnexal tenderness, palpable adnexal mass, and cervical motion tenderness are important ectopic pregnancy indicators. These same signs may accompany pelvic infection; however, purulent cervical discharge usually occurs with pelvic infections. An enlarged uterus accompanied by regular, heavy menses may indicate fibroids. In the perimeno-pausal woman, abnormal uterine bleeding should be considered endometrial cancer until the clinician obtains a normal endometrial biopsy. Although useful for determining cervical pathology and estrogen levels, the pap test is inadequate for evaluating endometrial cells and cannot replace an endometrial biopsy. When diagnosing abnormal genital bleeding, the clinician must first exclude pregnancy, neoplasm, infection, trauma, hormone administration, and blood dyscrasia as causes. After organic causes have been ruled out, attention is focused on the type of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding that is associated with premenstrual symptoms, such as breast tenderness, dysmenorrhea, and bloating, is considered to be ovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding. The most common cause of ovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding is a corpus luteum dysfunction, which often is amenable to hormonal therapy. All women with ovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding should be referred to a gynecologist for a thorough evaluation and possible treatment of the underlying condition. The most common cause of anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding is malfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. As the axis develops during the first two years of the menstrual cycle, anovulatory menses characterized by heavy, irregular, painless bleeding are common. Recurrence of the anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding pattern is associated with menopause. During the intervening childbearing years, the most common causes of anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding are stress and polycystic ovary disease.9.Tudiver F. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding and prior life stress.J Fam Pract. 1983; 17: 999-1003PubMed Google Scholar The absence of hirsutism or infertility in a woman with anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding suggests stress or nutritional causation. This diagnosis may be validated by the finding of normal LH levels. Polycystic ovary disease is associated with high LH levels. Management of abnormal genital bleeding depends on the severity of the underlying pathology and bleeding episodes. The nurse practitioner may manage anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding of the woman with moderate bleeding episodes in the early and late menstrual years and the occasional series of anovulatory cycles in the middle menstrual years. For these women, management by the nurse will involve health education, supportive counseling, regular monitoring of menstrual function, and assessment of iron levels in the blood. Iron replacement should be given as the need develops. The woman with frequent or heavy anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding should be managed in consultation with a gynecologist for bleeding control. The longer the estrogen stimulation between anovulatory periods, the heavier may be the menstrual bleeding. To control heavy bleeding and effect regular endometrial shedding, cyclical hormone therapy in the form of birth control pills or alternating estrogen and progesterone medications may be used. However, no estrogen regimen should be initiated until the possibility of pregnancy or estrogen dependent neoplasm of the endometrium, breasts, or ovaries has been ruled out.1.Gynecologic Disorders.in: Pauerstein C. Grune and Stratton, 1982Google Scholar Cyclical hormone regimes can be monitored by the nurse practitioner in consultation with a gynecologist.All women with a history of anovulatory bleeding should be carefully instructed in the danger of intermenstrual bleeding as a sign of endometrial cancer. Occasionally anovulatory bleeding occurs with such intensity that immediate treatment must be initiated to prevent serious blood loss and anemia. Any birth control pill taken several times a day for several days may be used to control a heavy menstrual flow. Regular cycling with the birth control pill or estrogen-progesterone compounds can then begin. On rare occasions the endometrium becomes depleted by heavy anovulatory bleeding and fails to respond to the low-dose estrogen-progesterone therapy of the birth control pill. Intravenous estrogen can be used to stimulate the endometrial growth before cyclical hormones are given.7.Danforth D. Scott J. Obstetrics and Gynecology.5th ed. J. B. Lippincott, 1986Google Scholar In the perimenopausal woman, an endometrial biopsy or dilatation of the cervix and curettage of the uterus to exclude the possibility of endometrial cancer should be done, and a complete pelvic and breast examination should precede estrogen administration. Unopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium results in hyperplasia and, some authorities believe, the potential for cancer. For this reason long time periods between menses are undesirable. Controlled endometrial shedding induced by progesterone withdrawal at regular intervals prevents hyperplasia. Withdrawal bleeding is dependent on an endometrium adequately primed with estrogen and the absence of pregnancy. Because of the possible teratogenic effects of progesterone, administration to achieve endometrial shedding should be accompanied by secure contraception. Progesterone as a single agent may be administered to women who have adequate estrogen levels and are not sexually active, are sterile, or reliably use barrier methods of birth control. Other women may be cycled on birth control pills or sequential estrogen-progesterone medications. All women with an anovulatory bleeding history should be carefully instructed in the danger of intermenstrual bleeding as a sign of endometrial cancer. This symptom should be promptly reported to the clinician. Hysterectomy is frequently recommended for the perimenopausal woman with bleeding that is difficult to control. Despite the frequency with which the surgery is performed, hysterectomy is",

      "abstract": "Summary. No significant effects on the duration of subsequent oestrous cycles, the duration of pseudopregnancy or on the other characteristics of pseudopregnancy were observed after hysterectomy in albino mice. In pregnancy, except for a slight transient effect on Day 10, the residual duration of luteal activity (as measured by the duration of the extrauterine weight loss and the interval to oestrus) was independent of the presence or absence of the uterus and pregnancy was maintained by a single contralateral ovary associated with an isolated non-pregnant horn. Loss of the placentae by hysterectomy or uterine evacuation on the 8th day of pregnancy had no influence on the duration of CL activity when compared with that of pseudopregnant animals. Thereafter, the duration of residual luteal activity declined to a near constant level from the 14th day onwards and this decline was accompanied by a reduction in the variability of the life of the CL normally seen in pseudopregnancy. Placental removal after the 14th day was followed by almost immediate cessation of luteal function which at no time (with the possible exception of the 18th day) continued for the remainder of the gestation period.",

      "abstract": "An involuting uterus is a temporary barrier to fertility in cows, ewes and sows. Parturition is followed by a period when conception is not possible: about 1 week in sows and about 3 weeks in cows and ewes. Estrus and ovulation seldom occur together during this period and, if fertilization occurred and the embryo reached the uterus, placentation would be virtually impossible. The period of no fertility is followed by 2 to 3 weeks when fertility is possible, but not optimal. The extent to which the involuting uterus contributes to infertility during the second period is difficult to determine. Embryonic mortality in sows bred during this latter period appears to be a major cause of reduced litter size, so changes in uterine environment associated with involution may be essential for optimum fertility. Conception rate is lower up to 40 days after parturition than later in cows and ewes. Uterine involution appears not to be a barrier to fertility after 3 to 4 weeks postpartum in sows or 5 to 6 weeks postpartum in cows and ewes unless delayed by inflammation or infection.",

      "title": "The Breeding Cycle of the Female Humpback Whale, Megaptera nodosa (Bonnaterre)",
      "abstract": "The gestation period in the humpback whale is of almost 12 months' duration, most conceptions occurring early in August with parturition at the beginning of the following August. The modal length of calves at birth is 14 ft. The sex ratio at birth is 51.4 per cent. males to 48.6 per cent. females. Twin foetuses are occasionally recorded. There is no preference towards either right or left ovary or uterine cornu with regard to ovulation or pregnancy. The breaking of the umbilical cord at birth is described. The histological appearances of the mammary gland during advanced pregnancy and during lactation are described and illustrated. Upon the evidence presented it is concluded that lactation in this species extends over 104 months, suckling generally commencing in mid August and terminating at the end of the following June. The composition of the milk has been determined during various stages of lactation. Oestrous cycles rarely occur during pregnancy, but examples of ovulation following shortly after parturition, while the females are suckling their calves, are cited. It is shown that when the calf is lost at or soon after birth, oestrous cycles usually recommence at once. Where the calf is suckled for the normal period (10½ months) there is no anoestrous period following the end of lactation as oestrous cycles recommence in July, immediately after (occasionally just before) weaning at the end of June. Three types of breeding cycle are shown for the humpback whale. In the most common cycle, absence of the post-partum ovulation, or its occurrence without conception, results in one calf in 2 years. On the other hand, a successful postpartum ovulation results in two calves in 2 years. In the third type of cycle, loss of the first calf at or just after parturition is balanced by a second pregnancy succeeding immediately afterwards. This results in two pregnancies in 2 years with only one calf reared.",

A 1% incidence of de novo erectile dysfunction after anterior urethropathy was found with systematic review and meta analysis of 36 studies with 2323 patients. In most cases the erectile dysfunction was transient and resolved within six to twelve months. Objective To evaluate the likelihood of developing de novo erectile dysfunction ( ED ) after anterior urethroplasty and to determine if this likelihood is influenced by age, stricture length, number of previous procedures or timing of evaluation.

      "abstract": "Anal resting pressure is based on active forces generated by the smooth and striated sphincter muscles and on the expansion of the blood-filled anal vascular cushions. Anal continence is a complex phenomenon based on a sphincter barrier, reservoir function, and sensation components. The resting anal pressure, however, is important for the retention of gas and liquid stool, i.e., when the function of the flap-valve component of the continence mechanism is ineffective. Anal resting pressure is higher in men than in women. Most of the studies found that anal pressure tends to decrease with age, especially after menopause and after the age of 70. Anal resting pressure is influenced by methodological factors, age and gender. Anal manometry is not a standardized investigation technique. The smooth internal anal sphincter continuously generates electrical and mechanical rhythmic activity. Its pure myogenic activity is weak but greatly enhanced by the sympathetic innervation.",

If something is painful, it is painful, and one will typically wish to avoid it.\n\nWomen with endometriosis have a nine-fold increase in risk of deep dyspareunia in comparison to the general female population of corresponding age.6 In two groups of women with recto-vaginal endometriosis ( n =100) and peritoneal and/or ovarian endometriosis ( n  = 100) compared to healthy controls ( n =100), 67% and 53%, respectively, reported deep dyspareunia compared with 26% of controls.7\n\nWhilst recognising that dyspareunia is found in populations without endometriosis, this study demonstrated that women with endometriosis experience more frequent and severe deep dyspareunia and worse sexual functioning compared with women without endometriosis.

Hypertensive disorders are associated with increased maternal and perinatal mortality and present as a wide spectrum of disorders, ranging from minimal elevation of blood pressure alone to severe hypertension with multiple organ dysfunction. Gestational hypertension may be defined as elevated blood pressure appearing after the 20th week of pregnancy or in the first 24 hours postpartum without edema or proteinuria, and with a return to normotension within 10 days of delivery. The classifications and definitions of the hypertension disorders of pregnancy are frequently confusing. It is often difficult to differentiate between pre-eclampsia, chronic hypertension, and chronic hypertension with superimposed pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a disorder specific to human pregnancy. Pre-eclampsia may be classified as either mild or severe. The endothelium and the internal elastic lamina are replaced by invading trophoblast tissue.",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus. Deposits are commonly distributed on the ovaries, uterosacral ligaments, pouch of Douglas, rectum and sigmoid colon, bladder and ureter. Endometriosis is common, affecting 10% of the female adult population and up to 50% of women with infertility. Risk factors include early menarche, late menopause, delayed childbearing, vaginal outflow obstruction and a first-degree relative affected. Women commonly present to their GP with pelvic pain, painful intercourse or subfertility. Classically the pain starts several days before the period which is extremely painful. After the period, symptoms tend to improve until mid-cycle when the pattern repeats again. Patients also complain of fatigue. Abdominal palpation, bimanual and speculum examination are important to identify signs of endometriosis, but also to exclude alternative diagnoses such as fibroid uterus, infection or pregnancy. However, a normal examination does not exclude a diagnosis of endometriosis. Serum CA125 can be raised in endometriosis but is not specific or sensitive for the condition and is therefore not recommended as a screening test. A normal pelvic ultrasound scan does not exclude a diagnosis of endometriosis. The gold standard investigation for endometriosis is laparoscopy and biopsy with histological confirmation. Referral should be considered if pain is not controlled with simple analgesia or the diagnosis is suspected in a woman who is actively trying to conceive. Early referral should be considered in women with abnormal examination findings, or an abnormal ultrasound result.",

The most common areas of genital pain include the vulva, the vaginal opening, and inside of the vagina. Management of acute perineal pain following childbirth includes pain medications and cryotherapy. Late pregnancy perineal massage may decrease birth-related perineal trauma for primiparous women. Minimizing the use of episiotomy, as well as limiting forceps and vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery, may decrease or prevent perineal pain and dyspareunia. Treatment of pain-related anxiety and postpartum depression may also prevent or lessen postpartum genito-pelvic pain.",

Genital dissatisfaction can lead to low self-esteem and psychosexual dysfunction. Therefore, phalloplasty, the gold standard in transgender surgery, may provide a possibility to achieve a satisfactory genital appearance and sexual function. Small series have reported cosmetically acceptable and erogenous sensate neophalli with incorporation of a neourethra to allow voiding in a standing position and with enough bulk to allow penile prosthesis insertion for pleasurable intercourse. Although early results seem promising, further publication of series with large numbers and longer follow-up is needed to evaluate to what extent phalloplasty improves physical and sexual outcomes. Complications are of particular concern because of associated scarring and loss of sensitive tissue. Without full preoperative workups assessing patients' expectations and reasons for undergoing surgery, they may still struggle with self/penile image and with psychological barriers for engaging in sexual activity. Recommendations for the psychosocial management of boys and men with penile deficiency are suggested.",

      "abstract": "This review of periodic abstinence for family planning emphasizes terminology and distinctions between the prevalent methods, and issues that will enable the health practitioner to be informed about this family planning choice. Periodic abstinence developed in the 1930s when Ogino and Knaus independently discovered the timing of ovulation, and consequently the calendar-based rhythm method became sanctioned by the church. Philippine surveys find a 40/100 woman-year pregnancy rate with rhythm. The cervical mucus method is also known as the ovulation, Billings or mucus method. Coitus is permitted by the 4th night after the peak day. Symptoms may be obscured by vaginal or seminal fluids, infections, allergies, or drugs. The symptothermal method employs mucus symptoms and basal body temperature. Coitus is allowed on the 3rd night after the temperature rise. It has the lowest failure rate, ranging from 11.2-19.8. Some family planning groups also use other symptoms such as midcycle spotting or pain, cervical position, dilation or texture, moods or libido. Various teaching groups have published charts that facilitate charting symptoms, such as temperature graphs with wide scales to make it easier to read the temperature rise. Measuring efficacy rates is difficult, and different definitions are used for several types of failures. The most important factor in success with natural family planning is the motivation of the couple. The most common cause of failure is conscious departure from the rules. Some current issues regarding abstinence are possible risks of birth defects from aged gametes, the difficulty of predicting ovulation in women with irregular cycles, the effects of vaginal infection and illness on the mucus signs, the potential for sex selection through the use of timing of intercourse and development of tests and devices to predict ovulation.",

      "title": "Pelvic floor function during and after first pregnancy",
      "abstract": "This study evaluated the effects the first pregnancy and childbirth on the pelvic floor. Pregnancy and vaginal delivery can negatively affect pelvic floor function. Micturition symptoms, defecation symptoms and sexual dysfunction are all signs of an impaired pelvic floor function. These symptoms are known to have a high prevalence during and after pregnancy. In a non-pregnant population these symptoms are often experienced as bothersome. Efforts should be made to identify risk factors for different pelvic floor symptoms and the consequences of these symptoms on the quality of life. The studies in this thesis were all performed on a large cohort of healthy nulliparous women with a singleton pregnancy. The aims of this thesis was: 1. to report on the prevalence of pelvic floor symptoms during and after first pregnancy 2. to investigate the effect of pregnancy and childbirth on pelvic floor symptoms 3. to study the consequence of pelvic floor symptoms on the quality of life during and after first pregnancy 4. to determine what factors can be of influence on the sexual function after first childbirth Urogenital symptoms occurred in almost all women during pregnancy. Whereas the prevalence of frequency and urgency symptoms was high from 12 weeks gestation onwards and remained stable during pregnancy, the prevalence of urinary incontinence symptoms increased with gestational age. Despite the high prevalence of symptoms the majority of women reported not to be bothered by it. The prevalence of bothersome symptoms is the highest at 36 weeks gestation, and they are probably part of a normal pregnancy. After childbirth SUI was significantly more prevalent in women who delivered vaginally. Besides the mode of delivery, we did found another risk factor for SUI postpartum. The presence of SUI in early pregnancy gave an increased risk for experiencing SUI one year postpartum both in women after a vaginal delivery and in women who underwent a caesarean delivery. Overactive bladder symptoms are common during pregnancy. Dry OAB had no negative effect on the quality of life whereas wet OAB negatively affected the quality of life both during and after pregnancy, mainly on the mobility and embarrassment domain. The urge urinary incontinence symptom in wet OAB seems to have a profound negative effect on the quality of life. Apparently, in young mothers with wet OAB limitations in mobility are especially stressful and these symptoms can be embarrassing. Defecation symptoms that are already present in early pregnancy are highly predictive for reporting symptoms at 12 months postpartum. The only exception is fecal incontinence, which is mainly related to anal sphincter lesion. An important prognostic factor for a dissatisfied sexual relationship one year postpartum is not being sexual active in early pregnancy. Satisfaction with the sexual relationship seemed not to depend on pregnancy and parturition associated factors.",

      "abstract": "For many women, the monthly suffering induced by menstrual \"cramps\" is severe enough to profoundly disrupt their quality of life. In the case of primary dysmenorrhea, a condition related to premenstrual syndrome (PMS), intense uterine contractions are thought to trigger moderate to intense pain despite the absence of an underlying infection or other medically-identifiable disease states. The associated uterine hyper-contractility is reminiscent of labor, and associated pain is likely to be mediated by the release of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and the infiltration of leukocytes that normally accompany the breakdown of the endometrial lining. Standardized extracts of Vitex agnus-castus berries (VAC extracts of chaste tree, or chaste berries) are clinically effective in treating the symptoms of PMS, yet the mechanisms of how the chemically complex mixture acts are largely unknown. Using an in vivo dysmenorrhea model rats were treated with 10 mg/kg estradiol-benzoate i.p. once daily for 12 days and with 2.1, 10.3 or 20.7 mg/kg VAC dry extract p.o. once daily for 7 days prior to induction of convulsions. Uterine contractions where induced with 2 IU/kg oxytocin i.p., followed by monitoring of abdominal convulsions and signs of pain on the last day of the experiment. Moreover, in vitro methods were applied that are described in the methods section. Here, we show that the VAC herbal dry extract BNO 1095 (commercially available as Agnucaston®) targets the uterine myometrial tissue and inflammatory signaling molecules of associated migratory/inflammatory cells. Specifically, BNO 1095 dose-dependently inhibited oxytocin-induced uterine contractions in a rat dysmenorrhea model in vivo and drug-induced contractions in isolated human and rat uterine tissue in vitro. Furthermore, BNO 1095 showed a promising anti-inflammatory capacity by potently inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase activity and leukotriene production and by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species and inflammatory cytokines in vitro. These results provide evidence that BNO 1095 effectively treats menstruation-related complaints including primary dysmenorrhea.",

Evidence is cited showing that overall PG levels or levels of certain types of PG rise with IUD, and that this is a local reaction. In 1976 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were successfully used to reduce uterine bleeding. The means by which the IUD induces abnormal uterine bleeding has not been determined. Some authors have sought to explain the rise in PG by means of aseptic inflammation of the endometrium. The possible role of platelets, thrombus, and expansion and contraction of blood vessels in bleeding with IUD has been raised. The uterus with IUD becomes more active. When IUD is designed too large or insufficiently pliable, abnormal bleeding may occur in menstruation. The presence of an IUD makes the uterus highly sensitive to PG, so that even normal PG levels can cause a strong reaction in the uterine smooth muscle. PG plays an important role in the mechanisms of abnormal uterine bleeding; PG suppressants will be significant in treating abnormal uterine bleeding with IUD.",

In the case of patients with congenital malformations of genital organs, interdisciplinary medical and psychological care should be sought, and the help of a specialist in family doctor is also important. Despite the fact that in the practice of a family doctor the problem of congenital malformations is relatively rare, due to the importance of the problem, it is important in family medicine to know about patients with abnormalities in the structure and function of the genital organs arising during intrauterine life due to differentiation disorders sexual. These patients require a referral to gynecological specialists. It is important to properly diagnose the type of defect, possibly eliminate unpleasant ailments, and thus restore the proper functioning of the genital organs also in the context of functioning in the sexual sphere.

This is partly due to the fact that elective caesarean section as a potentially preventative intervention is increasingly available and perceived as safe. As there is a multitude of emotive issues involved, including health economics and the relative roles of healthcare providers, the discussion surrounding pelvic floor trauma in childbirth has not always been completely rational. However, after 25 years of urogynaecological research in this field it should be possible to determine whether pelvic floor trauma in childbirth is myth or reality, and, if real, whether it matters for the pathogenesis of incontinence and prolapse. On reviewing the available evidence, it appears that there are sufficient grounds to assume that vaginal delivery (or even the attempt at vaginal delivery) can cause damage to the pudendal nerve, the inferior aspects of the levator ani muscle and fascial pelvic organ supports. Risk factors for such damage have been defined and variously include operative vaginal delivery, a long second stage, and macrosomia. It is much less clear, however, whether such trauma is clinically relevant, and how important it is in the aetiology of pelvic floor morbidity later in life.",

The evaluation and management of Cushing disease, acromegaly, prolactinomas, both intra- and postpartum, is different from that in a nonpregnant state or in men; management pearls are offered. New-onset visual symptoms or pituitary deficiencies proximal to pregnancy can signify a potentially fatal pituitary disorder such as lymphocytic hypophystis or Sheehan syndrome and demand early diagnosis and treatment.

Prematura may experience a postpartum complications and the some of this is: postpartum infections, bleeding after delivery, breast problems (mastitis), urinary incontinence, postpartum depression and psychosis and tromboembolism. Postpartum hemorrhage is usually happens because the uterus fails to properly contract after the placenta has been delivered, or because of hematomes in the uterus, cervix or vagina. If bleeding is severe, midwife must massage the uterus to help it contract and gives the oxytocin.\r\n Urine production often increases greatly, but temporarily, after delivery. Because bladder sensation may be decreased after delivery, the midwife encourage a mother to try to urinate regularly, at least every 4 hours. Doing so avoids overfilling the bladder and helps prevent bladder infections. If the prematura cannot urinate on her own, a midwife must inserted catheter temporarily into the bladder to empty the urine. Once a urinary infection is diagnosed, the therapy is antibiotics. The women must drink plenty of fluids, and are asked to give urine samples at the beginning and end of treatment to screen for any remaining bacteria.\r\n Mastitis, or breast infection, usually is indicated reddened area on the breast but the entire breast may also be involved. Breast infections - which can be brought on by bacteria may be accompanied by fever, chills, fatigue, elevated temperatures and headache. For therapy she must take a antibiotics and she can continue to nurse but it's also important to drink plenty of fluids. Thromboembolism is a disease that occurs due to prolonged bed rest. Therefore midwives must encourage women to quickly get up and move, to avoid complications that can even lead to death. Some prematures experience a case of the baby blues. Changes in hormone levels, combined with the new responsibility of caring for a newborn, make many new mothers feel anxious, overwhelmed or angry. For most, this moodiness and mild depression go away within several days or weeks. In this period she needs the understanding of the family and a midwife. Postpartum depression usually becomes apparent two weeks to three months after delivery, is characterized by intense feelings of anxiety or despair but the postpartum psychosis is much dangerous and in both cases prematura needs psychiatric help.\r\n Urinary incontinence is the inadvertent passage of urine, usually is caused by the stretching of the base of the bladder during pregnancy and delivery. The midwife must educates the women how to doing Kegel exercises. In the meantime, wear protective undergarments or sanitary napkins.\r\n Finally, the task of the midwife is to see women as an integral being in need of psychological, physical and social assistance in the event that the application itself, and midwives will be able to provide the help, security and understanding and thus brighten period puerperium during their stay in the maternity ward.",

Hysterotomy is now recommended when tubal ligation is also indicated. Vacuum aspiration entails dilatation under local or regional anesthesia to 2 Hegar numbers beyond the number of postmenstrual weeks of pregnancy. A vacuum source more powerful than usual in surgery and apparatus for resuscitation are required. Vacuum aspiration can be performed up to 12 weeks of amenorrhea; Karman or \"miniaspiration\" up to 8 weeks. The Karman method requires operative skill to dilate the cervix 5 mm without causing too much pain or leaving retained products. Intraamniotic saline, glucose, or urea used after 16 weeks results in few long-term complications because the delivery resembles natural labor, but it does require up to 5 days' hospitalization. Intraamniotic prostaglandin administration is preferred over the intravenous or intrauterine routes. A self-administered method for bringing on menses has been unsuccessful in women.",

The care that a woman receives during labor should not only help her to cope with the effort, stress, and pain; it should minimize or remove the danger as well. The purpose of monitoring the progress of labor is to recognize incipient problems, so that their progression to serious problems may be prevented. Prolonged labor can lead to adverse outcomes for both mother and baby, including maternal exhaustion, perinatal asphyxia, and even death. Inefficient uterine action can be recognized and corrected, and some adverse outcomes can be prevented.

L’igiene intima della donna nel post-partum svolge un ruolo importante nel riequilibrare la flora ed il pH vaginale. L’estratto di Thymus vulgaris, utilizzato nell’igiene intima 1 o 2 volte/die per 4 settimane, riduce significativamente la presenza di sintomi vulvovaginali\r\nquali prurito, bruciore, edema, eritema, leucorrea. Questo si associa a significativo miglioramento del desiderio, dell’eccitazione e dell’orgasmo, e a significativa riduzione della dispareunia. Conclusioni: un’igiene appropriata nel post-partum e associata ad una significativa riduzione dei sintomi genitali e ad un parallelo miglioramento della sessualita della donna in tutte le sue dimensioni. Il ginecologo puo migliorare i sintomi genitali e sessuali in puerperio attraverso una diagnosi accurata, e una terapia che includa i suggerimenti\r\nper un’appropriata igiene intima.",

      "abstract": "Menopause is the stage in a woman's life when her monthly periods stop. It is the end of a woman's reproductive years. Perimenopause is the first stage of this process and can begin eight to 10 years before menopause. Menopause is the point when a woman has not had a menstrual period for at least 12 months. Postmenopause is the stage after menopause. Menopause is the end of a woman's menstrual cycle and fertility. This happens when: Your ovaries no longer make estrogen and progesterone, two hormones necessary for reproduction and Your periods have stopped for 1 year. Menopause naturally occurs with age. But it can also be due to surgery, treatment of some disease or due to some disease. In these cases it may be called induced menopause, surgical menopause, or primary ovarian insufficiency, depending on the cause. Menopause begins around age 51 when it occurs naturally. But it could happen before you turn 40. This is called premature menopause. The age at which you start is mostly determined by your genes.",

      "title": "Chains of Grief: The Impact of Perinatal Loss on Subsequent Pregnancy",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: This paper identifies women who are at greater potential for medical complications in their pregnancies due to post traumatic stress resulting from previous perinatal loss. The loss may have been suffered by the woman herself during a past pregnancy or she may have inherited heightened anxiety from perinatal loss experienced by her mother. In the latter case, the unresolved grief is transmitted from mother to daughter, affecting physiological, emotional and behavioral patterns in the next generation. Pregnancy presents an opportunity for healing. Given effective prenatal counseling by a trained clinician, perinatal loss issues can be addressed through body-centered hypnosis so that history does not repeat itself. Left untreated, post traumatic stress can produce crippling anxiety for the pregnant woman, contributing to complications of pregnancy, childbirth and even parenting. The family who loses a newborn infant (or fetus through miscarriage or stillbirth) endures a deep tragedy. When asked, many families who have experienced perinatal death have said that the death of a newborn hurts as much as the death of an older child, spouse or parent. The loss is different: one mourns unfulfilled life. However, the love and expectations that go into anticipating a life that will not be fulfilled are usually greatly underestimated by those who have not experienced such a loss. Richard Marshall Medical research has documented the impact of emotional stress on the outcome of pregnancy and childbirth (Lederman, et al., 1978; Levenson and Shnider, 1979; Gotsuch and Key, 1974, Peterson et al., 1988) as well as substantiating a critical period for bonding. (Klaus et al., 1972; Kennel, et al., 1975). The impact of emotional support on the length of labor and facilitation of maternal-infant interaction immediately following birth has also verified the importance of the emotional and psychological aspects of medical care during the perinatal period (Sosa, et al., 1980). However, little research has been done on the impact of perinatal loss on subsequent pregnancy and prenatal bonding, despite the fact that it is one of the most emotionally charged issues that a woman may have to deal with during the course of a subsequent pregnancy. Although some authors have attempted to identify the needs of bereft parents (Benreid and Nichols, 1981; Marshall, 1981) there has been little research done to explore the impact on a subsequent pregnancy, or information about what can be done to help women resolve grief prenatally. The purpose of this paper is to share the importance of addressing these needs during pregnancy, and the use of body-centered hypnosis in the context of a preventive prenatal counseling program as a method of choice to reduce anxiety and resolve loss, making way for the potential birth of another child. Women who have endured previous perinatal loss have greater emotional adjustments to a new pregnancy, including fear of another loss, which has impact not only on attachment to the unborn fetus but also may precipitate heightened fear and panic states throughout the pregnancy and into the labor process. Little had been done in standard prenatal care to help this special needs population. In my clinical experiences, it is evident that women who have endured loss in the perinatal period are at greater risk for future miscarriage, prematurity and complications of childbirth. As these women approach a subsequent pregnancy, attachment and loyalty to the previous child resurfaces, often making it difficult for the mother to form an attachment to the next pregnancy. When loss remains unresolved, disruption in bonding and attachment can affect not only the immediate maternal-infant relationship, but can have substantial impact on successive generations. Women who have absorbed the impact of their mother's unresolved prenatal loss during their own childhood are particularly vulnerable to high levels of anxiety and fear during pregnancy, childbirth and the ongoing maternal-child relationship. …",

      "abstract": "Adolescents belong to vital age group, not only because they are the entrant population to parenthood but also they are in the threshold between childhood and adulthood. The period of adolescence for a girl is a period of physical and psychological preparation for safe motherhood. The first menstrual period is called menarche. It usually starts between the ages 11 and 14. Though the menstruation is normal, some girls experience dilemma during their monthly periods. The most commonly experienced problem by the girls is cramping pain during menstruation, known as Dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea is defined as pain or discomfort (cramps) during or just before a menstrual period. Two types of dysmenorrhea are primary and secondary dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea symptoms include back ache, sweats and gastrointestinal symptoms. Pain begins at the onset of the menstrual flow and lasts for 12 to 48 hours. Pharmacotherapy can be used to treat primary dysmenorrhea but it has limitation because of adverse reactions which mandates the selection of alternative therapeutic modalities. Hence the investigator used yoga therapy to treat primary dysmenorrhea as an alternative therapy. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in selected schools and 300 adolescent girls who had primary dysmenorrhea were selected by simple random sampling method. Data was collected by using Numerical pain intensity scale for pain and Likert scale for associated factors of primary dysmenorrhea. Pretest was conducted during menstruation and Yoga therapy was given to experimental group (150) for 3 months and for control group (150) no intervention was given. The posttest was conducted after 3 subsequent menstrual cycles for both groups. The major findings of the study showed that there was a significant difference in the pain scores and associated factors scores of experimental and control group. The pain scores of primary dysmenorrhea was significantly different at 0.001 level of significance among experimental and control group showed that yoga therapy was one of the definite alternative therapy to treat primary dysmenorrhea.",

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders. A variety of different chemical structures have been found to have antidepressant activity. The number is constantly growing; however, as yet, no one group has been found to have a clear therapeutic advantage over the others. The major indication for antidepressant drugs is depression, but a number of side effects have been established by clinical experience and controlled trials. It is clear that, to some extent, any drug or chemical substance administered to the mother is able to cross the placenta unless it is destroyed or altered during metabolism. Placental transport of maternal substrates to the fetus and of substances from the fetus to the mother is established at about the fifth week of fetal life. Traditionally, teratogenic effects of antidepressants or other drugs have been noted as anatomic malformation. It is clear that these are dose- and time-related and that the fetus is at great risk during the first 3 months of gestation. However, it is possible for antidepressants to exert their effects on the fetus at other times during pregnancy as well as to infants during lactation. Administration of antidepressants to pregnant women presents a unique problem for the physician. Not only must maternal pharmacologic mechanisms be taken into consideration when prescribing an antidepressant drug, but the fetus must also be regarded as a potential recipient of the drug. Certain results are evident with regard to drugs administered during lactation. It is essential that physicians need to be aware of the results of animal studies in this area and of the potential risk of maternal drug ingestion to the suckling infant.",

The condition is commonly associated with other chronic pain disorders and can be exceedingly debilitating, resulting in sexual dysfunction, severe depression and/or anxiety. It can significantly impair quality of life. Goals for long-term team approach management should be discussed with the patient at the commencement of each intervention as effectiveness of therapy is not assured. Currently, there is no intervention that effects cure in all individuals and a combination of pharmacological therapy, psychotherapy and physiotherapy, reserving surgery as a last-line option, is the best option for treatment. There are no long-term data on how long women will have symptoms and, if resolved, what provokes symptoms again in the future, whilst correlation between the etiology of vulvodynia and efficacy of treatment is not known.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Many women experience various menstrual problems in their lives and adenomyosis is one of them. Adenomyosis is when the endometrial tissue grows within the muscular wall of the uterus. It forms a distinct nodular cluster of smooth muscle and endometrial glands, leading to the thickening of the surrounding myometrium. This condition is often associated with heavy or irregular menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea. Although adenomyosis is not directly correlated with any disease in Ayurveda, based on symptoms such as Theevra vedana, shyava Aruna varuna Artava, and kati Vedana, it mostly simulates with Vataja asrigdara.Methodology: A39-year-old married female visited to the Outpatient Department of Prasuti Tantra Evam Stri Rogaat SKGAC &amp; H, Kurukshetra, with complaints of pain during menstruation, dull aching pain in the lower abdomen along with heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) per vagina with the passage of clots in menses for 3 months. She was supposed to be treated with an Ayurvedic line of management. Ayurvedic treatments can be very beneficial in relieving the symptoms of adenomyosis and improving the overall health of the patient.Results: The patient was given three cycles of Matra Basti for three consecutive before the menstrual cycle along with oral Ayurvedic medicines. The treatment given shows noticeable progress in HMB and dysmenorrhea. The outcome of the study is very positive.Discussion: The present study emphasized the role of Ayurveda in bringing positive results in the management of adenomyosis.Conclusion: In this case study we can conclude that ayurvedic intervention are effective in treating Adenomyosis and require further studies for longer periods and larger sample size.",

      "abstract": "If a severe uterine inflammation is diagnosed 15 days post partum in a cow with retained placenta by clinical examination, it has to be assumed that this inflammation was already manifest two days before (in the discussed case at the time of purchase). By an external examination of the animal this genital inflammation cannot be seen, if there is no vaginal discharge or dried uterine fluids at the tail and around the vulva. The inflammation is the consequence of the placental retention, even if there has been veterinary assistance (manual removal of the retained placenta, antibiotic treatment of the uterus) in time. After manual removal of the placenta, part of it is normally left in the tips of the uterine horns; they cannot be reached by the veterinarian's hand. Even by additional means - like application of oxytocin, lifting the abdomen of the cow with the aid of a plank or trying to invert the tip of the uterine horn - the fetal membranes cannot always be totally removed. The statement that the placenta has been totally removed, is correct only if the end of the chorionic membranes could be clearly identified. Each placental retention in cattle carries the risk of reduced fertility. If a cow is sold a few days post partum, this defect, which can reduce the animal's breeding value, may be unnoticed.",

The ischuria pathophysiology is not fully understood, but there are several hypotheses that may cause the occurrence of urinary retention in the early postpartum period. For example, trauma to the pelvic floor muscles and innervation can lead to decreased bladder sensitivity, and swelling of the ureters and vagina after childbirth can lead to urinary tract obstruction. Despite the frequency of complications in the form of ischuria, the maternity hospital staff does not pay sufficient attention to screening for these problems in the early and late postpartum periods.

Most obvious is the requirement that each woman who arrives at this period of readjustment should have a general review of her history and a systematic examination for the sake of her entire health problem. The extent to which this needs to be elaborated will depend upon the amount of detail about her which the physician already has available in his records. Specifically sought is evidence of neoplasm in the breasts or pelvic organs. Uterine fibroids or polyps may be a contraindication to estrogenic therapy or may require surgical treatment before estrogens are administered. When menstrual irregularity, amenorrhea, or menorrhagia occur before age 40 they may be indications of the menopause occurring prematurely, but before treatment is started other possibilities should be given deliberate consideration. These phenomena may follow dysfunction of the ovaries induced not only by primary ovarian failure (the usual concept of the menopause) but also by anterior-pituitary or, occasionally, thyroid disturbance. In turn these latter may be induced by systemic disorders of varied types.",

      "abstract": "Approximately 8–10% of premenopausal women experience moderate to severe perimenstrual breast pain or cyclical mastalgia, monthly. This mastalgia can occur regularly for years until menopause, can interfere with usual activities, and is associated with elevated utilization of mammography among young women. Although mastalgia is a well documented symptom in premenstrual syndrome (PMS), it is unknown whether PMS is necessarily present in women with cyclical mastalgia. The present study prospectively examined mastalgia and its relationship to PMS. Thirty-two premenopausal women reporting recent mastalgia completed breast pain and menstrual symptom scales daily for 3–6 months. Eleven women (34.4%) met criteria for clinically significant cyclical mastalgia, reporting an average of 10.2 days of moderate-severe mastalgia monthly. Five women (15.6%) met criteria for PMS. Mastalgia was not significantly associated with PMS: 82% of women with clinical cyclical mastalgia did not have PMS. Cyclical mastalgia, although by definition associated with the menstrual cycle, is not simply premenstrual syndrome, and merits further investigation as a recurrent pain disorder whose presentation, etiology, and effective treatment are likely to differ from those of PMS.",

      "abstract": "Mual muntah adalah keluhan yang sering dirasakan oleh wanita yang sedang hamil terutama trimester pertama. Gejala mual muntah biasanya muncul pada usia kehamilan 7- 12 minggu. Penyebabnya adalah karena faktor fisologis dan psikologis. Peningkatan hormon HCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin) dan estrogen dapat menyebabkan jaringan-jaringan otot pada sistem pencernaan menjadi kurang efisien sehingga meningkatkan asam lambung dan memperlambat metabolisme dalam tubuh. Faktor psikologis dipicu dari lingkungan sekitar seperti pekerjaan atau masalah keluarga membuat ibu hamil menjadi stress, dan mengganggu sistem hormonal dari lambung dalam kontrol sekresi asam lambung sehingga asam lambung meningkat menyebabkan mual muntah. Mual muntah dapat menyebabkan penurunan nafsu makan sehingga terdapat perubahan keseimbangan elektrolit yang menyebabkan perubahan metabolisme tubuh. Tujuan kegiatan meningkatkan pengetahuan ibu hamil tentang akupresur dan tentang mual muntah, meningkatkan ketrampilan ibu hamil dalam melakukan akupresur untuk mengurangi mual muntah dalam kehamilan. Metode yang digunakan adalah penyuluhan dan pelatihan akupresur. Kegiatan dilaksanakan selama 1 hari, diikuti 8 orang ibu hamil. Hasil  kegiatan, terjadi peningkatan pengetahuan ibu hamil  dari kategori cukup (51-70) sebanyak 50% dan kategori kurang (<50) sebanyak 50%.

      "title": "Study of the possibility of osteopathic correction inclusion in the complex therapy of pelvic pain syndrome in women at the late postpartum period",
      "abstract": "Introduction . Pain during childbirth and pain after childbirth are unavoidable. Most often, the occurrence of pelvic pain syndrome after childbirth is associated with the manifestation of physiological changes in the joints and bones of the pelvis during pregnancy and during childbirth. The musculoskeletal system of a woman after childbirth passes to normal functioning gradually, and some stages of this process may be accompanied by pain syndrome of various localization and severity. In the late postpartum period and during lactation, non-drug treatment of pain syndrome is preferable. One of the promising non-drug approaches may be the timely application of osteopathic correction methods. However, the available scientific literature presents relatively few studies on the possibility of osteopathic methods using for the pelvic pain syndrome correction in women at the postpartum period. The aim of the study was to research the possibility of osteopathic correction inclusion in the complex therapy of pelvic pain syndrome in women at the late postpartum period. Materials and methods. A group of women after physiological childbirth was randomly formed homogeneous by age, parity of childbirth. The study involved 40 primiparous women aged 30–40 years with no organic diseases, and with the presence of pelvic pain syndrome, which first appeared in the late postpartum period (2–8 weeks after physiological birth through the natural birth canal). Two groups were formed by the randomization envelopes method: the main group (20 participants) and the control group (20 participants). In both groups, the patients received therapy in the form of applications of anesthetic ointments (gels), the use of the Lyapko applicator, elements of therapeutic physical culture (static gymnastic exercises in the supine position). Patients of the main group additionally received osteopathic correction (3 sessions with an interval of 10–14 days). Before and after treatment, osteopathic status, quality of life according to the MOS-SF-36 questionnaire, and intensity of pain syndrome according to the visual analog scale (VAS) were assessed in both groups. Results. Prior to the treatment start in the both groups, patients had biomechanical disorders of the neck region (structural component — in 50 % of the participants in the main group and 40 % of the control group), thoracic region (structural component — in 55 and 60 %, respectively), lumbar region (structural component — 95 and 55 %, and the visceral component — 45 and 20 %), the pelvic region (structural component — 100 and 95 %). In the main group, regional biomechanical disorders of the pelvic region were also detected, the visceral component — in 50 % of the participants. After the treatment, the patients of both groups had no regional biomechanical disorders of the thoracic region (structural component), the lumbar region (visceral component), and the pelvic region (visceral component). In the main group, in addition, there was a statistically significant ( p &lt;0,05) positive dynamics in relation to dysfunctions of the neck region (structural component), lumbar region (structural component), pelvic region (structural component). The groups began to differ significantly ( p &lt;0,05) in relation to the following regional disorders: lumbar region (structural component) and pelvic region (structural component). At the study start, the participants in the both groups were characterized by low quality of life, assessed by SF-36, and severe pain by VAS. After the treatment in both groups, there were statistically significant ( p &lt;0,05) positive dynamics in all of the above indicators: the pain syndrome severity decreased, and the life quality indicators increased; and in the main group the results were statistically significantly ( p &lt;0,05) more pronounced. Conclusion. Based on the obtained results, it is possible to recommend the inclusion of osteopathic correction in the complex therapy of pelvic pain syndrome in women at the late postpartum period. But also it is recommended to continue the study with the involvement of a larger number of participants.",

      "abstract": "Introducao: De acordo com a Sociedade Brasileira de Urologia (SBU) 40% das gestantes podem apresentar um ou mais episodios de incontinencia urinaria durante a gestacao ou logo apos o parto. O desejo frequente de urinar pode ser um dos primeiros sinais de gravidez, a bexiga fica logo acima dos ossos pelvicos e e sustentada pelo seu assoalho pelvico. A bexiga relaxa e se enche de urina, enquanto o esfincter urinario - estrutura que fica em volta do canal da urina - mantem o orgao fechado ate que voce possa usar o banheiro. Isso ocorre varias vezes ao longo do dia e noite. Durante a gravidez e o parto, os musculos do assoalho pelvico sao postos a prova, uma vez que nesta fase, ha aumento da pressao sobre estes musculos, algumas das causas comuns da incontinencia urinaria na gestacao e o esforco que onde pode acontecer o escape de urina quando tossir, espirrar, se exercitar ou rir. Esses movimentos fisicos exercem pressao extra sobre a bexiga, o que causa incontinencia por estresse, hormonios, Infeccoes do Trato Urinario – ITU, entre suas causas estao as mudancas hormonais e imunologicas deste periodo. Objetivo: Esse trabalho tem como objetivo relatar a incontinencia urinaria durante o periodo gestacional em forma de uma revisao de literatura. Metodo: Trata-se de revisao de literatura, constituida por seis artigos cientificos publicados no Sci-Elo, Hcor e BVS, entre 2014 e 2018, selecionados por meio de palavras-chave, disponiveis na integra, gratuitos, em ingles, portugues. Resultados: A forma mais prevalente de incontinencia urinaria nas mulheres nos anos reprodutivos e a Incontinencia Urinaria de Esforco (IUE). Este tipo de IU e caracterizado como a perda involuntaria de urina durante a realizacao de esforcos fisicos, devendo-se a um aumento brusco da pressao intra-abdominal na ausencia da atividade do musculo detrusor. Conclusao: O periodo gestacional ja traz a gestante varias mudancas fisiologicas ao organismo, com tudo os sintomas da incontinencia provocam um impacto negativo nas gestantes, nesse impacto da incontinencia ao final da gestacao. A musculatura da regiao pelvica sofre uma pressao e comprime um pouco a bexiga neste periodo e, por isso, o desconforto urinario pode acontecer.",

      "abstract": "Sphincter preservation and organ restoration during rectal cancer surgery avoids permanent stoma creation and diminishes psychosocial damages. However, decreased rectal volumes and sphincter dysfunction—including pelvic nerve damage—results in low anterior resection syndrome, as well as urinary and sexual dysfunction after rectal resection. Bowel habit changes such as fecal incontinence, fecal urgency, frequent bowel movements, clustered stools, and difficulties in bowel emptying can be treated using medications, pelvic floor rehabilitation, sacral neuromodulation, or neorectal reservoir reconstruction. Pelvic nerve damage resulting from superior and inferior hypogastric plexi during sphincter-preserving rectal cancer surgery can induce urologic and sexual dysfunctions. Preoperative voiding difficulty, perioperative blood loss, and autonomic nerve injury are considered independent risk factors for postoperative urinary dysfunction. Retrograde ejaculation and erectile dysfunction, female dyspareunia, and vaginal dryness are manifestations of sexual dysfunction resulting from autonomic nerve injury during rectal cancer surgery. Multifactorial causes for functional outcomes after sphincter- preserving surgeries are considered to improve patient’s quality of life with acceptable oncologic outcomes in the treatment of rectal cancer patients.",

      "abstract": "Study Type – Therapy (case series) Level of Evidence 4 What’s known on the subject? and What does the study add? Intraprostatic injection of botulinum toxin type A was shown to be effective in decreasing symptoms of BPH in several recent studies. However, the possible impairment of sexual function caused by the neurotoxin had never been investigated. This study shows that intraprostatic administration of botulinum toxin type A neither causes deterioration of sexual function (libido, orgasm, erectile function or ejaculation), nor alteration of serum testosterone levels. OBJECTIVE • To evaluate the consequences on male sexual function of intraprostatic injection of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT/A) as a treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Although BoNT/A is effective in decreasing symptoms of BPH, neuronal impairment caused by the neurotoxin might affect emission/ejaculation. These aspects have not been evaluated before. PATIENTS AND METHODS • In all, 16 sexually active men aged &gt;60 years with BPH/benign prostatic enlargement (BPE), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) ≥8 and a maximum urinary flow rate ( Q max ) &lt;15 mL/s refractory to standard medical therapy volunteered for the study. • Patients were injected transrectally, under ultrasonographic control, with 200 U of BoNT/A in the prostate. Evaluation was carried out at baseline and 1, 3 and 6 months post‐treatment. Erectile function was evaluated using the International Index of Erectile Function – Short Form (IIEF‐5) questionnaire. • Orgasmic/ejaculatory function and libido were evaluated using questions 9, 10, 11 and 12 of the IIEF – Long Form. Total testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH) and prolactin were also investigated. RESULTS • The mean age was 73 ± 6 years. The IIEF‐5 score was 16.5 ± 6 at baseline, 15.7 ± 6 at 1 month, 16.6 ± 6 at 3 months and 15.7 ± 5 at 6 months (differences nonsignificant). • The score for ejaculatory/orgasmic function (questions 9 and 10) remained fairly constant from baseline to the sixth month, 8.3 ± 1.9 and 8 ± 2.1 respectively. • The sexual desire score (questions 11 and 12 of the IIEF) also remained little changed from baseline (5.9 ± 1.6) to month 6 (6.1 ± 2). Total serum testosterone, LH, FSH and prolactin did not change during the study. CONCLUSIONS • Intraprostatic injection of BoNT/A in patients with BPE does not impair erectile, orgasmic or ejaculatory functions and does not change libido. • The male hormonal profile is not altered by BoNT/A injection. This facilitates the acceptance of BoNT/A as a treatment for BPH/BPE lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) refractory to standard medical management.",

Even seemingly convincing experimental evidences are contradictory concerning the causes of the hypertrophy of the mammary glands during pregnancy and their secretory activity immediately after parturition. There is a general opinion that nervous shock, certain psychic states caused by the presence or absence of the suckling reflex and the emotional status and environment of the mother affect the flow of milk. The perturbation accompanying these factors is evidently not a direct nervous mechanism, since it has been shown experimentally that the severance of the spinal cord in woman<sup>1</sup>and in other mammals<sup>2</sup>and of the nerves supplying the mammary glands<sup>3</sup>causes no untoward influence on the secretory activity of the glands.

The decisive process of aging in men appears to start from the adrenal cortex. It occurs at about the same age as the adrenopause in women. Regardless of whether changes in the quantity of cells in the regions of the adrenal cortex or a weakness of various enzymes are causal for aging, the changes of hormones have drastic effects.

Migrain dibagi menjadi dua subtipe, yaitu migrain tanpa aura dan migrain dengan aura. Prevalensi migrain meningkat pada perempuan setelah pubertas dan lebih dari 50% serangan terjadi saat menstruasi. Migrain dapat dipicu oleh berbagai faktor, seperti usia, jenis kelamin, faktor psikologis, dan yang terpenting faktor hormon pada siklus menstruasi, penggunaan kontrasepsi oral, kehamilan, maupun menopause. Akan tetapi, menstruasi menjadi faktor risiko yang signifikan dalam memicu terjadinya migrain tanpa aura. Siklus menstruasi terdiri dari tiga fase, yaitu fase folikular, ovulasi, dan fase luteal. Pada siklus menstruasi, terdapat teori penting yang dapat menjelaskan terjadinya migrain saat menstruasi, yaitu teori estrogen withdrawal yang dikembangkan oleh Somerville. Risiko migrain tanpa aura akan meningkat pada dua hari sebelum menstruasi hingga hari ketiga menstruasi. Hal ini berkaitan dengan terjadinya estrogen withdrawal atau penarikan atau penurunan besar hormon estrogen pada fase folikular awal dan fase luteal akhir. Dengan adanya estrogen withdrawal, akan terjadi penekanan sistem serotonergik dan pemulihan yang lambat dari sistem glutamatergik pada sistem saraf pusat. Hormon estrogen withdrawal pada siklus menstruasi yang memfasilitasi sistem neurotransmitter inilah yang berperan dalam memicu terjadinya migrain tanpa aura.

      "title": "Postpartum urinary retention",
      "abstract": "Postpartum urinary retention (PUR) is a common condition in obstetric units. It is also known as puerperal urinary retention (1) or insidious urinary retention after vaginal delivery (2). Despite its ubiquity, morbidity, and the distress brought on to postpartum women, PUR remains a poorly understood subject. Unlike urinary incontinence, female urinary retention in particular PUR, has not received much attention. Scientific publications on this subject are relatively sparse. In this review the scientific background, clinical significance, and management alternatives of PUR are discussed. There is currently no standardized definition of PUR. One common, symptom-based clinical definition of PUR is 'the absence of spontaneous micturition within 6 h of vaginal delivery. In the case of a cesarean section, it is defined as 'no spontaneous micturition within 6 h after the removal of an indwelling catheter (more than 24 h after delivery)' (1, 3). On the other hand, if one views PUR as a form of acute urinary retention, the following definitions could also be used. Stanton (4) described acute urinary retention as the 'sudden painful or painless inability to void over a 24-h period, requiring catheterization, which yields at least 50% of the cystometric capacity' (4). This definition requires the diagnosis to be made retrospectively and with the aid of cystometry. Shah and Dasgupta (5) advocated a simpler definition in order to ensure all clinicians refer to the same condition. They defined acute urinary retention as 'the sudden onset of the inability to void'. This may be either painful (where neurology is normal) or painless (where abnormal neurology is present). Another common clinical definition of urinary retention is significant post-void residual bladder volume (PVRBV), where PVRBV is defined as 'the volume of fluid remaining in the bladder immediately following the completion of micturition' (6). The presence of PVRBV implies that there is an imbalance between the forces of urine expulsion and the outflow resistance, or that there is failure or decrease in detrusor contractility (7). Accordingly, a significant PVRBV represents an abnormality of bladder function, and could be used as the definition of PUR. Various definitions for a significant PVRBV have been published by different authors and they include: 40 ml (8), 50 ml (5), 100 ml (9, 10), 150 ml (2, 11, 12), 200 ml (13-15), and 500 ml (16). However, these values appear arbitrary, as there was no reason offered. It seems that they are proposed mainly for the clinical management of urinary retention. The prevalence of PUR varies, reflecting the lack of a standardized definition (3). Using the symptom-based definition mentioned above, Kermans et al. (1) reported PUR in 17 (2.1%) out of 789 women with vaginal deliveries and in two (3.2%) out of 62 women delivered by a cesarean section (1). Burkhart et al. (17) studied 1000 postpartum women and performed bladder catheterization only when women complained of discomfort and the urge to void with inability to do so (17). Using these criteria, 4.9% of women in Burkhart et al.'s group had PUR (17). Recent publications on PUR continue to show a confusing picture (Table I). It shows that the prevalence of PUR ranges from 0.45% to 14.1%. A point of note is that all five studies used different diagnostic criteria for PUR. Without a standardized definition of PUR, it would be difficult to devise effective clinical management, and to compare results of similar studies. The pathophysiology of PUR is poorly understood and various mechanisms have been speculated in the past. Francis (20) reviewed obstetrics and midwifery textbooks of the first half of the twentieth century and found that PUR was variously attributed to the following conditions in the postpartum period: Nervousness, modesty and similar factors causing inhibition by the central nervous system. An unnatural posture. Lack of elasticity of the bladder. Injury, swelling and bruising of the vulva, urethra and bladder trigone. Reflex spasm of the external urethral sphincter from tears and incisions in the perineum. An unspecified temporary derangement of the neuromuscular mechanism of the bladder and urethra. Some of these speculations may be true but no evidence for them has been provided. However, recent advances in urodynamics and electrophysiology, and histochemical studies of detrusor muscle chemical receptors allow a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of PUR. There are two major areas of breakthrough that may help us to understand PUR: Hormones and contractile responses of the bladder. Injured bladder innervation. There are a number of animal studies examining the effects of estrogens and pregnancy on bladder contractile function. It is established that the bladder is a hormone-responsive organ, and its functions may be subjected to the fluctuations of hormones during pregnancy and in the postpartum period (21-26). In studies comparing age-matched virgin and pregnant rabbits there were no difference in maximal response of isolated bladder strips to field stimulation (26). However, the relative contributions of the cholinergic and purinergic components were altered substantially in the pregnant rabbits. The maximal response of the bladder to cholinergic stimulation was decreased by approximately 50%, and the maximal response to purinergic stimulation was increased by approximately 50%. Furthermore, the ability of isolated whole bladders from pregnant rabbits to empty in response to field stimulation, a function of cholinergic stimulation, was decreased significantly (22). The decreased response of the bladders from pregnant rabbits to cholinergic stimulation was associated with a significant decrease in muscarinic cholinergic receptor density (24). Another observation from these studies was that pregnancy resulted in a significant decrease in the response of isolated strips of bladder base and urethra to alpha-adrenergic stimulation (24). A decrease in the muscarinic responsiveness of the bladder body would be consistent with an increase in urine retention, which is associated clinically with pregnancy. Lesions in the nervous system produce specific types of bladder emptying problems according to the level of the damage. Urinary retention occurs when the neurological lesions occur below the spinal reflex arc, at or below the level of the outlet of the sacral nerves which render the bladder acontractile or hypotonic (5). A number of studies have shown that the pudendal nerve, with afferent nerve branches (S2–4) supplying the bladder, is damaged during pelvic surgery and vaginal delivery (27-32). Afferent nerves innervating the lower urinary tract are those passing in the pelvic nerve to the sacral spinal cord (S2–4). These afferent nerves are small-diameter fibres that are linked with tension receptors in the bladder wall. Afferent pathways from striated muscle sphincters and from the urethra, which transmit sensations of warm, cold pain, and passage of urine, travel in the pudendal nerve to the sacral spinal cord (S2–4) (33). Urinary retention after vaginal delivery may be the result of injury to the pelvic, hypogastric, and pudendal nerves. The typical pelvic plexus injury is usually thought to produce the classic picture of acontractile bladder (34). However, the nature of the neurological lesion and its consequences may be variable owing to the complex interaction of partial or complete injuries to the parasympathetic, sympathetic, and somatic nervous systems (35). Typically, parasympathetic nerve injury produces a hypocontractile or acontractile bladder with decreased sensation. Sympathetic nerve injury can result in a bladder with decreased compliance and high storage pressure due to beta-adrenergic denervation. With recent advances in electrophysiological investigations, the damaging effects of vaginal delivery to the pudendal nerve have been shown in a number of studies. Sultan et al. (30) recruited 128 women prospectively from 34 weeks' gestation until 6 to 8 weeks after vaginal delivery, and studied their pudendal nerve terminal motor latencies (PNTML) and the degree of perineum descent (30). They demonstrated that vaginal delivery, particularly in the first pregnancy, was associated with significant pelvic floor tissue stretching and pudendal nerve damage. Similar results were presented by Tetzschner et al. (31) who studied 17 nulliparous women who had had a normal vaginal delivery and were found to have PNTML increased significantly to a mean of 2.64 milliseconds in the first few days after delivery (31). The PNTML then slowly decreased over a 3-month period back to the normal mean value of 1.95 milliseconds. It was concluded from their study that the pudendal nerve was impaired immediately after a normal vaginal delivery, but recovers over a 3-month period. In a subsequent study, Tetzschner et al. (31) demonstrated that pudendal nerve damage was a result of the labor process and vaginal delivery, and was not related to any antepartum events (32). They studied the PNTML of 28 women at 14, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Their results showed that PNTML did not increase significantly during pregnancy but increased significantly after delivery. In a larger-scale study Lee and Park (28) studied the serial PNTML of 80 women (40 nulliparas and 40 multiparas) 3 months before vaginal delivery, 3 days after delivery, and 2 months after delivery (28). They found that there was no difference between nulliparas and multiparas before delivery. On the other hand, 3 days after delivery, regardless of parity, the PNTML was prolonged. Two months after delivery, the PNTML returned to pre-delivery levels. Similar to Tetzschner et al. (31, 32) they also concluded that pudendal nerve damage occurred during vaginal delivery but recovered several months after delivery. The results of this study suggest that the pudendal nerve damage sustained during vaginal delivery is a transient event and is unlikely to give rise to long-term pudendal dysfunction thus chronic urinary retention. In a study to evaluate the relationship between obstetric risk factors and PUR, Kermans et al. (1) studied 789 women who delivered by the vaginal route, and 62 women delivered by a cesarean section, they found that nulliparity and cesarean delivery for lack of progress in the first stage were significantly more frequent among women with PUR (1). However, the robustness of this study could be questioned as the diagnosis was based on an initial clinical screening by the nursing staff, and catheterization was performed if retention was suspected. Women with retention who were asymptomatic therefore might not be detected. Andolf et al. (2) studied 539 consecutive women using ultrasound to measure their PVRBV on post-vaginal delivery day three. Using a diagnostic criterion of PVRBV >150 ml for PUR, they found that forceps delivery and vacuum extraction were associated with a higher prevalence of urinary retention. They also found that parity was a risk factor, with more nulliparas than multiparas manifested PUR. However, no difference was seen in birth weight between women with and without retention. Yip et al. (12) did a similar ultrasound study on 691 women, using the diagnostic criterion of PVRBV ≥150 ml, and they demonstrated a significant relationship between urinary retention on post-vaginal delivery day one and the following obstetric risk factors: prolonged first and second stages of labor (12). Although it seems that vaginal delivery is the strongest risk factor for PUR, Kerr-Wilson et al. (36) held an opposite view and did not think that the current management of labor predisposed women to bladder hypotonia and PUR (36). In a study of 20 postpartum women (10 nulliparas and 10 multiparas), using cystometry and uroflowmetry to assess the effects of labor on the postpartum bladder, they found that the mean urodynamic measurements were within normal limits, although there was a statistically significant positive correlation in nulliparas between duration of labor and residual urine, and between duration of labor and detrusor pressure rise in bladder filling in multiparas. They contrasted their results with that of Bennetts and Judd (37), who found the bladder to be hypotonic postpartum, and argued that active management of labor with oxytocin, and more frequent use of a cesarean section in modern obstetric practice, effectively shortened the labor duration, which in turn may lead to a reduction in the risk of subsequent bladder hypotonia. Currently the studies available on the relationship between epidural analgesia and PUR have shown contradictory results. Early reports demonstrated a positive relationship between the use of epidural analgesia and PUR. In a cystometric study on the effect of lumbar epidural analgesia on the lower urinary tract in a group of 27 nulliparous women with a vaginal delivery, Weil et al. (38) demonstrated that women who received epidural analgesia had a higher prevalence of hypotonic bladders than women without epidural analgesia. Kermans et al. (1) showed that the use of lumbar epidural analgesia, amongst other obstetric factors, was significantly more frequent among women with PUR. However, when epidural analgesia was combined with other obstetric factors (birth weight >4000 g, nulliparity, difficult vacuum extraction, and delayed second stage of labor) in a multivariate analysis, they showed no statistical difference between those with and without PUR (1). Andolf et al. (2) also demonstrated in their ultrasound prevalence study the use of epidural analgesia during labor was more frequent in women with PUR. Recent studies on the relationship between epidural analgesia and PUR showed a weaker relationship. Weissman et al. (39) studied 68 women who had received epidural analgesia during labor and delivery. These women had an ultrasound estimation of their PVRBV at a mean of 42 h after vaginal delivery, and none of the women were diagnosed as having urinary retention. When these women were compared with a group of controls, there was no significant difference between the groups in the average amounts of PVRBV. Batra et al. (40) performed cystometry on 20 women before and after epidural analgesia, and found no significant change in the detrusor pressure at maximal cystometric capacity, in vesical compliance, maximum flow rate, and in the mean flow rate. Furthermore, none of the 20 women developed urinary retention after the epidural analgesia. The decrease in prevalence of PUR after epidural analgesia may be due to a better understanding of the effects of anesthetic drugs on the peripheral and central neurogenic mechanisms controlling the micturition reflex, which subsequently leads to a more judicious use of drugs during epidural analgesia. The use of a new generation of anesthetic drugs may have also contributed to the reduction in prevalence of urinary retention in women receiving an epidural analgesia. The role of a cesarean section in PUR is difficult to discern. After a cesarean section, women sometimes have a transurethral indwelling catheter inserted for the first 24 h post-operatively, and the effects of the operation and anesthesia complicate postpartum bladder changes in these women. Post-operative immobility, wound pain, and lack of privacy might further add to the risk of urinary retention (41). The use of morphine in epidural anesthesia has been shown to give rise to urinary retention, which complicates the post-cesarean scenario (42, 43). When the use of epidural anesthesia was controlled in a multivariate analysis, women with a cesarean section did not have an increased prevalence of urinary retention (1). It is not always easy to make a clinical diagnosis of PUR. Diagnosis is especially difficult to make if the woman presents with asymptomatic PUR. When PUR is suspected, a diagnosis can only be made after ancillary procedures such as catheterization or imaging techniques such as ultrasound have been performed. The diagnosis of urinary retention relies on an accurate estimation of the PVRBV (44). According to the International Continence Society, PVRBV can be estimated by the following methods (6): Palpation. Catheter or cystoscope: (i) transurethral, (ii) suprapubic. Radiography: (i) intravenous urography, (ii) micturition cystography. Ultrasound. Radioisotopes: (i) clearance, (ii) gamma camera. These methods vary in accuracy, ease of use, comfort, costs, and complications. Catheterization, cystoscopy, radiography, and radioisotopes are either invasive, carry risks of radiation, or require special instrumentation; and the accuracy achieved is not necessary for most clinical situations. The clinically preferred methods used to estimate the PVRBV are palpation, catheterization, and ultrasound. Abdominal palpation for the distended bladder is the simplest and least invasive of all the diagnostic methods. Bimanual palpation may detect a residual volume of 200 ml or more, while single-hand palpation of the lower abdomen may detect a bladder with 300 ml or more (4). However, George (45) suggested bladders containing less than 300 ml are not readily detected by palpation alone; therefore palpation should be regarded as too insensitive as a method to diagnose PUR. Catheterization can be used both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Suprapubic catheterization is seldom used to diagnose urinary retention because of its invasiveness. Transurethral catheterization is a common way to drain the bladder and with it the PVRBV can be measured easily. The use of transurethral catheterization to diagnose PUR is not without risks, which include: pain, hematuria, and urinary tract infection (UTI). Catheter-associated UTI is a major and common problem (46). Kass and Schneiderman (47) showed that bacteria may gain entry to the urinary tract around the catheter and, despite many changes in catheter management, it still remains an important source of infection (48, 49). Ultrasound estimations of bladder volume have been used in prevalence studies of PUR because they are non-invasive, and readily available in most modern obstetric units (2, 12, 15). However, there is no consensus on the volume that should be used as diagnostic criterion for PUR. The puerperal uterus may affect the accuracy of ultrasound estimation of the PVRBV, because it may alter the bladder shape, rendering ultrasound estimate formulae inaccurate. In a validation study by Yip et al. (50) it has been shown that the bladder maintains its ellipsoid shape, and ultrasound estimation of the PVRBV in the postpartum period is accurate, and it can be used as a guide to whether transurethral catheterization is necessary. It is a common practice in the post-natal ward to try basic and non-invasive measures first to relieve urinary retention. In patients with post-operative urinary retention after general surgical operations, Stallard and Prescott (51) reported that 57% of patients who expressed difficulty in urinating in the presence of an urge to void were able to void successfully after 'helping measures' by nursing staff. These measures included the administration of oral analgesia, helping the patient to stand and walk, providing privacy, assisting the patient into a warm bath, and the immersion of the woman's hands into a basin of cold water (14). They present little risk to the postpartum women and represent reasonable options prior to other management modalities. Different pharmacological treatments for urinary retention have been advocated but few have been shown to be of much use. In early studies, pharmacological agents with anti-cholinesterase property such as distigmine bromide, neostigmine, and physostigmine were shown to improve detrusor function and used with success in the treatment of post-operative urinary retention (52). However, later studies could not reproduce similar results and these drugs were in fact shown to be associated with an increase in the prevalence of urinary retention (51, 53). In a randomized controlled study, Savona-Ventura et al. (53) studied three drugs used to prevent urinary retention after vaginal surgery: distigmine bromide, phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride, and prostaglandin F2 alpha, and found that all three drugs significantly increased the residual urine volume when compared with the control (53). Stallard and Prescott (51) also found that the use of neostigmine in general surgical patients significantly increased the incidence of post-operative urinary retention. Therefore, anti-cholinesterases are seldom used for the treatment of urinary retention. Cholinomimetic agents such as bethanechol chloride and carbachol have long been recommended for the treatment of post-operative urinary retention or PUR (54). However, studies in which cholinomimetic agents were used to treat urinary retention have failed to demonstrate significant efficacy (55, 56). Barrett (55) compared oral bethanechol chloride with a placebo in a randomized, double-blind study and did not demonstrate a significant short-term effect in women with chronic urinary retention. No differences were seen in voided volume, residual volume, percentage residual volume, mean flow rate and intravesical pressure at 100 ml volume and at maximal capacity when the treatment groups were compared with the group receiving the placebo. Other pharmacological agents for urinary retention including alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs and diazepam are less well studied. Alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs such as phenoxy- benzamine, prazosin, and phentolamine are effective for functional outlet obstruction. Tammela (57) reported 30% and 40%, respectively, fewer cases of post-operative urinary retention in patients who received a 3-day course of phenoxybenzamine compared with those who took carbachol and placebo (57). Stanton et al. (58) found diazepam given as night sedation was useful for initiating voiding after suprapubic incontinence surgery. Prostaglandin F2 alpha demonstrates specificity for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and can stimulate detrusor contractions (59). Tammela et al. (60) studied the effects of intravesical prostaglandin F2 alpha in a double-blind placebo-controlled study, and found that it enhanced bladder motor function and stimulated detrusor contraction post-operatively with no serious side-effects (60). Jaschevatzky et al. (61) also demonstrated in their placebo-controlled study that intravesical prostaglandin F2 alpha reduced urinary retention significantly after a vaginal hysterectomy. However, contradictory results have been published which showed that prostaglandin F2 alpha increased the prevalence of urinary retention after vaginal surgery (53). None of the pharmacological agents have been studied systematically in postpartum women, and their use in breast-feeding mothers is problematic because of potential effects in the infant (3). However, some of these pharmacological agents may be considered for selected, non-breast- feeding mothers with urinary retention. Catheterization of the bladder is the commonest treatment for urinary retention and effectively evacuates urine from the bladder and eliminates the risk of acute renal failure or bladder rupture (62). Although PUR is defined as the absence of spontaneous micturition within 6 h of a vaginal delivery, this is not a criterion for catheterization. The decision for catheterization is empiric and depends on the woman's symptoms and physical examination. If a postpartum woman despite the conservative treatments for urinary retention, complains of urinary frequency, urgency, strangury, or urge incontinence, or if physical examination reveals a visible abdominal mass, and percussion of the suprapubic areas reveals a distended bladder (62), then a transurethral indwelling catheter such as the Foley catheter is usually inserted. For postpartum women, a 12 or at most 14 Charriere (Ch) Foley catheter is usually used for short-term treatment (46). Suprapubic catheterization may become necessary if PUR becomes chronic, or failure to void after several attempts to remove the Foley catheter (63). The insertion of a suprapubic catheter, although more invasive than Foley catheterization, has been shown to appreciably reduce patient discomfort, nursing time, and urinary tract infection (64). If catheterization is necessary, the volume of urine drained initially may predict the need for repeat catheterization. Burkhart et al. (17) found that none of the 10 postpartum patients with a urine volume of 699 ml or less required repeat catheterization, but it was necessary for two out of 14 patients with 700–999 ml of residual urine and five out of 25 patients with more than 1000 ml of residual urine. Some authors recommended that transurethral catheterization be repeated every 4 h in patients who require an initial postpartum catheterization until spontaneous voiding occurs (3). There are little data to indicate whether repeated bladder catheterization is preferred to the insertion of an indwelling catheter in patients who are persistently unable to void for more than 24 h. Some obstetric units adopt a very vigorous management protocol for the detection of PUR, including early catheterization of the bladder to relieve the retention (3, 36). Some even advocate the use of early suprapubic catheterization to hasten bladder recovery (63). Catheterization is not without risk to patients. When women are catheterized for longer than 24 h in the postpartum period, approximately 40% will develop bacteriuria (65, 66). The incidence of urinary tract infection increases in women who require multiple catheterizations or who have an indwelling catheter inserted. The likelihood of urinary tract infection can be substantially decreased by prophylactic antibiotics therapy. Although the woman who requires only one catheterization may not need prophylactic antibiotics, microscopic examinations of urine and urine culture might be considered in these women to detect early signs of infection (3). Harris (66) has shown in his study on the role of antibiotics in PUR that prophylactic antibiotics at the time of catheterization effectively reduce the prevalence of urinary tract infection (66). Therefore, he suggested any woman who needs to be catheterized at any time in the postpartum period should receive a course of prophylactic antibiotics. Suitable prophylactic antibiotics include: nitrofurantoin, ampicillin,and trimethoprim-sulfamethoazole (3, 66). However, trimethoprim-sulfamethoazole is contraindicated in breast-feeding mothers, but ampicillin and nitrofurantoin can be safely used, and they should be given throughout the period of catheterization and for 48 h after catheter removal (3). Recently there are reports on the treatment of PUR by acupuncture (67-69). Acupuncture is an ancient healing system developed over centuries as part of the traditional medicine of China, Japan, and other Far Eastern countries. It postulates that the stimulation of specific areas on the skin affects the functioning of certain organs of the body. Moxibustion, the warming of acupuncture points through the use of smoldering herbs, is often used as a supplement and the needles may also be stimulated using a small electric current (70). The potential value of acupuncture has been shown in the management of female urinary dysfunctions, such as detrusor instability and nocturnal enuresis (71). In 1985, Yang published the first report on using acupuncture to treat PUR (69). He treated 49 women with urinary retention after vaginal delivery by inserting needles to the acupuncture points Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and Zusanli (St 36). Among the 49 women, 19 had spontaneous voiding after one session, 23 responded after two sessions, five after three sessions and two after four. He claimed that all 49 women were completely cured after an average of 1.9 sessions. Similar results were reported by Huang (67) in a study of 20 patients (7 men, 13 women) with urinary retention. In this study a combination of acupuncture with moxibustion were employed, with needling of multiple acupuncture points Qugu (Ren 2), Zhongji (Ren 3), Guanyuan (Ren 4), Mingmen (Du 4), Zusanli (St 36), Shenshu (UB 23), and Sanyinjiao (Sp 6). Among the 20 patients, seven were cured with one session, two with four sessions, and nine with three to seven sessions. Li et al. (68) managed 103 women with PUR by needling only one acupuncture point. They inserted the needle into the Huiyang point (UB 35) and 88 (85.4%) of the women were reported to be 'cured', and 14 (13.6%) claimed 'markedly effective', with only one (1%) woman who reported 'no effect'. All three research groups did not report any untoward effects of acupuncture or moxibustion. Despite the positive findings in these reports, further scientific evidence on the efficacy of acupuncture is necessary. The three reported studies are uncontrolled. The rationale of selecting the acupuncture points was not explained. The effects of single acupuncture point therapy versus multiple-point therapy need to be explored and explained. The placebo effects of acupuncture may affect the outcome. Furthermore, the outcome measurement of these studies was only the patients' subjective report of symptomatic improvement, and there was no objective assessment of outcome such as the change in the PVRBV. Surgery has been shown to be effective in treating specific types of female urinary retention but there is no report of its use in the treatment of PUR. Because PUR is likely to be a functional disorder secondary to hormonal or neuromuscular dysfunctions instead of urethral obstruction, surgical treatments such as urethral dilatation and recalibration (72), or urethrotomy with incision of the urethral epithelium and mucosa using an Otis urethrotome are not advocated (4). Habituation treatment, a form of behavioral therapy using conditioning procedures and intermittent reinforcement at variable intervals, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic urinary retention (73). Habituation requires the patients to record the time from the moment of trying to micturate to the moment of starting the urinary stream. If the patient fails to urinate within a given time interval then she is instructed to leave the toilet for a period of at least 2 min before trying again (73). However, this modality of treatment has not been demonstrated in postpartum women. Pelvic floor exercises and biofeedback are commonly used to treat women with urinary incontinence (74), but there is limited information on using these treatments for urinary retention. Breuer et al. (75) reported the successful management of a case of urinary retention due to pseudo-neurogenic bladder, using a combination of physical therapy, biofeedback, and medications (phenoxybenzamine and baclofen). Postpartum urinary retention is a distressing condition, particularly when the patient is catheterized. There are very few studies on the sequelae of PUR but some published data suggest that this condition returns to normal within a short period after delivery, and specific treatment is not always necessary. Studies by Andolf et al. (2), Yip et al. (12), and Lee et al. (15) suggested PUR is a self-limiting phenomenon, and all their patients with PUR returned to normal within 2 to 6 days of diagnosis and no specific treatment such as catheterization or pharmacological therapy was necessary. Jeffery et al. (63) reported a series of three cases of PUR with short-term sequelae. All three women were nulliparas and had undergone epidural analgesia during labor (63). Two required forceps deliveries and all were unable to void after delivery. Each patient was referred to their unit when repeated catheterization had failed to improve the PUR. The duration of retention before referral was 10, 11, and 28 days. Suprapubic catheterization was performed at their unit and was kept for 7, 13, and 21 days, respectively, and all three patients returned to normal with successful removal of the suprapubic catheter. Groutz et al. (76) reported a similar series of four cases of PUR. Two required transurethral indwelling catheterization and they returned to normal on postpartum days 7 and 15, respectively. Two required suprapubic catheterization and they returned to normal on postpartum days 28 and 40, respectively. Although the relatively short female urethra and urinary stasis are documented risk factors for urinary tract infection in PUR (77, 78), none of the five studies on the short-term sequelae of PUR specifically reported urinary tract infection as a characteristic feature of PUR (1, 2, 12, 15, 63). Indeed urinary tract infection was only reported to be associated with transurethral catheterization but not with PUR per se (65, 66). There are even fewer published data on the long-term sequelae of PUR. Versi and Barnick (79) reported six women with a history of PUR. Two women had permanent voiding difficulties, two required self-catheterization 6 months after delivery and two had altered bladder sensation although they were voiding normally. There are two reports on the follow-up of women with a history of PUR. Andolf et al. (2) followed up 10 out of the 12 women who had been diagnosed to have PUR in their ultrasound study (2). At follow-up 4 years later, they reported the prevalence of stress incontinence was not higher than that in the general population, and they concluded that ultrasonography 'does not seem to have any place in the normal postpartal care.' However, the number of women on follow-up in Andolf et al.'s (2) study is too small therefore no firm conclusion could be drawn for the relationship between postpartum retention and other urinary dysfunctions. In a case-controlled study by Yip et al. (50), they followed a cohort of women 4 years after their initial diagnosis of PUR (50). They found that women with PUR did not have a higher prevalence of urinary stress incontinence and fecal incontinence. However, the presence of long-term voiding difficulties was not assessed in this study. There are reasons to suggest PUR could lead to problems in later life. Khullar and Cardozo (80) have pointed out that the bladder could accumulate as much as one litre of urine in PUR, which stretches the bladder wall and would result in detrusor damage and long-term complications. Indeed, recent studies using rodent models have shown that stretching of the bladder smooth muscle could induce stress responses such as increased bladder cyclooxygenase-2 expression (81), or increase rates of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis and stimulates transcription of the gene for heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, an ErB1/EGF ligand that has been linked to hypertrophic bladder growth (82). How these observations in abnormal biochemical changes can be translated to long-term bladder dysfunctions are still unknown, although Park et al. (81) suggest these changes may participate in bladder smooth muscle cell proliferation and thereby play a role in pathological bladder wall thickening after urinary retention (81). Postpartum urinary retention is a common condition, which is associated with the labor process, but their relationships have not been fully evaluated. By identification of obstetric risk factors, urinary retention may be prevented in at risk women, and timely preventive measures or treatment given to the woman at risk.",

      "title": "Postpartum urinary retention",
      "abstract": "Postpartum urinary retention (PUR) is a common condition in obstetric units. It is also known as puerperal urinary retention (1) or insidious urinary retention after vaginal delivery (2). Despite its ubiquity, morbidity, and the distress brought on to postpartum women, PUR remains a poorly understood subject. Unlike urinary incontinence, female urinary retention in particular PUR, has not received much attention. Scientific publications on this subject are relatively sparse. In this review the scientific background, clinical significance, and management alternatives of PUR are discussed. There is currently no standardized definition of PUR. One common, symptom-based clinical definition of PUR is 'the absence of spontaneous micturition within 6 h of vaginal delivery. In the case of a cesarean section, it is defined as 'no spontaneous micturition within 6 h after the removal of an indwelling catheter (more than 24 h after delivery)' (1,3). On the other hand, if one views PUR as a form of acute urinary retention, the following definitions could also be used. Stanton (4) described acute urinary retention as the 'sudden painful or painless inability to void over a 24-h period, requiring catheterization, which yields at least 50% of the cystometric capacity' (4). This definition requires the diagnosis to be made retrospectively and with the aid of cystometry. Shah and Dasgupta (5) advocated a simpler definition in order to ensure all clinicians refer to the same condition. They defined acute urinary retention as 'the sudden onset of the inability to void'. This may be either painful (where neurology is normal) or painless (where abnormal neurology is present). Another common clinical definition of urinary retention is significant post-void residual bladder volume (PVRBV), where PVRBV is defined as 'the volume of fluid remaining in the bladder immediately following the completion of micturition' (6). The presence of PVRBV implies that there is an imbalance between the forces of urine expulsion and the outflow resistance, or that there is failure or decrease in detrusor contractility (7). Accordingly, a significant PVRBV represents an abnormality of bladder function, and could be used as the definition of PUR. Various definitions for a significant PVRBV have been published by different authors and they include: 40 ml (8), 50 ml (5), 100 ml (9,10), 150 ml (2,11,12), 200 ml (13–15), and 500 ml (16). However, these values appear arbitrary, as there was no reason offered. It seems that they are proposed mainly for the clinical management of urinary retention. The prevalence of PUR varies, reflecting the lack of a standardized definition (3). Using the symptom-based definition mentioned above, Kermans et al. (1) reported PUR in 17 (2.1%) out of 789 women with vaginal deliveries and in two (3.2%) out of 62 women delivered by a cesarean section (1). Burkhart et al. (17) studied 1000 postpartum women and performed bladder catheterization only when women complained of discomfort and the urge to void with inability to do so (17). Using these criteria, 4.9% of women in Burkhart et al.'s group had PUR (17). Recent publications on PUR continue to show a confusing picture (Table I). It shows that the prevalence of PUR ranges from 0.45% to 14.1%. A point of note is that all five studies used different diagnostic criteria for PUR. Without a standardized definition of PUR, it would be difficult to devise effective clinical management, and to compare results of similar studies. The pathophysiology of PUR is poorly understood and various mechanisms have been speculated in the past. Francis (20) reviewed obstetrics and midwifery textbooks of the first half of the twentieth century and found that PUR was variously attributed to the following conditions in the postpartum period: Nervousness, modesty and similar factors causing inhibition by the central nervous system. An unnatural posture. Lack of elasticity of the bladder. Injury, swelling and bruising of the vulva, urethra and bladder trigone. Reflex spasm of the external urethral sphincter from tears and incisions in the perineum. An unspecified temporary derangement of the neuromuscular mechanism of the bladder and urethra. Some of these speculations may be true but no evidence for them has been provided. However, recent advances in urodynamics and electrophysiology, and histochemical studies of detrusor muscle chemical receptors allow a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of PUR. There are two major areas of breakthrough that may help us to understand PUR: Hormones and contractile responses of the bladder. Injured bladder innervation. There are a number of animal studies examining the effects of estrogens and pregnancy on bladder contractile function. It is established that the bladder is a hormone-responsive organ, and its functions may be subjected to the fluctuations of hormones during pregnancy and in the postpartum period (21–26). In studies comparing age-matched virgin and pregnant rabbits there were no difference in maximal response of isolated bladder strips to field stimulation (26). However, the relative contributions of the cholinergic and purinergic components were altered substantially in the pregnant rabbits. The maximal response of the bladder to cholinergic stimulation was decreased by approximately 50%, and the maximal response to purinergic stimulation was increased by approximately 50%. Furthermore, the ability of isolated whole bladders from pregnant rabbits to empty in response to field stimulation, a function of cholinergic stimulation, was decreased significantly (22). The decreased response of the bladders from pregnant rabbits to cholinergic stimulation was associated with a significant decrease in muscarinic cholinergic receptor density (24). Another observation from these studies was that pregnancy resulted in a significant decrease in the response of isolated strips of bladder base and urethra to alpha-adrenergic stimulation (24). A decrease in the muscarinic responsiveness of the bladder body would be consistent with an increase in urine retention, which is associated clinically with pregnancy. Lesions in the nervous system produce specific types of bladder emptying problems according to the level of the damage. Urinary retention occurs when the neurological lesions occur below the spinal reflex arc, at or below the level of the outlet of the sacral nerves which render the bladder acontractile or hypotonic (5). A number of studies have shown that the pudendal nerve, with afferent nerve branches (S2–4) supplying the bladder, is damaged during pelvic surgery and vaginal delivery (27–32). Afferent nerves innervating the lower urinary tract are those passing in the pelvic nerve to the sacral spinal cord (S2–4). These afferent nerves are small-diameter fibres that are linked with tension receptors in the bladder wall. Afferent pathways from striated muscle sphincters and from the urethra, which transmit sensations of warm, cold pain, and passage of urine, travel in the pudendal nerve to the sacral spinal cord (S2–4) (33). Urinary retention after vaginal delivery may be the result of injury to the pelvic, hypogastric, and pudendal nerves. The typical pelvic plexus injury is usually thought to produce the classic picture of acontractile bladder (34). However, the nature of the neurological lesion and its consequences may be variable owing to the complex interaction of partial or complete injuries to the parasympathetic, sympathetic, and somatic nervous systems (35). Typically, parasympathetic nerve injury produces a hypocontractile or acontractile bladder with decreased sensation. Sympathetic nerve injury can result in a bladder with decreased compliance and high storage pressure due to beta-adrenergic denervation. With recent advances in electrophysiological investigations, the damaging effects of vaginal delivery to the pudendal nerve have been shown in a number of studies. Sultan et al. (30) recruited 128 women prospectively from 34 weeks' gestation until 6 to 8 weeks after vaginal delivery, and studied their pudendal nerve terminal motor latencies (PNTML) and the degree of perineum descent (30). They demonstrated that vaginal delivery, particularly in the first pregnancy, was associated with significant pelvic floor tissue stretching and pudendal nerve damage. Similar results were presented by Tetzschner et al. (31) who studied 17 nulliparous women who had had a normal vaginal delivery and were found to have PNTML increased significantly to a mean of 2.64 milliseconds in the first few days after delivery (31). The PNTML then slowly decreased over a 3-month period back to the normal mean value of 1.95 milliseconds. It was concluded from their study that the pudendal nerve was impaired immediately after a normal vaginal delivery, but recovers over a 3-month period. In a subsequent study, Tetzschner et al. (31) demonstrated that pudendal nerve damage was a result of the labor process and vaginal delivery, and was not related to any antepartum events (32). They studied the PNTML of 28 women at 14, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Their results showed that PNTML did not increase significantly during pregnancy but increased significantly after delivery. In a larger-scale study Lee and Park (28) studied the serial PNTML of 80 women (40 nulliparas and 40 multiparas) 3 months before vaginal delivery, 3 days after delivery, and 2 months after delivery (28). They found that there was no difference between nulliparas and multiparas before delivery. On the other hand, 3 days after delivery, regardless of parity, the PNTML was prolonged. Two months after delivery, the PNTML returned to pre-delivery levels. Similar to Tetzschner et al. (31,32) they also concluded that pudendal nerve damage occurred during vaginal delivery but recovered several months after delivery. The results of this study suggest that the pudendal nerve damage sustained during vaginal delivery is a transient event and is unlikely to give rise to long-term pudendal dysfunction thus chronic urinary retention. In a study to evaluate the relationship between obstetric risk factors and PUR, Kermans et al. (1) studied 789 women who delivered by the vaginal route, and 62 women delivered by a cesarean section, they found that nulliparity and cesarean delivery for lack of progress in the first stage were significantly more frequent among women with PUR (1). However, the robustness of this study could be questioned as the diagnosis was based on an initial clinical screening by the nursing staff, and catheterization was performed if retention was suspected. Women with retention who were asymptomatic therefore might not be detected. Andolf et al. (2) studied 539 consecutive women using ultrasound to measure their PVRBV on post-vaginal delivery day three. Using a diagnostic criterion of PVRBV >150 ml for PUR, they found that forceps delivery and vacuum extraction were associated with a higher prevalence of urinary retention. They also found that parity was a risk factor, with more nulliparas than multiparas manifested PUR. However, no difference was seen in birth weight between women with and without retention. Yip et al. (12) did a similar ultrasound study on 691 women, using the diagnostic criterion of PVRBV ≥150 ml, and they demonstrated a significant relationship between urinary retention on post-vaginal delivery day one and the following obstetric risk factors: prolonged first and second stages of labor (12). Although it seems that vaginal delivery is the strongest risk factor for PUR, Kerr-Wilson et al. (36) held an opposite view and did not think that the current management of labor predisposed women to bladder hypotonia and PUR (36). In a study of 20 postpartum women (10 nulliparas and 10 multiparas), using cystometry and uroflowmetry to assess the effects of labor on the postpartum bladder, they found that the mean urodynamic measurements were within normal limits, although there was a statistically significant positive correlation in nulliparas between duration of labor and residual urine, and between duration of labor and detrusor pressure rise in bladder filling in multiparas. They contrasted their results with that of Bennetts and Judd (37), who found the bladder to be hypotonic postpartum, and argued that active management of labor with oxytocin, and more frequent use of a cesarean section in modern obstetric practice, effectively shortened the labor duration, which in turn may lead to a reduction in the risk of subsequent bladder hypotonia. Currently the studies available on the relationship between epidural analgesia and PUR have shown contradictory results. Early reports demonstrated a positive relationship between the use of epidural analgesia and PUR. In a cystometric study on the effect of lumbar epidural analgesia on the lower urinary tract in a group of 27 nulliparous women with a vaginal delivery, Weil et al. (38) demonstrated that women who received epidural analgesia had a higher prevalence of hypotonic bladders than women without epidural analgesia. Kermans et al. (1) showed that the use of lumbar epidural analgesia, amongst other obstetric factors, was significantly more frequent among women with PUR. However, when epidural analgesia was combined with other obstetric factors (birth weight >4000 g, nulliparity, difficult vacuum extraction, and delayed second stage of labor) in a multivariate analysis, they showed no statistical difference between those with and without PUR (1). Andolf et al. (2) also demonstrated in their ultrasound prevalence study the use of epidural analgesia during labor was more frequent in women with PUR. Recent studies on the relationship between epidural analgesia and PUR showed a weaker relationship. Weissman et al. (39) studied 68 women who had received epidural analgesia during labor and delivery. These women had an ultrasound estimation of their PVRBV at a mean of 42 h after vaginal delivery, and none of the women were diagnosed as having urinary retention. When these women were compared with a group of controls, there was no significant difference between the groups in the average amounts of PVRBV. Batra et al. (40) performed cystometry on 20 women before and after epidural analgesia, and found no significant change in the detrusor pressure at maximal cystometric capacity, in vesical compliance, maximum flow rate, and in the mean flow rate. Furthermore, none of the 20 women developed urinary retention after the epidural analgesia. The decrease in prevalence of PUR after epidural analgesia may be due to a better understanding of the effects of anesthetic drugs on the peripheral and central neurogenic mechanisms controlling the micturition reflex, which subsequently leads to a more judicious use of drugs during epidural analgesia. The use of a new generation of anesthetic drugs may have also contributed to the reduction in prevalence of urinary retention in women receiving an epidural analgesia. The role of a cesarean section in PUR is difficult to discern. After a cesarean section, women sometimes have a transurethral indwelling catheter inserted for the first 24 h post-operatively, and the effects of the operation and anesthesia complicate postpartum bladder changes in these women. Post-operative immobility, wound pain, and lack of privacy might further add to the risk of urinary retention (41). The use of morphine in epidural anesthesia has been shown to give rise to urinary retention, which complicates the post-cesarean scenario (42,43). When the use of epidural anesthesia was controlled in a multivariate analysis, women with a cesarean section did not have an increased prevalence of urinary retention (1). It is not always easy to make a clinical diagnosis of PUR. Diagnosis is especially difficult to make if the woman presents with asymptomatic PUR. When PUR is suspected, a diagnosis can only be made after ancillary procedures such as catheterization or imaging techniques such as ultrasound have been performed. The diagnosis of urinary retention relies on an accurate estimation of the PVRBV (44). According to the International Continence Society, PVRBV can be estimated by the following methods (6): Palpation. Catheter or cystoscope: (i) transurethral, (ii) suprapubic. Radiography: (i) intravenous urography, (ii) micturition cystography. Ultrasound. Radioisotopes: (i) clearance, (ii) gamma camera. These methods vary in accuracy, ease of use, comfort, costs, and complications. Catheterization, cystoscopy, radiography, and radioisotopes are either invasive, carry risks of radiation, or require special instrumentation; and the accuracy achieved is not necessary for most clinical situations. The clinically preferred methods used to estimate the PVRBV are palpation, catheterization, and ultrasound. Abdominal palpation for the distended bladder is the simplest and least invasive of all the diagnostic methods. Bimanual palpation may detect a residual volume of 200 ml or more, while single-hand palpation of the lower abdomen may detect a bladder with 300 ml or more (4). However, George (45) suggested bladders containing less than 300 ml are not readily detected by palpation alone; therefore palpation should be regarded as too insensitive as a method to diagnose PUR. Catheterization can be used both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Suprapubic catheterization is seldom used to diagnose urinary retention because of its invasiveness. Transurethral catheterization is a common way to drain the bladder and with it the PVRBV can be measured easily. The use of transurethral catheterization to diagnose PUR is not without risks, which include: pain, hematuria, and urinary tract infection (UTI). Catheter-associated UTI is a major and common problem (46). Kass and Schneiderman (47) showed that bacteria may gain entry to the urinary tract around the catheter and, despite many changes in catheter management, it still remains an important source of infection (48,49). Ultrasound estimations of bladder volume have been used in prevalence studies of PUR because they are non-invasive, and readily available in most modern obstetric units (2,12,15). However, there is no consensus on the volume that should be used as diagnostic criterion for PUR. The puerperal uterus may affect the accuracy of ultrasound estimation of the PVRBV, because it may alter the bladder shape, rendering ultrasound estimate formulae inaccurate. In a validation study by Yip et al. (50) it has been shown that the bladder maintains its ellipsoid shape, and ultrasound estimation of the PVRBV in the postpartum period is accurate, and it can be used as a guide to whether transurethral catheterization is necessary. It is a common practice in the post-natal ward to try basic and non-invasive measures first to relieve urinary retention. In patients with post-operative urinary retention after general surgical operations, Stallard and Prescott (51) reported that 57% of patients who expressed difficulty in urinating in the presence of an urge to void were able to void successfully after 'helping measures' by nursing staff. These measures included the administration of oral analgesia, helping the patient to stand and walk, providing privacy, assisting the patient into a warm bath, and the immersion of the woman's hands into a basin of cold water (14). They present little risk to the postpartum women and represent reasonable options prior to other management modalities. Different pharmacological treatments for urinary retention have been advocated but few have been shown to be of much use. In early studies, pharmacological agents with anti-cholinesterase property such as distigmine bromide, neostigmine, and physostigmine were shown to improve detrusor function and used with success in the treatment of post-operative urinary retention (52). However, later studies could not reproduce similar results and these drugs were in fact shown to be associated with an increase in the prevalence of urinary retention (51,53). In a randomized controlled study, Savona-Ventura et al. (53) studied three drugs used to prevent urinary retention after vaginal surgery: distigmine bromide, phenoxybenzamine hydrochloride, and prostaglandin F2 alpha, and found that all three drugs significantly increased the residual urine volume when compared with the control (53). Stallard and Prescott (51) also found that the use of neostigmine in general surgical patients significantly increased the incidence of post-operative urinary retention. Therefore, anti-cholinesterases are seldom used for the treatment of urinary retention. Cholinomimetic agents such as bethanechol chloride and carbachol have long been recommended for the treatment of post-operative urinary retention or PUR (54). However, studies in which cholinomimetic agents were used to treat urinary retention have failed to demonstrate significant efficacy (55,56). Barrett (55) compared oral bethanechol chloride with a placebo in a randomized, double-blind study and did not demonstrate a significant short-term effect in women with chronic urinary retention. No differences were seen in voided volume, residual volume, percentage residual volume, mean flow rate and intravesical pressure at 100 ml volume and at maximal capacity when the treatment groups were compared with the group receiving the placebo. Other pharmacological agents for urinary retention including alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs and diazepam are less well studied. Alpha-adrenergic blocking drugs such as phenoxy- benzamine, prazosin, and phentolamine are effective for functional outlet obstruction. Tammela (57) reported 30% and 40%, respectively, fewer cases of post-operative urinary retention in patients who received a 3-day course of phenoxybenzamine compared with those who took carbachol and placebo (57). Stanton et al. (58) found diazepam given as night sedation was useful for initiating voiding after suprapubic incontinence surgery. Prostaglandin F2 alpha demonstrates specificity for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and can stimulate detrusor contractions (59). Tammela et al. (60) studied the effects of intravesical prostaglandin F2 alpha in a double-blind placebo-controlled study, and found that it enhanced bladder motor function and stimulated detrusor contraction post-operatively with no serious side-effects (60). Jaschevatzky et al. (61) also demonstrated in their placebo-controlled study that intravesical prostaglandin F2 alpha reduced urinary retention significantly after a vaginal hysterectomy. However, contradictory results have been published which showed that prostaglandin F2 alpha increased the prevalence of urinary retention after vaginal surgery (53). None of the pharmacological agents have been studied systematically in postpartum women, and their use in breast-feeding mothers is problematic because of potential effects in the infant (3). However, some of these pharmacological agents may be considered for selected, non-breast- feeding mothers with urinary retention. Catheterization of the bladder is the commonest treatment for urinary retention and effectively evacuates urine from the bladder and eliminates the risk of acute renal failure or bladder rupture (62). Although PUR is defined as the absence of spontaneous micturition within 6 h of a vaginal delivery, this is not a criterion for catheterization. The decision for catheterization is empiric and depends on the woman's symptoms and physical examination. If a postpartum woman despite the conservative treatments for urinary retention, complains of urinary frequency, urgency, strangury, or urge incontinence, or if physical examination reveals a visible abdominal mass, and percussion of the suprapubic areas reveals a distended bladder (62), then a transurethral indwelling catheter such as the Foley catheter is usually inserted. For postpartum women, a 12 or at most 14 Charriere (Ch) Foley catheter is usually used for short-term treatment (46). Suprapubic catheterization may become necessary if PUR becomes chronic, or failure to void after several attempts to remove the Foley catheter (63). The insertion of a suprapubic catheter, although more invasive than Foley catheterization, has been shown to appreciably reduce patient discomfort, nursing time, and urinary tract infection (64). If catheterization is necessary, the volume of urine drained initially may predict the need for repeat catheterization. Burkhart et al. (17) found that none of the 10 postpartum patients with a urine volume of 699 ml or less required repeat catheterization, but it was necessary for two out of 14 patients with 700–999 ml of residual urine and five out of 25 patients with more than 1000 ml of residual urine. Some authors recommended that transurethral catheterization be repeated every 4 h in patients who require an initial postpartum catheterization until spontaneous voiding occurs (3). There are little data to indicate whether repeated bladder catheterization is preferred to the insertion of an indwelling catheter in patients who are persistently unable to void for more than 24 h. Some obstetric units adopt a very vigorous management protocol for the detection of PUR, including early catheterization of the bladder to relieve the retention (3,36). Some even advocate the use of early suprapubic catheterization to hasten bladder recovery (63). Catheterization is not without risk to patients. When women are catheterized for longer than 24 h in the postpartum period, approximately 40% will develop bacteriuria (65,66). The incidence of urinary tract infection increases in women who require multiple catheterizations or who have an indwelling catheter inserted. The likelihood of urinary tract infection can be substantially decreased by prophylactic antibiotics therapy. Although the woman who requires only one catheterization may not need prophylactic antibiotics, microscopic examinations of urine and urine culture might be considered in these women to detect early signs of infection (3). Harris (66) has shown in his study on the role of antibiotics in PUR that prophylactic antibiotics at the time of catheterization effectively reduce the prevalence of urinary tract infection (66). Therefore, he suggested any woman who needs to be catheterized at any time in the postpartum period should receive a course of prophylactic antibiotics. Suitable prophylactic antibiotics include: nitrofurantoin, ampicillin,and trimethoprim-sulfamethoazole (3,66). However, trimethoprim-sulfamethoazole is contraindicated in breast-feeding mothers, but ampicillin and nitrofurantoin can be safely used, and they should be given throughout the period of catheterization and for 48 h after catheter removal (3). Recently there are reports on the treatment of PUR by acupuncture (67–69). Acupuncture is an ancient healing system developed over centuries as part of the traditional medicine of China, Japan, and other Far Eastern countries. It postulates that the stimulation of specific areas on the skin affects the functioning of certain organs of the body. Moxibustion, the warming of acupuncture points through the use of smoldering herbs, is often used as a supplement and the needles may also be stimulated using a small electric current (70). The potential value of acupuncture has been shown in the management of female urinary dysfunctions, such as detrusor instability and nocturnal enuresis (71). In 1985, Yang published the first report on using acupuncture to treat PUR (69). He treated 49 women with urinary retention after vaginal delivery by inserting needles to the acupuncture points Sanyinjiao (SP 6) and Zusanli (St 36). Among the 49 women, 19 had spontaneous voiding after one session, 23 responded after two sessions, five after three sessions and two after four. He claimed that all 49 women were completely cured after an average of 1.9 sessions. Similar results were reported by Huang (67) in a study of 20 patients (7 men, 13 women) with urinary retention. In this study a combination of acupuncture with moxibustion were employed, with needling of multiple acupuncture points Qugu (Ren 2), Zhongji (Ren 3), Guanyuan (Ren 4), Mingmen (Du 4), Zusanli (St 36), Shenshu (UB 23), and Sanyinjiao (Sp 6). Among the 20 patients, seven were cured with one session, two with four sessions, and nine with three to seven sessions. Li et al. (68) managed 103 women with PUR by needling only one acupuncture point. They inserted the needle into the Huiyang point (UB 35) and 88 (85.4%) of the women were reported to be 'cured', and 14 (13.6%) claimed 'markedly effective', with only one (1%) woman who reported 'no effect'. All three research groups did not report any untoward effects of acupuncture or moxibustion. Despite the positive findings in these reports, further scientific evidence on the efficacy of acupuncture is necessary. The three reported studies are uncontrolled. The rationale of selecting the acupuncture points was not explained. The effects of single acupuncture point therapy versus multiple-point therapy need to be explored and explained. The placebo effects of acupuncture may affect the outcome. Furthermore, the outcome measurement of these studies was only the patients' subjective report of symptomatic improvement, and there was no objective assessment of outcome such as the change in the PVRBV. Surgery has been shown to be effective in treating specific types of female urinary retention but there is no report of its use in the treatment of PUR. Because PUR is likely to be a functional disorder secondary to hormonal or neuromuscular dysfunctions instead of urethral obstruction, surgical treatments such as urethral dilatation and recalibration (72), or urethrotomy with incision of the urethral epithelium and mucosa using an Otis urethrotome are not advocated (4). Habituation treatment, a form of behavioral therapy using conditioning procedures and intermittent reinforcement at variable intervals, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic urinary retention (73). Habituation requires the patients to record the time from the moment of trying to micturate to the moment of starting the urinary stream. If the patient fails to urinate within a given time interval then she is instructed to leave the toilet for a period of at least 2 min before trying again (73). However, this modality of treatment has not been demonstrated in postpartum women. Pelvic floor exercises and biofeedback are commonly used to treat women with urinary incontinence (74), but there is limited information on using these treatments for urinary retention. Breuer et al. (75) reported the successful management of a case of urinary retention due to pseudo-neurogenic bladder, using a combination of physical therapy, biofeedback, and medications (phenoxybenzamine and baclofen). Postpartum urinary retention is a distressing condition, particularly when the patient is catheterized. There are very few studies on the sequelae of PUR but some published data suggest that this condition returns to normal within a short period after delivery, and specific treatment is not always necessary. Studies by Andolf et al. (2), Yip et al. (12), and Lee et al. (15) suggested PUR is a self-limiting phenomenon, and all their patients with PUR returned to normal within 2 to 6 days of diagnosis and no specific treatment such as catheterization or pharmacological therapy was necessary. Jeffery et al. (63) reported a series of three cases of PUR with short-term sequelae. All three women were nulliparas and had undergone epidural analgesia during labor (63). Two required forceps deliveries and all were unable to void after delivery. Each patient was referred to their unit when repeated catheterization had failed to improve the PUR. The duration of retention before referral was 10, 11, and 28 days. Suprapubic catheterization was performed at their unit and was kept for 7, 13, and 21 days, respectively, and all three patients returned to normal with successful removal of the suprapubic catheter. Groutz et al. (76) reported a similar series of four cases of PUR. Two required transurethral indwelling catheterization and they returned to normal on postpartum days 7 and 15, respectively. Two required suprapubic catheterization and they returned to normal on postpartum days 28 and 40, respectively. Although the relatively short female urethra and urinary stasis are documented risk factors for urinary tract infection in PUR (77,78), none of the five studies on the short-term sequelae of PUR specifically reported urinary tract infection as a characteristic feature of PUR (1,2,12,15,63). Indeed urinary tract infection was only reported to be associated with transurethral catheterization but not with PUR per se (65,66). There are even fewer published data on the long-term sequelae of PUR. Versi and Barnick (79) reported six women with a history of PUR. Two women had permanent voiding difficulties, two required self-catheterization 6 months after delivery and two had altered bladder sensation although they were voiding normally. There are two reports on the follow-up of women with a history of PUR. Andolf et al. (2) followed up 10 out of the 12 women who had been diagnosed to have PUR in their ultrasound study (2). At follow-up 4 years later, they reported the prevalence of stress incontinence was not higher than that in the general population, and they concluded that ultrasonography 'does not seem to have any place in the normal postpartal care.' However, the number of women on follow-up in Andolf et al.'s (2) study is too small therefore no firm conclusion could be drawn for the relationship between postpartum retention and other urinary dysfunctions. In a case-controlled study by Yip et al. (50), they followed a cohort of women 4 years after their initial diagnosis of PUR (50). They found that women with PUR did not have a higher prevalence of urinary stress incontinence and fecal incontinence. However, the presence of long-term voiding difficulties was not assessed in this study. There are reasons to suggest PUR could lead to problems in later life. Khullar and Cardozo (80) have pointed out that the bladder could accumulate as much as one litre of urine in PUR, which stretches the bladder wall and would result in detrusor damage and long-term complications. Indeed, recent studies using rodent models have shown that stretching of the bladder smooth muscle could induce stress responses such as increased bladder cyclooxygenase-2 expression (81), or increase rates of deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis and stimulates transcription of the gene for heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor, an ErB1/EGF ligand that has been linked to hypertrophic bladder growth (82). How these observations in abnormal biochemical changes can be translated to long-term bladder dysfunctions are still unknown, although Park et al. (81) suggest these changes may participate in bladder smooth muscle cell proliferation and thereby play a role in pathological bladder wall thickening after urinary retention (81). Postpartum urinary retention is a common condition, which is associated with the labor process, but their relationships have not been fully evaluated. By identification of obstetric risk factors, urinary retention may be prevented in at risk women, and timely preventive measures or treatment given to the woman at risk.",

      "title": "A paediatrician asks-why is it called birth injury?",
      "abstract": "Summary. It is irrational to ascribe a child's so called ‘brain damage’ to labour or delivery without considering other factors. ‘Brain damage’ occurs without difficult labour or perinatal hypoxia and caesarean section is no guarantee against it. Severe difficulties in delivery and severe hypoxia at birth are in the great majority not followed by evidence of ‘brain damage’. In the maternal history there is a significantly greater incidence of relative infertility, and of pregnancies associated with low birthweight or intrauterine growth retardation, postmaturity, antepartum haemorrhage, pre‐eclampsia or infections. There are often genetic factors, more congenital anomalies and pathological evidence of underlying abnormality. There is an interaction of numerous factors, prenatal, perinatal and postnatal and it is simplistic to ascribe ‘brain damage’ to single factors, such as breech delivery or hypoxia at birth, without considering the antecedent causes of those factors.",

      "abstract": "Early amnion rupture is a sporadic event that results in mechanical teratogenesis due to amniotic-band disruption and/or compression. It may cause abortion or stillbirth, craniofacial clefts, and cerebral, body wall and limb/skeletal defects. Prolonged and premature rupture of membranes and oligohydramnios result in the dry-lung syndrome and pulmonary hypoplasia. The risk of chorioamnionitis is also increased, with serious consequences to the fetus and neonate. Placental lesions are associated with fetal growth retardation, preterm birth, fetal malformations and other neonatal disorders (congenital infections, erythroblastosis, alpha thalassaemia). In particular, the impact of extremely preterm births on perinatal mortality rates and health costs is substantial. The 1-year survival rate of singleton infants born at the Monash Medical Centre was 10% at a gestation period of 23 weeks, 37% at 24 weeks, 42% at 25 weeks, 61% at 26 weeks and 78% at 27 weeks (11% at birthweights of 500-599 g, 30% at 600-699 g, 55% at 700-799 g and 71% at 800-899 g). Proven measures to minimize the neonatal consequences of extremely preterm delivery include in utero transfer of at-risk fetuses to a perinatal centre and antepartum corticosteroids. Research into the pathophysiological basis of placental and membrane dysfunction may help reduce the prematurity rate.",

      "abstract": "Normal voiding needs a coordinated, sustained bladder contraction of adequate size and duration. It requires a decrease in resistance of the bladder neck and urethra and no obstruction. Voiding problems can arise from abnormal storage of urine or problems with urinary control. The aim of this article was to review the functional anatomy and physiology of urinary control and micturition and the pathophysiology of urinary control problems. The Medline (PubMed) database, Cochrane Library, and Science Citation Index were searched electronically to identify original published studies on bladder anatomy, function and urinary control. References were searched from relevant chapters in specialized texts and all were included. Voiding problems are the most common presenting urological symptoms in general medical practice. Urinary incontinence occurs when the normal process of storing and passing urine is disrupted. A history of coexisting fecal incontinence suggests a neuropathic etiology. A better understanding of the physiology of urinary control could lead to preventive measures for postoperative urinary retention and incontinence such as fluid restriction and to appropriate anesthesia/analgesia, autonomic nerve preservation, total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer, and biofeedback exercises. It could also suggest appropriate therapeutic measures for established urinary incontinence. Clin. Anat., 2018. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

It is defined as menstrual pains, which sometimes, may be so severe, as to completely cripple the affected woman in every aspect of her daily function. Dysmenorrhea may further cause female infertility problems. This disease is divided into two forms: primary - where no accompanying pelvic pathology is found, and secondary - where pelvic pathology is demonstrated. The most prevalent cause of the latter form is endometriosis. Treatment comprises of medication, such as NSAIDs or various hormonal preparations or several methods of complementary medicine, as well as surgery. Generally, medical and complementary forms of treatment have been found effective in alleviating the pain, while surgery was found effective in treating infertility. Dysmenorrhea, in general, and endometriosis, in particular, has a further immense financial burden on society - both in terms of medical cost, as well as absence from studies or work by young women. To date, no absolute effective treatment, in terms of pain prevention or long standing fertility preservation, has been found.",

      "abstract": "As disfunções sexuais femininas são definidas como qualquer irregularidade relacionada ao desejo sexual, orgasmo, excitabilidade ou dor sexual. Estudos mostram que cerca de 49% das mulheres brasileiras são acometidas por algum tipo de disfunção sexual, o que prejudica as relações com seus parceiros e qualidade de vida. Dentre as disfunções sexuais tem-se a dispareunia (DP), caracterizada por algia genital associada a penetração, o vaginismo, ocasionada pela contração involuntária da musculatura interna da vagina, a vulvodinia, dor crônica relacionada a hipersensibilidade da região vulvar, e a vestibulodínia (VBD), versão mais comum da vulvodinia, quando há hipersensibilidade no vestíbulo vulvar. A conduta fisioterapêutica correta e baseada em evidências pode ser uma alternativa facilitadora do processo, diminuindo os danos causados nesse período. Objetivou-se avaliar as evidências científicas sobre a atuação da fisioterapia pélvica nas disfunções sexuais femininas, sendo consideradas publicações entre os anos de 2014 e 2024, nos idiomas português e inglês. O levantamento bibliográfico foi realizado nas bases MedLine, LILACS, PubMed e SciELO. Observou-se que a fisioterapia no tratamento das disfunções sexuais femininas melhora a dor gênito-pélvica, função sexual, força e consciência da musculatura do assoalho pélvico (MAP) através do uso da cinesioterapia, eletroterapia, biofeedback (BF) e terapias manuais. A terapia por ondas de choque extracorpóreas também mostrou bons resultados no tratamento da DP, porém mais estudos a respeito desse método ainda precisam ser realizados. Por fim, esse estudo contribui para o embasamento da prática clínica dos fisioterapeutas envolvidos com disfunções sexuais femininas (DSFs), assim como o direcionamento de pesquisas clínicas futuras.",

      "title": "WHAT IS THE HEALTH RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AMENORRHEA",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY ∑ Amenorrhea is one of the most common symptoms in the woman’s health pathology. It can be caused by anatomical defects of the outflow tract (uterus, cervix, vagina), thus being in the gynecologist’s domain, or can be observed in gonadal dysgenesis (Turner’s syndrome), hypopituitarism (Sheehan’s syndrome), prolactin-secreting pituitary tumors, Cushing’s syndrome, hyperthyroidism, stress, anorexia nervosa, polycystic ovaries, and in women upon discontinuation of oral contraceptives, especially if they have a history of prior menstrual irregularities. Endocrine abnormalities may also be due to changes in target tissue responses to hormones. These disorders can occur by a variety of mechanisms. Endocrine glands may be injured or destroyed by neoplasia, infections, hemorrhage, autoimmune disorders, and many other causes. Menopause, pregnancy and lactation are the most common causes of ammenorrhea. Hypothalamic lesions resulting in impaired secretion of releasing hormones may manifest themselves by pituitary dysfunction, which in turn leads to functional abnormalities of its various target organs. Extraglandular disorders can result in hormone deficiency and become manifest with amenorrhea as one of the symptoms. Assessment of the patient’s endocrine status relies on the findings from the history, physical examination and laboratory testing. The latter can include measurement of hormone levels of their metabolites in plasma or urine either in basal state or in response to provocative testing. For endocrine deficiency syndromes, hormones are generally administered to counteract the deficiency. In hormone excess syndromes, a variety of approaches have been used. Hyperfunctioning tumors are removed when possible, and sometimes hyperplastic glands are extirpated. In other cases, drugs are given to block hormone production. Menopause related osteoporosis is the leading health problem associated with amenorrhea and should be treated as early as possible, i.e. from the beginning of the period of menses disappearance.",

The pain is severe during the first and/or second day of bleeding &amp; usually lasts up to 72 hours. More than 55 to 80% of post-menarche women are thought to experience primary dysmenorrhea. Both vitamin E and a placebo may lessen dysmenorrhea-related pelvic pain, although vitamin E appears to do more significantly Objective: To find the role of vitamin E in the treatment of Primary dysmenorrhea Methodology: This randomized placebo-controlled trial was conducted at JankiDevi Jamiat Singh Maternity Hospital Lahore and Sir Syed Hospital Karachi from 1stJune 2021 to 31stMay 2022. Sample size 70 with age 16-28 years with unmarried women; regular menstrual cycles; no urogenital disorders; no previous history of abdominal or pelvic surgery. To check severity of pain we used Visual Analog Scale (VAS) &amp; Cox Menstrual Symptom Scale (CMSS) was used for grading the pain duration. Pain duration was categorized as follows: score 1: ≤0-0.5 hours of pain; score 2: 0.5-1 hours of pain; score 3:&gt;1 hour of pain; score 4: &gt;1 day of pain. Two groups were formed from the sample. Vitamin E 400 units/day in two divided doses was prescribed for the first group to begin the treatment course (5 days in a month,), and Placebo was given to the second. Data was entered and analyzed in SPSS. Result: Total 70 were enrolled. There were 35 women given Vitamin E and 35 were given placebo. In Group 1, the mean age was 21.57+ 3.35 and in Group 2, the mean age was 22.0+3.05.Before treatment, the mean of VAS pain score was 49.29 in Vitamin E group ad placebo group was 58.71mm and after treatment, the mean of Vas pain score was reduce to 34.60 in vitamin E group and placebo group was 44.48. A significant difference was found the severity of pain and duration between the pre- and post treatment in both groups. Table: 2,3 As the comparison indicates, no significant differences were found regarding severity of pain and duration between the groups. ( p &lt; 0.05). This study will help the practioners,gynecologist for in the treatement of primary dysmenorrheal further this will also open the doors for further researches in this field. Conclusion: Vitamin E helps to relieve pain in primary dysmenorrhea. It can be considered as a universal medicine in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea since it is a very simple way for pain control with fewer side effects and is cost-effective.

      "abstract": "Kernaussagen Schwangerschaft und Geburt bedeuten für den weiblichen Beckenboden eine Mehrbelastung sowie strukturelle und funktionelle Veränderungen. Die vaginale Geburt ist der wichtigste Risikofaktor für die Entstehung von Störungen der Beckenbodenfunktion wie Inkontinenz und Lageveränderungen der Genitalorgane. Eine Schnittentbindung kann das Auftreten von Symptomen einer Beckenbodenschwäche nicht verhindern, kann jedoch als Sekundärprävention im Falle einer erneuten Schwangerschaft diskutiert werden. Die gezielte Frage nach Symptomen einer Urininkontinenz, Stuhl- oder Windinkontinenz sowie eines Deszensusgefühls oder einer Dyspareunie im Rahmen der gynäkologischen Konsultation ist wichtig. Bei der Versorgung von Geburtsverletzungen sollte zum Ausschluss einer okkulten Sphinkterverletzung immer eine digitale rektale Untersuchung erfolgen. Eine Identifizierung und ggf. Rekonstruktion des internen Analsphinkters sollte bei ausgedehnten Verletzungen immer angestrebt werden. Allen Wöchnerinnen sollte die konsequente Durchführung einer Rückbildungsgymnastik empfohlen werden. Ein frühzeitiges Beckenbodentraining nach höhergradigen Dammverletzungen ist besonders wichtig. Bei Auftreten einer Urininkontinenz sollte eine gründliche urogynäkologische Diagnostik zur Identifizierung der Ursache und Form der Inkontinenz erfolgen, um eine adäquate Therapie gewährleisten zu können. Beim Auftreten einer Urininkontinenz oder Drangsymptomatik sollte immer eine Urindiagnostik zum Ausschluss einer Infektion oder Mikrohämaturie erfolgen. Die Sonografie ist der derzeitige Goldstandard in der morphologischen Diagnostik von Inkontinenz- und Beckenbodenfunktionsstörungen. Eine enge interdisziplinäre Zusammenarbeit mit den urologischen und proktologischen Kollegen wird empfohlen. Die Notwendigkeit einer psychosomatischen Mitbetreuung sollte geprüft werden. Die Ausschöpfung von konservativen Therapieoptionen vor Entscheidung zu einer chirurgischen Intervention sollte bei allen Symptomen einer postpartalen Beckenbodenschwäche erfolgen.",

      "abstract": "Sex differences in sleep begin at a very early age and women report poorer sleep quality and have higher risk for insomnia than do men. Sleep may be affected by variation in reproductive hormones, stress, depression, aging, life/role transitions, and other factors. The menstrual cycle is associated with changes in circadian rhythms and sleep architecture. Menstruating women (even without significant menstrual-related complaints) often report poorer sleep quality and greater sleep disturbance during the premenstrual week compared to other times of her menstrual cycle. In addition to these sleep disturbances, women with severe premenstrual syndrome often report more disturbing dreams, sleepiness, fatigue, decreased alertness and concentration during the premenstrual phase. Sleep disturbances are also commonly reported during pregnancy and increase in frequency and duration as the pregnancy progresses. The precipitous decline in hormones and unpredictable sleep patterns of the newborn contribute to and/or exacerbate poor sleep and daytime sleepiness during the early postpartum period. Insomnia is also among the most common health complaints that are reported by perimenopausal women. Women are particularly vulnerable to developing insomnia disorder during these times of reproductive hormonal change. In this review, we present a discussion on the most relevant and recent publications on sleep across the womanâs lifespan, including changes in sleep related to menstruation, pregnancy, postpartum, and the menopausal transition. Treatment for sleep disturbances and insomnia disorder and special considerations for treating women will also be discussed. Key words: Sleep, Insomnia, Women, Pregnancy, Menopause",

Se han descrito alteraciones de la eyaculacion en pacientes bajo tratamiento con inhibidores selectivos de la recaptacion de serotonina y antipsicoticos. Objetivo: Describir, a partir de una revision de la literatura, los aspectos clinicos de la eyaculacion retardada y los factores asociados. Metodos: Revision tematica de la bibliografia especializada que posee informacion vigente y relevante, sin importar el ano de su publicacion. La busqueda se realizo en las bases de datos PubMed, Google Academico y Medline. Se utilizaron descriptores en espanol e ingles. Resultados: Se analizaron aspectos anatomicos y fisiologicos de la eyaculacion, asi como etiologicos, clinicos y de tratamiento. Se hallaron factores que precipitan su aparicion, tales como: problemas en la relacion de pareja, trastornos de ansiedad, preocupacion por el desempeno sexual, depresion, control excesivo de la respuesta eyaculatoria, distraccion en cuanto a las sensaciones y habitos de masturbacion, dificilmente reproducibles durante el coito. Conclusiones: Se brindo una actualizacion acerca de la eyaculacion retardada, con enfasis en los factores psicologicos y organicos. Se destacaron como instrumentos fundamentales de exploracion la historia clinica exhaustiva con enfasis en la exploracion psicosexual, el examen neurologico y urologico; asi como la evaluacion de la relacion de pareja. Se considero transcendental en el tratamiento la educacion y la orientacion sexual, el empleo de tecnicas especializadas como las fantasias eroticas y la desensibilizacion progresiva.",

The causes of secondary amenorrhea probably lie in the hypothalamus and/or the ovaries.The time lapse between cessation of oral contraception and conception is between 5.8 and 6.5 months. No increase in abortion has been noted, but abortuses and ova have an increased polyploid tendency and incidence of chromosome breaks. Further investigations of larger series are necessary to provide definite proof. Meanwhile it would seem advisable that after cessation of hormonal contraception there should be a time lapse of six to eight months before a patient becomes pregnant.",

The baby is otherwise well, formula fed, and is thriving with no other symptoms.\n\nInvoluntary passage of a baby’s stomach contents back up the oesophagus is a common, normal physiological event. The infant might or might not regurgitate or vomit shortly after feeding, several times a day.1 This is known as gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR), and can be associated with feed refusal, crying, and back arching.2 As the lower oesophageal sphincter has not yet matured, milk refluxes through the opening into the oesophagus, causing discomfort for the infant (fig 1). GOR resolves without investigation or treatment.\n\n\n\nFig 1  Mechanism of gastro-oesophageal reflux\n\n\n\nConsider gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) if symptoms of regurgitation interfere with the baby’s quality of life or cause complications, such as poor weight gain, difficulty in sleeping, and recurrent chest infections1.1\n\nIt can be difficult to distinguish between colic—excessive, frequent crying in a well baby—and GOR, GORD, or “fussy eating” because of the overlap of symptoms and the lack of useful investigations.

In this article, the authors review and summarize current literature associating pelvic floor disorders with vaginal childbirth. Stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse are strongly associated with vaginal childbirth and parity. The exact mechanism of injury associating vaginal delivery with pelvic floor disorders is not known, but is likely multifactorial, potentially including mechanical and neurovascular injury to the pelvic floor. Observational studies have identified certain obstetrical exposures as risk factors for pelvic floor disorders. These factors often coexist in clusters; hence, the isolated effect of these variables on the pelvic floor is difficult to study.",

      "abstract": "Endometriosis causes pelvic pain and infertility. Infertility results from effects of endometriosis exerted in the pelvic cavity, in the ovaries and/or on the uterus. Medical treatment effective on pain and at preventing disease recurrence following surgery is of no use for improving the chances of conceiving naturally. Surgery however improves the chances of conceiving in the 12-18 months afterward. Endometriosis through extension of the disease to the ovaries may harm ovarian response to COS needed in ART. Surgery for endometrioma(s) may further reduce ovarian responses to COS in case of endometriosis. Remarkably however, reduced ovarian responses due to endometriosis are not necessarily associated with reduced oocyte quality and ART outcome. Pre-ART treatment with oral contraceptives (OC) improves ART outcome in case of ovarian endometriosis particularly, if endometriomas are present at the time of oocyte retrieval. This measure requires however that a proper OC-FSH/hMG interval is respected and that \"LH\" effects are provided during the ovarian stimulation, using either hMG or small doses of hCG. These latter precautions prevent the adverse outcome reported in case of pre-ART use of OC when ovarian stimulation is conducted using r-FSH exclusively.",

      "title": "Progestogens versus oestrogens and progestogens for irregular uterine bleeding associated with anovulation",
      "abstract": "Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is excessively heavy, prolonged or frequent bleeding of uterine origin which is not due to pregnancy or to recognisable pelvic or systemic disease. Anovulation may be inferred from a number of observations but, in the normal clinical situation, anovulation is often assumed when a woman presents with heavy, prolonged or frequent bleeding, particularly in those who are at the extremes of reproductive life and in women known to have polycystic ovarian syndrome. Menstrual bleeding that is irregular or excessive is poorly tolerated by the majority of women. Changes in the length of the menstrual cycle generally imply disturbances of the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis. In anovulatory DUB with acyclic (irregular) oestrogen production there will be no progesterone withdrawal from oestrogen primed endometrium and so cycles are irregular. Prolonged oestrogen stimulation may cause a build up of endometrium with erratic bleeding as it breaks down and is expelled. This is the rationale for using cyclical progestogens during the second half of the menstrual cycle, in order to provoke a regular withdrawal bleed. Continuous progestogen is intended to induce endometrial atrophy and hence to prevent oestrogen-stimulated endometrial proliferation. Progestogens, and oestrogens and progestogens in combination are already widely used in the management of irregular or excessive bleeding due to DUB but the regime, dose and type of progestogen used varies widely, with little consensus about the optimum treatment approach.To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of progestogens alone and oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the management of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation.We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (searched 4 May 2007), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to May 2007), EMBASE (1985 to May 2007), CINAHL (1982 to May 2007), Biological Abstracts (1969 to May 2007), Current Contents (1980 to 2007) and reference lists of articles.All randomised controlled trials of progestogens (via any route) alone or in combination with oestrogens in the treatment of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation.Study quality assessment and data extraction were carried out independently by two review authors. Both authors were experts in the content matter.No randomised trials were identified which compared progestogens with oestrogens and progestogens or with placebo in the management of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. Only one small, non-randomised study compared two progestogen regimes in the management of heavy and irregular bleeding in women with confirmed anovulation. One randomised study compared the effects of two progestogens on endometrial histology in women with a variety of menstrual symptoms, half of whom had cystic glandular hyperplasia.There is a paucity of randomised studies relating to the use of progestogens and of oestrogens and progestogens in combination in the treatment of irregular bleeding associated with anovulation. Further research is needed to establish the role of these treatments in the management of this common gynaecological problem.",

Twenty-one of the patients were satisfied with the results, although the objective success of the operation did not always correlate with subjective relief of symptoms. The commonest apparent cause for failure was the coincidence of urgency with stress incontinence, and the few true failures, due to secondary relaxation of the paraurethral supports, were often mitigated by compensatory learning on the part of the patients, many of whom remain blissfully unaware of the underlying weakness. The retropubic urethrovesical suspension operation is simple, effective, and free of complications. It is indicated as a primary procedure whenever a vaginal operation has failed to cure (or, worse, has caused) stress incontinence. It is advised as a complementary procedure for women with a secondary complaint of stress incontinence who must undergo laparotomy for other cause.",

      "abstract": "A conservative estimate is that approximately 5% of pregnancies are affected by de novo headache, that is, new-onset or new-type headache.(1) Summarize the available literature, which is exclusively neurological, regarding de novo headache during the third trimester of pregnancy and puerperium; and (2) review the common pathologies of pregnancy and puerperium that may be relevant to de novo headache, with focus on the first and second trimester. We obtained the literature through a search of PubMed and references of the retrieved publications, without time limit.Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and idiopathic intracranial hypertension occur at the same rate during pregnancy and puerperium as otherwise, but symptomatic intracranial hypertension due to dural venous-sinus thrombosis is increased during the third trimester and puerperium. Stroke occurrence, whether arterial or venous, does not seem increased during pregnancy and puerperium but when stroke does occur, it is mostly during the third trimester and puerperium. Immediate postpartum headache is commonly either tension-type headache or migraine; when due to spinal-fluid hypovolemia, apart from epidural or spinal anesthesia, a labor-related dural tear should be considered. Of the medical conditions associated with pregnancy, hypothyroidism, anemia, and hypertension may have to be considered as possible causes of de novo headache.De novo headache during pregnancy is relatively common and almost always leads to neurological referral.",

      "title": "[Prevention of abortion].",
      "abstract": "Psychologists and marriage counselors conducting preabortion interviews in a French clinic note that women have emotions concerning abortion apart from the reasons they give for choosing to end their pregnancies. Their experience demonstrates that a pregnancy never occurs by chance, but always at a given moment of existence. An abortion becomes an event in the significant and particular history of each woman undergoing one. Particular circumstances of unemployment, illness, or other adversity become linked in the woman's later recollections of the abortion. Abortions often signify psychic problems of separation or loss, as demonstrated by the considerable number of immigrant women who undergo abortions after having been obliged to leave their native lands, or those who undergo abortions after the death of a child. Women choosing abortion experience anguish and guilt. Fantasies of the aborted child represent the period of mourning that must be surmounted. The psychic labor of the grief process allows a progressive detachment to be achieved. The belief that expanded knowledge and use of contraception would lead to a significant decline in abortion has been belied by experience; the number of abortions has been stable over the years despite ever increasing use of contraceptives of all types. The objective of contraception, a harmonious sexual relationship in which pregnancy does not occur, is itself complex. Choices related to a more or less distant future are made by individuals who are to a greater or lesser extent engaged in the relationship using more or less inconvenient techniques. Statements made by couples themselves perfectly reflect the paradoxes. Objections and resistances to contraceptive use are also prompted by societal norms of sex and reproduction. The couple are influenced in their abortion decision by their own level of maturity and by their family backgrounds.",

      "title": "Acute maternal collapse in pregnancy with ruptured rudimentary horn of unicornuate uterus: A case report",
      "abstract": "Unicornuate uterus with rudimentary horn occurs due to failure of complete development of one of the Mullerian ducts and incomplete fusion with the contralateral side. It is associated with numerous obstetrics and gynecological problems such as Infertility, Endometriosis, Miscarriages, Malpresentations & Intrauterine growth restriction. Pregnancy in the non-communicating rudimentary horn is extremely rare and usually terminates in rupture during first or second trimester of pregnancy. Pregnancy occurs via transperitoneal migration of sperm or zygote. Variable thickness of rudimentary horn musculature, poor distensibility of myometrium lead to rupture. This complication is usually seen in 2nd trimester resulting in shock and haemoperitoneum. Diagnosis of rudimentary horn pregnancy is difficult and can be missed in ultrasound. It requires a high risk of suspicion. Materials and Methods: We report the case of 24yr primi gravida with 26 weeks of gestation presented with pain abdomen and sudden maternal collapse on arrival, suspected to be intra-abdominal pregnancy in ultrasound and on laparotomy found ruptured rudimentary horn of unicornuate uterus with fetus found intra-abdominally with massive hemoperitoneum. Conclusion: Pregnancies in rudimentary horn of unicornuate uterus are prone to intra uterine growth restriction and rupture in second trimester so a high index of suspicion is required to save this catastrophic event and associated maternal morbidity and mortality. In our opinion, routine excision of rudimentary horn should be undertaken during non-pregnant state laparoscopically. However, those women who refuse should be adequately counseled regarding potential complications and if pregnancy occurs in rudimentary horn, first trimester laparoscopic excision should be done.",

      "abstract": "Depending on age it has been estimated that up to 40% of women have complaints of sexual problems, including decreased libido, vaginal dryness, pain with intercourse, decreased genital sensation and difficulty or inability to achieve orgasm. In this review we address the etiologies and incidence, evaluation and treatment of female sexual dysfunction following vaginal surgery for indications such as stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse; anterior/posterior colporrhaphy, perineoplasty and vaginal vault prolapse.Literature on the mechanisms by which vaginal surgery affects female sexual function are discussed along with related pathophysiology to potential causes. The anatomy, neurovascular supply of the clitoris and introitus, and intrapelvic nerve supply are discussed as related to vaginal surgery. Techniques to avoid neurovascular damage during pelvic floor surgery were corroborated by supporting literature. Literature regarding female sexual dysfunction following other procedures, such as vaginal hysterectomy, Martius flap interposition, and vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistula repair were also discussed.Current literature does not support an association between vaginal length following vaginal surgery and sexual function. The proportion of women who are sexually active does not appear to be affected by vaginal surgery. Sling surgery for urinary incontinence does not appear to adversely affect overall sexual function, although individual parameters of sexual function scores may vary, eg a significant percent of women report pain during intercourse. Some patients experience improved overall sexual function due to complete relief from coital incontinenceSymptomatic vaginal narrowing is rare even in women undergoing simultaneous posterior repair. Overall sexual satisfaction appears to be independent of therapy for urinary incontinence or prolapse. Data indicate that defect specific posterior colporrhaphy with the avoidance of levator ani plication may improve sexual function. The possible etiological factors for sexual dysfunction following vaginal surgery deserve further investigations.",

A substantial proportion of women whose lumps prove to be benign remain distressed and may become clinically anxious or depressed, particularly if they suffer from chronic breast pain. Up to 30% of women with breast cancer develop an anxiety state or depressive illness within a year of diagnosis, which is three to four times the expected rate in matched community samples. After mastectomy 20-30% of patients develop persisting problems with body image and sexual difficulties. Breast conserving surgery reduces problems with body image, but this is offset by increased fears of recurrence. Consequently, the type of surgery does not affect psychiatric morbidity. Immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy may reduce this morbidity provided that the possible complications have been discussed fully and understood, that the patient wants it for herself and not because of pressure from others, and that it is carried out expertly. Psychiatric morbidity further increases when radiotherapy or chemotherapy is used. ### Problems of recognition #### Reasons for non-disclosure of psychological morbidity Few patients mention psychological morbidity because they do not think that it is acceptable to do so. Doctors can promote disclosure of such problems by asking questions and clarifying the responses about patients' perceptions of the nature of their illness and their reactions to it and about their experience of losing a breast or having radiotherapy or chemotherapy. By being empathic, making educated guesses about how a patient is feeling, and summarising what has been disclosed, doctors promote both disclosure and expression of related feelings. #### Disclosure by patients ##### Inhibited by",

      "abstract": "Reimers et al. describe changes in pelvic organ support during pregnancy and at 1 year postpartum in a cohort of 300 nulliparous women. The findings are reassuring, with an overall low prevalence of prolapse (<10%) and demonstrable changes that largely recover by 1 year. Significant findings from this longitudinal study are the cranial shift of the middle compartment from mid- to late pregnancy and the shortening of the perineal body and genital hiatus from 6 weeks to 6 months postpartum. The shift of the cervix during pregnancy (cranial) and postpartum (caudal) represents the largest change in pelvic support regardless of mode of delivery. This study emphasises the mechanical forces taking place within the pelvic floor, and hypothesises how these dynamics may increase a woman's risk for the development of subsequent pelvic floor disorders. Stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse are often associated with parity and, more specifically, vaginal childbirth; however, the mechanism of injury has not been completely elucidated and likely involves direct injury to pelvic floor muscles, connective tissue and neurovascular structures. Many healthcare providers focus on the immediate complications of childbirth and mode of delivery, such as maternal mortality, infection, anaesthetic complications, thromboembolic diseases, haemorrhage, hysterectomy and depression, but perhaps more attention should be paid to delayed maternal complications, such as subsequent uterine rupture and placental implantation abnormalities, which have significant neonatal implications; as well as urinary and fecal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, sexual dysfunction, and pelvic pain. The latter pelvic floor conditions may take decades to develop as other lifestyle factors such as increasing body mass index and smoking further contribute to the development of these disorders. Very few studies have evaluated long-term effects of pregnancy on pelvic floor disorders. The Norwegian EPINCONT study found that parity was associated with stress and mixed urinary incontinence, and that first delivery had the most significant impact (Rortveit G et al. Obstet Gynecol 2001;98: 1004–10). Similarly, Evers et al. reported a significant association between obstetric anal sphincter lacerations and anal incontinence, and its negative impact on quality of life 5–10 years after childbirth, compared with women who either delivered vaginally without anal sphincter laceration or delivered via caesarean section (Evers EC et al. Am J Obstet Gynecol 2012;207:425.e1–425 46). Robust longitudinal studies such as these two often cited publications provide valuable information on consequences of parity, sphincter laceration and mode of delivery. Reimers et al. are encouraged to continue the longitudinal evaluation on objective changes in pelvic support in this cohort of women and should incorporate subjective measures such as bother and impact on quality of life using validated tools. Long-term data on outcomes that matter to patients will provide the most valuable information for future practice and guideline development. None declared.

Achieving abandonment of FGM is an international priority, which requires multi-sectoral actions, including engagement of the health sector to provide high quality care to women and girls affected by FGM while also taking actions to promote prevention. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a harmful practice associated with a range of health complications. Achieving abandonment of FGM is an international priority, which requires multi-sectoral actions, including engagement of the health sector to provide high quality care to women and girls affected by FGM while also taking actions to promote prevention. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a traditional harmful practice that involves the partial or total removal of external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The practice has been classified into four types with Type I consisting of partial or total removal of the clitoral glans and/or the prepuce/clitoral hood. Type II is the partial or total removal of the clitoral glans and the labia minora, with or without removal of the labia majora. Type III, also known as infibulation, is the narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and repositioning the labia minora, or labia majora, sometimes through stitching, with or without removal of the clitoral glans and prepuce. Type IV includes all other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, e.g., pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterizing the genital area. There are no health benefits to FGM, but rather it increases risk of health problems affecting women's physical, psychological, and sexual health both immediately following the practice and over the life course. Immediate complications include hemorrhage, pain, shock, genital swelling, infection, problems with urination and wound healing, and in some cases, death.1Berg R.C. Underland V. Odgaard-Jensen J.

The absolute number of women and girls affected is expected to increase as large cohorts of young girls in countries with a high prevalence of FGM reach the age at which the practice occurs (https://www.unfpa.org/resources/bending-curve-fgm-trends-we-aim-change). Some evidence suggests that FGM prevalence is likely to increase in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because girls may not have access to the protective services, prevention messages, and care networks that usually offer a degree of protection from the practice, which is illegal in most settings (https://www.unfpa.org/news/millions-more-cases-violence-child-marriage-female-genital-mutilation-unintended-pregnancies). In addition, families may be under more intense pressure from traditional practitioners and extended family members to have their daughters undergo FGM. The practice is widely believed to have originated during Pharaonic times and has been perpetuated and justified for a range of reasons, including to ensure virginity, to limit promiscuity, to promote fidelity, to ensure marriageability, to serve as a rite of passage into womanhood, for aesthetic reasons, to ensure family honor, and to conform to ideals of womanhood. Once the practice has become deeply entrenched as a social norm within communities (https://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/iwp_2009_06.pdf),6Mackie G. LeJeune J. Social Dynamics of Abandonment of Harmful Practices: A New Look at the Theory.in: Special Series on Social Norms and Harmful Practices. Innocenti Working Paper No. 2009-06.

This can serve as a strong incentive for families to continue the practice.7Edberg M. Krieger L. Recontextualizing the social norms construct as applied to health promotion.SSM Popul. Health. 2020; 10: 100560https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2020.100560Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar There is also a concerning trend of health workers performing FGM in some settings, which is known as \"FGM medicalization\" and includes acts of FGM by a health worker, either within a health care setting or in a private setting. Existing evidence from 17 countries with repeat surveys suggests an increasing trend in medicalization of FGM in Egypt, Guinea, Mauritania, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Chad, and Yemen (https://www.unfpa.org/resources/brief-medicalization-female-genital-mutilation). This trend is alarming because it goes against the \"do no harm\" medical ethics principle by which health care workers abide, and it counters FGM abandonment efforts by further endorsing this harmful practice and also creating a false sense of safety from its health complications. A review of the literature showed that there are four main reasons why health care providers perform FGM—they are members of practicing communities and subject to the same social norms and may therefore be supportive of the practice; they are satisfying a demand, which may seem inevitable, and they see themselves as supplying a service to families; many claim that they are reducing harm by performing FGM because they can do it in a safer way; and many report carrying out the practice for financial reasons to supplement income or to receive in kind payments from community members.8Doucet M.H. Pallitto C. Groleau D. Understanding the motivations of health-care providers in performing female genital mutilation: an integrative review of the literature.Reprod. Health. 2017; 14: 46https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-017-0306-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar Regardless of the justifications mentioned by the health care providers, by performing FGM, they are further perpetuating a harmful practice and violating the rights of girls. FGM violates a number of human rights principles, including the rights of the child, the right to be free from cruel or inhumane treatment, the right to bodily integrity, the right to be free from discrimination, and the right to health due to the well-documented risk of health consequences associated with the practice. These health complications also have cost implications. A recent health economic analysis showed that treatment of the health complications of FGM costs health systems 1.4 billion USD per year (www.srhr.org/fgmcost) a number that is expected to increase unless urgent action is taken. In addition to these quantifiable costs, there are likewise less quantifiable costs to the psycho-social well-being of women and girls (S. O'Neill and C.C.P., unpublished data). A recent review of qualitative literature demonstrated that FGM status can affect the ways that women interact with family, community members, and society more generally, both within high prevalence and diaspora communities. When a woman's FGM status deviates from the social norms in which she lives, she is more likely to experience stigma, social isolation, and psychologically abusive behaviors, which can adversely affect health and health seeking behavior as well as lead to relationship difficulties. Despite these financial and psychosocial costs and the health risks suffered, the health sector has not played an active role in preventing FGM or ensuring quality care to manage its health complications, even in settings where the majority of women and girls undergo this practice. There are a number of reasons for the limited attention of the health sector in addressing FGM. The competing priorities and limited human and financial resources in many countries mean that public health systems prioritize the most urgent, visible, and high burden health problems, such as pandemics and other health emergencies, which require timely and integrated responses. In addition, the health sector is often not considered an active player in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals related to harmful practices such as FGM (SDG 5.3), and investment from governments and the international community has traditionally targeted other sectors. It is well recognized that multi-sectoral efforts are needed to bring an end to this harmful practice, although there is insufficient evidence on what interventions or combination of interventions will drive the lasting change needed to achieve abandonment. Enacting laws and creating enabling environments (https://www.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/Policy_Brief-_Enabling_Environments_for_Eliminating_Female_Genital_Mutilation.pdf) for their implementation are critical but insufficient steps. Laws without community acceptance may inadvertently drive the practice underground, discourage disclosure, and prevent women and girls from seeking necessary health services for fear of being reported.9Muthumbi J.

Likewise, working through the education sector to provide information and to inform girls of their rights,12Abathun A.D. Sundby J. Gele A.A.

The health sector has been less present in abandonment efforts to date despite the fact that most women come through the health system on numerous occasions, particularly during reproductive years, and health care providers tend to be trusted and well-respected members of the community who have the potential to influence behaviors in positive ways. The health sector is increasingly serving a health promotion and prevention role in addition to a curative role. Emphasis on quality of care through person-centered service delivery and application of rights-based approaches has shown that health workers can promote health not just to ensure the absence of disease but also to achieve \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being\" as articulated in the World Health Organization (WHO)'s constitution. Promoting well-being includes preventing harmful practices that violate human rights and cause ill health. Indeed, the health sector in low- and middle-income countries has a history of community outreach and a large network of service outlets and providers of different cadres serving communities. This includes involving community members or leaders in community health committees to promote behavior change in a wide range of health topics, including violence prevention, immunization, breastfeeding, and HIV prevention. As respected members of their communities who are also familiar with and subject to the same social norms, pressures, and beliefs, they are well placed to engage with their patients and clients in preventing FGM through one-on-one counseling during clinical visits or home visits or in groups during health education sessions and community health outreach activities. It is important to frame conceptually where the health system sits within the larger social system and its interaction with the community and other sectors. Macro-level factors such as socio-economic, political, legal, and developmental factors (i.e., literacy and secondary education levels of women, total fertility rates, GDP and percentage of GDP spent on health, maternal mortality rates, gender equality, and other health-related indicators) can directly or indirectly affect the continuation or abandonment of FGM as a community norm. Further, the political stance and commitment of government officials or other influential actors to end this practice as well as the presence of criminalizing laws and availability of financial or human resources will affect the scale and effectiveness of interventions to end this practice. These macro-level factors affect all sectors including the health sector and specifically the health system building blocks (https://www.who.int/healthinfo/systems/WHO_MBHSS_2010_full_web.pdf), which include the health work force, service delivery, health information systems, access to essential medicines, financing, leadership, and governance. These factors determine the quality and coverage of health sector interventions on FGM prevention and care that directly impact the health service user at facility or community level. It is also critical that the health sector addresses FGM through a public-health approach grounded in gender equality and human rights with the aim of offering the highest quality of prevention and care services possible for women and girls at risk as well as those who have undergone FGM. One important aspect of this is the need for the health sector to play a more active and direct role in ending FGM medicalization by working closely with its workforce and indirectly through reducing the demand from health service users. In 2010, WHO and partners released the Global Strategy to Stop Health Care Providers from Performing FGM (https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/fgm/rhr_10_9/en/), which is a four-prong strategy that provides countries with a framework to structure health sector plans to address FGM, including through strengthening governance and political will, improving training of health care providers to provide prevention and care services, enacting regulatory and accountability mechanisms for professional codes of conduct, and monitoring and evaluating programs and actions to document impact within the health sector. Responses need to be implemented in a sustained and systematic manner using evidence-based interventions and programmatic data to contribute meaningfully to increasing the quality of life for FGM survivors as well as reducing FGM incidence. Ministries of health and related stakeholders need to engage actively to develop strategic health sector plans that address FGM. These plans need to be informed by contextual factors specific to each setting, including the epidemiology of the practice, the specific drivers as well as the health system profile and readiness to address it. These plans include activities ranging from integration of FGM into pre-service and in-service training of health care providers to improving management of complications and communicating for FGM prevention; establishing accountability measures for providers who carry out FGM, such as loss of licenses or fines; developing health policies against FGM practice; generating data through health information systems; ensuring that all providers have a sufficient level of awareness and training to be able to communicate effectively about FGM prevention and to manage complications; and ensuring that FGM is included in essential service packages for sexual, reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child, and adolescent health (SRMNCAH) strategies, plans, and service packages. FGM should also be integrated within health emergency-response packages. Emergencies often lead to or aggravate gender inequality and can put women and girls at higher risk of FGM. Women and girls may be viewed as a \"burden\" with no ability to provide income for their families. Protecting virginity becomes closely linked with values like family honor and marriageability and fidelity. Insecure times can result in breakdown in social systems that cause families to assert traditions and can roll back advances in gender equality. These realities should be recognized and addressed from the outset of emergencies to prevent further health risk to women and girls. Priority seed funding should be invested into activities to catalyze the roll out in implementation. Seven priority countries specifically Burkina Faso, Guinea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, Somalia, and Tanzania to date have developed health sector plans with the support of WHO and are in different implementation phases in rolling out activities. Case studies and implementation research will inform scale up for other countries planning to actively engage the health sector to address FGM. It is also important that health sector planning makes use of the many evidence-based tools and resources that can be used to support a range of actors, including policy makers and program officers to front line health care providers to be able to address FGM. At an international level, a forthcoming online WHO resource kit aims to bring together WHO's resources on FGM for countries to adapt to their context based on existing gaps and needs in each setting. It includes practical tools such as WHO's Clinical Guidelines on the Management of Complications from FGM (https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/management-health-complications-fgm/en/) and WHO's clinical handbook Care for Women and Girls Living with FGM (https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/health-care-girls-women-living-with-FGM/en/), templates for developing action plans for FGM prevention and care, monitoring and evaluation tools, and guidance on developing tailored surveillance plans to generate FGM related data continuously and systematically for planning, implementation, and evaluation purposes. In addition, a checklist tool for developing and updating FGM training content in nursing and midwifery curricula is another resource to inform the systematic integration of context-relevant FGM content within these training curricula. Furthermore, an innovative training package on person-centered communication on FGM prevention, which is currently being tested in a multi-country study,13Ahmed W. Oyaro V.M. Stein K. Ndavi P. Esho T. Baldé M.D. Soumah A.M. Omer M. Ahmed M.A. Petzold M. et al.A hybrid, effectiveness-implementation research study protocol targeting antenatal care providers to provide female genital mutilation prevention and care services in Guinea, Kenya and Somalia.BMC Health Serv. Res. 2021; 21: 109https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-06097-wCrossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar will be available after the study is completed. This novel approach aims to train health care providers working in primary health care settings, particularly antenatal care settings using a training program comprised of a facilitator's manual, an animated video, training aids, and slides using an interactive and skills building approach. These tools are critical resources for countries to implement health sector policies and programming in high prevalence countries. In conclusion, there are a number of concrete steps needed for an effective and comprehensive health sector response to FGM. First, the health sector needs to engage as an equal partner with other sectors in national FGM abandonment strategies for a well-coordinated multi-sectoral partnership. This includes ensuring the participation of the Ministry of Health, professional associations, and community health workers in national and community level planning and implementation processes. An assessment of needs and context specific planning and adaptation of tools is another critical step in improving programming and implementing sustainable activities. Through these efforts, the health sector can play an important role and contribute meaningfully to the efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal target of FGM abandonment by 2030.",

      "title": "The pelvic floor during pregnancy and delivery: Can pelvic floor trauma and disorders be prevented?",
      "abstract": "The pelvic floor consists of the levator ani muscle, nerves, and connective tissue. The levator ani muscle attaches to the bony pelvis and provides support of the urinary bladder, uterus, vagina and rectum. A healthy and well-functioning pelvic floor is important in stabilizing the pelvic organs and preventing pelvic floor disorders. The superficial muscles of the perineum and the anal sphincters also contribute to this interaction between muscles, nerves and connective tissue, all subject to injury during childbirth. \"Pelvic floor disorders\" is the common term for urinary incontinence, anal incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, pelvic floor pain, and sexual dysfunction. At least 25% of all women have some of these symptoms and suffer from prolapse and incontinence.1 Some women suffer from more than one impairment. Pelvic floor disorders may have a great impact on a woman's self-image and her social life. These impairments are also an economic burden for society because of sick-leaves, hospital visits and assessments and conservative and surgical treatment.1 The lifetime risk of requiring urinary incontinence or prolapse surgery is approximately 20% in Western countries.1 Pregnancy, and in particular vaginal delivery, where pelvic floor, perineal, and anal sphincter trauma may occur, are the main risk factors for pelvic floor disorders later in life.2 Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is used as first-line treatment for women with established urinary incontinence and mild pelvic organ prolapse. It is also often used for women with muscular pelvic pain and sexual dysfunction. Teaching and learning PFMT may be challenging since these muscles are inside the body and muscle movements are barely visible on the perineum. Women with injured pelvic floor muscle have, on average, a weaker contraction than women with intact muscles and nerves, but most women with injuries are still able to contract. Teaching and learning PFMT during pregnancy, when muscles, nerves and connective tissue are intact, is probably easier than starting with a weakened pelvic floor in the postpartum period or later in life when symptoms have occurred. One study suggested that pelvic floor training may be associated with shorter active pushing phase during childbirth,3 but few studies have focused on whether PFMT during pregnancy can prevent levator trauma. In this issue of AOGS, Zhang et al. included 30 studies in a systematic review and investigated the effect of PFMT on the prevention of urinary incontinence and perineal tears.4 They included only randomized controlled trials, providing a high level of evidence. The meta-analysis of 12 studies regarding the prevention of urinary incontinence showed a significant and clinically relevant risk reduction (RR = 0.72) for urinary incontinence for women in the PFMT group. Pelvic floor muscle training was also effective in prevention of third- or fourth-degree perineal tears involving the anal sphincters at childbirth, with a RR of 0.50. These meta-analyses indicate that PFMT during pregnancy may improve quality of life for many women. Few data exist on the prevention of anal incontinence and this should therefore be included in future trials.5 Since PFMT reduces the risk of anal sphincter injury, which is a strong risk factor for anal incontinence, we might assume a protective effect of PFMT, but this still needs to be confirmed. The dimensions of the levator hiatus increase throughout pregnancy.6 Also during the first stage of labor there is a modest stretching of the levator muscle and increased levator hiatal dimensions,7 but most stretching and muscle injuries probably occur during the expulsive phase of labor when the fetal head passes through the levator hiatus.8 The levator ani muscle has a huge ability to stretch without rupturing, and the medial fibers can stretch 2.5 times their original length.9 Still, levator avulsions can occur, and avulsion diagnosed on ultrasound or MRI is defined as an injury to the inferomedial aspect of the puborectalis part of the levator ani muscle complex, when the muscle fibers are detached from their insertion on the symphysis. Such injuries are strongly associated with development of pelvic organ prolapse later in life, and a meta-analysis confirmed that women with levator avulsions had a two-fold increased risk of symptomatic prolapse, and four times increased risk of prolapse at clinical examination.10 Another meta-analysis showed that forceps was associated with seven-fold increased risk of levator avulsion compared to spontaneous vaginal birth and a four-to five-fold increased risk compared to vacuum-assisted birth.11 Vacuum carries a similar risk as spontaneous vaginal birth, and such trauma is not seen in women after cesarean section.11 These studies provide a strong indication of choice of instrument at operative vaginal delivery, especially to prevent pelvic organ prolapse later in life. Pudendal nerve injury may cause impairment of the pelvic floor, and multiparity, forceps, increased duration of the second stage, obstetric anal sphincter trauma and high birthweight are important risk factors for nerve injuries.12 Pudendal nerve injury usually causes few symptoms because of reinnervation, but in some women, the denervation is more severe and associated with urinary or fecal incontinence. Instrumental deliveries, and in particular forceps deliveries, in nulliparous women are associated with an increased risk of anal sphincter injuries.13 Fetal position and station should be identified precisely before instrumental vaginal deliveries and change of instrument (eg vacuum converted to forceps) should be avoided. Instrumental delivery in the occiput posterior position has the highest risk of anal sphincter injuries, and knowledge about correct traction direction is important.14 The Finnish concept of perineal protection (one hand supporting the perineum, the other hand controlling the speed of expulsion, close observation of perineal stretching and communication with the mother) is effective in preventing third and fourth- degree perineal tears involving the anal sphincters.15 In general, there has been less focus on perineal tears that do not involve the anal sphincters, but some studies have suggested that deeper second-degree perineal tears are associated with an increased likelihood of perineal pain and lower sexual function compared to women with intact perineum or superficial perineal injuries.16 A more detailed classification of second-degree tears into 2A, 2B and 2C would seem useful in future studies on this topic.17 Clinical examinations of fetal station and position during childbirth are subjective and imprecise. Ultrasound has shown high accuracy for assessment of fetal station and position and is recommended as a diagnostic tool before instrumental deliveries.18 Ultrasound can also be used in coaching women how to push effectively, and instrumental deliveries may be avoided.19 Whether ultrasound during pregnancy and at childbirth can be used to identify women at risk and to prevent pelvic floor and perineal trauma still needs to be investigated. Pregnant women want to participate in clinical decisions, and they should be informed about risks and preventive procedures. Women increasingly demand predictability about childbirth, risk of pelvic floor and anal sphincter injuries and subsequent consequences. We can all agree that prevention of injuries is better than treatment of subsequent symptoms. We now know that perineal support is protective and that vacuum should be preferred to forceps. Still, further studies regarding the effect of PFMT in preventing not only pelvic floor disorders, but also levator injuries, anal sphincter injuries and second-degree perineal trauma are needed. The role of pelvic floor ultrasound during pregnancy and childbirth in prevention of birth trauma should also be further explored.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia fisiológica se define como el cese de las menstruaciones que ocurre por el agotamiento de folículos primordiales y la resistencia de las estructuras foliculares a la acción de las gonadotropinas. El término se aplica cuando se ha completado un año sin menstruaciones, por lo que es una fecha que se establece en forma retrospectiva. En este sentido, la postmenopausia es la expresión correcta para referirse a la situación de las mujeres que han sobrepasado este momento. En un estudio multicéntrico realizado en América Latina, se encontró que la mediana de edad de la menopausia fue de 48.6 años, con rango de 43.8 años en Asunción (Paraguay) a 53 años en Cartagena (Colombia). Desde el punto de vista endocrinológico, la menopausia se caracteriza por un hipogonadismo-hipergonadotrópico. Sin embargo, la menopausia fisiológica no es la única causa de este estado hormonal, otras causas de insuficiencia ovárica primaria, que se pueden presentar incluso desde edades muy tempranas, también se caracterizan por hipogonadismo-hipergonadotrópico. Tal es el caso de disgenesias gonadales, lesiones autoinmunes del ovario, efectos de radioterapia pélvica o de quimioterapia con agentes alquilantes, ooforectomía bilateral por indicaciones benignas o malignas, cistectomías repetidas, premutación en el gen FMR1 para X frágil, galactosemia no tratada, y menopausia precoz idiopática, entre otras.",

      "title": "Fetal Pain in the First Trimester",
      "abstract": "Fetal pain perception has important implications for fetal surgery, as well as for abortion. Current neuroscientific evidence indicates the possibility of fetal pain perception during the first trimester (<14 weeks gestation). Evidence for this conclusion is based on the following findings: (1) the neural pathways for pain perception via the cortical subplate are present as early as 12 weeks gestation, and via the thalamus as early as 7-8 weeks gestation; (2) the cortex is not necessary for pain to be experienced; (3) consciousness is mediated by subcortical structures, such as the thalamus and brainstem, which begin to develop during the first trimester; (4) the neurochemicals in utero do not cause fetal unconsciousness; and (5) the use of fetal analgesia suppresses the hormonal, physiologic, and behavioral responses to pain, avoiding the potential for both short- and long-term sequelae. As the medical evidence has shifted in acknowledging fetal pain perception prior to viability, there has been a gradual change in the fetal pain debate, from disputing the existence of fetal pain to debating the significance of fetal pain. The presence of fetal pain creates tension in the practice of medicine with respect to beneficence and nonmaleficence.",

Pregnancy-associated osteoporosis is self-limited and usually does not recur during subsequent pregnancies, but little is known about its pathogenesis or the dynamics of bone density during the evolution and recovery phases of an acute episode. We report a case of idiopathic PAO. Follow-up included repeat measurements of bone density, which revealed a striking rate of improvement during the first 6 months after delivery (50% increase) and continuous improvement, at a diminished though still relatively high rate, during the successive year. This observation provides insight into the early stages of recovery from PAO.",

      "title": "Combined oral contraceptives: health benefits beyond contraception.",
      "abstract": "It has been recognized for over 50 years that combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are also capable of offering health benefits beyond contraception through the treatment and prevention of several gynaecological and medical disorders. During the last years a constant attention was given to the adverse effects of COCs, whereas their non-contraceptive benefits were underestimated. To date, most women are still unaware of the therapeutic uses of hormonal contraceptives, while on the contrary there is an extensive and constantly increasing of these non-contraceptive health benefits. This review summarizes the conditions of special interest for physicians, including dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, hyperandrogenism (acne, hirsutism, polycystic ovary syndrome), functional ovarian cysts, endometriosis, premenstrual syndrome, myomas, pelvic inflammatory disease, bone mineral density, benign breast disease and endometrial/ovarian and colorectal cancer. The benefits of COCs in rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, menstrual migraine and in perimenopause have also been treated for more comprehensive information. Using COCs specifically for non-contraceptive indications is still outside the product licence in the majority of cases. We strongly believe that these aspects are not of minor relevance and they deserve a special consideration by health providers and by the mass media, which have the main responsibility in the diffusion of scientific information. Thus, counseling and education are necessary to help women make well-informed health-care decisions and it is also crucial to increase awareness among general practitioners and gynaecologists.",

      "title": "Mechanisms of abnormal uterine bleeding",
      "abstract": "Over the past 10 years there has been an upsurge of interest in the mechanisms underlying normal and disturbed menstrual bleeding. These studies have particularly focused on the mechanisms underlying the common problems of menorrhagia associated with ovulatory and anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) and of unpredictable breakthrough bleeding during hormonal contraceptive use. A wide range of abnormalities of endometrial morphology and function have been demonstrated, but it is still not clear how all the pieces of this complex jigsaw puzzle fit together. Ovulatory DUB is predominantly associated with decreased endometrial vasoconstriction and vascular haemostatic plug formation, leading to defective control of the volume of blood which is lost during menstruation. By contrast, breakthrough bleeding is associated with a wide range of molecular disturbances which appear to result in unpredictable vessel breakdown through disturbed endometrial angiogenesis, increased vascular fragility and loss of the integrity of the endothelial, epithelial and stromal supporting structures. Anovulatory DUB is very poorly understood, but may be associated with disturbed angiogenesis, fragile vessels and defective haemostatic processes. Little is known about the actual mechanisms of the common problem of abnormal bleeding associated with specific genital tract pathologies such as uterine myomata.",

This phenomenon is explored through three different psychoanalytical concepts: disallow, unthinkable pregnancy and indifference experience. The disallow defense mechanism, in cases of denial of pregnancy, is considered as an explanation why women do not link their bodily changes with a possible pregnancy. It appears that women cannot link the sexual act to pregnancy if they have suffered because of a traumatic situation. These situations are explained in the concept of unthinkable experience. In this paper, indifference experience is related to borderline patients, a possible psychopathological structure for women who do not know they are pregnant.",

Labour induction ensures delivery of the fetus at an optimum time when delivery is more beneficial for the fetus, than the risks involved in continuing the pregnancy. Almost 25 % of labours are induced for some reason or another.\r\nPost term pregnancy - NICE guidelines recommend that IOL should be considered for women beyond 41weeks of pregnancy.  \r\nHypertensive disorders in pregnancy - Evidence indicates that IOL can lower the risk of poor maternal and neonatal outcomes in women having severe gestational hypertension/eclampsia.\r\nFoetal growth restriction - Induction of labour may help prevent stillbirths and improve neonatal outcomes in FGR.\r\nDiabetes in pregnancy - There is lot of debate about the timing of IOL in women with uncomplicated diabetes and those with severe diabetes.\r\nPROM - Inducing labour in cases of PROM reduces the rate of endometritis and of chorioamnionitis and admissions to a NICU. \r\nIntrauterine Fetal Demise - immediate induction of labor is advisable for preventing psychological trauma and related complications.\r\nTwin pregnancy - IOL is not recommended routinely in uncomplicated twin pregnancies.  \r\nElective induction/IOL on maternal request - There is no advantage of elective induction in absence of definite maternal and fetal indications.\r\nWhether labour can be induced depends on the status of the uterine cervix. Assessment of the cervix is traditionally done with the help of Bishop’s Score and the modified Bishop’s Score. Also correct selection of patients is necessary for labour induction. Labour should not be induced in situations where vaginal delivery is contraindicated. Common methods used for IOL are Foley’s catheter, amniotomy, oxytocin and prostaglandins in various forms. Risks associated with labour induction can be hyper-stimulation of the uterus and the associated risk of fetal heart rate abnormalities. IOL should be done judiciously with the best available options to ensure a reasonable chance of success of induction.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is a potential side effect of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and LUTS (lower urinary tract symptoms) drugs: this article is a critical review of the current literature. Many studies have been published on this topic. Methodological flaws limit the conclusions of these studies, mainly because of the lack of diagnostic criteria for ejaculatory and sexual desire dysfunction. Few of these studies are RCTs. The α-blocker (also called α1-adrenergic antagonist, alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist, alpha-blocker or AB) and 5-ARI (also called 5α-reductase inhibitor or testosterone-5-alpha reductase inhibitor) drugs can in particular cause erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorders and reduction of sexual desire. The sexual side effect profile of these drugs is different. Among the α-blockers, silodosin appears have the highest incidence of ejaculatory disorders. Persistent sexual side effects after discontinuation of finasteride has recently been reported, however further studies are needed to clarify the true incidence and the significance of this finding. It is desirable that future studies include validated tools to assess and diagnose sexual dysfunction induced by these medications, especially for ejaculation and sexual desire disorders. Only a small amount of research has intentionally set out to investigate sexual dysfunction caused by α-blocker and 5-ARI drugs: studies to specifically assess sexual dysfunction induced by these drugs are needed. Further studies are also needed to assess in the long term the role of combined therapy of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and α-blockers or 5-ARIs in treating LUTS/BPH. <b>Methods:</b> This study was conducted in 2014 using the paper and electronic resources of the library of the \"Azienda Provinciale per i Servizi Sanitari (APSS)\" in Trento, Italy (<ext-link href=\"http://atoz-ebsco.com/Titles/2793\">http://atoz.ebsco.com/Titles/2793</ext-link>).

All resulting listed articles were reviewed. Studies published between 2002 and December 2014 were included in the review. We included all studies that explicitly reported data on sexual dysfunction during treatment with α-blockers and 5-ARIs. We also reviewed studies that have evaluated the use of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors in combination with these drugs. The purpose was to identify possible intervention strategies for sexual dysfunction related to these drugs.",

Various definitions are used to describe the menopause (McKinlay et al. 1992; Richardson 1993): the menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation resulting from loss of ovarian follicular activity the menopause transition describes the period prior to the final menstrual period with the endocrinological, biological, and clinical features of the approaching menopause. The length of this transition has been reported to be four years (onset of perimenopause 47.5 years) and to be shorter in smokers (McKinlay et al. 1992). Furthermore, 10% of women may not experience this phase but cease menstruation abruptly the postmenopause should be defined as dating from the final menstrual period, although it cannot be determined until a period of 12 months of spontaneous amenorrhoea has been observed the perimenopause includes the menopause transition and ends 12 months after the final menstrual period.",

      "title": "Common Questions About Recurrent Urinary Tract Infections in Women.",
      "abstract": "Recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in women, including healthy women with normal genitourinary anatomy. Recurrent UTI is typically defined as three or more UTIs within 12 months, or two or more occurrences within six months. The same species that caused previous infections is typically responsible for recurrences. In premenopausal women, sexual intercourse three or more times per week, spermicide use, new or multiple sex partners, and having a UTI before 15 years of age are established risk factors. In postmenopausal women, risk is primarily increased by sequelae of lower estrogen levels. Episodes of recurrent UTI are typically characterized by dysuria and urinary frequency or hesitancy. Findings from the history or physical examination that suggest complicated infection or another disease process warrant additional evaluation. At least one symptomatic episode should be verified by urine culture to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. Imaging is rarely warranted. Short courses of antibiotics are as effective as longer courses. Patient-initiated treatment lowers the cost of diagnosis, number of physician visits, and number of symptomatic days compared with physician-initiated treatment. It also reduces antibiotic exposure compared with antibiotic prophylaxis. Antibiotic prophylaxis effectively limits UTI recurrence but increases the risk of antibiotic resistance and adverse effects. Cranberry products may reduce recurrent UTIs in premenopausal women, but are less effective than antibiotic prophylaxis, and data are conflicting. Optimal dosing is unknown. Postmenopausal women with atrophic vaginitis may benefit from topical estrogen therapy.",

Symptoms can be divided into storage symptoms, voiding symptoms, post-micturition symptoms, and prolapse symptoms. Some women may be too embarrassed to volunteer any or all of their symptoms and its complete impact to daily life. Therefore, the use of standardized symptom questionnaires may help to provide a complete and structured analysis. A complete general history will allow clinicians to identify relevant co-morbidities that could initiate or worsen symptoms or influence ongoing care and management of the woman. Examination of a woman should include inspection and palpation of the abdomen, assessment for pelvic organ prolapse, pelvic floor muscle assessment, bimanual vaginal examination, and neurological examination as appropriate. The combined findings from the history and examination are important to guide further information gathering, investigation, or treatment.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Reconstructive interventions on the male urethra present a complex surgical challenge. It is crucial not only to restore the anatomical patency of the urethra but also patients’ quality of life. The onset of sexual dysfunction after the operation significantly reduces the patients' quality of life and their perception of treatment outcomes. Objective. To conduct a review of the current literature on sexual and reproductive disorders following reconstructive interventions on the male urethra. Material and methods. Literature search was conducted using the PubMed, Google Scholar, and eLibrary databases up to August 2023. The search was performed using keywords in both Russian and English, including urethroplasty, urethral stricture, sexual dysfunction, ejaculatory dysfunction, penile shortening, penile curvature, and cold glans. Results. The development of sexual dysfunction after reconstructive interventions on the urethra depends on anatomical factors, surgical technique, and the extent of urethral involvement. Erectile dysfunction is present within the first 6 months after the surgery, followed by gradual recovery. The development of ejaculatory dysfunction, penile shortening or curvature, as well as impaired sensitivity, depends on the chosen surgical approach. Conclusion. The literature on sexual dysfunction is characterized by heterogeneous studies, making their analysis challenging. Data on reproductive disorders following urethroplasty are presented only in a few studies. To further assess surgical und functional outcomes it is necessary to conduct multicenter studies using validated questionnaires.",

      "abstract": "Lower back pain is a frequent symptom during pregnancy, often worsening as the pregnancy progresses. The shifting center of gravity, hormonal changes, and increased weight gain associated with pregnancy can contribute to lower back pain and discomfort. While pharmacological interventions are sometimes necessary, there is growing interest in non-pharmacological approaches that may provide relief without potential side effects. Counter pressure is a type of massage that uses your fists to apply constant pressure to the patient's spine during compression. Anti-stress information can also be applied to the lower back in a straight or circular motion. Back compression techniques can relieve back pain during labor contractions. Objective to determine the level of labor pain in the first stage of the active phase of labor in women giving birth at the Rappang Health Center in Sidrap Regency before back massage is carried out with the counter pressure technique. To find out labor pain in the first stage of the active phase of labor in women giving birth at the Rappang Health Center, Sidrap Regency, after doing back massage using a counter pressure technique. The type of research used is pseudo- or quasy-experimental research with a Two-Group Posttest Only design. The relaxation technique obtained a mean rank of 18.25, while the group that underwent counter pressure obtained a value of 6.75. So the average pain in the group that only got the relaxation technique was higher than that done with masse counter pressure with a p value (0.000) &lt;0.05 so it can be concluded that counter pressure massage is effective in reducing pain intensity in laboring mothers. There is an influence of the Counter Pressure massage technique to reduce the intensity of labor pain during the first active phase at the Rappang Health Center, Sidrap Regency. Counter pressure could potentially be a useful technique for managing labor pain.",

      "title": "Male factor infertility--basics revisited.",
      "abstract": "Despite increasing population of the world, the desire for reproduction remains a basic human desire. Infertility is a complex phenomenon and the suffering couples need emotional and psychological support along with investigations and treatment. A couple is said to be infertile if pregnancy does not result after one year of normal sexual activity without contraceptives. About 25% couples experience infertility at some point in their reproductive lives, the incidence increasing with age. The male partner factor contributes to about 40% of cases of infertility. Clinical evaluation of male partner is warranted after 6 months of unprotected coitus. Endocrine profile and detailed semen analysis are the cornerstones of laboratory investigations after history and physical examination. Oligospermia is the presence of less than 20 million/sperms/ml in the ejaculate; azoospermia is the absence of sperm; oligoasthenoteratozoospermia means that the sperms have motility and morphological defects in addition to being less than 20 million/ml. As spermatogenesis takes approximately 74 days, it is thus important to review history from the past 3 months.1 Spermatogenesis is a unique process of continuing differentiation because, unlike thoroughly mitotic processes, such as hematopoiesis, the DNA content of the product is half that of the progenitor cells. In the initial stages, spermatogonia undergo mitotic divisions, giving rise to primary and secondary spermatocytes, the cell type in which the first and second meiotic divisions occur. The haploid products of meiosis are the round spermatids, which elongate during the process called spermiogenesis and compact their chromatin into the sperm head and produce the other sperm components. Despite the research interest in the process involved, little is known about the pathway. An important early observation was that some azoospermic men had deletions of the distal long arm of the Y-chromosome, suggesting that an underlying genetic defect may be responsible in some cases.2 This led to the postulation",

Protrusion of single or more layers of rectum through the anus is rectal prolapse. Rectal prolapse is also a common problem in cattle and small ruminants. Rectal prolapse occurs following straining which may be related with many conditions. In late gestation, vaginal prolapse may occur due to hormonal shift, decline in progesterone and rise in estrogen. Because of vaginal prolapse the animal may strain continually and end up with rectal prolapse and leads to a serious obstetrical emergency. A two and half years old pluriparous non descriptive doe was presented with the history of a mass protruding through the vulva and anal opening for the past five hours. Based on the initial clinical observation, the case was diagnosed as vagino-cervical prolapse coupled with rectal prolapse. The prolapsed vaginal mass and rectal mass was reduced and replaced in its anatomical position. Since the rectal straining was persistent, parturition was induced using cloprostenol (125 µg) and dexamethasone sodium phosphate (16 mg) as intramuscular injection. Following the induction, the doe delivered two live male kids after 36 hrs. After parturition straining was not observed. The animal made an uneventful recovery without any recurrence.

      "abstract": "&lt;strong&gt;Background:&lt;/strong&gt; Post-partum period is challenging for every woman. It usually starts from delivery and ends by 42 days. In majority of women, complications like hemorrhage, DVT, pulmonary embolism, edema in hand and ankle joints, puerperal infection, problems in breast feeding, kypho-scoliosis and backache arise. Postnatal low back pain and pelvic pain are common problems in the post-partum period; these could vary from mild problems to disability. The incidence of postnatal LBP is very high from 21% to 82% in the fisco year post-partum. Remission of pain occurred in 51% at 1 month and 78% at 6 months in CS group, while in the normal vaginal delivery group 55% at 1 month and 85% in the 6th month had remission of pain. Reoccurrence of pain is common in postnatal period. Physiotherapy has shown to have influence on various problems arising in post-natal period. Health literature listed out various conventional treatment approaches for back pain which includes exercises, yoga, core stability, walking, running, aquatic exercise and aerobics. Pilate therapy focuses on improving the body’s core and makes it more flexible and stronger. Pilates has been found to be effective in neuromuscular problems. Its effect in post natal women is a research area. Its effect over conventional therapy needs to be evaluated for better patient care. &lt;strong&gt;Method:&lt;/strong&gt; 494 subjects were included according to criteria. Subjects were allotted into two groups. Group A: Pilates and Group B: Conventional. Interventions were given for 6 weeks and changes in Visual Analogue Scale, Modified Schober Test, Manual Muscle Testing, Oswestry Low Back Disability were noted. &lt;strong&gt;Result:&lt;/strong&gt; For pre and post interventional analysis between the groups, student’s t-test was used. The results showed significant improvement with Pilates therapy than conventional training in reducing back pain, increasing abdominal muscle strength and improving quality of life. &lt;strong&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/strong&gt; Pilates therapy reduced back pain than conventional therapy in post natal women.",

El reflujo gastrico limita la prescripcion de medicamentos analgesicos y antibioticos. Los valores elevados de progesterona observados durante la gravidez, el incremento del metabolismo de los estrogenos de la encia y el incremento en la produccion de prostaglandinas durante el embarazo, tienen una accion directa sobre los capilares gingivales y sobre la nutricion y metabolismo de las celulas del periodonto. En el primer trimestre se pueden presentar algunos trastornos como vomito, nauseas y fatiga, ademas pueden aparecer los granulomas piogenos gingivales, aunado a esto la gingivitis y periodontitis preexistentes se pueden intensificar. En el tercer trimestre se puede observar en la gestante una etapa de depresion y fatiga que puede desencadenar en una falta de cooperacion para cumplir con el protocolo de higiene oral. Despues de la semana 28 la posicion supina causa una marcada disminucion del gasto cardiaco debido a la compresion del utero sobre la vena cava inferior, produciendose en algunos casos el Sindrome de Hipotension Supina.

(2)rmal vaginal discharge Normal physiological discharge changes with the menstrual cycle.The character of the discharge tends to be clearer with a stretchable consistency around ovulation, then may be thicker and slightly yellow during the luteal phase.Normal healthy discharge should not be associated with symptoms such as itching, redness and swelling, and does not have a strong odour.(3) Vaginal discharge can increase during higher oestrogen states, such as ovulation, the luteal phase, puberty and pregnancy, and with oestrogenbased therapies such as combined hormonal contraception and hormone-replacement therapies.Normal vaginal discharge is found in 10% of those who present with vaginal discharge.(4) Abnormal vaginal discharge Abnormal vaginal discharge is characterised by a change in colour, consistency, volume or odour, and may be associated with symptoms such as itch, soreness, dysuria, pelvic pain, intermenstrual bleeding or postcoital bleeding.(5) An important follow-up question to ask is whether the vaginal discharge is significantly altered from the woman's usual pattern.(3) If the vaginal discharge has a significant change in colour and odour, contains blood or causes itch or discomfort, it is less likely to be physiological in nature.",

      "abstract": "Fear of childbirth was described on the basis of an analysis of fear-inducing situations spontaneously written by 40 pregnant women, and on the basis of the analysis of questionaires concerning anxieties before parturition and answered by 80 additional gravidae, at 12 weeks before and some days before the expected date of delivery. The following factors of anxiety before parturition were found: fear of injury of the mother or of the newborn, fear of efforts in labour, and their concomitant traumas and symptoms, fear of complications during delivery, fear of feeling to be helpless, fear to lose control of coping with labour, and fear of the unknown. The focus of the anxieties varied during the course of pregnancy. 12 weeks before term the main contribution to fear was given by the anxiety of injury, whereas some days before delivery anxiety of efforts in labour and their concomitant symptoms dominated. An offer of different courses of preparations for childbirth in our department should help the pregnant women to cope with her anxieties before parturition or fear of childbirth.",

      "abstract": "The term ectopic pregnancy refers to a gestation in which the fertilized ovum implants on any tissue other than the endometrial membrane lining the uterine cavity. Fig 1 presents the various types of ectopic pregnancy and their relative frequencies The classic clinical symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are pelvic pain, amenorrhea, and vaginal bleeding , spotting (40-50%). However, only 50% of patients present typical symptomatology. Patients may present with other symptoms common to early pregnancy, including nausea (frequently after rupture), breast fullness, fatigue, abdominal pain, heavy cramping, shoulder pain, and recent dyspareunia . Physical findings during examination should be pelvic unilateral tenderness, especially on movement of cervix (75%), enlarged uterus or palpable adnexal mass; crepitant mass on one side or in culde-sac (50%). Approximately 20% of patients with ectopic pregnancies are hemodynamically compromised at initial presentation, which is highly suggestive of rupture. Body temperature ranges from 37.2 to 37.8 0C while the pulse is variable: normal before but rapid after rupture. Today, using modern diagnostic techniques, most ectopic pregnancies may be diagnosed prior to rupturing [1]. Diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy has been greatly improved by the advent of rapid serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) tests and then the widespread adoption of transvaginal pelvic ultrasonography (TVUS) [2]. Serum beta-HCG levels can definitively rule out pregnancy if negative, although there have been case reports of pathology-proven ruptured ectopic pregnancy and hemorrhagic shock despite an undetectable serum beta-HCG [3]. In the early stages of a normal intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), the serum beta-HCG rises along a well-defined curve. Therefore, serial beta-HCG tests can be useful for determining the ultimate location of a pregnancy of unknown location. The lower limit of normal rise in beta-HCG (using a 99% confidence interval) is 53% in 2 days [4]. Patients with a beta-HCG level that falls more than 50% in 2",

En la hembra bovina el prolapso uterino se ve favorecido por la atonia uterina y la notoria distension de los ligamentos anchos despues del parto, asi como por la debilidad y relajacion del diafragma pelvico, en ciertos casos, lejos de calmarse, los violentos dolores que produce la distension del cuello, hace que los espasmos del miometrio continuen despues de parto. Como la porcion mas activa del musculo uterino es la que se extiende hacia la extremidad de los cuernos, en tanto que la parte cercana al cervix tiende a ser mas inerte, es posible que el desequilibrio de estas contracciones, actuando sobre un organo flacido y vacio, produzca la invaginacion inicial del extremo terminal del cuerno gravido.

      "title": "SP0068 Pregnancy and rheumatoid arthritis",
      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Women will hardly ever get their first signs of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) during pregnancy, whereas the onset of RA seems to cluster in the postpartum period. This clinical and epidemiological observation may be explained by a postponement of the onset of symptomatic RA by pregnancy, which is in line with the observed amelioration of disease activity in women with established RA. Up to 75% of women with RA improve during pregnancy, starting in the first or second trimester with maximum improvement during the third trimester of pregnancy. More than 90% of these patients will experience a flare of their disease within two to six months after delivery. Women who have ever been pregnant have a lower risk of developing RA, particularly when they had their first pregnancy at an early age. Several biological mechanisms have been put forward to explain the favourable effect of pregnancy on the onset and course of RA, but there is still no fully satisfactory explanation. The profound hormonal shifts (e.g. increased estrogens, progesterone and corticosteroids) have been implicated in the favourable effect of pregnancy through their effect on the immune system. Pregnancy is an immunological challenge requiring immunological protection or tolerance for the partly non-self fetus. Cellular immunity is decreased during pregnancy, which may play a role in the positive effect of pregnancy in RA. Pregnancy is associated with decreased production of TH1 associated cytokines (IL2, interferon gamma), increased production of TH2 associated cytokines (IL-4, IL-10), and decreased production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF alpha, IL-12). Alterations in the glycosylation of IgG have also been put forward as a possible explanation. The question why not all women improve during pregnancy is still not answered by the above mechanisms. There is some evidence that HLA disparity between mother and fetus will play a role in the suppression of autoimmunity, which will differ between different pregnancies. A better understanding in how pregnancy exerts its effect on the onset and course of RA will help to unravel possible immunological mechanisms in RA and may lead to more effective treatments.",

The most extreme form of menstrual irregularity is amenorrhea, which has been linked to significant decreases in vertebral bone density and increases in injury prevalence. Many authors have sought to determine the causal factors of athletic amenorrhea, some of which include hormonal status, training and physical parameters, nutritional balance, and psychological stress. The purpose of this paper was to compare studies that have examined the relationship of these variables to menstrual irregularities and bone density. Controversy exists regarding the relative contribution of these variables. The etiology is likely multifactorial and should be evaluated as such. Clinicians treating female athletes must be knowledgeable about the negative consequences associated with menstrual irregularities. Furthermore, it is critical that clinicians provide thorough patient education in order to prevent injuries and the long-term loss of bone density. Appropriate medical and/or psychological referral of the athlete with menstrual irregularities may be necessary.",

Emerging evidence suggests that there is variability in sleep patterns and complaints which manifest differently among pregnant women. Moreover, it is well accepted that sleep disturbance can dysregulate normal immune and endocrine processes that are critically important to the health and progression of gestation. A possible consequence of sleep disturbance is an increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Then again, many endogenous and exogenous factors, including pregnancy-related physiological, hormonal, and anatomic changes, as well as lifestyle changes, can impact the degree and chronicity of sleep disturbance.

      "abstract": "Not discounting the important foetal or placental contribution, the endometrium is a key determinant of pregnancy outcomes. Given the inherently linked processes of menstruation, pregnancy and parturition with the endometrium, further understanding of menstruation will help to elucidate the maternal contribution to pregnancy. Endometrial health can be assessed via menstrual history and menstrual fluid, a cyclically shed, easily and non-invasively accessible biological sample that represents the distinct, heterogeneous composition of the endometrial environment. Menstrual fluid has been applied to the study of endometriosis, unexplained infertility and early pregnancy loss; however, it is yet to be examined regarding adverse pregnancy outcomes. These adverse outcomes, including preeclampsia, foetal growth restriction (FGR), spontaneous preterm birth and perinatal death (stillbirth and neonatal death), lay on a spectrum of severity and are often attributed to placental dysfunction. The source of this placental dysfunction is largely unknown and may be due to underlying endometrial abnormalities or endometrial interactions during placentation. We present existing evidence for the endometrial contribution to adverse pregnancy outcomes and propose that a more comprehensive understanding of menstruation can provide insight into the endometrial environment, offering great potential value as a diagnostic tool to assess pregnancy risk. As yet, this concept has hardly been explored.",

      "title": "Persistent Postnatal Perineal Pain and Dyspareunia: A Review of Physical Pathology and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Postnatal perineal pain and dyspareunia are common. For many women the problem will resolve spontaneously within 3 months of delivery. However, a small but significant minority develops persistent perineal pain and/or dyspareunia, and this has considerable impact on the sexual function of women and their partners. Some women may be more at risk of postnatal dyspareunia (e.g., primiparae, or after assisted vaginal delivery). Less than half with the problem are likely to actively seek treatment from, or be offered treatment by, a health care professional. Those in regular contact with postnatal women should consider taking a proactive role in identifying women with a range of postnatal morbidities, including persistent perineal pain and dyspareunia. There is very little literature outlining the assessment and management of dyspareunia in the postnatal population. Physiotherapists potentially have skills appropriate to the assessment and management of postnatal dyspareunia, particularly where the primary problem appears to be pain originating from scar tissue, but there is insufficient evidence available at present to support or dismiss this contention. In view of the lack of research currently available, it is not possible to make evidence-based recommendations for practice. Essentially, there is considerable need for further research in all aspects of postnatal dyspareunia.",

      "abstract": "Masa nifas merupakan masa setelah lahirnya plasenta dan berakhir saat rahim kembali seperti sebelum hamil. Masa ini berlangsung selama 6 minggu atau 42 hari. Pada masa nifas tidak jarang ibu mengalami berbagai kondisi yang tidak mengenakkan. Beberapa masalah yang sering dijumpai antara lain perdarahan pasca persalinan, keputihan, infeksi, inkontinensia urin, payudara bengkak, Baby Blues Syndrome dan Post-Partum Depression. Kondisi ini apabila tidak ditangani dengan baik dapat menjadi faktor risiko komplikasi yang dapat membahayakan ibu dan bayi. Metode penulisan dilakukan dengan pendekatan review jurnal dari Google Scholar dengan kata kunci post partum, faktor risiko dan komplementer pada masing-masing jurnal. Pencarian menghasilkan 10 penelitian yang direview. Penulisan review jurnal ini adalah untuk mengetahui penerapan terapi komplementer yang dapat menurunkan faktor risiko pada masa nifas melalui pencarian review jurnal. Penelitian yang direview menunjukkan bahwa pemberian terapi komplementer dapat menurunkan berbagai keluhan dan faktor risiko pada ibu nifas. Diharapkan bidan dapat memberikan asuhan kebidanan dengan pendekatan terapi komplementer kepada ibu pasca persalinan. The post partum period is the period after the birth of the placenta and ends when the uterus returns to its pre-pregnancy state. This period lasts 6 weeks or 42 days. In the post partum period, it is not uncommon for mothers to experience various unpleasant conditions. Some of the problems frequently encountered include post-partum bleeding, vaginal discharge, infections, urinary incontinence, swollen breasts, Baby Blues Syndrome and Post-Partum Depression. If this condition is not treated properly, it can become a risk factor for complications that can endanger the mother and baby. The writing method was carried out using a journal review approach from Google Scholar with the keywords post partum, risk factors and complementary in each journal. The search yielded 10 studies reviewed. Writing this journal review is to find out the application of complementary therapies that can reduce risk factors in the post partum period through searching journal reviews. The studies reviewed show that providing complementary therapy can reduce various complaints and risk factors in post partum mothers. It is hoped that midwives can provide midwifery care with a complementary therapy approach to postpartum mothers.",

Although the transition from the prenatal period to the postnatal period is usually desired and planned, it is a developmental and cognitive transition period full of complex emotional reactions. During this period, common mood disorders for women include maternity blues, postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis. Postpartum depression is a common and serious mood disorder which can jeopardize the health of the mother, baby and family within the first year of delivery. Knowing the risks factors is an important issue for the early detection and early intervention of postpartum depression. However, knowing that a history of infertility may contribute to the development of depression during the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, there are few studies assessing the effects of infertility on the development of postpartum depression. In this review, the effects of infertility on the development of postpartum depression and health professions' roles in this issue are discussed in light with the literature.",

Occasionally a cow will present two or more days following parturition with signs of peritonitis, depression, and anorexia. The cow may or may not have a history of obstetric intervention or even suspected dystocia. Tearing of the vulva, vagina, and cervix occur almost exclusively during dystocia. Tearing and bruising can often occur during parturition in the absence of obstetric intervention; however injury to these structures typically occurs during obstetric management of dystocia. This chapter describes the management of iatrogenic injury from artificial insemination or embryo transfer (ET). The indications for ovariectomy include neoplasia or the presence of severe adhesions, either of which affect the function of the ovary.",

The symptoms of menopause can vary from woman to woman, and the disappearance of menstrual cycles is but a sign. Menopause and perimenopause are characterized by high levels of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and of LF (luteinizing hormone), and by low levels of plasmatic estradiol; these phenomena, however, are not always stable. Lack of estrogen in postmenopause causes skin alterations, atrophy of the genital organs, and osteoporosis. Medical consultation is very important at the onset and during menopause.",

      "abstract": "Brief episodes of severe fetal hypoxia can arise in late gestation as a result of interruption of normal umbilical blood flow Systemic parameters and blood chemistry indicate complete recovery within 1-2 hours, although the long-term effects on fetal brain functions are unknown Fetal sheep were subjected to umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) for 10 min at 131 days of gestation, and then monitored intensively until onset of labour or delivery (<145 days of gestation) Normal patterns of fetal behaviour, including breathing movements, episodes of high and low voltage electorcortical activity, eye movements and postural (neck) muscle activity, were disrupted for 3-10 days after the UCO Preterm labour and delivery occurred in a significant number of the pregnancies after UCO compared to the control (sham-UCO) cohort.Complications arising from antepartum events such as impaired umbilical blood flow can cause significant fetal hypoxia. These complications can be unpredictable, as well as difficult to detect, and thus we lack a detailed understanding of the (patho)physiological changes that occur between the antenatal in utero event and birth. In the present study, we assessed the consequences of brief (∼10 min) umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) in fetal sheep at ∼0.88 gestation on fetal plasma cortisol concentrations and fetal behaviour [electrocortical (EcoG), electo-oculargram (EOG), nuchal muscle electromyography (EMG) and breathing activities] in the days following UCO. UCO caused a rapid onset of fetal hypoxaemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis; however, by 6 h, all blood parameters and cardiovascular status were normalized and not different from the control (Sham-UCO) cohort. Subsequently, the incidence of fetal breathing movements decreased compared to the control group, and abnormal behavioural patterns developed over the days following UCO and leading up to the onset of labour, which included increased high voltage and sub-low voltage ECoG and EOG activities, as well as decreased nuchal EMG activity. Fetuses subjected to UCO went into labour 7.9 ± 3.6 days post-UCO (139.5 ± 3.2 days of gestation) compared to the control group fetuses at 13.6 ± 3.3 days post-sham UCO (144 ± 2.2 days of gestation; P < 0.05), despite comparable increases in fetal plasma cortisol and a similar body weight at birth. Thus, a single transient episode of complete UCO late in gestation in fetal sheep can result in prolonged effects on fetal brain activity and premature labour, suggesting persisting effects on fetal cerebral metabolism.",

      "title": "Minimising diagnostic uncertainties in early pregnancy",
      "abstract": "Introduction\r\n\r\nApproximately one in five women experience abdominal pain and/or vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy. This usually prompts referral to an Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit where an ultrasound scan will be performed. Following the ultrasound, either a certain or uncertain diagnosis will be made. Certain diagnoses may be positive, i.e. a viable intrauterine pregnancy, or negative, i.e. a non-viable or ectopic pregnancy. Uncertain diagnoses occur when there is ambiguity regarding either the location or the viability of the pregnancy. Up to 25% of women attending an Early Pregnancy Assessment Unit are given such a diagnosis at their initial visit. \r\n\r\nAll women with a diagnosis of either a pregnancy of unknown location or uncertain viability need to be followed-up until a definitive diagnosis can be made. At present this is haphazard and protracted, commonly taking up to two weeks to resolve and requiring multiple visits for various different investigations. This takes a considerable amount of time and costs a not insignificant amount of money. Furthermore, in the time taken to make a definitive diagnosis, a stable woman with an unknown miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy may become unstable and require immediate resuscitation, life-saving blood transfusion and/or emergency surgery. \r\n\r\nAims \r\n\r\nThe aim of this PhD was to develop methods to minimise the number of women given uncertain diagnoses in early pregnancy, or to at least minimise the duration of uncertainty if the diagnosis is unavoidable. Several different studies were undertaken in an attempt to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nStudies\r\n\r\nWe initially undertook a prospective cohort study to determine the levels of anxiety generated by uncertain diagnoses in early pregnancy was undertaken. Women with uncertain diagnoses were found to be significantly more anxious (as measured using the standardized short form of Spielberger’s state-trait anxiety inventory) than their counterparts given certain diagnoses (23±0.79 versus 14±6.6), even if these certain diagnoses were not associated with an ongoing pregnancy. This study served to further justify the main objective. \r\n\r\nWe then performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify and determine the diagnostic accuracy of various different ultrasonographic features to predict (a) an intrauterine pregnancy prior to visualization of embryonic contents and (b) a tubal ectopic pregnancy in the absence of an obvious extra-uterine embryo. This study identified the double decidual sac sign as a potential marker to be able to accurately differentiate a true gestation sac from a pseudosac with a sensitivity of 82% (95% CI, 68-90%), specificity of 97% (95% Ci, 76-100%), positive likelihood ratio of 30 (95% CI, 2.8-331) and negative likelihood ratio of 0.19 (95% CI, 0.10-0.35). The quality of the studies included in the meta-analysis however precluded the use of the double decidual sac sign in clinical practice without further validation\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, we carried out a prospective study following STARD guidelines to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the double decidual sac sign to predict an intrauterine pregnancy prior to visualization of embryonic contents using modern, high-resolution transvaginal ultrasound. This study found that the double decidual sac sign predicted an intrauterine pregnancy with a sensitivity of 94% (95% Ci, 85-98%), specificity of 100% (95% CI, 16-100%) and overall diagnostic accuracy of 94% (95% CI, 88-100%). The positive and negative predictive values are 100% (95% CI, 94-100%) and 33% (95% CI, 4.3-78%) respectively whilst the positive likelihood ratio was infinite and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.06 (95% CI, 0.02-0.16). These results suggest that the meta-analysis under-estimated the ability of the double decidual sac sign to differentiate between a true gestation sac and a pseudosac. \r\n\r\nSubsequently, we conducted a study incorporating off-line analysis of ultrasonographic images to determine the inter- and intra-observer reliability of the double decidual sac sign to predict an intrauterine pregnancy prior to ultrasonographic visualization of embryonic contents. This involved fifteen observers from around the United Kingdom remotely assessing a selection of two-dimensional images from 25 of the diagnostic accuracy study participants. There was significant (p<0.01) agreement amongst the observers but the level of agreement was only ‘fair’, reflected by kappa statistics of 0.25, 0.33 and 0.21. Following a period of focused training, the inter-observer reliability significantly increased demonstrated by kappa statistics of 0.70, 0.63 and 0.53. The intra-observer reliability ranged from ‘substantial’ (K=0.65) to ‘almost perfect’ (K=0.92). These results demonstrate that the double decidual sac sign has the potential, after training, to be both reliable and precise, making it a very useful ultrasonographic sign in clinical practice. \r\n\r\nFinally, we undertook a prognostic research study, following REMARK recommendations, investigating the ability of five serum biomarkers to predict pregnancy outcome in women with pregnancies of uncertain viability. Candidate biomarkers included Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), soluble FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase-1 (Flt-1), serum TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand and Interleukin-15. Serum concentrations of Ang-2 and Flt-1 were significantly lower in pregnancies of uncertain viability that were subsequently proven to be viable than those that were subsequently proven to be non-viable (Ang-2 1510pg/ml versus 2365pg/ml and Flt-1 103pg/ml versus 202pg/ml). Furthermore, there were statistically significant (p<0.01), linear (p-value for trend <0.01) associations between Ang-2 and Flt-1 concentrations and subsequent pregnancy viability such that women with a pregnancy of uncertain viability and Ang-2 concentrations greater than or equal to 2666pg/ml were 64% less likely to have a viable pregnancy than those with Ang-2 concentrations less than or equal to 1382pg/ml and women with a pregnancy of uncertain viability and Flt-1 concentrations greater than or equal to 142pg/ml were 50% less likely to have a viable pregnancy than those with Flt-1 concentrations less than or equal to 87pg/ml. These findings suggest that Ang-2 and Flt-1 may be useful in the prediction of pregnancy viability in cases of uncertainty.\r\n\r\nDiscussion \r\n\r\nOne of the biggest challenges in early pregnancy ultrasonography is accurate differentiation between a true gestation sac and a pseudosac. Pseudosacs, although rare, are strongly suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy, hence it is an important distinction to make, ideally as soon as possible. Both appear initially as intrauterine fluid collections or ‘empty sacs’. Whilst experts may claim that it is not difficult to differentiate between the two structures, in clinical practice, many of the individuals undertaking the scans in early pregnancy do not claim to be experts. Traditional teaching has always been to wait until either a yolk sac or fetal pole are visualized within the sac before confirming a definite intrauterine pregnancy. Although safe, inherent with this approach is that an intrauterine fluid collection is visible using transvaginal ultrasound from around day 28 but a yolk sac is not visible until at least day 35. If an ultrasound is undertaken during this time, an ‘empty sac’ will be seen and uncertainty will ensue. \r\n\r\nApplication of the results from the studies described above could potentially revolutionize the care of women with diagnostic uncertainties in early pregnancy. Firstly, the confirmation that uncertain diagnoses in early pregnancy are highly anxiogenic, means that Early Pregnancy Assessment Units can now justify the allocation of resources to help alleviate this distress. This is crucial if we are to improve the holistic nature of the care provided to women with complications of early pregnancy. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the discovery that the double decidual sac sign can accurately predict an intrauterine pregnancy prior to visualization of embryonic contents (and therefore effectively exclude an ectopic pregnancy) means that we can rationalise follow-up, improve consistency and minimise error in the management of women with ultrasonographic evidence of an empty sac in early pregnancy. \r\n\r\nAlthough it could be argued that utilization of the double decidual sac sign does not minimise the number of women given uncertain diagnoses in early pregnancy, merely swap concerns regarding location to ones regarding viability, in clinical practice it is the potential consequences of pregnancies of unknown location that are most hazardous, both because of the immediate threat to health and the future threats to fertility. Furthermore, if the findings from our prognosis study are confirmed, and appropriate threshold levels for our biomarkers determined, it may be possible to minimise the duration of uncertainty for women with pregnancies of uncertain viability to hours rather than weeks. \r\n\r\nUsing a combination of approaches therefore, we have achieved the overall aim of this thesis in minimising diagnostic uncertainties in early pregnancy, the clinical benefits of which are multifold. Not only does it reduce anxiety for women, but also prevents unnecessary investigations from being performed in those with an intrauterine pregnancy and minimise morbidity and mortality, permit earlier, potentially less invasive intervention and possibly preserve future fertility for women with an ectopic pregnancy.",

      "title": "Uterine torsion complicated by severe placental abruption in the second trimester: a case report and literature review",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Uterine torsion is a rare obstetric event that can occur during pregnancy and is difficult to diagnose. Its occurrence may lead to serious adverse pregnancy outcomes. Case introduction The patient was a 33-year-old woman at 30 + 5 weeks’ gestation with a singleton pregnancy. The pregnancy course, including fetal growth, and prenatal examinations were regular. Except for a small amount of vaginal bleeding in early pregnancy and treatment with progesterone, there were no prenatal abnormalities, and the patient denied any trauma or sexual history. The patient was admitted to the emergency department with persistent severe pain in the lower abdomen and slight vaginal bleeding during night sleep. Abdominal pain started two hours prior to admission and was accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Examination revealed positive abdominal tenderness, high uterine tone, and no significant intermittent period of uterine contractions, and measurement of the fetal heart rate by means of the nonstress test revealed a rate of 60 beats per minute. Therefore, placental abruption was highly suspected. Subsequently, an emergency cesarean section was performed under general anesthesia. The newborn boy, with Apgar scores of 0–3-4 after birth and weighing 1880 g, was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and died two days later due to ineffective rescue. After the uterine incision was sutured, the examination revealed that the uterine incision was located on the posterior wall of the uterus, and the uterus was twisted 180° to the right. The diagnosis after cesarean section was 180° uterine torsion to the right, severe placental abruption, and severe neonatal asphyxia. On the fifth day after surgery, the patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital. Conclusions Posterior uterine incision cesarean section may be performed in unexpected circumstances and is also feasible as a safe option for resetting if torsion is not complete. Abdominal pain during pregnancy is less likely to be diagnosed as uterine torsion, which often leads to premature birth, fetal asphyxia, placental abruption, and even perinatal death. Therefore, for abdominal pain during pregnancy, obstetricians should consider the possibility of uterine torsion.",

The most important risk factors are advanced maternal age and chronic pathologies.

An early postpartum haemorrhage (EPH) is one that occurs during the first 24 hours following delivery and is generally the most serious.The late is what happens after 24 hours after delivery until 6 weeks after it. The causes of PPH include uterine atony, traumas/ lacerations, retention of products of conception and coagulation disorders, the most frequent being atony and the latter can occur due to different factors of which one of them was the factor that triggered the hemorrhage in the present case. Multiparity is associated with an increase in fibrous tissue that can interfere with muscle contraction, since uterine over- distention exhausts the tone of muscle fibers, which is why a multiparous uterus is more prone to atony. It can be prevented by an active mangement of the third stage of labour and its treatment goes from the use of uterotonics drugs to an emergency hysterectomy.",

Methods The 2 societies cosponsored a terminology consensus conference, which was held in May 2013. Results and Conclusions Members of the consensus conference agreed that the term genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is a medically more accurate, all-encompassing, and publicly acceptable term than vulvovaginal atrophy. GSM is defined as a collection of symptoms and signs associated with a decrease in estrogen and other sex steroids involving changes to the labia majora/minora, clitoris, vestibule/introitus, vagina, urethra and bladder. The syndrome may include but is not limited to genital symptoms of dryness, burning, and irritation; sexual symptoms of lack of lubrication, discomfort or pain, and impaired function; and urinary symptoms of urgency, dysuria and recurrent urinary tract infections. Women may present with some or all of the signs and symptoms, which must be bothersome and should not be better accounted for by another diagnosis. The term was presented and discussed at the annual meeting of each society. The respective Boards of NAMS and ISSWSH formally endorsed the new terminology—genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)—in 2014.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background and Aims</h3> Vaginismus is a condition characterized by an aversion to vaginal penetration due to actual or anticipated pain. This can pose challenges during pregnancy and delivery. <h3>Methods</h3> We report a case of a 25-year-old pregnant woman from Bangladesh with severe vaginismus admitted in the labor unit for induction at 41 weeks of gestation. It should be noted that the patient wished to experience a eutocic delivery. Therefore, induction was initiated with endovaginal prostaglandin under fetal monitoring, despite the background. A few hours later, the patient started to develop contractions and did not tolerate further obstetric evaluations due to severe pain on vaginal examination. After a multidisciplinary discussion, we decided to proceed with epidural anesthesia before any further examinations. Ropivacaine 0.5% was used to produce analgesia and motor blockade ate S2-S4 level to reduce spasming. The remaining vaginal evaluations were uneventful. A trial of vaginal labor was attempted, but eventually induction failure was presumed, and the patient underwent cesarean section under epidural anesthesia. Postoperative analgesia included intravenous paracetamol and ketorolac and fixed epidural boluses of ropivacaine. Maternal and fetal outcomes were favorable, and the parturient reported satisfaction with the adopted approach. Recent improvements in labor epidural analgesia have prioritized pain relief without motor blockade. Vaginismus increases the risk of requiring instrumentation, or cesarean delivery, as well as perineal and vaginal trauma. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Early epidural analgesia with some degree of motor blockade can be a valid approach in the management of the laboring woman with vaginismus, facilitating vaginal delivery, reducing complications, and ensuring patient satisfaction.",

This chapter reviews the evidence for the safety of sexual activity in low- and high-risk pregnancies and establishes the validity of recommendations of abstinence in different clinical scenarios. The main concern regarding sexual intercourse is its ability to cause uterine contractions that could possibly result in premature labor or endanger a pregnancy complicated by placental pathologies. In light of the existing evidence, which is limited in amount and quality, it seems that coitus does not produce contractions powerful enough to precipitate labor, either in women who are at increased risk for preterm labor or in those who are not. Another significant concern is the possibility that sexual intercourse may trigger migration of pathogens to the cervix and cause an ascending infection and chorioamnionitis, especially in the setting of premature rupture of the membranes, and some studies indeed support this hypothesis; however, they were conducted decades ago, and their quality is low. It is clear that there is insufficient high-quality research to establish proper evidence-based guidelines for women who wish to receive medical advisement regarding sexual activity. However, when examining the existing literature and taking into consideration that coitus is part of every couple’s healthy and normal lifestyle, it seems that overall engaging in sexual activity during pregnancy is safe. In selected cases of high-risk pregnancies, recommendations should be tailored individually according to the parturient’s obstetric history.",

If a girl does not feel clinical improvement within 3-6 months of empiric treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, secondary dysmenorrhea should be kept in mind and exploration of the cause of secondary dysmenorrhea should be done. Our objective was to review the current knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of dysmenorrhea and to summarize the approach in the diagnosis and management in specific adolescent groups. We selected adolescents as their psychosomatic factors like anxiety, tension adversely influence their pain threshold. We reviewed the recent article written on dysmenorrhea, which has been published in different medical literature. At the same time, different guidelines and treatment protocols have been reviewed. Adolescents are more vulnerable to dysmenorrhea. They are suffering mostly from primary dysmenorrhea, but pelvic pathology should be kept in mind, especially endometriosis and Mullerian abnormalities. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral contraceptive pills (OCP) are the first-line treatment. Special emphasis should be given to improving their mental strength.

      "title": "The Epidemiology and Social Impact of Premenstrual Symptoms",
      "abstract": "This review of premenstrual syndrome covers the definition of PMS, its prevalence, its \"natural history\" or age of onset, triggering factors, course over the lifespan, associated physical or emotional problems, the effects of hysterectomy and oophorectomy; its risk factors: age, parity, menstrual cycle changes, oral contraceptive use, toxemia of pregnancy; and functional impairment and treatment seeking behavior. To define PMS it is important to note that the term means negative symptoms occurring in the late luteal phase, as opposed to any cycling phenomena, or those pathologic processes that may be exacerbated premenstrually. Studies from many countries generally find that while the majority of women have premenstrual complaints, less that 10% have symptoms severe enough to be labeled PMS. Several classification schemes have been proposed to categorize PMS symptoms, pointing to possibly more than 1 entity. PMS can superimpose over other disorders, such as affective disorder, thus \"secondary PMS.\" Pms usually begins with menarche, but more women seek treatment in their 30s. It may vary in intensity, but does not resolve spontaneously, and may fade with pregnancy, oral contraception, menopause or inhibition of ovulation. Data are conflicting on whether hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy cure PMS. Symptom distribution varies with age. Symptoms may correlate with parity. Irregular menses or heavy flow may exacerbate symptoms, and those with toxemia of pregnancy may have more severe PMS. Much research has focused on association of PMS with suicide, psychiatric hospitalization, criminal activity, work performance and accidents.",

      "abstract": "For termination of a pregnancy up until the 12th week, the method of choice is suction curettage. The dilation of the cervical canal is made easier and sometimes the embryo is aborted if a viscid preparation containing Prostaglandin F 22 is injected intracervically 12 hours prior to the scheduled procedure. For termination of pregnancy after the 14th week, prostaglandin is superior to all other methods. It can be used intraamnially, extra-amnially or intravenously. Not enough information and experience is available in Europe regarding the intravaginal application.For premature termination of pregnancy up to 12 weeks, suction curettage is the preferred method of treatment. Dilation may be performed by using Hegar pins, metreurynter, or a vibrodilatator. To avoid cervicorrhexis a new mehtod called ''softening'' or ''priming'' facilitates dilatation of the cervical canal. A viscid preparation containing Prostaglandin F22 is injected intracervically 12 hours before the operation. In almost 1/4 of the cases the embryo is aborted.For termination of pregnancy after the 14th week, prostaglandin is superior to all other methods. Intraamnial administration of Miniprostin F 22 is preferred because of the success rate, low risk, and tolerable side effect factor. In rare incidences when this method fails, extraamnial or even iv doses may be given. Intravaginal administration may result in less infection, but in Europe this method has, evidently, not been tested.",

In a sample of 200 women treated for neurotic disorders, about 60% reported such contractions or pulsations. In a sample of 100 female health professionals and counselors, contractions were reported in 80%. Contractions seem to frequently accompany subjective experience of female orgasm, but are not its necessary condition.

Here, we discuss five possible mechanistic interpretations of the observed associations; first, the associations may be non-causal because they result from the confounding effect of genetic variants or of other risk factors; second, the associations may be mediated by an abrupt reduction in levels of circulating estrogen; third, the associations may be mediated by an abrupt reduction in levels of circulating progesterone or testosterone; fourth, the associations may be mediated by an increased release of gonadotropins by the pituitary gland; and fifth, genetic variants may modify the hormonal effects of bilateral oophorectomy through simple or more complex interactions. Results from other studies are cited as evidence for or against each possible mechanism. These putative causal mechanisms are probably intertwined, and their clarification is a research priority.",

      "title": "AB029. Meeting sexual health requirements in menopause",
      "abstract": "Many underlying psycho-physiological complexities can alter the normal manifestation of sexual responses in women. While these factors may be hormonal changes associated with pregnancy or lactation, medical or surgical debilitating illnesses, relationship issues or socio-cultural and environmental factors, a major hallmark along the life stages is menopause per se. The transition from reproductively active period to menopause is the key to a variety of physiological, psychological, functional and relationship adjustments and associated sexual difficulties. Particularly, the rapid hormonal descent during menopause appears to be the basis for personal distress in approximately 50% of women presenting with female sexual dysfunction (FSD) in their late fifties and beyond. Abrupt oestrogen decline in the postmenopausal period can lead to vaginal epithelial atrophy, dryness and pain in addition to negative impacts on sexual response and satisfaction. For this reason, surgical menopause is even more likely to precipitate FSD than a natural menopause. The interventional approaches require to be appropriately tailored to reduce the hormonal loss and level of personal distress in women going through this inevitable life-time adjustment. Although emotional, social and cultural taboos or boundaries may exert a significant impact on how Asian women react to sexuality in aging, a multitude of other factors warranting clinical attention is likely to co-exist in these older women. Therefore, integrating counseling and therapy with respective medical interventions for the predisposing and/or co-morbid conditions would optimize clinical outcomes for both the patient and her partner. Renewed emphasis through DSM V classification envisages a pro-active approach so that these women will continue to lead a healthy and fulfilling life, well beyond menopause. Therapeutic intervention classically uses hormonal treatment - estrogen as the mainstay and although evidence-based therapeutic relief with testosterone (in desire or interest disorders) is demonstrable, it remains non-FDA approved. Promising drugs include Flibanserin for efficacy in hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in view of its preferential affinity for serotonin 5-HT (1A agonist and 2A antagonist) and dopamine D receptors and the new SERM, Ospemifene, which is FDA approved for dyspareunia and in the clinical management of genitourinary syndrome of menopause. While the future promises pharmaco-therapeutic advancements through several drugs in pipeline, it is imperative to ensure that the concomitant psychosocial or cultural limitations are also holistically addressed.",

      "abstract": "Unintended pregnancy can result in anxiety. The risk of anxiety is increased if there is a bad obstetric history. Furthermore, severe anxiety may put the mother at risk of terminating the pregnancy. A 38-year-old female presented to the Obstetrics Clinic planning to discontinue her pregnancy. This pregnancy was unwanted because the patient was traumatized by the bad history of previous pregnancies, and the patient was anxious about her future condition, especially since she was suffering from heart disease. The patient was referred to psychiatry and diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. She was treated with pharmacological as well as non-pharmacological therapies, and agreed to keep the pregnancy. A history of loss in a previous pregnancy has a significant impact on a woman's psychology, resulting in continued worry about their ability to carry the pregnancy to term. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive worry that is difficult to control. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are safe medications for anxiety disorders in pregnancy. In addition, cognitive behavioral therapy is proven to be a first-line non-pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders. Generalized anxiety disorders can occur in anyone including women with unintended pregnancy who also have a poor obstetric history. Anxiety disorders in pregnant women can be treated with pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy. ABSTRAKKehamilan tidak diinginkan dapat berdampak pada kecemasan. Risiko kecemasan pun meningkat jika ada riwayat obstetri buruk. Lebih lanjut, kecemasan yang parah dapat memunculkan risiko ibu memutuskan mengakhiri kehamilannya. Perempuan, 38 tahun, datang ke Poli Obstetri karena berencana tidak melanjutkan kehamilannya. Kehamilan ini tidak diinginkan karena pasien trauma akan riwayat buruk kehamilan-kehamilan sebelumnya, dan pasien cemas akan kondisinya nanti, apalagi sedang menderita sakit jantung. Pasien dikonsulkan ke psikiatri dan didiagnosis dengan gangguan cemas menyeluruh. Pasien diberi terapi farmakologis serta nonfarmakologis, termasuk terapi kognitif perilaku, dan kemudian pasien bersedia untuk mempertahankan kehamilannya. Riwayat kehilangan pada kehamilan sebelumnya berdampak signifikan pada psikologis wanita, sehingga akan terus mengkhawatirkan kemampuan mereka membawa kehamilan ke persalinan. Gangguan cemas menyeluruh ditandai dengan kekhawatiran berlebihan yang sulit dikendalikan. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) merupakan obat untuk gangguan kecemasan yang aman pada kehamilan. Selain itu, terapi kognitif perilaku terbukti sebagai nonfarmakoterapi lini pertama untuk gangguan kecemasan. Gangguan cemas menyeluruh dapat terjadi pada siapa saja termasuk pada wanita dengan kehamilan tidak diinginkan yang juga memiliki riwayat obstetri buruk. Gangguan cemas pada ibu hamil dapat ditangani dengan pemberian farmakoterapi dan nonfarmakoterapi.",

Intrapartum uterine contractions reduce uteroplacental perfusion. In a healthy, well-grown, term fetus, no significant hypoxia or damage results from these contractions. FHR decelerations refer to a parasympathetic-mediated chemoreflex of the cardiovascular system in response to a brief period of fetal oxygen deprivation. The current intrapartum electronic FHR monitoring technology lacks sufficient sensitivity to detect placental inflammation or fetal systemic inflammatory response or to predict neonatal sepsis. Increased values of umbilical artery resistance indices are associated with pathological FHR patterns and adverse neonatal outcomes.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. . The females of the tropical Bruchid Bruchidius atrolineatus (Pic) (Coleoptera) produce a sex pheromone that influences male behaviour. This pheromone, tested on males in an olfactometer, triggers characteristic antennal movements followed by a distinct chemo‐anemotaxis. Sex pheromone production depends on the age of the females and is partly correlated with their ovarian activity. Females 0–24 h old are not attractive, but they begin to attract males on the second day of adult life. Vitellogenesis seems to correlate with the emission or the production of the pheromone but there is no precise synchrony between the two phenomena which are probably induced by the same endocrine factors. Within 1 h after mating there is a decrease in the females' attractiveness, which lasts at least 48 h. Under our experimental conditions no particular rhythm of production or emission of the sex pheromone in B. atrolineatus could be observed.",

      "abstract": "La endometriosis es la causa más común de dolor pélvico crónico femenino. A pesar del tratamiento médico, muchas mujeres no logran controlar el dolor, con la consecuencia de restricciones más o menos graves en la vida laboral, social, familiar, de pareja y sexual. En América Latina y específicamente en idioma español hay escasa información sobre las relaciones de la endometriosis con factores psicológicos que se encuentran enmarcados dentro de esta enfermedad. Por este motivo, el objetivo de este estudio es analizar esta patología estrógeno-dependiente y su asociación con diferentes aspectos psicológicos, así como su abordaje terapéutico. Para esto se realizó una búsqueda sistemática en base s de datos. Los resultados indican que la endometriosis es una enfermedad que genera como sintomatología, dolor crónico, el cual afecta de manera negativa la calidad de vida, relaciones de pareja, fertilidad, y estado emocional, generando ansiedad y depresión entre otros trastornos psiquiátricos. Los anteriores factores influyen de la misma forma, de manera negativa en la percepción del dolor, aumentando el ciclo. Debido a esto se concluye que el tratamiento psicológico podría ser un apoyo necesario para las mujeres que padecen endometriosis, en donde el manejo de dolor y los mecanismos de afrontamiento, deben ser los objetivos principales en el plan terapéutico.",

      "abstract": "The changes in menstrual cycles that lead to menopause begin with alterations in estrogen and progesterone which decrease in concentration, and the aging ovaries' ability to produce eggs. Inhibin is a hormone produced by ovarian cells and when its levels fall as the ovaries' ability to produce hormone is diminished, it provides feedback to the pituitary to regulate follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and may be responsible for the increase in FSH seen in menopause. The most classic symptom associated with menopause or perimenopause is the hot flash or flush. Estrogen is important in maintaining vaginal lubrication, and following menopause, loss of tissue strength and lubrication can lead to burning, itching, bleeding, and even painful intercourse. Women who stay on estrogen from the menopausal years and beyond maintain the bone density they had at the time they began therapy, as estrogen is an anti-resoptive agent. Women who enjoyed their sex lives prior to menopause continue to enjoy and maintain their sexuality.",

      "abstract": "AbstractAbstractWomen who have lost children to perinatal complications, are subjected to pain and grief continuously; however their agony increases on remembrance days such as birthdate, or on Mother's Day. Fathers, siblings and grandparents suffer too.Common disorders of pregnancy, such as pregnancy -induced hypertension (PIH), or the more serious pre-eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, or eclampsia, can lead to devastating effects such as miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death; or at the very least, a sick infant. With many of these consequences, the loss of the dreams, hopes and plans that parents have made is imminent.The investigation of the psychosocial aspects of 'high-risk' pregnancy has never been fully addressed. However, the threat of loss, or the actual experience, may provoke the onset of a potential psychological crisis during the perinatal period, therefore, it is important that these issues be addressed by the nurse in order to aid the development of coping mechanisms to enable women and their families to deal with what may happen. This may be done by predicting the stages of the bereavement process experienced by these women and their family meembers, as outlined in the Kubler-Ross model of bereavement (1969), which is indicative of many types of grief reactions.Other issues including the restriction in activity, uncertainty of pregnancy outcomes, disruption in work or career activities, financial strains, and reduced labour and birthing options, become concerns for high-risk pregnant women. The way women deal with these issues and the pathways nurses can take to help these women develop effective coping strategies, will be addressed also.Key words: psychosocialbereavementpregnancy-Induced hypertensionhigh-risk pregnancygriefpowerlessness",

The purpose of this paper is to discuss about the causes, impact, and management of recurrent miscarriage by using the transactional model of stress. The exact cause of miscarriage is unknown; but, increased anticardiolipin antibodies, increased maternal age translocation of parental chromosomes, anatomical variation such as septate uterus, and presence of genital tract infections can lead to miscarriage. It is a stressful event; and, women respond to it in a variety of ways. Some woman may end up in having altered marital relationships, and others may suffer from psychological problems such as sadness, anger, guilt, anxiety, and lack of interest. Thus, this puts the burden on the health care providers to identify and address medical and psychological issues; and encourage for follow-up counseling that is required to minimize discomfort and enhance coping strategies for living a happy life.",

      "abstract": "Female wild black rhinoceroses in Zimbabwe were monitored non-invasively using faecal progesterone metabolite analysis and observation of reproductive behaviour. A postpartum period of reproductive inactivity of at least 4 months, followed by a period of 4-7 months of oestrous cyclicity, was detected in six multiparous females. Three-quarters of the oestrous cycles (n = 21) had a total duration (mean +/- SEM) of 26.8 +/- 1 days. Other types of cycle were characterized either by an extended luteal phase, lasting on average twice as long as the normal cycle, or by an extended follicular phase. These extended cycles may have resulted from early embryo loss and heat stress. Female rhinoceroses did not conceive before 8 months after giving birth and some females (n = 2) most likely aborted after 3.0-3.5 months of gestation. The detected period of cyclic oestrus occurred between May and March in females (n = 9), and there was a 3 month extended interoestrous interval in nulliparous females during the period of decreasing daylengths that can be presumed to be the period of poorest fertility for the black rhinoceros under tropical latitudes. In contrast, the period of optimum fertility in the Southern hemisphere coincided with the late spring and early summer, and corresponded to the early rainy season. As a result, a higher incidence of births was detected in the late rainy season, providing the lactating female with the most suitable environment in terms of nutritional requirements.",

Amnionitis is polymicrobial infection and commonly involves bacteria that are part of the normal vaginal flora. In term patients, amnionitis seems to occur more as a consequence of multiple risk factors such as prolonged rupture of membranes or multiple vaginal examinations. The diagnosis of amnionitis is typically clinical and made based upon the presence of maternal fever and one of the following additional criteria: maternal tachycardia, fetal tachycardia, uterine tenderness, leukocytosis or foul-smelling vaginal discharge. Once the diagnosis of amnionitis is made either clinically or by amniocentesis, preparations for delivery should be undertaken.

      "abstract": "Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common problem among women. Pregnancy and labor are the major risk factors for UI among young and middle‐aged women. In some studies, the presence of incontinence before and during pregnancy has been shown to be an independent risk factor for urinary and anal incontinence after delivery and beyond. Recently, the need and consequences of many routine interventions applied during each delivery are questioned on an evidence‐based basis. Episiotomy and interventions (forceps, fundal pressure) at the second phase of delivery result in pelvic floor injury by perineal trauma. Similar interventions during delivery pose a risk for urinary and fecal incontinence. Therefore, episiotomy should be avoided as much as possible during delivery, and spontaneous and non‐interventional labor opportunities should be created. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is often advised as a conservative management method in UI during pregnancy. Investigations suggest that women with stress, urge or mixed UI should be advised to perform PFMT that is part of the conservative management program. There is some evidence in primiparous women that PFMT may prevent UI on the late weeks of pregnancy and the postpartum period. When postpartum pelvic floor exercises are applied along with feedback, they induce a decrease in postpartum incontinence. Furthermore, motivation and the initiative in reminding women regarding kegel exercises were not found to be effective in the postpartum prevention of UI. Postpartum pelvic floor exercises were not found to be consistent with decreased incidence of fecal incontinence. Multidisciplinary approaches are needed to inform women about the risk of postpartum UI.",

Rasa nyeri ini timbul akibat ketidak seimbangan hormon progesterone sehingga menyebabkan kram perut bagian bawah bahkan bisa menyebar sampai ke pinggang. Hal ini dapat memperparah jika nyeri haid atau dismenore disertai dengan mual, muntah, sakit kepala, stres, depresi, cemas berlebihan, dan keadaan sedih yang berlebihan. Maka dari itu, banyak upaya dilakukan untuk mengurangi keluhan nyeri haid atau dismenore tersebut salah satunya dengan mengkonsumsi air kelapa hijau sebagai obat herbal untuk mengurangi rasa nyeri haid tersebut. air kelapa hijau mengandung kalsium 14,11 Mg/100 ml, magnesium 9,11 Mg/100 ml dan vitamin c. Kalsium dan magnesium yang terkandung dalam air kelapa hijau dapat mengurangi ketegangan ototserta kandungan vitamin c yang merupakan zat-zat alami anti inflamasi yang membantu meringankan rasa sakit akibat kram menstruasi.

      "abstract": "Menopause is an essential phase of women’s life. Essentially, human female experiences different phases pertaining to the reproductive system and hormonal status these phases are prominently as follows. Childhood phases (0 to 12 year) menstrual phase (12 to 45±4 years) menopausal face (45 to 50±years) and post menopause (50 to till end of her life). Menopause is complete cessation of menstrual cycle at least for a year. Menopausal phase causes many hormonal, physical, physiological, emotional and psychological changes in humans female. These changes are prominent in the reproductive system and hormonal profile. Menopausal state of women indicates the end of her reproductive period with other associated changes. Majority of women get disturbed physiologically, emotionally and psychologically. Menopausal woman develops the feeling of end of her sexual life and women hood. This paper reviews the state and perception of menopause, misconception regarding end of sexual life, better management of menopausal state and how menopause could be new the beginning of happier life physically, mentally, physiologically and sexually.",

      "title": "Pattern of electrical activity of the ovine uterus and cervix from mating to parturition",
      "abstract": "Summary. The electrical activity of the uterus, greater curvature and lesser curvature, and of the cervix were recorded throughout several oestrous cycles, matings and the entire course of pregnancy in a set of ewes. In cyclic ewes, all electrode sites were active during the periovulatory period, but during the luteal phase only the cervix and lesser curvature continued to present regular activity, i.e. episodes of 6–8 min duration. Matings failed to disrupt the oestrous activity pattern in 5 out of 6 ewes. During the subsequent pregnancy in 4 ewes, activity, when present, consisted of the cyclic occurrence of regular activity episodes in the gravid horn(s) (greater curvature) and in the cervix (and lesser curvature in 1 ewe). Three phases were recognized on the basis of the activity of the greater curvature of the gravid horn(s). The first phase corresponded to quiescence of the horn from Day 5 (Day 0 = mating) to about Day 41. The second phase was marked by the sudden onset of regular activity of the uterus; frequency rapidly increased and maximal values were reached around Day 49, after which frequency progressively decreased until around Day 66. The third phase was characterized by a steady state in genital tract activity until the peripartum period. The cervix and lesser curvature activity followed an almost similar development of regular activity episodes with only slight time differences.",

      "abstract": "IN THE domestic hen 24–26 hours elapse between the time when an ovum first enters the oviduct and the time the completed egg is expelled from the uterus. During this stay, the egg remains in the uterus or shell gland 18 to 20 hours where it acquires the hard shell. When formation of the hard shell is completed, uterine contractions set in which lead to the eventual expulsion of the egg. Little is known about the factors which determine the length of time the egg is gestated in the uterus and those which determine the moment for its expulsion. It remains to be seen whether these factors are similar or even comparable to those which initiate the birth of the uterine contents in mammals. Among the factors implicated in the initiation of parturition in mammals are the hormones from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. Interference with the posterior lobe has been found to result in abnormal or delayed parturition in some mammals while in others no effects were noticed",

The literature review was completed by making use of Pub med, Google Scholar, and Medscape. The prevalence of uterine prolapse was found to be in the range of 10?40%. The grass root causes of UP in Nepal are poverty, illiteracy and male dominated social structure. These causes gender based discrimination, inaccessibility to health services, poor nutrition, early marriage, early pregnancy, multi parity in the need of son, work load during pregnancy and postnatal period, domestic violence, home deliveries, lack of awareness about UP, shyness to explain about reproductive health related problems which in turn leads to uterine prolapse. Women suffering from UP start experiencing a variety of physical symptoms like back ache, difficulty in standing, sitting and walking, difficulty in lifting, vaginal foul smelling discharge/ itching, sore or ulcer in protrusion of tissue, painful intercourse, burning micturition, urinary incontinence, difficulty in passing stool, etc. The psycho?social dimension of life is also affected by having UP. These symptoms affects almost every aspect of women’s daily living hence creating role limitation, physical limitations, social limitations, personal limitations and also psychology of sufferer. All of these finally have direct impact on the quality of life of the women.",

The size of the problem is difficult to assess, although the number of infanticides (neonaticides) has fallen in some jurisdictions, as has the number of maternal fatalities attributable to criminal abortion, probably for similar reasons.1 Nevertheless, abandoned fetuses and infants are still discovered in a variety of circumstances.

The abnormalities included amputation of peripheral limb structures, open neural folds, exencephaly, blisters, head, face, and tail malformation, and generalized growth retardation. The hypothesis that the teratogenic and other effects were consequences of prolonged prenatal stress induced by the experimental conditions is supported by the observation that both procedures led in a short time to significant increases in mean maternal adrenal weight.",

      "title": "Incidence, Diagnosis, and Management of Proctological Conditions During Pregnancy",
      "abstract": "Background Proctological diseases are highly prevalent during pregnancy, with reported incidence rates ranging from 45% to 68%. The true prevalence is likely higher due to underreporting. These conditions frequently persist into the postpartum period, causing significant discomfort and emotional distress. Physiological changes in the maternal body—including hormonal, metabolic, immunological, and cardiovascular alterations—play a central role in the development of these disorders. The enlargement of the uterus, increased blood volume, and elevated pressure in the pelvic veins contribute to venous stasis in the hemorrhoidal plexus, thereby predisposing pregnant individuals to symptomatic hemorrhoids and perianal thromboses. Summary The most frequently reported symptoms are anal pain and constipation. Anal pain, which is often intense, is commonly associated with constipation and is due to the high density of sensory nerve endings in the anal canal. Constipation affects more than 60% of pregnant women, primarily as a result of hormonal changes, decreased physical activity, and iron supplementation. Straining during defecation further aggravates proctological conditions, facilitating the development of hemorrhoids, anal fissures, and perianal thrombosis. Diagnosis should include a thorough medical history, physical examination, and proctoscopy. In selected cases, additional imaging may be warranted. Conservative treatment is the mainstay of management, with a focus on symptom control and regulation of bowel habits. Hemorrhoidal disease is particularly common during pregnancy. Conservative treatment includes increased fluid intake, the use of stool softeners, and local cooling measures. Surgical interventions should be reserved for refractory cases and only considered when absolutely necessary. Anal fissures, the second most prevalent condition after hemorrhoids, are primarily caused by constipation. First-line treatment involves stool regulation, analgesic therapy, and the application of topical ointments. While chronic fissures may occasionally require surgical intervention, non-invasive approaches are strongly preferred to minimize risks. Perianal thrombosis, often misdiagnosed as thrombosed external hemorrhoids, typically occurs in the third trimester or shortly after delivery. Conservative therapy is generally effective, focusing on pain control. In selected cases, surgical excision of thrombosed nodules may be indicated. Key Messages In summary, proctological conditions during pregnancy are common but usually manageable through accurate diagnosis, conservative treatment, and empathetic patient support. Prioritizing symptom relief and avoiding unnecessary surgical interventions are essential to achieving favorable outcomes.",

Een belangrijke negatieve factor op de tevredenheid is de postoperatieve penislengte. Door de oorzaak en de duur van de ED is deze door fibrose van de corpora meestal verkort. Ook is er in principe geen lengtetoename van de penis mogelijk bij oppompen van de prothese. Een belangrijke positieve factor voor de tevredenheid van de behandeling is een betrokken partner. Een uitdaging is – behalve de medische indicatiestelling – de psychoseksuele en relationele counseling en het managen van verwachtingen. Dit vraagt om samenwerking met een seksuoloog.

In most cases, prenatally detected hydronephrosis is a mild and/or transient ultrasound finding. The sensitivity and specificity of prenatal ultrasonography for the detection of congenital anomalies depends on many factors including maternal obesity, fetal position, sonographic equipment, and experience of the person performing the scan. Most of the serious, potentially lethal genitourinary anomalies, such as posterior urethral valves and bilateral renal agenesis are detected in the trimester. Mild prenatally detected hydronephrosis is usually an innocent ultrasound finding which represents a transient physiologic state of no clinical significance. Prenatally detected hydronephrosis is a nonspecific finding and, where appropriate, further imaging investigations are required to establish the urological diagnosis. Postnatal diagnostic imaging always begins with a renal and bladder ultrasound. Ureteroceles may be detected prenatally and are characterized by appearances of a thin septum or thin walled cystic structure within the bladder.",

      "title": "Some Placental Considerations Related to Neurodevelopmental and Other Disorders",
      "abstract": "Many newborns who appear normal at birth later manifest substantial neurologic and other disease. Pathologists are able to explain some of that sad enigma. Placental pathology frequently reveals the pathogenesis of cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and other neurodevelopmental disorders. This requires recognition of gross placental abnormalities and insightful light microscopic examination. Chorioamnionitis is now proven to be the major cause of premature onset of labor and prematurity. There is important need for investigation of pathogenetic processes associated with ascending intrauterine infection. Major complications therein include bacterially mediated fetal hypoperfusion resulting from placental and umbilical vasocontraction. Placentas of 10% of newborns have villitis of unknown etiology. The importance of villitis is incompletely known. The fetus may discharge meconium on more than one occasion, particularly so when the fetus is postmature. Clinicians may not recognize that fetal discharge has occurred if the event occurred 4 days or more prior to delivery. Intra-amniotic meconium associated with oligohydramnios probably causes placental and umbilical vasocontraction. Meconium probably thus contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary vasoconstriction, persistent fetal circulation, necrotizing enterocolitis, and damage of the fetal brain, liver, and kidneys. Fetal hypoxia and asphyxia may be acutely or chronically acquired. Major placental lesions associated with neonatal asphyxia include chronic ischemic change, nucleated red blood cells, intravillous hemorrhages, intimal vascular fibrin cushions, meconium staining, and intervillous fibrin.

However, a desire to extend the life of the cow so that a calf can be reared or a lactation completed, or simply to add condition prior to sale often justifies attempts at surgical correction as well. Most injures to the uterus are iatrogenic and occur during efforts to relieve dystocia. Examination may reveal a distal uterine tear which is likely the result of a spontaneous tear or, of course, an injury similar to the iatrogenic injuries. Tearing of the vulva, vagina, and cervix occurs almost exclusively during dystocia. Tearing and bruising can often occur during parturition in the absence of obstetric intervention; however, injury to these structures typically occurs during obstetric management of dystocia. Also termed third-degree perineal laceration, a rectovaginal tear exclusively occurs as a sequela to dystocia.",

As RU-486 poses no religious or moral issue in patients who are not pregnant, have no intention of getting pregnant, or are incapable of pregnancy, it may be concluded that the drug ban self-imposed by Hoechst-Roussel because of the issue of abortion and contraception should be lifted from studies of its medical application. RU-486 ([11β(4-dimethyl-amino phenyl)]17β hydroxy[17α prop-1-ynyl]estra-4,9-dien-3-one), or mifepristone (originally named RU38486), is best known as an antiprogestin abortifacient or contraceptive,<sup>1-3</sup>but its clinical potential extends beyond this.

Such bleeding may be secondary to a wide array of specific underlying problems, but in many cases a diagnosis of dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is ultimately made. The term DUB refers to abnormal uterine bleeding that is not a consequence of structural or systemic disease. Usually DUB is related to anovulatory menstrual cycles, a condition specifically referred to here as anovulatory DUB. Women with ovulatory cycles may also have DUB, specifically referred to here as ovulatory DUB. Other terms used to describe abnormal bleeding patterns include oligomenorrhea and polymenorrhea, traditionally used to designate patterns of bleeding episodes with intervals greater than 35 and less than 24 days, respectively. The term menorrhagia refers to episodes of excessive flow and/or duration occurring at regular normal intervals, and metrorrhagia to such episodes occurring at irregular intervals. Still another term, used increasingly in recent years, is heavy menstrual bleeding, and is generally used to describe abnormal uterine bleeding on the basis of either anovulatory or ovulatory DUB.",

      "title": "Pregnancy-Related Pelvic Pain: A Neglected Field in Developing Countries",
      "abstract": "Inadequate access to antenatal care is still a major concern in many developing countries, and reducing pregnancy-related mortality is the main goal of national and international organizations of maternal health (1, 2). Despite the significant gap to reach the millennium development goal 5 (MDG5) to put an end to all the preventable causes of maternal deaths, the importance of other apparently benign pregnancy-related disorders should not be underestimated (3). In other words, besides considering the warning signs of major causes of maternal morbidity and mortality during the antenatal visits, including hemorrhagic or hypertensive disorders, some other measures should be taken to make the gestational and puerperal period as tolerable and satisfying as possible both for mother and her family, especially in the developing countries (3, 4). Nearly, half of the pregnant females experience pelvic girdle pain (PGP), at least to some extent (5). Although this musculoskeletal pain within the pelvic area is not harmful to females or their fetuses, it is indeed disabling interferes with their motherhood, familial relationships and their profession (5, 6).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, among the discomforts experienced by females during pregnancy, musculoskeletal complaints like PGP are not taken serious by the majority of clinicians. In a study by Pierce et al. the mean pain intensity score reported for low back or pelvic girdle pain was six out of ten and in 80% of females these rate had negative impact on their lifestyles (7). In another study by Malmqvist et al. PGP was the main cause of sick leave in Norwegian pregnant females with a mean duration of 11 weeks (8). In the same study, the principal reason not to take a leave from work was the subjects’ higher educational level besides job satisfaction and not to perceive less pain, which actually did exist (8). The pain which tends to begin as early as 18 weeks of pregnancy may persist in the postpartum period for as long as 15 months (9, 10).\r\n\r\nA number of mechanical and hormonal factors are blamed for the development of this disorder: 1) the increasing load of the gravid uterus on spine and pelvis, 2) softening of the pubic symphysis, 3) laxity of the pelvic ligaments and 4) shifting of the uterus and a change in the pelvic orientation, which result in pelvic instability (10-13).\r\n\r\nFemales may have a wide range of complaints. Simply, everyday activities like getting up, turning over in bed, sitting down or walking may become painful (14, 15). The most common pain characteristics reported were dull, stabbing or cutting pain types within the pelvic area radiating to back or thighs (15). Many other aspects of a females’ life can also be greatly deteriorated (14-16). With regard to the pain management, no single medical treatment has proved to be effective till now (14-18). While, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are contraindicated in the third trimester of pregnancy and opioids are not considered safe, paracetamol is not associated with satisfactory results (14). Opioids are not generally considered harmless; however, tramadol, with weaker tendency for opioid receptors, is safely used during pregnancy without maternal or neonatal toxicity (19). Combined treatment of opioids with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist like ketamine seems to have better analgesic effects; though, not proved by all studies (20). Compartment block with local anesthetics is another modality to decrease opioid consumption; nonetheless, its efficacy is not established yet (16, 21). Other proposed interventions include using pelvic belts, regular exercise, physical therapy, transcutaneous nerve stimulation and acupuncture which are costly and not everyone can afford especially in the developing countries. Therefore, what seems to be practical and cost-benefit, at least at the present time, is the role of appropriate support and adequate education from health care providers to recognize the risk factors and the ways to minimize the symptoms (16). Since there seems to be a lack of knowledge and awareness about the existence of such a disability among the caregivers themselves, further investigation is required in this field (6, 16). According to recent studies, physical exercise could have alleviating effects (17, 18). However, in a systematic review by Gutke et al. among different treatment modalities for lumbopelvic pain during pregnancy, it was reported that acupuncture and pelvic belts had the strongest effect and exercise had a weak effect (22).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it can be stated that pregnancy-related chronic pains, including pelvic girdle pain, are really disabling throughout many females’ lives, though not detrimental. While there are still many gaps in detection and appropriate management of this disorder, PGP should be considered as a major health concern in the society which deserves much more attention and support.",

      "abstract": "In Brief Stress urinary incontinence, the complaint of involuntary leakage during effort or exertion, occurs at least weekly in one third of adult women. The basic evaluation of women with stress urinary incontinence includes a history, physical examination, cough stress test, voiding diary, postvoid residual urine volume, and urinalysis. Formal urodynamics testing may help guide clinical care, but whether urodynamics improves or predicts the outcome of incontinence treatment is not yet clear. The distinction between urodynamic stress incontinence associated with hypermobility and urodynamic stress incontinence associated with intrinsic sphincter deficiency should be viewed as a continuum, rather than a dichotomy, of urethral function. Initial treatment should include behavioral changes and pelvic floor muscle training. Estrogen is not indicated to treat stress urinary incontinence. Bladder training, vaginal devices, and urethral inserts also may reduce stress incontinence. Bulking agents reduce leakage, but effectiveness generally decreases after 1–2 years. Surgical procedures are more likely to cure stress urinary incontinence than nonsurgical procedures but are associated with more adverse events. Based on available evidence at this time, colposuspension (such as Burch) and pubovaginal sling (including the newer midurethral synthetic slings) are the most effective surgical treatments. Stress urinary incontinence affects one third of adult women and is usually reduced or eliminated with either nonsurgical or surgical therapy.",

As a result the entire abdominal “corset” will be weakened with very little apparent mechanical support. In addition to this there will be increased elasticity of ligament and the back will be more vulnerable to injury resulting from incorrect use.\r\nAs a result of overstretched and weak abdominal muscle the patient experience difficulty in initiating micturition and inability to control bladder when she desires to void become apparent there is a leakage when the intraabdominal pressure is raised by coughing, sneezing and laughing.

To evaluate the effectiveness of abdominal strengthening exercise in\r\nworking women following normal delivery.\r\n3. To determine changes after abdominal muscle training attending the\r\nprogramme in working women following normal delivery.\r\nMETHODOLOGY:\r\nThe study is experimental in nature. 20 samples are taken. Pretest\r\nmeasurement is taken for abdominal muscle strength using dynamic\r\nabdominal endurance scale. After which the abdominal strengthening\r\nexercise was given to the patient. After that posttest measurement is taken in\r\na similar fashion in a set of pretest measurement.\r\nSetting of the Study: The study was conducted in postnatal wards in Parkkavan Hospital, Trichy.\r\nPopulation Sample: The samples that fulfill the selection criteria were the population for the study.\r\nSampling Method:\r\nPurposive sampling method was done in post natal wards.\r\nCriteria for Selection:\r\n1. Mothers who are willing to participate.\r\n2. Mothers who had normal delivery with no other medical complications.\r\nInclusion Criteria:\r\n1. Mothers of age between 20- 30 yrs,\r\n2. Normal delivery mother’s,\r\n3. Working mother’s.\r\nExclusion Criteria:\r\n1. Mother’s above the age of 30 yrs,\r\n2. Mother’s with Caesarian section,\r\n3. Mother’s with severe postnatal problems,\r\n4. House wives.\r\nRESULTS:\r\nThis study presented the assessment of effectiveness of\r\nabdominal strengthening exercise program for 20 study samples of working\r\nwoman following normal delivery.\r\nAmong the selected participants most of them found weak\r\nabdominal muscles. Abdominal strengthening program was given to the\r\nparticipants.\r\nThe study carried out had a correlation with the literature\r\nreview. The statistical interpretation of the Mean and Standard Deviation\r\nshows the improvement in abdominal muscle strength. Test statistics for\r\nstrength calculated has been compared with tabulated T-test values. It is\r\nfound that the calculated test statistics (17.44) from the recorded values is\r\nhigher than the tabulated value (2.093). So we rejected the null hypothesis\r\nand accept the hypothesis, saying that there is significant improvement in\r\nstrength following strengthening exercise program for working woman\r\nfollowing normal delivery.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe statistical analysis done from the pretest and posttest\r\nvalues of abdominal endurance test score showed that abdominal\r\nstrengthening exercise program had a significant effect in improving the\r\nabdominal muscle strength for working woman following normal delivery.",

      "title": "Prevention of urinary and anal incontinence: role of elective cesarean delivery",
      "abstract": "Purpose of review Currently, prophylactic elective cesarean to prevent incontinence is being promoted without robust evidence supporting it. This has created confusion among health personnel. Past research centered on defining the damaging effect of vaginal birth on continence whilst the limited research on elective cesarean considered it protective. Cesarean delivery has economic, obstetric, gynecological and psychosocial consequences, but incontinence is not uncommon with a persistent morbidity. There is confusion among health personnel about advocating elective cesarean delivery to prevent incontinence. Reviewing current research would facilitate obstetric thinking. Recent findings Multiplanar endosonography and three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging scanning are reportedly better in delineating structural alterations in the continence mechanism following vaginal birth and could be applied to postcesarean incontinence. Incontinence can follow vaginal or elective cesarean delivery and the severity following either mode is comparable. Urinary incontinence can resolve, persist or start de novo and the primiparous prevalence is similar following cesarean or vaginal birth. Transient anal incontinence can manifest during pregnancy. Paradoxically, pelvic floor strengthening exercises are beneficial for pregnancy-related incontinence, yet urinary incontinence occurs in nulliparas notwithstanding a strong pelvic floor. Summary Improved imaging techniques should promote a better understanding of postcesarean incontinence. Since severe incontinence can occur after elective cesarean, its reportedly preventative role deserves more scrutiny. When incontinence occurs without labor, it is transient or shows exercise-related improvement; the role of elective cesarean delivery seems tenuous and needs careful evaluation. Current evidence does not support the routine use of elective cesarean to prevent incontinence so the delivery mode should continue to be dictated by obstetric considerations.",

This chapter reviews the problems of the old-age gynaecology patient concerning common symptomatology, menopause, hormone replacement therapy, sexuality, and malignancies. From menopause onward, the lower genital tract undergoes atrophic changes with loss of connective tissue elasticity and thinning of the mucosa. Postmenopausal bleeding is defined as any bleeding from the genital tract after 12 months of amenorrhoea. Vaginal discharge is a common gynaecological complaint seen in the elderly. Uterovaginal prolapse is a herniation of the female genital tract. Lichen sclerosus is a chronic skin condition characterised by the thinning of the epithelium with loss of keratin, which frequently extends around the anus. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause describes symptoms of oestrogen deficiency affecting the vulva, vagina, bladder, and urethra. Ovarian cancer remains the most lethal gynaecological malignancy despite trials of many different treatment regimens to try to improve the poor prognosis.",

A further series of experiments showed that similar fetal hemorrhage followed the temporary clamping (45 minutes) of the uterine wall or uterine fat, excluding major uterine vessels; handling the uterus for 5 minutes; and stretching of the uterine blood vessels. A low incidence of fetal hemorrhage was also associated with laparotomy alone, but the fetuses were unaffected by extensive handling of the uterus through the abdominal wall or by intraperitoneal anesthesia. Fetal hemorrhage was also induced by a short episode of severe maternal hyperthermia but not by a high dose of ethanol given by gavage. These results suggest that a range of uterine trauma may result in fetal hemorrhage, perhaps through a common mechanism.",

Emergency contraception (EC) is birth control used to prevent pregnancy after known or suspected failure of contraception or unprotected intercourse, including sexual assault. Women who use EC should be given additional opportunities to consider whether a more permanent or better method of contraception is warranted. Once adolescents have had a sexual experience, they may be even more open to reconsidering abstinence and should be encouraged to consider abstinence as a potential choice. Certain types of condoms provide some protection against sexually transmitted infections. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are hormonal methods of birth control. For most women, pregnancy and/or abortion are associated with a greater risk of mortality and morbidity than oral contraceptives. Male sterilization is the most cost-effective contraceptive method, with a failure rate of 0.1 to 4%. Many circumstances affect a woman's access to contraception.",

      "title": "The Timing of Elective Surgery on the Genitalia of Male Children With Particular Reference to Undescended Testes and Hypospadias",
      "abstract": "Psychologic considerations suggest that the optimal time for elective surgery on the genitalia is either the first 6 months of life or sometime during the fourth year. In the child with cryptorchidism, physiologic considerations are of paramount importance and the timing of treatment should be based on these considerations. Despite the conflicting views on the subject, there is suggestive evidence that early orchiopexy—during the first year of life or soon afterwards—may be the most optimal time for orchiopexy, but further investigation would be necessary to confirm this. Currently, timing of operation is based more on psychologic rather than physiologic factors (although both are taken into account), and should remain unchanged until further evidence accumulates. The Committee feels that the later the orchiopexy after age 6, the more likely germinal epithelial failure will occur. However, it should be pointed out that 5 or 6 has not proven to represent optimal age in respect to germinal function but only the latest recommended age for orchiopexy. In patients with hypospadias, technical considerations have the greatest bearing on timing, but, depending on the individual surgeon, the precise timing varies. The period after the third birthday is preferred by the majority; this certainly is consistent with psychologic considerations unless the correction of chordee justifies a separate cedure, which then should be corrected by age 2.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Warm Compress,Disminorhea. Puberty is a stage of development characterized by the maturity of the sexual organs and achieving the capability to reproduce, in which one of the characteristics of the signs of puberty a woman is the first occurrence of menstruation (menarche). When it happened the first menstruation (menarche) and the next menstruation, a woman will experience abdominal pain (disminorea), when the abdominal pain disorder (disminorea) are not adequately addressed; it can be debilitating to the decrease in performance. Disminorea that occurs continuously in each period, can be one of the symptoms of endometriosis on the reproductive system. One way that can be done to overcome disminorea by performing a warm compress, which is done to meet the needs of a sense of comfort, reduce or relieve pain, reduce or prevent muscle spasms and provide a sense of warmth in the abdomen (stomach). Warm compresses can be done by attaching a rubber bag filled with warm water or a towel that has been soaked in warm water, to the painful body part. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a warm compress against dysmenorrhea pain reduction in eleventh student at SMK Muhammadiyah Watukelir Sukoharjo. This type of research is quasi experiment with one group pretest-posttest design with purposive sampling technique sampling number of 30 respondents.

This is the first case report of successful control of menstrual cycle-related exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and add-back therapy. A 49-year-old premenopausal woman experienced recurrent severe arthritis flares despite aggressive immunotherapy. Her arthritis symptoms started 10 days before her menstruation and spontaneously resolved after the initiation of menstruation. We chose a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist with percutaneous estradiol gel to prevent a hypoestrogenic state and a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system to facilitate uterine protection by estrogen. Thereafter, her symptoms significantly improved without experiencing major flares. In addition, she did not demonstrate any menopausal symptoms. This case highlights that rheumatoid arthritis disease activity may be associated with the menstrual cycle, and hormonal therapy may be beneficial as an adjunct therapy for controlling premenstrual exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis.",

      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhoea is the term used to describe painful menstrual cramps, and is the most commonly encountered gynaecological disorder. It affects more than 50% of women of reproductive age, of which 10% to 12% experience severe dysmenorrhoea that interferes with their daily lives by incapacitating them for 1 to 3 days each month. Dysmenorrhoea is estimated to be the single greatest cause of working hours lost by women and school absence in teenage girls (Dawood 2008; Lindeque 2015: 6-9). Primary dysmenorrhoea is defined as painful, spasmodic cramping in the lower abdomen just before and/or during menstrual bleeding, in the absence of any identifiable macroscopic pathology. It is related to increased levels of inflammatory markers such as vasopressin, prostaglandins (PGF2α) and leukotrienes from the secretory endometrium. These induce ischaemia due to excessive prolonged uterine contractions, increased the sensitivity of pain fibres, and cause vasoconstriction (Iacovides, Avidon and Baker 2015: 1-17; Stewart and Deb 2014: 296-302). This double-blinded randomised study aimed to establish the efficacy of a homoeopathic complex (consisting of Angelica sinensis 6cH, Dioscorea villosa 6cH, Matricaria chamomilla 6cH, Viburnum opulus 6cH and Zingiber officinalis 6cH) compared to a homoeopathic similimum in 30cH plussed potency in the treatment of the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhoea, in terms of the participants’ perception of the treatment. Thirty female students, who signed the inform consent forms (Appendices B and D), from the Durban University of Technology were selected based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria after they underwent an abdominal ultrasound examination (Appendix D) by a gynaecologist. They were randomly divided by means of convenience sampling according to a randomisation sheet into two groups. There were 20 in the experimental group which received the homoeopathic complex, and 10 in the control group which received the homoeopathic similimum. The study took place at the Homoeopathic Day Clinic, located at the Durban University of Technology. It was conducted over a period of three menstrual cycles per participant. The initial consultation took place prior to a menstrual period and the subsequent three follow-ups took place once a month, a week after each menstrual period. During each consultation, a detailed homoeopathic case history was conducted and a physical examination including an abdominal examination was performed. In addition, the participants were required to complete the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (Moos 1968) (Appendix G) and the Pain Rating Scale (British Pain Society 2006) (Appendix H). SPSS version 23.0 software was used to analyse the data collected from these questionnaires. The quantitative variables across the groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test since the captured data was non-parametric. The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare intra-group data. Quantitative variables were expressed as a mean ± standard deviation. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. The intra-group analysis using the PRS and the MDQ scales (Appendices G and H) showed statistically significant changes in the subcategories of pain in the simillimum group, while these changes were noticed in the complex group only with the PRS scale, when different follow up mean pain score was compared to that at baseline. The different comparisons and p-values can be found in the Appendix G1. The homoeopathic complex group showed more statistically significant changes in the subcategories of behaviour change, negative affect, and control (Appendix G1); while the homoeopathic similimum also revealed other statistically significant changes in the autonomic response and appetite change subgroups (Appendix G1). The inter-group analysis did not reveal any statistically significant change between the groups, although a decrease in the majority of the various mean scores was observed throughout the study. The study’s results led to the conclusion that both the homoeopathic complex and homoeopathic similimum were effective (Appendix G1) in the treatment of symptoms of primary dysmenorrhoea during various follow-ups, as well as reducing the need for allopathic pain medications in the participants during the study. However that efficacy shown by the presence of statistically significant results could not been maintained throughout the study from the baseline to the third follow-ups, this could be due to the smaller sample size of the participants, the need for a better suited similimum remedy with a higher potency for the control group; or the need for another complex remedy, It was also noted that there was no evidence that one treatment was more beneficial than the other even though a decrease in the mean scores was observed in both groups.",

      "title": "Study of Factors Associated with Incomplete Bladder Emptying in Older Women",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The study of Park and colleagues1 is important in that they demonstrated higher postvoid residual (PVR) volumes in women with a history of back or pelvic surgery, indicating that assessment of PVR may be beneficial for these women before recommending incontinence medications (antimuscarinics) to avoid urinary retention risk. Nevertheless, we would like to address some points about the study. Many factors affect PVR, such as bladder hypocontractility; a large bladder diverticulum; bladder stones; and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) due to anatomic, neurological, or functional causes.2 However, the study did not include imaging modalities such as ultrasonography to exclude BOO, diverticulum, or stones. An obstruction may cause incomplete bladder emptying. In a study examining factors related to PVR, all possible causes of high PVR should be considered carefully. Without excluding obstruction, it is hard to conclude that the only factor affecting PVR is a history of pelvic or back surgery. Moreover, surgical procedures (nerve-sparing or not) are important in development of bladder dysfunction, but the authors did not mention surgical procedures. Nor did they provide information regarding history of pelvic radiotherapy. They stated that individuals with a history of bladder cancer were excluded but did not mention rectal cancer or cervical cancer, which might have involved pelvic radiotherapy. Radiation exposure could have affected bladder emptying.3 Conflict of Interest: The editor in chief has reviewed the conflict of interest checklist provided by the authors and has determined that the authors have no financial or any other kind of personal conflicts with this paper.

      "title": "Challenges in the Diagnosis and Consequential Management of Patients 46, XY DSD",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background: Disorders of sex development (DSD) are clinical conditions that cause an incongruity between the chromosomal and phenotypic sex of an individual. A high variable group of congenital disorders can arise depending upon the timing and location of defect involved in sex determination and differentiation. 46, XY DSD occurs in 1:20,0000 male births; with external genitalia ranging from ambiguous to normal female. Such conditions can be psychologically stressful for patients and their families and have been historically difficult to diagnose, especially at genetic level. Failure to diagnose exact mutation may make the therapeutic approach, genetic counseling and risk assessment even more challenging. Clinical case: Full term baby is born to non -consanguineous parents after an uneventful pregnancy. Mother denied any history of acne/hirsutism, hormone or substance use during pregnancy. At birth, external genitalia showed non-rugated labia majora with posterior fusion, absence of labia minora and vaginal opening. Enlarged clitoris/ Penile like structure measuring 1.5 cm with palpable corpora and hypospadias was present. No palpable gonads were appreciated. No other dysmorphic features were present and rest of the physical exam was unremarkable. Cosyntropin stim test on day 4 of life showed appropriate adrenal response. Pelvic ultrasound and MRI showed an elongated structure posterior to the bladder presumably uterus with no identifiable gonads. Chromosome analysis revealed an XY karyotype. FISH for SRY and microarray were unremarkable. Further testing at 4 weeks of life showed sub optimal elevation of Gonadotropins and Testosterone. Female gender was assigned due to parents’ preference and endocrine/ Urology recommendations. The 46,XY DSD genetic panel including testing for non-syndromic DSD, steroid abnormalities, skeletal dysplasia syndromes, and multiple malformation syndromes was unremarkable. Conclusion: Although a number of cytogenetic or single-gene defects have been associated with DSD, the true incidence of pathogenic variants has not been established. Many cases of 46, XY DSD remain unexplained likely due to an unidentified pathogenic variant of genes not routinely included in the panel or not yet identified to be associated with DSD. Without a clear diagnosis, genetic counseling and risk assessment is difficult. Parents should be informed about future options regarding sexual development, hormonal therapy and surgical treatments available. The determination of social sex must be made in consideration of underlying possible etiology, phenotypic sex, ethnic traditions, sexual identity and the acceptance of the assigned social sex by the parents. The affected child and his/her family must be followed throughout life to determine the patient’s adjustment to his/her social sex.",

Es ist wichtig, bei Patientinnen im fertilen Alter an eine Schwangerschaft zu denken. Vaginale Blutungen können durch Atrophie, durch Infektion, Karzinom oder schwangerschaftsbedingt sein; in letzterem Fall ist es wichtig, zwischen Extrauteringravidität, pathologischer oder physiologischer intrauteriner Gravidität zu unterscheiden. Bei postmenopausalen Blutungen sind weitere gynäkologische Abklärungen durch den Facharzt obligatorisch, um ein Karzinom auszuschließen. Nach Vergewaltigung benötigen die Patientinnen psychologische, forensische und gynäkologische Beratung. Sexuell übertragbare Krankheiten, HIV inklusive, müssen ausgeschlossen werden und gegebenenfalls prophylaktische Medikamente gegeben werden. Falls ungeschützter Geschlechtsverkehr stattgefunden hat, kann die «Pille danach» für 72 Stunden eingesetzt werden oder eine Spirale bis fünf Tage postkoital. Senkungen sind selten ein akutes Problem. Sie können allerdings zur Harnretention führen. Harnwegsinfekte sind ein häufiges Problem und sollten antibiotisch therapiert werden.",

      "abstract": "ren las mujeres. Las encuestas procedentes de diferentes paises encuentran que entre el 10 y el 51% de las mujeres presenta un deseo sexual inhibido. Este bajo nivel de deseo se asocia con frecuencia con la dificultad en la excitacion y en el orgasmo, asi como con insatisfaccion sexual. La reduccion del deseo sexual es uno de los problemas mas habituales que se encuentran en el ambulatorio de asistencia primaria en Obstetricia y Ginecologia. Sin embargo, muchos de los medicos han recibido poca o nula formacion sobre los problemas sexuales, y por ello desconocen como diagnosticar o tratar este problema. Como resultado, la alteracion queda, con frecuencia, sin diagnosticar ni tratar, a pesar de su elevada frecuencia. Se ha utilizado una variedad de terminos para describir las alteraciones del deseo sexual y de la excitacion, entre los que se encuentran: evitacion sexual, baja libido, deseo sexual inhibido, deseo sexual hipoactivo, alteracion hipoactiva del deseo sexual (AHDS), alteracion de la excitacion sexual femenina y alteracion por aversion sexual. No existe consenso sobre la definicion de estos terminos, y muchos autores e investigadores se han esforzado en definir los sindromes con que se encuentran. No existe una herramienta universalmente aceptada para definir las diferentes alteraciones, y algunos pacientes parecen presentar componentes de mas de uno de los diagnosticos. Este articulo presenta tres modelos del deseo sexual de la mujer, un planteamiento del diagnostico diferencial y algunos metodos que pueden utilizarse en la practica clinica.",

      "abstract": "Acupuncture and acupressure, 2 modalities of Traditional Chinese Medicine, are based on reducing pain and symptoms of disease through balancing yin and yang . Acupuncture and acupressure have been used in China for reduction of labor pain, labor augmentation, and other intrapartum indications for more than 2 millennia. This article presents a review of the current literature that has addressed the effects of acupuncture and acupressure on intrapartum events. Studies of acupuncture have demonstrated that acupuncture may reduce labor pain, the use of pharmacologic agents, the use of forceps and vacuum‐assisted births, and the length of labor. Studies that examined the effect of acupuncture on labor that is induced or augmented for premature rupture of membranes have found that acupuncture may increase the degree of cervical ripening but does not reduce the amount of oxytocin or epidural analgesia administration, nor does it shorten length of induced labor. Acupressure may reduce labor pain and labor duration, but acupressure has not been found to increase cervical ripening or induce labor. There are insufficient studies about acupuncture and acupressure and their effects on labor at this time, and there is need for further research. Areas of uncertainty include efficacy, optimal point selection, best techniques, and length of time for point stimulation.",

Sulit diketahui sebelumnya bahwa kehamilan akan menjadi masalah (Prawirohardjo, 2006).\r \tKurangnya pengetahuan ibu dan keluarga tentang kehamilan resiko tinggi dapat meningkatkan kejadian resiko tinggi pada kehamilan. Keterlambatan dalam mengenali secara dini tanda bahaya kehamilan dapat meningkatkan kejadian resiko tinggi kehamilan karena dalam keadaan kehamilan normal pun dapat secara tiba-tiba menjadi resiko tinggi (Depkes, 2009).\r \tTanda-tanda bahaya pada kehamilan yang terjadi pada seorang ibu hamil merupakan suatu pertanda telah terjadinya suatu masalah yang serius pada ibu atau janin yang dikandungnya. Tanda-tanda bahaya ini dapat terjadi pada awal kehamilan (hamil muda) atau pada pertengahan atau pada akhir kehamilan (hamil tua) (Depkes RI, 2009). \tAdapun macam-macam tanda bahaya kehamilan pada trimester tiga antara lain: Perdarahan pervaginam, keluar air ketuban sebelum waktunya, demam tinggi, bengkak dikaki, muka dan tangan, sakit kepala yang hebat, gerakan janin tidak ada atau kurang (minimal 3 kali dalam 1 jam) (Azrul, 2005).\r \tPengetahuan ibu dan keluarga tentang tanda-tanda bahaya kehamilan dapat memberikan landasan yang kuat agar terwujudnya perilaku sehat dalam menekankan upaya kesehatan promotif selama kehamilan.

The diagnosis strategy of erectile dysfunction has changed, and it is important for every health professional to learn how to deal with erectile dysfunction.Although very prevalent, the sexual dysfunctions, including erectile dysfunction, continue to be underdiagnosed. Patients often expect physicians to initiate the conversation and ask about their troubles having sex. The routine to identify erectile dysfunction causes has undergone significant changes over the last decade. Identification of erectile dysfunction can be made through questionnaires or a complete medical and sexual history. Anamnesis and laboratory tests are sufficient in most cases to identify erectile dysfunction and to manage the treatment. Supplementary tests are used in special cases or when there is a need for an etiological diagnosis.Sexual function must be a part of every medical consultation, as any other body function. Erectile dysfunction diagnosis is not a complex task and can be accomplished by any physician. Even when the professional does not feel secure to treat erectile dysfunction, he or she can just identify the dysfunction and refer the patient to an expert.",

En Venezuela no han sido reconocidos, debido a las pocas evaluaciones internas que se realizan a las cerdas, por la poca utilizacion del ultrasonido, clinicamente y a nivel de matadero. Los defectos de desarrollo pueden ser anatomicos (agenesia, aplasia o hiploplasia) o funcionales. Los defectos anatomicos tambien se han descrito como malformaciones o anormalidades. Las malformaciones son mas evidentes en los recien nacidos. El desarrollo de anormalidades en el tracto reproductivo de cerdos es frecuente y pudiendo ser debidas a factores geneticos, fisicos, quimicos o infecciosos. Se ha establecido que las alteraciones presentes en el tracto reproductivo, probablemente tengan un componente heredable que pudiese ser de importancia economica y a su vez motivo de pesquisas y eliminacion de una linea genetica determinada. El utero unicornis es una anomalia congenita que resulta de la falta de desarrollo de uno de los conductos de Muller, presentandose un utero incompleto o defectuoso. Es una condicion en la que hay un solo cuerno uterino o la ausencia parcial del mismo, pero con la presencia de los dos ovarios. Esta disgenesia reproductiva se denomina aplasia uterina unilateral, completa o segmental del cuerno uterino, derecho o izquierdo. En este trabajo se evaluo la presencia de anomalias presentes en el tracto reproductivo en cerdas, evaluandose 522 hembras porcinas de descarte, provenientes del oriente del pais, durante el periodo de un ano. Solo 3 animales presentaron disgenesis reproductiva (0,58%), representadas por utero unicornis. Dos de las hembras, pertenecian al grupo de hembras jovenes (segundo y tercer parto) y la otra pertenecia al grupo de hembras adultas (octavo parto), comprometiendo la eficiencia reproductiva de las hembras jovenes.",

      "abstract": "Selama masa kehamilan, ibu hamil mengalami beberapa perubahan secara fisik maupun psikologis yang dapat menyebabkan rasa ketidaknyamanan dan rasa cemas selama kehamilan. Kecemasan yang dialami ibu hamil khususnya saat trimester III terkait dengan adanya rasa khawatir akan kesehatan ibu dan janin seperti adanya perasaan takut saat melahirkan, takut bila janin yang dilahirkan cacat dan bila terjadi komplikasi saat bersalin atau setelah bersalin. Ibu hamil primigravida lebih banyak mengalami kecemasan jika dibandingkan dengan ibu hamil multigravida terkait dengan pengalaman kehamilan dan persalinan. Rasa tidak nyaman, rasa cemas yang dialami dan peningkatkan pelepasan hormon stres akan berdampak buruk terhadap kesehatan ibu hamil itu sendiri dan kesehatan janin yang dikandung. Kecemasan identik atau ditandai dengan meningkatnya sekresi hormon stres seperti kortisol, epinefrin dan adrenalin. Namun hormon-hormon tersebut telah banyak diteliti pada penelitian sebelumnya. Sedangkan penelitian tentang kecemasan dan hormon β-endorphin belum pernah dilakukan sebelumnya. Sekresi hormon β-endorphin dalam tubuh dapat meningkatkan suasana hati atau merubah mood khususnya pada ibu hamil trimester III yang mengalami kecemasan. Terapi musik merupakan penggunaan musik sebagai terapi pelengkap (Complementary Medicine) yang digunakan dengan tujuan untuk mengurangi atau meminimalkan penyakit yang berpengaruh terhadap keadaan fisik, emosional dan/ spiritual seseorang. Rangsangan musik diproses oleh dan melalui otak (sistem limbik) yang memiliki pengaruh positif pada fungsi saraf dan aktivitas hormonal. Musik dalam satu periode dapat membantu menurunkan gejala depresi pada orang dewasa. Selain itu terapi musik juga dapat meningkatkan relaksasi,mood, kualitas hidup, mengurangi stres dan kecemasan. Struktur dalam musik dapat membuat pasien merasa nyaman dan damai.",

      "abstract": "Symptoms due to estrogen deficiency begin in the perimenopausal years and progress as serum levels of this hormone decrease. Vasomotor instability, manifested by hot flushes or night sweats, may persist for several months to a few years. Psychologic symptoms include anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, palpitations, and headaches. Atrophy of the genital epithelium may result in senile vaginitis with symptoms of irritation, burning, pruritus, dyspareunia, and even vaginal bleeding. Even the lower urinary tract mucosa is dependent upon estrogen. Postmenopausal osteoporosis affects 25 to 50% of older women and increases the risk for vertebral, hip, and other fractures. Estrogen therapy for menopausal complaints has received adverse publicity because several reports have indicated that unopposed estrogens increase the risk of endometrial cancer. Added progestogen not only negates this risk but reduces the incidence of endometrial adenocarcinoma in estrogen-progestogen users to less than that observed in untreated women. Estrogen replacement therapy does not increase the risk of breast cancer; the incidence of this malignancy, however, was also less in the estrogen-progestogen users when compared with either the untreated women or from that expected from the national cancer surveys. In evaluating postmenopausal women for hormone replacement, the benefits of estrogen-progestogen therapy must be weighed against possible risks.",

      "abstract": "Uterine activity may be defined in terms of the frequency of contractions of the uterus and the pressure generated by these contractions. Most studies that report an effect of analgesia on labor are retrospective, and, if prospective, are nonrandomized. Drug effects on uterine activity and labor progress are probably dose related, but are also influenced by a myriad of other factors including, but not limited to, the mother's emotional state, degree of cervical change, uterine contractility pattern, phase of labor, and individual differences in pharmacokinetics and drug sensitivity. The latest phase of labor may be prolonged by excessive narcotic or inappropriate timing of regional analgesia. The normal active phase tends to be resistant to the inhibitory effects of the usual amount of any analgesia. A brief period of decreased uterine activity often follows institution of analgesia. This may effectually accelerate labor in some patients by decreasing maternal anxiety and serum concentrations of catecholamines. A combination of sedation epidural blockade, and subsequent oxytocin use may prove effective in correcting a dysfunctional or hyperstimulatory pattern during the active phase. The second stage of labor may be slightly prolonged by effective epidural analgesia, but this delay is not necessarily harmful as long as the fetal heart rate tracing is normal, maternal hydration is adequate, and maternal pain relief is sufficient.",

      "title": "Low Back Pain in Japanese Women: Including cases caused by osteoporosis",
      "abstract": "Low back pain is an unavoidable symptom among humans because of their bipedal standing posture and is one of the most common complaints of outpatients. Women, in particular, experience low back pain due to various factors throughout their life cycle. Low back pain can be caused by both physiological and pathological factors, including menstrual pain during puberty, pregnancy and par- turition during sexual maturity, vague symptoms during the climacteric, and osteoporosis during old age. These factors lead to a higher prevalence of low back pain in females than in males. This review discusses the roles of anatomical and endocrinological factors in the development of low back pain in women. Apart from low back pain associated with pregnancy, most cases of low back pain due to organic disease in middle-aged and elderly women are related to orthopedic or gynecological conditions. The specific underlying diseases and conditions are reviewed. This article also discusses low back pain related to vague symptoms caused by autonomic disorders. This discussion is based on studies of 400 patients with low back pain. Although there was no significant relation between bone mineral density and the presence or severity of low back pain, we confirmed that vertebral fractures associated with osteoporosis cause symptoms such as low back pain and adversely affect patients' quality of life. Low back pain is closely related to life style. The close associations with personality and interpersonal relations require that low back pain is comprehensively diagnosed and treated.",

In the preconception period, it is recommended that women perform 30 minutes to 1 hour of moderate‐to‐high intensity physical activity per day, at least 5 days a week, and avoid the absence of any physical activity for 2 consecutive days. Pregnant women should: i) start or continue to perform moderate‐intensity physical activity (up to 150 min/wk with at least 3 sessions longer than 30 min), ii) start or continue to do muscle strengthening activity involving the large muscle groups (once or twice a week). In the absence of medical contraindications, it is recommended that they continue physical activity (at least 30 min/d) during the postpartum period. Sedentary time must be limited, if possible, to less than 7 hours a day, regardless of the period.",

      "title": "Diagnosis and treatment of ectopic pregnancy.",
      "abstract": "The most common site of localisation of an ectopic pregnancy is the fallopian tube. Rarely an ectopic pregnancy can be found in the ovary, a caesarean section scar, the abdomen or the cervix. Risk factors are previous ectopic pregnancy, PID, endometriosis, previous pelvic surgery, the presence of a coil and infertility. However, a third of women with an ectopic pregnancy have no known risk factors. NICE recommends a low threshold for offering a pregnancy test to women of childbearing age when they attend the surgery. Symptoms and signs appear when the tube starts to tear. When the tube ruptures, the woman will quickly become unwell and haemodynamically unstable because of rapid intra-abdominal blood loss. The most common symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are pelvic or abdominal pain, amenorrhoea, missed period or abnormal period and vaginal bleeding. A positive diagnosis of a urinary tract infection or gastroenteritis does not exclude an ectopic pregnancy. Signs of suspected ectopic pregnancy include pelvic, abdominal, adnexal or cervical motion tenderness, rebound tenderness and abdominal distension. Women who are haemodynamically unstable, or in whom there is significant concern about the degree of pain or bleeding, should be referred directly to A&E, irrespective of the result of the pregnancy test. Stable patients with bleeding who have pain or a pregnancy of six weeks gestation or more or a pregnancy of uncertain gestation should be referred immediately to an early pregnancy assessment (EPA) service, or out-of-hours gynaecology service if the EPA service is not available. Diagnosis is confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound scan to identify the location of the pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Harninkontinenz (HI) als Folge eines nicht ausreichenden Verschlussmechanismus der Harnröhre (urethrale Sphinkterinkompetenz [USMI]) oder einer gestörten Speicherfunktion der Blase ist eine gefürchtete Nebenwirkung der Kastration bei Hündinnen. Das Risiko für HI wird von Faktoren wie Rassezugehörigkeit, Körpergewicht und Zeitpunkt der Kastration beeinflusst. Typisch ist der Harnverlust im Liegen, der im Mittel 2,8 Jahre nach Kastration erstmals auftritt. Die Diagnose wird mittels Ausschlussverfahren gestellt, wobei insbesondere eine gezielte Anamnese sehr hilfreich ist. Die Therapie hat zum Ziel, den Verschlussdruck der Harnröhre und/oder die Blasencompliance zu erhöhen. In der Regel führt eine medikamentöse Therapie zum Erfolg, sodass eine chirurgische Intervention nicht notwendig ist. Neben der HI werden als unerwünschte Kastrationsfolge bei bestimmten Hunderassen auch Fell-veränderungen beobachtet. Die durch die Kastration ausgelösten pathophysiologischen Mechanismen, die zur Abnahme des Harnröhrenverschlussdrucks, zu einer veränderten Speicherfunktion der Harnblase sowie zu Fellveränderungen führen, sind bis heute nicht vollständig geklärt. Außer die in einer altbekannten Hypothese genannte Östrogendefizienz könnte die nach Kastration veränderte Sekretion der übergeordneten Sexualhormone, FSH, LH und GnRH eine Rolle spielen. Neben α-Adrenergika, Flavoxat und Estriol wird auch der erfolgreiche Einsatz von GnRH-Agonist-Depotformulierungen zur Therapie der kastrationsbedingten HI beschrieben. Diese Depotformulierungen erwiesen sich auch zur Therapie bei Fellveränderungen nach Kastration als geeignet.",

      "abstract": "The menopausal transition, or perimenopause, is associated with profound reproductive and hormonal changes. These changes have been well chronicled and matched with concomitant symptoms. The pattern of appearance of menopausal symptoms and their natural history have become increasingly clear thanks to the conduct of several long-term, longitudinal cohort studies that have examined many aspects of women's biology and psychology through this time of life. Menopausal symptoms are highly prevalent; they are sufficiently bothersome to drive almost 90% of women to seek out their healthcare provider for advice on how to cope. (1) The classic symptom of menopause is the hot flash, which is experienced by most women, and is moderately to severely problematic for about 1/3 of women. While most women will have an experience of hot flashes limited to just a year or two, others will experience them for a decade or more, and a small proportion of women will never be free of them. Poor sleep becomes more common in perimenopausal women not only in association with the menopausal transition but also in relation to aging. Depressed mood and increased anxiety also increase during the transition, with an abrupt rise in prevalence as women approach the later stages of the menopausal transition and have longer bouts of amenorrhea. These common symptoms often interact with one another such that depressed women tend to experience worse hot flashes along with worse sleep. As women enter the latter stages of the transition, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia also become more likely, affecting about 1/3 of the population. Unlike hot flashes, mood issues, and sleep, vaginal symptoms will not go away without treatment. Clinical approaches to these problems often involve hormone therapy, which can be safely given to most perimenopausal women on a short-term basis. Therapeutic strategies that are nonhormonal and behavioral can also be deployed.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Numbers of women seeking consultation for pelvic floor disorders, a large portion of which will involve pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and lower urinary tract dysfunction, are expected to reach epidemic proportions within the next decade. A full understanding of the complex impact of pelvic organ prolapse on lower urinary tract function is crucial to successful management. Recent findings Recent data lend support to the concept that women with POP, but no associated urethral dysfunction, may be best served by a surgical repair that carefully avoids dissection in the periurethral area. Conversely, preoperative evaluation will often reveal bladder outlet obstruction concomitant with ‘hidden’, ‘potential’, or ‘occult’ stress urinary incontinence when the prolapse is reduced. Many of these women will not have incontinence symptoms in daily life. Paradoxically, the mechanical bladder outlet obstruction may induce detrusor instability with subsequent obstructed/overactive bladder symptom complexes not dissimilar to those of men with prostatic bladder outlet obstruction. Anatomic research shows that the vessels and nerves supplying the urethra are particulary vulnerable to surgical techniques used in pelvic organ prolapse repair. Summary This mix of obstructed, overactive bladder with hidden stress incontinence increases with degree of POP, and all women with severe prolapse will fair best if evaluated for all three conditions prior to surgical repair.",

Exposure of voles to short (6 h) photoperiods slows gonadal development or causes active gonads to regress. Abolishing pineal activity either by chemical sympathectomy, using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), or by surgical pinealectomy, prevents this inhibiting or regressing effect of short photoperiod upon gonads. Thus, the pineal gland appears to play a part in the measurement of day length by voles and in the physiological causation of their seasonal breeding.",

Es verwundert daher nicht, daß bisher keine eindeutige Antwort auf die Frage vorliegt, ob die senkrechte oder die waagrechte Körperhaltung sub partu als die natürliche und dementsprechend für den Ablauf der Geburt die günstigste Position anzusehen ist. Betrachtet man Skulpturen aus der Prähistorie oder auch frühe bildliche Darstellungen der Geburt aus Mesopotamien, Ägypten, Indien, Griechenland und vielen anderen Ländern der Welt oder nimmt man die vielfältigen Geburtsabbildungen der Künstler des Mittelalters zur Hand, so ist es eindrucksvoll und auch überraschend, daß die Gebärende überwiegend, wenn nicht sogar ausschließlich, in sitzender oder hockender oder kniender oder stehender oder hängender Position dargestellt wird. Also in aufrechter Haltung. Diese, in der Kunstgeschichte, aber auch in der Medizingeschichte, stets zitierte und oft als Normalhaltung angesprochene Körperstellung der kreißenden Frau wird auch heute noch vorwiegend als die übliche Geburtsposition bei den Naturvölkern beobachtet. Zur Illustration dieser auch für die heutige Geburtshilfe möglicherweise folgenreichen Problematik gibt es eine große Zahl von Bildern aus allen Zeitepochen und den verschiedenen Kulturen.",

      "title": "Chorioamniotic Membrane Separation Found on Routine Testing in an Otherwise Asymptomatic Woman With Late Preterm Twin Gestation",
      "abstract": "Background: Chorioamniotic membrane separation (CMS) is a rare finding that is commonly preceded by invasive fetal procedures. The presence of CMS can also be associated with uncommon maternal or fetal conditions as well as preterm delivery, amniotic band syndrome, umbilical cord complications, and fetal and neonatal death. It is classified as a high-risk antepartum condition due to the significant fetal morbidity and mortality that may ensue. Case Report: A 40-year-old gravida 5 para 1212 at 35 weeks presented for antepartum fetal testing. Her antepartum course was complicated by di–di twin gestation, chronic hypertension, and advanced maternal age. A routine ultrasound (as part of the antepartum fetal testing) identified an incidental finding of CMS. The patient's only reported symptom was that of preterm contractions, without evidence of active labor, and other fetal testing was reassuring. She had a repeat cesarean section that day and the suspected etiology was preterm, premature rupture of membranes of Twin B that was seen on entry into the uterine cavity. Discussion: Chorioamniotic separation is a rare occurrence associated with significant adverse fetal outcomes. This is the first reported case of incidental diagnosis in a twin pregnancy during antepartum fetal surveillance testing. Our detection resulted in the delivery of late preterm, but otherwise healthy, twin neonates.",

      "abstract": "In 201 of 212 oestrous cycles in 25 adult Merino ewes a fairly uniform sequence of changes occurred in the macroscopic nature of the vaginal contents. This sequence of changes or 'vaginal cycle' was characterized by the presence of mucus, frequently in great amount, during oestrus, and the appearance of quantities of material of a cheesy consistency within 3 days following oestrus. The cheesy material usually persisted for 3 or more days and was succeeded by small amounts of material of a semitransparent or clear serous nature. Two or three consecutive vaginal cycles occupied 32 interoestrous intervals of 31-61 days, most of which occurred during well-defined sexual seasons, and in two instances consecutive vaginal cycles continued throughout the whole of the interval between two well-defined sexual seasons. Some vaginal cycles also occurred during most other anoestrous intervals between sexual seasons. Forty oestrous periods were either associated unusually with a vaginal cycle or were not associated with any regular sequence of changes at all. Twenty-one of these periods occurred at the beginning or during the course of periods of reduced sexual activity.",

      "title": "Transvaginal ultrasonography – a helpful tool for the gynecologist in the diagnosis of a rare cause of obstructive ileus",
      "abstract": "Sir, Broad ligament hernias are extremely rare. They constitute about 5% of all internal hernias, which in turn cause 0.5–4% of intestinal obstruction cases (1). Early diagnosis is of importance for limiting intestinal ischemia, necrosis and perforation, and thus morbidity and mortality. Transvaginal ultrasonography in the hands of an experienced operator can give a hint that allows us to suspect this diagnosis, especially if the clinical picture fits. We call attention to this through the case of a previously healthy 36-year-old female (G3P2) with two normal vaginal deliveries after uneventful pregnancies and an early surgical abortion, who presented to the emergency department with abdominal colicky pain of 24 hours’ duration. She had a cervical conization 10 years earlier and no history of abdominal or pelvic surgery, endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease. She did not use contraception, had a regular menstrual cycle and was menstruating at the moment. Her symptoms had appeared during lunch the day before, first as a diffuse discomfort, which some hours later became stronger and persistent in the left lower abdominal quadrant accompanied by repeated vomiting and fever (38°C). No bowel movement had occurred since the pain started. The physical examination revealed diffuse tenderness without peritoneal signs and a non-distended abdomen. Her laboratory tests were normal except for slight leukocytosis (13 300/mm3, normal C – reactive protein). During the bimanual pelvic exam, a soft mass in direct relation to the uterus was noted. It could not be mobilized off the uterus despite vaginal manipulation. The transvaginal ultrasound revealed a C-shaped “coffee bean” configuration of bowel loop on the left side of the uterus in the pelvis (where the palpated mass was located). The uterus was displaced to the right and the left ovary could not be visualized. This sonographic finding can be mistaken for a dilated Fallopian tube. Doppler ultrasonography was inconclusive. At diagnostic laparoscopy, an almost 30-cm-long ileal loop, moderately discolored and edematous but not infarcted, was found to have herniated through a fenestration on the left broad ligament under the round ligament. The operative findings included a uterus rotated 90° anticlockwise, with the left tube and ovary directed towards the sacrum and the right adnexa directed anteriorly to the pubis (Figure 1). A small amount of free bloody fluid was observed in the pouch of Douglas, which was regarded as retrograde menstruation. No endometriotic lesions were noted. As the intestinal loop could not be mobilized laparoscopically, the procedure was converted to a laparotomy. The round ligament was divided and ligated. The intestinal loop appeared viable. Bowel resection was not necessary. Upon closer inspection, on the left side a defect measuring 2 cm in diameter on the upper part of the broad ligament, through the mesoligamentum teres, was noted. Contralateral broad ligament inspection revealed two similar but wider defects (right side). The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful. Although exact diagnosis was not made preoperatively, the early intervention guaranteed good prognosis in our view. Loops of small bowel pass under the left round ligament (arrow) causing obstructive ileus. Note the rotation of the uterus anticlockwise. Broad ligament disorders are classified as primary when their source is congenital, inflammatory or traumatic or secondary when it is iatrogenic. Skandalakis et al. (2) described congenital cystic structures within the broad ligament which they believed to be remnants of the mesonephric or Müllerian ducts. Spontaneous rupture of these cysts might account for defects in nulliparous women. Operative trauma, perforation following vaginal manipulation, and trauma after pregnancy or birth may also induce such a defect by tearing the uterine supporting structures and/or by torsion of the gravid uterus (3). Although the latter is considered a plausible explanation since > 85% of these hernias occur in parous women (1), no single theory is yet convincing enough to explain all presented cases. Broad ligament defects are also classified either by the nature of the defect (the fenestra, the pouch and the hernia sac type) (4) or by its anatomic location in relation to the round ligament (5). The sonographic features of the condition noted here, despite being relatively indirect for this type of internal hernia, can nevertheless aid in the diagnosis and bear similarities to computed tomography findings of the condition (6). This internal herniation should therefore be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of parous middle-aged females who lack risk factors for ileus but present with symptoms of intestinal pelvic obstruction, and where a distended bowel loop is seen lateral to the uterus on transvaginal ultrasonography in conjunction with the described palpation findings.",

Sources included are CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, CINAHL, relevant journals, conference proceedings, and registries of ongoing trials. <b>Eligibility criteria for selecting studies</b> Randomised clinical trials of prostaglandin or prostaglandin analogues used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction versus placebo or no treatment, alternative prostaglandin dose or administration, or a different type of prostaglandin. We included studies recruiting women with a viable fetus, but had no other restrictions relating to indication for labour induction or language of publication. Outcomes assessed were serious neonatal morbidity (trialist defined) or perinatal death; serious maternal morbidity (trialist defined) or death; vaginal delivery not achieved within 24 hours, caesarean section, and uterine hyperstimulation with fetal heart rate changes. <b>Results</b> 280 randomised clinical trials were included (48&nbsp;068 women) in the review. Maternal and neonatal mortality and serious morbidity were rarely reported and are summarized narratively. Unresolved inconsistency was observed for the hyperstimulation outcome. Relative to placebo, the odds of failing to achieve a vaginal delivery were lowest for vaginal misoprostol (≥50 µg) (odds ratio 0.06 (95% credible interval 0.02 to 0.12)), with a 39% absolute probability of event (95% credible interval 1% to 94%). Compared with placebo, odds of caesarean section were lowest for titrated oral misoprostol solution (&lt;50 µg) (odds ratio 0.65 (0.49 to 0.83)), with an absolute probability of event of 15% (3% to 40%). <b>Conclusions</b> Low dose(&lt;50 µg) titrated oral misoprostol solution had the lowest probability of caesarean section, whereas vaginal misprostol (≥50 µg) had the highest probability of achieving a vaginal delivery within 24 hours.

In fact, it is noted that the prevalence of visceral pain disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease, gallbladder and biliary tract diseases are significantly higher in women. Furthermore, symptom such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, distension, satiety, bloating, diarrhoa or constipation, frequently appears in relation with pregnancy, luteal phase of the menstrual cycle or perimenopausal and menopausal states. Further support for the contribution of ovarian steroids to functional gastrointestinal disorders comes from studies demonstrating that pharmacological ovariectomy reduces abdominal pain symptoms. Therefore, addressing the influence of sex and sex hormones in the modulation of visceral pain appears critical to develop new strategies of diagnosis and therapy sex-directed for gastro-intestinal disorders.",

      "abstract": "In the past 25 years, we have studied 73 cases of Myasthenia. 19 of these have had 24 pregnancies. We confirm the results that are given in the literature (15). Pregnancy does not trigger off Myasthenia. The action of pregnancy on Myasthenia is variable and there is an equal chance of worsening, improvement or a stationary state of the condition. All the same, patients who are well stabilised and have been for some time do not become worse. Worsening, when it does happen, happens especially in the first trimester of the pregnancy and calls for precise observation of the patient in order to regulate the treatment. Myasthenia has no direct or indirect action on the fetus and the pregnancy is not disturbed. Labour can be normal but the second stage often has to be aided because of the patient's muscle tiredness. In labour and particularly in the second stage an acute crisis can occur with difficulty in breathing. For this it is necessary to have an anaesthetist present who can resuscitate the patient and if necessary give respiratory aid by ventilation. Curare and like substances are absoultely contra-indicated if general anaesthesia is required. Transitory neonatal Myasthenia is rare, but the severity of the respiratory complications can be such that is should be sought for routinely and if there is the slightest doubt the newborn should be transferred to the special care neonatal unit.",

      "abstract": "Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome is a part of the group of abnormalities known as \"Anomalies of the fusion of the Müllerian ducts\". It is characterized by normal development of breasts and hairs, normal appearance of external genitalia, normal feminine genotype (46XX), normal FSH, LH, E₂ and Test. levels, normal ovaries and congenital absence of uterus and the whole or the upper two thirds of the vagina. It is observed in about 15% of the cases with primary amenorrhea and the incidence is about 1:4500-6000. Etiologycal factors such as lack of estrogen/gestagen receptors, deletions or mutations of genes that stop the fusion, as well as the activation of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), are considered. The etiology is being explored but there is no consensus yet. The diagnosis is confirmed during a clinical examination, which takes place because of a primary amenorrhea (often happening at the age of 16), and the absence of a uterus and vagina is proved. The therapy should be handled by a multidisciplinary team including obstetrician, trained midwife, psychologist, specialist in imaging and psycho-sexual counseling. The idea for surgical creation of vagina (neovagina) dates many years ago. The first known documents date back to 1817 and over the years a variety of methods are offered usage of amnion, dura mater, peritoneum, skin grafts, different parts of the intestine, cellulose, etc. The first method of non-surgical treatment is offered by the Czech gynecologist Frank. His ambition was to build a vagina by gradual dilatation of the tissue while applying dilatators with successively increasing length and thickness. The method was further developed by Ingram (1981) and nowadays by Edmonds (2012). He reported about 245 patients treated during the last 12 years by his team. 232 of them had a success in anatomic aspect (95%), 13 did not complete the treatment due to psychological or cultural problems. The experts from American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists include in their \"Committee Opinion\" from May 2013 the following lines: \"Non-surgical creation of the vagina is the appropriate first line approach in most patients\". Briefly is presented our experience in this field--14 girls at the age of 16-18, successfully treated with dilatation in the III Gynecology Clinic in University hospital \"Maichin dom\", Sofia, Bulgaria.",

      "title": "Gut Motility Alterations in Neonates and Young Infants",
      "abstract": "Colic usually affects babies in the first few weeks of their lives and persists for about 4 months. Crying can be intense and furious and it may last for several hours per day for several weeks. Although crying can occur at any time, it is usually worse in the late afternoon and evening, and occasionally affects the baby's sleep. Infantile colic is not considered a disease, fulfilling instead criteria for a functional disorder. Research shows that babies with colic continue to eat and gain weight appropriately, despite the crying (1). The main risk for these babies relates to the stress and anxiety that the condition creates at home, especially when it affects the first child. The cause of colic is not known. Painful flatus may contribute to colic, but there is little evidence to prove that it is linked to digestive problems (2). Another theory is that while the digestive system is maturing, some babies are more sensitive to substances such as lactose ingested through breast-feeding and formula milk; however, evidence to support this hypothesis also is limited. Other possible causes relate to the baby's behavior and temperament. Among the gastrointestinal (GI) factors, we focus on non-nutritive pathophysiology such as the relation of colic to gastroesophageal reflux (GER), GI motility disorders, the role of gut hormones, and intestinal microflora. GER Uncomplicated GER in otherwise healthy infants is common and is not considered a disease. Approximately 50% of all infants 0 to 3 months regurgitate at least once per day. This frequency drops to 5% by age 10 to 12 months. Three percent of parents of 10- to 12-month-old infants view this as a problem (3). Common contributing factors to excessive regurgitation include overfeeding, air swallowed during feeding, crying, or coughing. In uncomplicated GER (termed functional regurgitation in the Rome III criteria (4)), the physical examination is normal and weight gain is adequate. A thorough history and physical examination are sufficient for a confident diagnosis, and conservative, nonpharmacologic therapy usually is recommended. GER disease (GERD) occurs when the consequences of excessive GER cause a true disease, such as esophagitis, aspiration pneumonia, failure to thrive, and hematemesis. Guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of the infant and child with suspected GERD have been published (5). It is tempting to associate GER (and GERD) with excessive crying in some babies. The recent widespread use of medications aimed at increasing acid suppression in newborns and infants (6) may indeed reflect the belief that excessive esophageal exposure to acid is the culprit in many instances of infant colic. GERD symptoms in infants, however, usually include vomiting and feeding difficulty, and these are not common symptoms in babies with colic. Normal esophageal pH monitoring scores have not been defined adequately in infants of different ages, and many pH studies have indicated that GER is a common event. Reflux index scores in infants often are higher than those considered clinically significant in adults and children. Reflux parameters are altered by changes in arousal state, type and frequency of feeding, and posture (7–9) factors that are rarely standardized in pediatric intraoesophageal pH–monitoring studies. The development of electronic impedance to study reflux events may shed further light on the relation between reflux and crying and irritability in infants. Interestingly, therapeutic studies that have been aimed at reducing gastric acid secretion to treat “reflux symptoms,” including irritability, in infants have failed to demonstrate superiority of the drugs compared with placebo (10,11). Available data seem to suggest that GER and GERD may play a role only in a small subset of infants with colicky symptoms. MOTILITY DISORDERS Esophageal and GI motility and enteric nervous system abnormalities have been implicated as possibly being involved in the pathophysiology of infant colic. GI motility matures during infancy and early childhood and may be influenced by various factors, including developmental stage, dietary habits, genetics, arousal state, intercurrent illnesses, congenital anomalies, and effects of medical or surgical interventions. Esophageal motility plays an important role in airway protection during episodes of GER. There is evidence that abnormal esophageal reflexes may contribute to difficulty in feeding infants with some of the consequences of prematurity. The evaluation of these protective mechanisms in infants is now feasible but restricted to a few referral third-level centers (12). In regard to alteration in gastric motility and its interplay with regurgitation in infants, gastric distension and impaired fundic relaxation as a result of disturbed gastric motility may play a role. Transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation seems to be triggered by gastric distension via activation of the stretch receptors in the stomach (13,14) and there is evidence that gastric accommodation may be impaired in the first few days of life (15). The enlarged antral area, as a consequence of distal displacement of gastric contents when fundic function is impaired, could trigger nausea and discomfort and consequently provoke regurgitation. Other studies suggest that acid exposure may be reduced in the case of delayed gastric emptying (16). Recent data on infants with cow's-milk allergy show a close link between GI symptoms, GER, and gastric-emptying time (17). Although the available evidence fails to provide insight into the exact triggers of infant colic, the data about the relation among gastric and oesophageal motor function, allergy, and dyspeptic symptoms allow for the hypothesis that certain infants may be predisposed to dietary protein intolerance and disturbed gut motility in the first few weeks of life. These processes also may lead to altered gut perception and normal stimuli (eg, intestinal distension) may be misinterpreted as painful events (18), much as happens in other pain-predominant functional disorders affecting older children, such as functional abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome (19,20). In support of the hypothesis that disturbed gut sensory-motor function may play a role in infant colic, there is the finding that ghrelin and motilin (2 hormones that affect gastric emptying) concentrations in blood are higher in infants with colic than in controls. Elucidation of the role of ghrelin in GI motility may open new doors to better understand the etiology of infant colic (21). Treatments of colicky symptoms have included medications with anticholinergic effects with the goal of reducing “spasms” or lessen the amplitude of potentially painful GI contractions. Evidence supporting their use is controversial, suggesting that motility disturbances may be involved only in a subgroup of children with infant colic (22,23). ROLE OF MICROBIOTA Reduction in crying time in colicky newborns fed with breast milk with the addition of probiotics has been reported by Savino and coworkers (24) and confirmed by other studies in preterm and term infants (25,26). The action of microbiota and its modulation by probiotics on upper GI motility can be explained in several ways (27). Volume and chemical characteristics of meals in the gut may modulate vagal signaling and affect gastric emptying (28). Fiber content increases gastric antrum motility compared with other diets (29). Intestinal bacteria metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) may stimulate smooth muscle (30). In the colon, these compounds inhibit peristaltic activity and may stimulate tonic activity. SCFA modify upper motility, inducing relaxation of the proximal stomach, lower esophageal sphincter and reducing gastric emptying via the mediation of GI hormones such as polypeptide YY (31). Cross-talk among the digestive nervous and motor activities, immune-related mechanisms, and probiotics has been thoroughly investigated. There is evidence that postinfectious enteric muscle dysfunction represents a state of persistent dysfunction of the neuromuscular tissues maintained by the production of mediators such as transforming growth factor-β and prostaglandin E2 by the intestinal muscle layers themselves (32). The interstitial cells of the Cajal network, the pacemaker of GI electrical activity, also may be damaged by inflammation and such alteration may lead to motor abnormality (33). The administration of probiotics could restore muscle function after a GI infection through action on multiple proteins and other components of excitation-contraction coupling (34). Probiotics also interact with the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (35,36). The coordinated interplay among these components is fundamental for the proper functioning of the gut. De Weerth and coworkers showed a microbiota diversity in children affected by colic in the first week of life compared with healthy controls (37). CONCLUSIONS Little evidence supports a substantial role of GER or GERD in the majority of infants with colic. It is possible that delayed gastric emptying, associated with abnormal antral contractions, leads to prolonged gastric stasis and antrofundic incoordination, resulting in increased wall tension in the gastric body and the fundus. This, in turn, may activate tension and pain receptors in the stomach to generate the characteristic distress present in children with colic. Heightened visceral sensitivity and altered gut hormones in these children also may contribute to enhanced pain perception. Such hypotheses have not been confirmed yet by in vivo studies and have not translated into viable therapeutic options. The role of microbiota in modifying intestinal environment and host responses in both the peripheral and central nervous systems represents a promising but not yet proven target for therapeutic interventions in dealing with distressed behavior in infants.",

With the aim of showing the findings detected in the imaging studies carried out, the case of a young adult with repeated mild urinary sepsis is presented, who was diagnosed with multiple and bilateral renoureteral malformations in the infertility consultation. The majority of congenital renoureteral malformations imply serious biopsychosocial problems for the patient, with the consequent impact on the psychological sphere and the social life of family members when diagnosed in the prenatal stage, so they inevitably constitute a health problem, since they contribute to fetal and infant mortality or increased morbidity in any age group.

      "abstract": "Mental health disorders in adolescence are a significant problem, relatively common, and amenable to treatment or intervention. Obstetrician-gynecologists who see adolescent patients are highly likely to see adolescents and young women who have one or more mental health disorders. Some of these disorders may interfere with a patient's ability to understand or articulate her health concerns and appropriately adhere to recommended treatment. Some disorders or their treatments will affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, causing anovulatory cycles and various menstrual disturbances. Adolescents with psychiatric disorders may be taking psychopharmacologic agents that can cause menstrual dysfunction and galactorrhea. Adolescents with mental illness often engage in acting-out behavior or substance use, which increases their risk of unsafe sexual behavior that may result in pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. Pregnant adolescents who take psychopharmacologic agents present a special challenge in balancing the potential risks of fetal harm with the risks of inadequate treatment. Whether providing preventive women's health care or specific obstetric or gynecologic treatment, the obstetrician-gynecologist has the opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality from mental health disorders in adolescents by early identification, appropriate and timely referral, and care coordination. Although mental health disorders should be managed by mental health care professionals or appropriately trained primary care providers, the obstetrician-gynecologist can assist by managing the gynecologic adverse effects of psychiatric medications and providing effective contraception and regular screening for sexually transmitted infections. This Committee Opinion will provide basic information about common adolescent mental health disorders, focusing on specific implications for gynecologic and obstetric practice.",

Fatigue is an unrelenting condition that affects physical and mental health, and it has implications for everyday activities, motivation, and social interactions. Although individuals of all ages and both genders are at risk for developing fatigue, postpartum fatigue is particularly challenging, because the new mother has demanding life tasks to accomplish during this period of time. Postpartum fatigue may impact postpartum maternal role attainment and may place a woman at increased risk for postpartum depression. Although several treatable physiological conditions common during the postpartum period are known to increase fatigue, none of these conditions is a part of the usual assessment of healthy postpartum women. For many women, subtle fatigue may develop, linger or worsen, and even lead to depression, with both the woman and her care provider unaware. We all know that postpartum fatigue exists; many of us have experienced it personally. These nurses explain the evidence-based interventions that we can institute for our patients with postpartum fatigue.",

      "abstract": "It is sometimes difficult to plan contraception with a woman who has just delivered a baby, because she is sometime not motivated in the week following delivery, feeling unable to contemplate intercourse because of perineal pain and other discomforts. Effective contraception should be used beginning with the 25th postpartum day because of the subsequent strong possibility of ovulation before the return of menstruation. The woman should be provided with as much information on contraception as possible during this period, and possible contraindications to specific methods should be sought, such as thromboembolic accidents, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, infection, ectopic pregnancy, abortion, and desire for subsequent pregnancy. No request for contraception should be ignored and the same method should not be imposed on all women. The topic of contraception should not be deferred until the postpartum check-up in the 2nd month, because 50% of women will have had intercourse by the end of the 2nd month, often unprotected. Local methods such as spermicides and condoms are effective when the couple is motivated and they are well accepted. The thromboembolic risk appears minimal when oral contraceptives (OCs) are begun on the 15th postpartum day for non-breastfeeding women. OCs should not be prescribed for women after prolonged bedrest, and women who previously used pills should have lipid and glucose tests before the 2nd month postpartum consultation. The low dose progestin pill should be preferred to the low dose combined pill if a potential thromboembolic risk exists. Infants of breastfeeding women using pills receive 1/500 of the estrogen dose administered to the mother and 1/1000 of the progestin dose. No effects of these doses have been found on the growth or genital development of infants, and modifications of milk composition are not constant. A low dose progestin pill beginning on postpartum day 20 may however be preferred. It is better to await the return of menses before inserting an IUD because of the danger of expulsion prior to that time. Local methods should not be the only ones recommended in the immediate postpartum period because of the possibility of poor acceptance and unwanted pregnancy resulting from incorrect use. Very high dose OCs should not be prescribed. Long acting injectable progestins should be avoided for breastfeeding women except in cases of serious psychic disturbance because the quantity of hormones entering the milk is much greater than with pills.",

      "title": "Why Do Women and Some Other Primates Menstruate?",
      "abstract": "WHY DO WOMEN AND SOME OTHER PRIMATES MENSTRUATE? C. A. FINN* The phenomenon of menstruation must have puzzled man since time immemorial. At what period the relationship of menstruation to childbearing was first appreciated is not known, although some association must have been suspected in mediaeval times. Isodore of Seville [1], in the seventh century, wrote, \"After many menstrual days, however, the semen is no longer germinable because there is no menstrual blood by which the ejaculate can be irrigated. Thus semen does not adhere to the female parts; lacking this power to adhere it is lost. Likewise thick semen also lacks the power of growth, being unable to mix with the female blood because of its own excessive thickness. This is why men or women become sterile: from excessive thickness of semen or blood, or from excessive thinness\" [2]. Certainly for hundreds of years myths and superstitions have surrounded the process ofmenstruation, associated predominantly with the idea of uncleanliness. In the Jewish faith, for instance, women are not permitted to carry out any religious functions during the menses, and the menstruating matrons of Rome were not allowed to enter the temples . Intercourse during menstruation was considered to be a peccatum (sin), and women who had primary amenorrhoea were not supposed to marry and, if they did, could be divorced [3]. The uniqueness of menstruation to woman (and a few other primates) may not have been very apparent to early man. The animal most closely associated with him—and probably the only one with a reasonable possibility of having its vaginal discharges noticed—would have been the bitch, and this animal does periodically show a sanguinous discharge from the vagina. In any case, in pre-Darwinian times man was not aware ?Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology, University of Liverpool, Veterinary Field Station, Leahurst, Neston, South Wirral, L64 7TE, United Kingdom.© 1987 by The University of Chicago.

Nevertheless, it is interesting that Isodore of Seville [1] stated that \"women are the only menstrual animal.\" The early medical practitioners assumed that the periodic discharge of blood was an important physiological function in itself. Because of its occasionally putrescent appearance and smell and the attendant pain, it had been assumed since Hippocrates that the period was a form of detoxication of the blood poisoning that women encountered [3]. Isodore said that \"the menstrual flow is woman's superfluous blood,\" and Trotula ofSalerno in the eleventh century [4], quoting no less an authority than Galen, gave very precise details for the treatment ofwomen who failed to menstruate: \"If the menses are lacking and the woman is thin, the vein under the inner arch ofher foot, the internal saphenous, should be lanced. On the first day from one foot, on the following day from the other foot—the blood to be drawn as the case demands.\" However, Isodore of Seville [1] appreciated that the menstrual flow is no ordinary blood: \"On contact with this gore, crops do not generate, wine goes sour, trees lose their fruit, iron is corrupted by rust, copper is blackened. Should dogs eat any of it they go mad. Even bituminous glue which is dissolved neither by rain nor by (strong) water, polluted by this gore, falls apart by itself.\" It is hardly surprising that menstruating women were kept out of temples and not allowed to perform religious functions. In the enlightened Victorian times, when zoologists became interested in reproductive biology, the similarity of the oestrous cycle of other animals to the menstrual cycle of nonprimates was stressed. In 1842 Pouchet [5] suggested that menstruation in women corresponds to the period of sexual excitement in other female mammals. Many of the great biologists of the day, including Marshall [6] and Heape [7], thought that the flow of blood at menstruation was equivalent to the prooestrous flow in dogs. Heape [7] suggested that all animals had a discharge at prooestrus but that the degree of tinting by blood varied such that in some animals the...",

Common menopausal symptoms include vasomotor symptoms, mood swings, concentration issues, vaginal dryness, atrophy of secondary sexual traits, libido loss, musculoskeletal discomfort, osteopenia, and osteoporosis. The most effective treatment for the relief of menopausal symptoms is estrogen, with or without. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is most beneficial before 60 years of age or within 10 years of menopause. Other menopause-related symptoms including mood swings, sleep disturbance, sexual dysfunction, and myalgia may improve with HRT. HRT is also effective in preventing bone loss associated with menopause and in reducing the incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures, including those of the vertebrae and hip.",

Current trials include its use as a once-a-month menses inducer. It can also be utilized for therapeutic interruption at a late stage of pregnancy, and tried as adjuvant treatment in some cases of breast cancer.

The proper development of the placenta allows it to support the fetus throughout pregnancy and expulsion or removal of a normal placenta following delivery, helps prevent postpartum complications. Maintenance of uteroplacental flow during pregnancy and during fetal surgery is important for the survival of the fetus and especially for the remainder of the pregnancy following fetal surgery. Serial monitoring of umbilical artery flow, a marker for uteroplacental insufficiency, is helpful to monitor fetal well-being. Physiology of the fetus correlates with the different stages of development in different organs and in many instances changes at delivery. The prevention of pain or the effects of noxious stimuli during fetal surgery serves many benefits, which include but are not limited to, prevention of release of stress hormones which can play a role in preterm labor and also prevention of long-term neurodevelopmental effects in the fetus.",

Consequently, a number of pathologies are related to such surgery among which placenta previa, dehiscence of previous scar, placenta accreta and preterm delivery. The purpose of this case report is to discuss the physical and psychological implications correlated with a very unusual case of a consecutive seventh CS in the same pregnant woman associated with several diseases: preterm delivery, fetal distress, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) (-4 weeks), central placenta previa with metrorrhagia, dehiscence of hysterectomic scar. In spite of the therapy (antifibrinolytic, tocolytic drugs, iron, folates, betamethasone) a preterm CS could not be avoided. Surgery was challenging; hysterectomy was avoided and the mother followed a normal post-operative course, whereas fetal distress and IUGR did not allow the survival of the newborn. A review of the literature regarding the clinical management and psychological aspects of a pregnant woman undergoing multiple complicated CS with the aforementioned disorders will be undertaken.Il parto cesareo è in continuo incremento in Italia, così come i tagli cesarei multipli. Alcune conseguenze di tali interventi sono: la placenta previa, la deiscenza di cicatrici precedenti, la placenta accreta ed il parto prematuro.

Microperforate hymen can lead to infertility, primary amenorrhea, acute or chronic pelvic pain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, dysuria, pollakiuria or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge. Aim We aim to report a patient who had intercourse problems and infertility complaints later found to have a microper-forate hymen. Discussion Pinhole opening of hymen may permit passage of fluids. Consequently spontaneous pregnancy can occur rarely. A few reports showed pregnancies with intact hymen without penetration of penis. But in general patients have fertility problems. Conclusion The results of the surgery are similar in all techniques and the particular surgical centre will have its own preference of which technique it prefers since after diagnosis definitive treatment is surgical and effective. Failure to manage these patients correctly may have long-term sequelae for their psychological, sexual and reproductive health.",

      "title": "Relationship of Parity, Maternal Age and Birth Weight with the Duration of the Second Stage of Labor",
      "abstract": "Background: second stage of labor begins when the cervix is fully dilated and ends with the birth of a baby. The duration of second stage of labor commonly lasts 2 hours for primigravida mothers and one hour for multigravida mothers. Prolonged labor is one of complications experienced by mothers in second stage of labor. Prolonged labor can cause several complications for both mothers and infants. Prolonged labor can harm both the mother and the infant. The harmful effects of complications during second stage of labor for mothers include the incidence of uterine atony, laceration, bleeding, infection, fatigue and shock and improving the birth rate with the C-section incision. Whereas the harmful effects of complications during second stage of labor for infants include asphyxiated, cerebral trauma caused by pressure on the head of the fetus, the injury due to action, and premature rupture of membranes. The severity of the injury increases continuously along with the longer of the duration of the labor process, and the risk of which rises quickly after 24 hours. The longer the labor, the higher the morbidity as well as the mortality. The stage of labor affected by all such factors mentioned is called the second stage of laborObjective: to find out the relationship of parity, maternal age, and birth weight with the duration of the second stage of labor.Methods: this study applied a quantitative research design using an analytical survey method through a cross sectional approach. The sample in this study was chosen using total sampling method with the purposive sampling technique, namely, that the sample was all maternity mothers who were coincidentally present at the time of the study at UPTD Karya Mukti Public Health Center in August 2021. Then, Chi-square statistical test was used to determine the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable.Results: of the 30 respondents, 20 respondents whose parity was not at risk (95.2%) experienced normal duration of second stage of labor, while 5 respondents (55.6%) whose parity was at risk experienced normal duration of second stage of labor. 21 respondents whose maternal age was not at risk (95.5%) experienced normal duration of second stage of labor, while 4 respondents whose maternal age was at risk (50%) experienced normal duration second stage of labor. 23 respondents (92%) with normal birth weight babies experienced normal duration of second stage of labor, while 2 respondents (40%)with large birth weight babies experienced normal duration of second stage of labor. The results of the Chi-square statistical test showed that there was a significant relationship between parity and the duration of the second stage of labor with the p-value of 0.019 £ 0.05 and the OR value of 9.157. There was a significant relationship between maternal age and the duration of the second stage of labor with the p-value of 0.011 £ 0.05 and the OR value of 5.387, and there was a significant relationship between birth weight and the duration of the second stage of labor with the p-value of 0.022 £ 0.05 and OR value of 3.405.Conclusions: there was a relationship between parity and the duration of second stage of labor. There was a relationship between maternal age and the duration of second stage of labor, and there was a relationship between birth weight and the duration of second stage of labor. Suggestions: It is hoped that health workers will further improve IEC (Information, Education, and Communication) regarding safe gestational age, safe parity and balanced nutrition as a form of antenatal care for pregnant women which is very influential, especially during the second stage of labor. In addition, for pregnant women, it is better to perform quality ANC to predict whether mothers will be likely to experience prolonged labor or not and also to prevent prolonged labor and other complications of pregnancy and labor. Then, based on the results of ANC tests, the mothers immediately referred to a more adequate hospitals/maternity hospitals to monitor the condition of their pregnancy so as to prevent the risk that will be faced by the mothers and fetus during labor.

      "title": "Poor neonatal adaptation syndrome: Toward a clinical consensus to guide research and counseling",
      "abstract": "Untreated or undertreated unipolar perinatal depression (PND) and anxiety are associated with myriad risks for both mother and infant. PND has been associated with adverse maternal outcomes including poor prenatal care, substance use, and suicide,1, 2 adverse obstetric outcomes including preterm labor and birth, operative delivery, and preeclampsia,3, 4 adverse neonatal outcomes including low birth weight and fetal distress,3, 4 and abnormal infant/child development.5 Perinatal anxiety has similarly been associated with preterm birth, low birth weight, being small for gestational age, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and abnormal infant/child development5-7 as well as increased risk of postpartum depression and low breastfeeding rates.8 On the contrary, antenatal antidepressant use, which may be clinically indicated in moderate or severe PND and/or anxiety, has been associated with small absolute risks of congenital malformation, obstetrical complications, and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and is more commonly associated with poor neonatal adaptation syndrome (PNAS).9, 10 Studies evaluating potential risks of antenatal antidepressant use for mother and infant inherently have limitations as they are necessarily observational in design, limiting the quality of the evidence base. Further complicating the issue is the question of clinical relevance; not all statistically significant differences are clinically significant differences, and a critical part of categorizing risk is understanding the magnitude of individual contributory factors. Despite these limitations, clinicians must develop a personalized treatment plan, one that often balances suspected risks, known risks, and unknown risks of antenatal antidepressant use against under/untreated antenatal depression. To determine if antenatal antidepressant treatment is clinically indicated, clinicians should consider factors including current and past psychiatric disorder, symptom severity, suicide risk, current and past psychiatric treatment efficacy and tolerability, medical co-morbidities, family psychiatric history, and patient treatment preference (including psychotherapies and other non-pharmacologic interventions). In addition to the clinician's careful assessment of the patient to determine a treatment plan, individual patients will assess the risks, benefits, and alternatives to antenatal antidepressant use differently according to their own priorities and values, which must be taken in consideration to produce an acceptable treatment plan for the patient. In the present issue of Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica, Kautzky et al present a comprehensive updated systematic review and meta-analysis of studies including women and their infants with antenatal SSRI or SNRI exposure. Among antenatal depressed individuals, a clinically negligible but statistically significant decrease in gestational age as measured in weeks (mean difference = −0.47 [−0.74; −0.21]) in antidepressant exposed infants compared to healthy controls can be compared to clinically negligible but statistically significant decrease in gestational age found for unexposed infants of depressed mothers (mean difference = −0.36, [−0.81, 0.08]) compared to healthy controls. Increases in preterm birth were found in both comparisons between exposed infants and healthy controls (odds ratio = 1.75 [1.38; 2.21]) and between untreated and treated depressed individuals (odds ratio = 2.36 [1.35; 4.15]). Additionally, although a clinically negligible statistically significant increase in low birth weight was found in exposed infants (mean difference = −69.75 grams [−115.51, −23.99]) compared to healthy controls, no such difference was observed between exposed infants and unexposed infants of depressed mothers. Given their analyses, the authors suggest that differences in low birth weight and preterm birth may be largely driven by PND rather than antenatal antidepressant use. PNAS, also referred to as neonatal adaptation syndrome, is a potentially clinically relevant risk to antenatal antidepressant use, and Kautzky et al further categorize its phenomenology and risk.11 PNAS generally refers to an apparently self-limited syndrome of crying, jitteriness, lethargy, mild respiratory distress, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, sleep disturbances, abnormal muscle tone, tremor, and rarely seizures that lasts up to two weeks post-birth.12 The etiology remains unclear, although withdrawal and overstimulation of serotoninergic systems in the infant have alternately been proposed. Kautzky et al evaluated six potential symptoms of PNAS, limited by heterogeneity in reporting and rare occurrence of symptoms, and found that that temperature dysregulation, hypoglycemia, respiratory problems, feeding problems, and convulsions were significantly associated with antenatal antidepressant use while jaundice was not. As convulsions referred to a broad range of symptoms, from tremor to seizure, this finding does not address potential severity of this broadly defined outcome and may represent phenomenologically distinct occurrences. Seeking to comment on clinical relevance through severity, the authors also examined rate of admission to specialized care and APGAR scores. Although increased rates of admission to specialized care were found in exposed infants, the clinical relevance of this finding remains unclear due to lack of information on reason for admission, length of stay, and treatment administered. Significant differences in APGAR score for exposed infants again demonstrated questionable clinical relevance, with absolute decreases in APGAR 1-minute and 5-minute scores at 0.38 and 0.11, respectively. Critical gaps in knowledge remain in our understanding of PNAS that must be closed by further research guided by clinical consensus on disease and symptom measurement. Without continued refinement of understanding of disease, informed risk modification strategies and treatment cannot be developed. Perhaps the most urgent problem to address in PNAS research is the lack of official consensus on symptomatology. Kautzky et al had data sufficient to analyze temperature dysregulation, hypoglycemia, respiratory problems, feeding problems, seizures, and jaundice, but lethargy, sleep disturbance, increased crying/jitteriness, and abnormal muscle tone have also been proposed as potential clinical symptoms of PNAS. Without a consensus on diagnostic parameters, the data gathered in primary studies are necessarily limited, which further limits the ability of meta-analyses to comprehensively characterize prevalence of proposed symptoms. Together with the lack of consensus on symptomatology is the lack of a dedicated psychometric scale to standardize assessment of PNAS due to antenatal antidepressant exposure. Currently, researchers often rely on scales developed for the purposes of other in-utero exposures, such as the Finnegan scoring system for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome,13 or scales designed for global assessment such as the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale.14 Without consensus on what is being measured and how it is being measured, observational studies cannot reliably measure this potential adverse neonatal outcome of maternal antidepressant use. While it is undisputable that the data concerning the risks of antenatal antidepressant use are subject to the limitations of all observational studies as well as limitations related to lack of clinical consensus and appropriate psychometrics, significant work has been undertaken to produce primary data as well as meta-analyses to characterize risk. The present data do allow for comprehensive risk/benefit counseling with acknowledgment of the limitations of the data as well as the potential for unknown risks. Pharmacological management of depression should not be avoided on the basis of the data quality currently informing our knowledge of risk. The risks of untreated depression and anxiety in the perinatal period are similarly well-investigated within the practical limitations that necessitate observational studies within this population. There is mounting evidence that untreated depression and anxiety confers significant risk of adverse maternal, obstetric, neonatal, and child developmental outcomes and that antenatal antidepressant use, while stably associated with some adverse obstetric, neonatal, and child developmental outcomes of varying clinical relevance, does not generally present unacceptable risks compared to the risk of no treatment. Indeed, current clinical consensus is that moderate to severe depression in pregnancy should be treated with antidepressants, in concert with evidence-based psychotherapies and other non-pharmacologic approaches, and antidepressant discontinuation in a symptomatically stable pregnant individual should only occur after an adequate length of symptomatic stability and if the risk of relapse is not unduly high.15, 16 Dr. Deligiannidis receives grant support from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (grants R01MH120313 and R01MH118269), the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Nesos Corporation and Sage Therapeutics.

      "title": "Congenital Imprinting Diseases: Aetiology, Pre- and Perinatal Manifestations, Diagnosis and Care of Affected Families and Pregnancies",
      "abstract": "Abstract Congenital Imprinting Disorders (ImpDis) are caused by abnormal expression of parentally imprinted genes. They are characterized by disturbances of imprinting marks which are a specific type of epigenetic signatures and occur either sporadic or familial. So far, twelve ImpDis have been identified, eight of them manifest prenatally or in the neonate period. With exception of abdominal wall defects, ImpDis are rarely associated with major malformations, but predominant early manifestations are disturbed pre- and/or postnatal growth, muscular hypotonia, neonatal feeding difficulties and metabolic/hormonal dysfunction. With few exceptions prenatal clinical features of ImpDis are unspecific and manifest only in the late second or third trimester. In some ImpDis, behavioural, developmental, and neurological symptoms might emerge, and in single ImpDis there is a higher risk of cancer in childhood. Prenatal diagnosis plays a crucial role in appropriate pregnancy management and initial care of the newborn, which in turn has positive impact on the life-long outcome of the patient. Furthermore, the diagnosis of ImpDis is relevant for the prevention of pregnancy risks such as preeclampsia and possible reproductive problems in future pregnancies and other family members. Genetic analysis is not straightforward, and imprinting disturbances may escape both DNA sequencing analysis and (molecular-)cytogenetic diagnostics. After introducing the topic with a case report, this review focuses on the recognition of ImpDis including maternal and family history, exogeneous and genetic risk factors, fetal imaging, and genetic findings as well as interdisciplinary care and treatment approaches in the management and decision making of affected families and pregnancies.",

      "abstract": "Background: Pregnancy is defined as the period from conception to birth. After the egg is fertilized by a sperm and then implanted in the lining of the uterus, it develops into the placenta and embryo and later into foetus. Pregnancy usually lasts for 40 weeks, beginning from the 1st day of the womens last menstrual period and lasting for 3 months. The changes observed in the system from conception to pregnancy, are principally the following namely- amenorrhoea, morning sickness, fatigue, heart burn, increased salivary discharge, occasionally depravity of appetite , headache, irritability of temper, the pressure of increasing pregnancy, protrusion of umbilicus, sometimes, varicose, swellings of the lower extremities, the breast also enlarge, an areola or brown circle is observed around the nipples and a secretion of lymph, composed of milk and water takes place. Stress is a natural human response that prompts us to address challenges and threats in our lives. It usually happens when a person is in a situation that he or she do not feel like they can manage or control. Stress in pregnancy may lead to higher blood pressure. This puts the pregnant women at risk of serious increased blood pressure, called pre-eclampsia, preterm birth and having a low birth weight infant. Method: This chapter deals with the description of research methodology. It is most important in research as it is the framework in conducting study. It indicates general pattern for organizing the procedure together valid and reliable data for investigations. It includes research designs, population and sample, sampling technique, inclusion and exclusion criteria, instruments, data collection and methods of data collection procedure and data analysis plan. Results :Through this study we came to the conclusion that the maximum samples or the pregnant women had somewhat recovered from their increasing level of stress by the interventions of art therapy that was provided to them for fifteen days and also the mean value of the pretest and the post test score is 20.01 and 14.4, respectively.",

      "title": "Chronic stress during the peripartum period: Implications for mother and offspring",
      "abstract": "Neuroendocrine, neuronal and behavioural peripartum adaptations are essential for the female`s successful adaptive response when becoming maternal. Despite these adjustive mechanisms, the period around birth represents a time with high risk for women to develop mood and anxiety disorders that include a severe confinement of mother-infant interactions. Unfortunately, the aetiology of postpartum mood and anxiety disorders is largely unknown. However, chronic stress during the peripartum period is one major risk factor of such mental illnesses. Therefore, my thesis centered on the premise that by assessing the consequences of peripartum stress, I can provide insight into the mechanisms underlying postpartum mood and anxiety disorders. In order to demonstrate the specificity of such effects to the peripartum period it is necessary to include controls such as males and, particularly, virgin females. \n\nIn this thesis, I demonstrated that chronic stress during either pregnancy or lactation prevented a number of the above mentioned peripartum adaptations. \n\nThus, I could show that chronic stress during pregnancy induces an increase in active maternal care with a concurrent increase in anxiety-related behaviour. Although, chronic stress and increased levels of anxiety are often associated with an increase in depression-like behaviour, I did not observe an effect of chronic stress in this direction. However, using the antidepressant imipramine, I revealed that chronic stress prevented the lactation-associated decrease in the noradrenergic system activity, which in general underlies the observed passive stress-coping behaviour in the FST. Furthermore, I could show that chronic pregnancy stress prevented the lactation-associated basal hypercorticism and the elevation in the OXT system within the PVN. Illustrating the specificity of the stress-induced changes to the peripartum period, most of the parameters were not affected in stressed virgin females. Given the fact that several postpartum psychiatric disorders have been linked to changes in basal ACTH and cortisol levels in humans, the results of the present thesis provide further important evidence that HPA axis dysregulation may be one major mechanism involved in the development of postpartum mood and anxiety disorders. \n\nNaturally, males and females differ in their sensitivity to stress and their stress responsiveness to several stressors. Using chronic restraint as the stress paradigm and adult hippocampal neurogenesis as the readout parameter, I could demonstrate that sex differences do not only occur in the basal HPA axis activity and pattern of hippocampal neurogenesis, but moreover that cell proliferation, cell survival, cell differentiation and stem cell quiescence are differentially affected by chronic stress in male and female rats. These results are of importance for various reasons. First, there is a correlation between chronic stress, neurogenesis and depression and second, females have twice a higher risk to develop depressive disorders compared to males. Thus, the results provide evidence that sex differences in hippocampal neurogenesis may underlie the increased depression-susceptibility in females. Taking these findings, I next assessed the effect of this RS paradigm on the altered neurogenesis that occurs in the peripartum period. Here, I revealed that chronic stress during lactation prevents lactation-associated changes in cell proliferation and survival, but moreover, I showed for the first time that differentiation patterns and stem cell quiescence are altered after chronic lactation stress. The lactation period is a time when the bigger part of metabolic resources is needed to insure healthy survival of the offspring. Therefore, reducing growth processes like neurogenesis and simultaneously increasing efficiency might be an important adaptive mechanism of the lactation period. \n\nBeside the effects of chronic stress on the mother, I provided a wide-ranging of basic knowledge about the effect of early life stress on the adult emotional and social behaviour in the offspring. Importantly, I demonstrated that not only the timing of the stressor plays a pivotal role, but moreover that postnatal maternal-infant interaction in the form of maternal care is seminal for the adult behavioural outcome of the offspring. While prenatal stress induced an anxiety-related and depression-like phenotype in adulthood, postnatal stress rather led to deficits in social behaviour. Although an increase in active maternal care was effective to restore the effect of postnatal stress on social behaviour, it did not restore prenatal induced stress effects. Thus, it seems that regulatory mechanisms that are fundamental for adult affective behaviour undergo a critical stage of development during the prenatal stage and a disruption of these processes might not be rescued by increased amounts of maternal care. However, a high quantity of maternal care might be able to restore deficits in social behaviour when occurring simultaneously with postnatal stress exposure. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying the observed time-dependent differences in behaviour have not been subject of investigation in this thesis. However, future studies will concentrate to identify mechanism that are involved in the regulation of adult affective and social behaviours that might also underlie psychopathologies like anxiety disorders, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders and schizophrenia, which have all been associated with early life stress exposure.",

      "abstract": "Persistent Mullerian Duct Syndrome in a 71-Year-Old Man, Case Report H. Salehi MD , M.R. Vatani Baf MD Received:27/06/06 Sent for Revision: 11/10/06 Received Revised Manuscript: 07/02/07 Accepted: 12/02/07 Background and Objective: Normal sexual differentiation occurs in the 6th embryonic week and in a normal embryonic life. Both wolffian and mullerian ducts are present until the onset of sexual differentiation. Normal sexual differentiation is directed by the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome (SRY). Secretion of mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) by sertoli cells results in regression of the mullerian duct in males. Any disruption of orderly steps in sexual differentiation may be reflected clinically as variants of the intersexes syndromes. One of the rarest forms of these syndromes is Persistent Mullerian Duct Syndrome (PMDS). This syndrome is caused by lack of regression and development of mullerian system and formation of female genital tract including uterus, fallopian tubes and two thirds of upper part of vaginal in male. While bilateral cryptorchidism, inguinal hernia and infertility are usually associated with this syndrome, external genital organs are normal. The diagnosis is usually made in the first years of life. Case Report: The presented case, a 71-year-old man, admitted to the surgical ward of Ali-ebn-Abitalib Hospital in Rafsanjan was diagnosed with a large right inguinal hernia. Physical examination of external genital tract was normal. The findings at operation were as follows: the uterus was attached to spermatic cord in the internal ring. Hysterectomy was done. Orchiectomy was also performed due to severe adhesion of the uterus to spermatic cord and rupture of the spermatic vessels. Pathologic examination of the resected tissues confirmed the diagnosis of PMDS. Conclusion: This syndrome is typically diagnosed by cryptorchidism and inguinal hernia during early years of life. Infertility is also a common finding in this syndrome. Although, there are a number of diagnostic procedures including sonography for detection of PMDS, this syndrome is almost recognised through operations casual. Rarity of PMDS and also unusual findings regarding this case including old age, the absence of infertility and cryptorchidism were the reasons for reporting this case.

      "abstract": "The facial nerve is cranial nerve number seven. A facial nerve palsy is a form of severe weakness of muscles of the face or paralysis due to swelling or any other kind of injury to the seventh nerve. Bell's palsy is the most common reason for facial nerve palsy in both pregnant and non-pregnant women, as well as in men and children. Palsy of the facial nerve is increased in conditions like pregnancy, diabetes, myasthenia gravis, Lyme disease, and multiple sclerosis, among others. The frequency of Bell's palsy in pregnant women is about three times that of an average person. There are several theories that have not been proven as to why this is the case. They are elevation of clotting factors in the blood, total body water causing compression and swelling of the facial nerve, increased level of female hormones like estrogen and progesterone, and the weakening of immune system in the third trimester of pregnancy, leading to reactivation of many viruses. Also, Bell's palsy during pregnancy has been linked to pre-eclampsia, which is also referred to as pregnancy-induced high blood pressure. Other associated factors are hemolysis, low platelets, which is a variant of pre-eclampsia, and elevated liver enzymes. Women are also susceptible to paralysis after childbirth. Most of the women who develop Bell's palsy after pregnancy start showing signs and symptoms seven to 10 days after the date of delivery.",

      "abstract": "The potential effects of epidural analgesia on the progress of labor and the incidence of operative or instrumental delivery has been a subject of lasting controversy, particularly between obstetricians and anesthesiologists. This controversy is difficult to resolve since it is almost impossible to devise fully randomized, prospective studies comparing different modes of pain relief during the first stage of labor. There is no lack of retrospective reviews. Most of them indicate that epidural analgesia is associated with longer labors and/or an increased incidence of forceps delivery or cesarean section [1Johnson W.L. Winter W.W. Eng M. Bonica J.J.

Most authors tend to see a casual relationship, even though, without randomization, selection bias cannot be ruled out. Women having a painful and protracted labor (malpresentation, dystocia) are more likely to request epidural analgesia than the less affected 'controls'. The same patients are also more likely to require an operative or instrumental delivery. Further, obstetricians are more prone to shorten the second stage of labor with the use of forceps or vacuum extractor when epidural analgesia is present. There are several reports indicating that epidural analgesia has no adverse effects on the progress of labor or the woman's ability to deliver vaginally [12Friedman E.A.

Uterine activity usually has significant effect on the progress of labor. Early studies showed that induction of caudal or lumbar epidural analgesia resulted in a transient decrease in uterine contractility, lasting 10–30 min [18Vasicka A. Kretchmer H.

In some of these reports this was attributed to the addition of epinephrine to the local anesthetic solution [[20]Craft J.B. Epstein B.S. Coakley C.S.

The effect of epidural anesthesia on uterine activity and blood pressure.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1976; 125: 846-854Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar]. Interestingly, the rate of cervical dilation was not affected by the temporary decrease in uterine activity [[18]Vasicka A. Kretchmer H. Effect of conduction and inhalation anesthesia on uterine contractions.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1961; 82: 609-611Google Scholar,[20]Craft J.B. Epstein B.S. Coakley C.S. Effect of lidocaine with epinephrine versus lidocaine (plain) on induced labor.Anesth Analg. 1972; 51: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar]. In another study, uterine activity was not altered by induction of epidural analgesia so long as the supine position was avoided [[23]Schellenberg J.C. Uterine activity during lumbar epidural analgesia with bupivacaine.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1977; 127: 26-31PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar], thus preventing aortocaval compression, which is known to reduce uterine contractility [[24]Caldeyro-Barcia R. Noriega-Guerra L. Cibils L.A. et al.Effect of position changes on the intensity and frequency of uterine contractions during labor.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1960; 80: 284-290Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar]. Administration of epidural analgesia may also lead to an increase in uterine activity, particularly an elevation of basal tone, and prolonged decelerations of the fetal heart [[25]Steiger R.M. Nageotte M.P. Effect of uterine contractility and maternal hypotension on prolonged decelerations after bupivacaine epidural anesthesia.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1990; 163: 808-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar]. The most recent investigations have centered on the effects of epidural analgesia on the duration of the second stage of labor and the incidence of instrumental delivery. These were conducted in a prospective, randomized way, since it is not considered unethical to discontinue the analgesia once the uterine cervix has reached full dilatation and the mother is encouraged to bear down. With the use of bupivacaine 0.25%, given by intermittent top-up injections, maintenance of epidural analgesia throughout labor did not prolong the second stage or increase the forceps delivery rate by comparison with patients in whom top-up injections were withheld during the second stage of labor [[26]Phillips K.C. Thomas T.A. Second stage of labour with or without extradural analgesia.Anaesthesia. 1983; 38: 972-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar]. Similar results were obtained with a continuous epidural infusion of 0.75% of lidocaine [[27]Chestnut D.H. Bates J.N. Choi W.W. Continuous infusion epidural analgesia with lidocaine: efficacy and influence during the second stage of labor.Obstet Gynecol. 1987; 69: 323-327PubMed Google Scholar]. The duration of the second stage of labor and the frequency of operative delivery were similar in women receiving lidocaine throughout labor and in those having normal saline substituted for the local anesthetic after the uterine cervix reached 8 cm dilatation. In contrast, a study involving continuous infusion of bupivacaine 0.125%, to nulliparous women showed that maintaining epidural analgesia beyond 8 cm cervical dilatation resulted in a prolongation of the second stage of labor (124 ± 70 min vs. 94 ± 54 min in the saline group) and an increased frequency of instrumental delivery (53% vs. 28%) [[28]Chestnut D.H. Vandewalker G.E. Owen C.I. et al.The influence of continuous bupivacaine analgesia on the second stage of labor and method of delivery in nulliparous women.Anesthesiology. 1987; 66: 774-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar]. Later on, the same group of investigators reported that with the continuous epidural infusion of 0.0625% bupivacaine, with 0.0002% fentanyl, maintenance of analgesia beyond cervical dilatation of 8 cm had no effect on the duration of the second stage of labor or the incidence of instrumental delivery [[29]Chestnut D.H. Laszewski L.J. Pollack K.L. et al.Continuous epidural infusion of 0.0625% bupivacaine – 0.0002% fentanyl during the second stage of labor.Anesthesiology. 1990; 72: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar]. Thus reducing the concentration of bupivacaine, made possible by the addition of fentanyl, had a salutory effect on the woman's ability to achieve spontaneous vaginal delivery. With intermittent epidural injections of bupivacaine 0.125%, the addition of sufentanil 10–30 μg, significantly reduced the incidence of instrumental deliveries (from 36 to 24%) [[30]Vertommen J.D. Vandermeulen E. Van Aken H. et al.The effects of the addition of sufentanil to 0.125% bupivacaine on the quality of analgesia during labor and the incidence of instrumental deliveries.Anesthesiology. 1991; 74: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar]. The authors attributed this to the prolongation of the block and reduced local anesthetic requirement with the addition of sufentanil. The only study in which the effects of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) on the incidence of dystocia and instrumental delivery were evaluated showed that these complications were more frequent among nulliparous women with PROM than among those in whom contractions preceded PROM [[31]Kong A.S. Bates S.J. Rizk B. Rupture of membranes before the onset of spontaneous labour increases the likelihood of instrumental delivery.Br J Anaesth. 1992; 68: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar]. This was independent of the choice of analgesia used during labor and the authors concluded that any study which aims to examine the effect of epidural analgesia on the outcome of labor should include PROM as a bias factor. Another serious bias may be introduced by the patient's choice of service. At least one study revealed a marked difference in cesarean section rate among nulliparous women attending clinic versus private services [[32]Neuhoff D. Burke S. Porreco R.P. Cesarean birth for failed progress of labor.Obstet Gynecol. 1989; 73: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar]. The use of epidural analgesia was similar in both services (approximately 42%), but the cesarean section rate was approximately 5% among the clinic patients compared with approximately 17% for the private patients. Failure to progress was diagnosed in 0.5% and 14% of clinic and private patients, respectively. Very recently published papers indicate that some researchers were able to conduct prospective, randomized studies comparing the effects of epidural conduction blockade with systemic narcotic analgesia [33Thorp J.A. Hu D. Albin R. et al.The effect of intrapartum epidural analgesia on nulliparous labor: a randomized, controlled, prospective trial.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1993; 169: 851-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 34Chestnut D.H. Vincent Jr., R.D. McGrath J.M. et al.Does early administration of epidural analgesia affect obstetric outcome in nulliparous women who are receiving oxytocin?.Anesthesiology. 1994; 80: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 35Chestnut D.H. McGrath J.M. Vincent Jr., R.D. et al.Does early administration of epidural analgesia affect obstetric outcome in nulliparous women who are in spontaneous labor?.Anesthesiology. 1994; 80: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. The results of one are startling. Analgesia was begun at cervical dilatation of approximately 4 cm. The group receiving epidural analgesia had a significant prolongation of the first and second stages of labor [[33]Thorp J.A. Hu D. Albin R. et al.The effect of intrapartum epidural analgesia on nulliparous labor: a randomized, controlled, prospective trial.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1993; 169: 851-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar]. Further, epidural analgesia was associated with a significant increase in malposition and cesarean delivery occurred more frequently in the epidural group (25% vs. 2.2% in the narcotic group), primarily due to a higher incidence of dystocia. These results are contradicted by two other studies in which patients were randomized to receive epidural bupivacaine at a cervical dilatation of at least 3 cm but less than 5 cm, or intravenous nalbuphine followed by epidural bupivacaine only after the cervix was at least 5 cm dilated [[34]Chestnut D.H. Vincent Jr., R.D. McGrath J.M. et al.Does early administration of epidural analgesia affect obstetric outcome in nulliparous women who are receiving oxytocin?.Anesthesiology. 1994; 80: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar,[35]Chestnut D.H. McGrath J.M. Vincent Jr., R.D. et al.Does early administration of epidural analgesia affect obstetric outcome in nulliparous women who are in spontaneous labor?.Anesthesiology. 1994; 80: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. There were no differences between groups in the duration of labor, in the incidence of malposition, and in the incidence of instrumental or operative delivery. The same results were obtained in a group of nulliparous women receiving oxytocin [[34]Chestnut D.H. Vincent Jr., R.D. McGrath J.M. et al.Does early administration of epidural analgesia affect obstetric outcome in nulliparous women who are receiving oxytocin?.Anesthesiology. 1994; 80: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar] and in another group who were in spontaneous labor [[35]Chestnut D.H. McGrath J.M. Vincent Jr., R.D. et al.Does early administration of epidural analgesia affect obstetric outcome in nulliparous women who are in spontaneous labor?.Anesthesiology. 1994; 80: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. In summary, the available data indicate that the effects of epidural analgesia may vary, depending on the timing and extent of the block, position of the patient, the choice and concentration of local anesthetic, and the addition of epinephrine or an opioid. Finally, premature rupture of membranes and the choice of obstetrical service may be the most important factors affecting the course of labor and delivery.",

      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhea is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain. It negatively affects patients' quality of life and sometimes results in activity restriction. A history and physical examination, including a pelvic examination in patients who have had vaginal intercourse, may reveal the cause. Primary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain in the absence of pelvic pathology. Abnormal uterine bleeding, dyspareunia, noncyclic pain, changes in intensity and duration of pain, and abnormal pelvic examination findings suggest underlying pathology (secondary dysmenorrhea) and require further investigation. Transvaginal ultrasonography should be performed if secondary dysmenorrhea is suspected. Endometriosis is the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea. Symptoms and signs of adenomyosis include dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, and a uniformly enlarged uterus. Management options for primary dysmenorrhea include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hormonal contraceptives. Hormonal contraceptives are the first-line treatment for dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis. Topical heat, exercise, and nutritional supplementation may be beneficial in patients who have dysmenorrhea; however, there is not enough evidence to support the use of yoga, acupuncture, or massage.",

      "abstract": "Despite intensive investigation, it is unclear whether the diagnosis of placental abruption should be based on established clinical criteria or histopathological findings. Although the vast majority of placental abruption cases appear to have a chronic etiology, it also remains speculative as to whether abruption is an acute or chronic process. The aim of the present multicenter, case-control study was to assess the concordance between clinical and histopathological diagnostic indicators of placental abruption. A secondary aim was to investigate acute and chronic histological lesions associated with clinical abruption. The clinical and histologic criteria for abruption were compared using data obtained from the New Jersey-Placental Abruption Study. The study subjects, 162 women with a confirmed clinical diagnosis of placental abruption, were matched with 173 controls without placental abruption. Criteria for the clinical diagnosis of placental abruption included painful vaginal bleeding accompanied by nonreassuring fetal status, uterine hypertonicity, evidence of clinically significant retroplacental bleeding, or clot(s) or placental abruption diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound. The pathological criteria for a diagnosis of abruption included hematoma with or without recent or old infarctions, foci of villous compression, fibrin deposition, and hemosiderin-laden histiocytes in cases with older hematomas. Histologic lesions were grouped as acute or chronic histologic lesions. Acute lesions included chorioamnionitis, funisitis, acute deciduitis, meconium-stained membranes associated with amnion necrosis and pigmented macrophages, villous stromal hemorrhage, and villous edema. Chronic lesions included chronic deciduitis, maternal floor decidual necrosis, decidual vasculopathy, placental infarction, villous mal-development with delayed or accelerated maturation, hemosiderin deposition, intervillous thrombosis, and villitis. Of the 162 clinically diagnosed cases, only 30.2% (n = 49) were confirmed as placental abruption based on gross or histological findings, whereas the specificity for a histologic confirmation of abruption was 100%. Among clinically diagnosed cases, the most common indication for a clinical diagnosis of abruption was evidence of retroplacental clot(s) or bleeding (77.1%). Two chronic lesions, placental infarction and decidual vasculopathy, were significantly associated with abruption, but no acute lesions were significantly associated with abruption. The investigators conclude from these finding that there is poor concordance between the clinical and pathological diagnosis of placental abruption. The diagnosis of abruption should be based on clinical criteria such as evidence of retroplacental bleeding or clot(s), ultrasound visualization of abruption, or painful vaginal bleeding accompanied by either nonreassuring fetal status or uterine hypertonocity.",

      "abstract": "Hyperemesis gravidarum is excessive nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. This dangerous vomiting is differentiated from the normal morning sickness commonly experienced by pregnant women because its intensity exceeds normal vomiting and lasts during the first trimester of pregnancy. One complication as a direct result of pregnancy is hyperemesis gravidarum, where this complication can be detected and prevented regularly during pregnancy. Nausea and vomiting occur in 60-80% of Primigravida and 40-60% of Multigravida. In one in 1000 pregnancies these symptoms become more severe. This feeling of nausea is caused by increased levels of the hormones estrogen and hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) in the serum. The physiological influence of this increase in hormones is not clear, perhaps due to the central nervous system or insufficient gastric emptying. This hyperemesis can cause dehydration and hunger, the cause of which is unknown. Psychological factors can trigger or worsen vomiting. Weight loss and dehydration. Dehydration can cause changes in electrolyte levels in the blood so that the blood becomes too acidic. If vomiting continues, liver damage can occur. Another complication is bleeding in the retina caused by increased blood pressure when the sufferer vomits. Patients are treated and receive fluids, glucose, electrolytes and vitamins via IV.

      "title": "Impact of animal health on reproduction of dairy cows",
      "abstract": "Many of the diseases that affect dairy cattle either in confinement or pasture-based systems typically occur in the first two months of lactation, before the first postpartum insemination. The increased susceptibility to metabolic and infectious diseases with parturition and the onset of lactation poses a major challenge to reproduction. A wealth of information in the scientific literature is available linking diseases with depressed reproduction in dairy cows. Unfortunately, only few studies have established a causal relationship between a specific disease and fertility, and little is known about the mechanisms that underlie the decrease in pregnancy in dairy cows that had disease in early lactation. It is clear that dairy cows that suffer from disease processes have impaired resumption of postpartum ovulation, compromised fertilization and preand peri-implantation conceptus development, altered conceptus gene expression, increased pregnancy loss and, ultimately reduced pregnancy per insemination that causes an extension in time to pregnancy. Because mechanisms are poorly understood, no target intervention is available at this time to reverse the poor reproduction in cows that develop periparturient diseases, except methods to induce cyclicity in anovular cows or to improve insemination rate in cows not detected in estrus. Regardless of a better understanding of the underlying biology of poor fertility in diseased cows, a pivotal approach is to implement strategies that mitigate the risk factors that predispose cows to disease. Such interventions include, but are not limited to, improving transition cow management and grouping, proper dietary formulation to prevent periparturient diseases associated with intermediary and mineral metabolism, strategies for reducing calving-related disorders, and methods to prevent mastitis and lameness. Future developments in target strategies to improve reproduction of cows suffering from peripartum diseases will require a better understanding of the impaired biological processes that compromise establishment and maintenance of pregnancy in this subfertile population of cows.",

      "abstract": "Abstrak Tujuan untuk mengetahui lebih dalam tentang turun peranakan atau prolaps alat genitalia dapat disamakan dengan suatu hernia, dimana suatu organ genitalia turun ke dalam vagina, bahkan mungkin keluar liang vagina. Hal ini karena kelemahan otot fasia dan ligamen penyokongnya. Kerusakan pada penyangga vagina dapat terjadi dalam satu lokasi saja (misalnya, dinding vagina anterior saja), tetapi lebih sering terjadi kombinasi. Metode merangkum daftar referensi terupdate sebagai bahan artikel yang dapat menjadi pedoman dan tatalaksana prolaps organ panggul. Hasil tidak semua prolaps alat genitalia membutuhkan terapi, karena banyak penderita tidak mempunyai keluhan, terutama stadium I dan kadang-kadang stadium II. Pada mereka yang mempunyai keluhan tentu perlu penanganan dengan tepat agar penderita merasa lebih baik. Prolaps uteri stadium II dan III dipilih vaginal histerektomi dan disertai dengan kolporafi anterior dan kolpoperineorafi, Hal ini terutama bila penderita sudah mengalami manaupose atau tidak memerlukan lagi organ reproduksi. Kesimpulan, walaupun tidak mengancam nyawa, akan tetapi prolapsus alat genitalia dapat menurunkan kualitas hidup wanita. Kata kunci : Prolap alat genital, kualitas hidup wanita",

      "abstract": "As in many other livestock diseases, diarrhea in young beef calves can be the symptom of the primary disease, or merely the result of a secondary or concurrent disease. The initial physical exam needs to look for respiratory disease, umbilical infection which may or may not have spread to the joints, and any evidence of birth defects or neurological conditions. Anything that interfers with nursing and the intake of adequate colostrum usually will result in diarrhea. It also is imperative to examine the cow for evidence of mastitis, uterine infection, or other diseases which may have impaired milk supply or produced more than the calf could easily handle (think Holstein-cross cows).&#x0D; This may be easier said than done, since many times the first examination of the calf takes place in the pasture.",

      "title": "Management of perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Most women worldwide experience menopausal symptoms during the menopause transition or postmenopause. Vasomotor symptoms are most pronounced during the first four to seven years but can persist for more than a decade, and genitourinary symptoms tend to be progressive. Although the hallmark symptoms are hot flashes, night sweats, disrupted sleep, and genitourinary discomfort, other common symptoms and conditions are mood fluctuations, cognitive changes, low sexual desire, bone loss, increase in abdominal fat, and adverse changes in metabolic health. These symptoms and signs can occur in any combination or sequence, and the link to menopause may even be elusive. Estrogen based hormonal therapies are the most effective treatments for many of the symptoms and, in the absence of contraindications to treatment, have a generally favorable benefit:risk ratio for women below age 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause. Non-hormonal treatment options are also available. Although a symptom driven treatment approach with individualized decision making can improve health and quality of life for midlife women, menopausal symptoms remain substantially undertreated by healthcare providers.",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is a disorder in all facets of sexual activity and can occur in many ways in patients with disabilities. It ranges from the \"low level\" of altered function in the sexual organs to the \"highest level\" of person's trust. All medical expertise is based primarily on the medical mechanical problems of penile erectile and ejaculatory dysfunction. The main problems of sexual dysfunction occur only when the patient approaches. For people with spinal cord injuries, sexual function has been identified as a priority for recovery. Recovery of sexual function is extremely important and constitutes an area of unmet need for people with spinal cord injuries. It would be the highest priority for people with paraplegia and the second highest priority in people with tetraplegia after recovering arm and hand function. Sexuality is a complex issue, and although we know our patients well, we often do not progress beyond the medical problem of erection, fertility, or contraception. For biologically effective sexual activity, an erection should occur with predictability, and vaginal lubrication based on adequate sexual arousal should facilitate comfortable sexual intercourse.",

      "title": "Factors Affecting Maternal Perception of Fetal Movement",
      "abstract": "Maternal perception of fetal movement is an important screening method for fetal well-being, as decreased fetal movement is associated with a range of pregnancy pathologies and poor pregnancy outcomes. An understanding of factors that may affect perception could help clinicians to determine the importance of maternal reports of decreased fetal movement. This review considers factors that may affect maternal perception of fetal movement and the sensitivity of maternal perception of fetal movements in comparison with ultrasound and other objective methods of movement detection. There is conflicting evidence on whether parity, gestational age, overweight and obesity, and placental location affect perception. This may be related to the small sample sizes of available studies and lack of consistent definitions of factors that may affect the ability of mothers to perceive movement. There is some evidence that psychological factors and duration of fetal movement may affect perception, and that strong movements and those including trunk movement are more likely to be perceived. The proportion of fetal breathing movements that mothers perceive has not been investigated. Research is also lacking as to whether there needs to be contact of fetal part(s) with maternal structures for movement to be perceived, and whether fetal position, amniotic fluid volume, maternal position, sedatives, or other drugs affect movement perception. Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians Learning Objectives: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to define variables that may affect a mother's ability to perceive fetal movements, describe different methods of fetal movement counting, and summarize how fetal movements may be related to fetal well-being.",

We report the case of a 27-year-old woman who had eclampsia on the 6th postpartum day after cesarean section with a throbbing headache as the only prodromal symptom and normal blood pressure (BP) recordings at the time of convulsion. She was managed successfully with magnesium sulfate therapy. This case emphasizes that headache and/or visual changes developing during the postpartum period can be the only warning symptom of impending eclampsia and that LPE can occur even when the BP has normalized post-delivery.

Pregnancy is a condition in which the foetus meets higher calcium demands to which the mother responds by higher intestinal absorption and/or mobilisation of bone calcium. This condition can be rarely associated with the development of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures, usually in the first pregnancy. It is still unknown whether osteoporosis in pregnancy is a result of the mother?s maladaptation to higher demands on calcium turnover, or the woman started pragnancy with a lower peak bone mass. CASE OUTLINE. This is a report of a 30-year old woman with severe osteoporosis diagnosed after her first delivery (T score L2-L4 -4,8). This woman was followed-up nine years later, during which period she had two more pregnancies. CONCLUSION. The appearance of rare, but serious osteoporosis in the third trimester of pregnancy requires close attention and further investigation of pregnant women, especially in case of the present hip or spine pain.",

Numerous reports have suggested that exercise is associated with improved mood and symptoms. In those reports, however, the diagnosis of PMS was not clearly documented, nor was the exercise carefully controlled. Preliminary evidence suggests that exercise training in ovulatory, sedentary women and intensified training in women athletes decrease mild premenstrual symptoms. Although conditioning exercise is associated with short luteal phase and anovulatory cycles, decreases in mild premenstrual symptoms occur prior to menstrual cycle changes. Controlled studies of PMS and exercise training may not only document an effective, nonpharmacologic therapy for PMS but also clarify the hormonal etiology of this complex biobehavioral phenomenon.",

Unpublished interviews from mothers who attended two tertiary teaching hospitals in Sydney, Australia and international Internet blogs/websites were also utilised. Maternal birth trauma seems to be a common cause of pelvic floor dysfunction. Women who have sustained birth trauma to the levator ani muscle or the anal sphincters are often injured more seriously than generally believed. There often is a substantial latency between trauma and the manifestation of symptoms. Urinary and faecal incontinence, prolapse and sexual dysfunction are commonly seen as too embarrassing to discuss with clinicians, and frequently, new mothers have inaccurate recollections of obstetric procedures that occurred without much explanation or explicit consent. Moreover, somatic trauma may contribute to psychological trauma and post‐traumatic stress disorder. The link between somatic and psychological trauma is poorly understood.",

      "title": "Dysmenorrhea and recent treatment options in adolescents and young adults",
      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhea, or primary dysmenorrhea (PD), marked by menstrual cramps in the lower abdomen, is a common but often overlooked condition affecting a considerable number of women. The impact of dysmenorrhea extends beyond physical pain, often causing considerable disruption to daily activities, work, and social interactions. It significantly affects the quality of life, often causing absenteeism from school or work. Increased intrauterine prostaglandin secretion is linked to pelvic pain in PD. Diagnosis relies mainly on clinical assessment, considering symptoms and physical examination, with treatment aimed to enhance the quality of life. These menstrual cramps are frequently accompanied by other symptoms, such as headaches and nausea, which are believed to be due to prostaglandins released as the endometrium breaks down. A literature search using the keywords dysmenorrhea, menstrual pain, and hormonal contraceptives was done using the following databases: Google Scholar, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Pubmed, and Scopus for articles published from 2015 to 2024. The literature study was done to find the connection of dysmenorrhea and menstrual pain with hormonal contraceptives. Common treatments include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormonal contraceptives, and non-pharmacological interventions. This review provides an in-depth analysis of recent treatment advancements for dysmenorrhea, focusing on its pathophysiology, clinical diagnosis, and impact on women's quality of life. It evaluates current and emerging treatments, including pharmacological interventions, non-pharmacological therapies, surgical approaches, hormonal treatments, and investigational drugs, aiming to identify improvements in efficacy and side effects.",

      "abstract": "Since the last decade, lumbar epidural analgesia has gained widespread use in obstetrics. Approximately 80% of parturients receive epidural analgesia for labour and vaginal delivery as well as caesarean section in most centres. There is little doubt that the most successful application of epidural analgesia during labour, considered by more than 75% of primiparas as extremely painful. The quality of analgesia is far superior to that which can be achieved by either parenteral or inhalation approaches and, unlike these methods, the mother remains alert. Epidural analgesia also prevents, or greatly diminishes, most of the physiological and chemical responses to labour pain that can be considered as stress responses, similar to those that have been described during surgery. There are considerable benefits, therefore, to both mother and child. Thus, epidural analgesia usually can be extended to relieve both uterine pain and pain related to distension of the lower birth canal, as well as providing analgesia for forceps delivery or caesarean section. Epidural analgesia allows the mother to be awake, minimizes or completely avoids the problems of maternal aspiration and avoids neonatal drug depression from general anaesthetics. If the most popular indication for epidural analgesia is the provision of pain relief, there are certain complications of pregnancy in which epidural analgesia appears to be indicated on therapeutic grounds such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, breech delivery, multiple pregnancy, incoordinate uterine action and fetal and/or maternal medical complications.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background/introduction</h3> Although abortions performed at earlier gestations are relatively medically safer and less costly, nonetheless in many settings there exists a small minority of women who receive abortions in the second trimester. The difficult circumstances faced by women seeking later abortions have been highlighted, but it is not always clear what factors lead to abortions being performed later in pregnancy. <h3>Aim(s)/objectives</h3> To identify the causative factors of later (second trimester) abortion, analyse the impact of service provision on timing of abortion and highlight other factors relevant to delay in seeking or obtaining abortion. <h3>Methods</h3> A literature search was conducted using Medline and Embase databases, and results were limited to English language studies from the last 20 years in settings where termination of pregnancy was legally available. <h3>Results</h3> Most delays tended to act on one or more of three periods: identification of pregnancy, decision-making, and obtaining an abortion having made a decision. Delays in suspecting or confirming the pregnancy were key drivers in later termination and were particularly pronounced in young people; service-related delays were common, though small, and were often compounded by logistical factors such as financial difficulties. <h3>Discussion/conclusion</h3> The causes of later abortion are many and complex, and very commonly overlap; more research is needed to analyse how these factors interact to cause delay. The association of low socioeconomic status with increased abortion delay suggests more must be done to ensure the accessibility of abortion services.",

      "title": "Effects of In Utero Exposure to AEDs on Morphology and Neurodevelopment",
      "abstract": "Abstract The presentations and clinical courses of patients with bipolar disorder differ greatly by gender. In addition, medical therapy must be tailored differently for men and women because of emerging safety concerns unique to the female reproductive system. In November 2005, these topics were explored by a panel of experts in psychiatry, neurology, and reproductive health at a closed roundtable meeting in Dallas, Texas. This clinical information monograph summarizes the highlights of that meeting. Compared to men with bipolar disorder, women have more pervasive depressive symptoms and experience more major depressive episodes. They are also at higher risk for obesity and certain other medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Mood changes across the menstrual cycle are common, although the severity, timing, and type of changes are variable. Bipolar disorder is frequently associated with menstrual abnormalities and ovarian dysfunction, including polycystic ovarian syndrome. Although some cases of menstrual disturbance precede the treatment of bipolar disorder, it is possible that valproate and/or antipsychotic treatment may play a contributory role in young women. Pregnancy does not protect against mood episodes in untreated women. Maintenance of euthymia during pregnancy is critical because relapse during this period strongly predicts a difficult postpartum course. Suspending therapy in the first months of pregnancy may be an option for some women with mild-to-moderate illness, or those with a long history of euthymia during pre-pregnancy treatment. However, a mood stabilizer should be reintroduced either in the later stages of pregnancy or in the immediate postpartum period. Preliminary data suggest that fetal exposure to some mood stabilizers may raise the risk of major congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental delays. For women planning to become pregnant, clinicians may consider switching to other drugs before conception. The value and drawbacks of breastfeeding during treatment must be considered in partnership with the patient, with close monitoring of nursing infants thereafter. The risks and benefits of medical treatment for women with bipolar disorder should be carefully reconsidered at each stage of their reproductive lives, with a flexible approach that is responsive to the changing needs of patients and their families.",

      "title": "Revisiting the “Do No Harm” Principle: Exploring Early Surgical Menopause in Marginalized Tribal Communities of Santhal Pargana, Jharkhand",
      "abstract": "Menopause frequently occurs as a natural process, but it can also be deliberately triggered through medical or surgical means for a variety of reasons. Surgical menopause refers to the cessation of natural estrogen production in a woman who is still in her premenopausal stage, which happens following a bilateral oophorectomy.[1] This surgical procedure is commonly performed alongside a hysterectomy, either due to benign conditions such as heavy menstrual bleeding, fibroids, endometriosis, or persistent pelvic pain, or due to malignant conditions such as ovarian carcinoma, Lynch syndrome, or BRCA 1/2 mutation. The symptoms experienced during surgical menopause are generally akin to those of natural menopause or chemically induced menopause. However, due to the abrupt loss of ovarian function in this case, women may encounter long term side effects. These could include a heightened risk of conditions such as pulmonary and colorectal cancer, coronary disease, stroke, cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, psychiatric disorders, and osteoporosis.[2,3] According to data obtained from the National Family and Health Survey, the prevalence of hysterectomy in India stands at 3.2%, with significant variations observed between different states. For instance, Bihar has a prevalence of 5.4%, while Andhra Pradesh has a prevalence of 8.9%.[4] Approximately 70% of these procedures took place within the private health-care sector, particularly demonstrating elevated figures within the less educated rural communities. This trend can be attributed to their beliefs, the convenient access to local medical practitioners, and the availability of such services.[4] In the region of Jharkhand, particularly within the significant tribal expanse known as the Santhal Pargana in eastern India, there exists a dearth of comprehensive literature, largely stemming from instances of cases not being reported or being underreported. In the Indian scenario, indiscriminate hysterectomy is a common procedure that is frequently motivated by fear of cancer of reproductive organs and the belief that the uterus can be removed to treat unrelated somatic issues.[4] This trend is also very common in the largest tribal part of India, situated in Jharkhand, known as Santhal Pargana. This draws attention to the issue of India's rising early unindicated hysterectomy incidence and the lack of comprehensive care for women suffering from the debilitating condition of chronic pelvic pain and vaginal discharge and these are not indications of pelvic inflammatory disease and hysterectomy. In a nation like India, which is still battling urgent issues such as maternal mortality and cervical cancer screening, the misuse of women's health fears and doubts is a public health concern. We had encountered approximately 100 patients with a history of early surgical menopause during their early 30 s, in the last 2 years, with a history of lower back pain and vaginal discharge and we are closely monitoring them for potential long-term repercussions linked with this condition. Based on what patients have shared, many gynecological conditions that can be managed medically, such as small fibroids, irregular menstruation, and cysts, are often treated with hysterectomy without undergoing thorough investigation. This practice stems from factors such as limited decision-making autonomy for women within families, economic challenges, the influence of a patriarchal society, and other contributing factors. Premature surgical menopause often leads to issues such as persistent vaginal discharge and lower back pain among most patients. Our observations extend beyond Jharkhand, indicating that states such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Bihar also have a significant prevalence of women who have undergone surgically induced early menopause. Notably, rural women appear to face a higher risk of early menopause, stemming from both natural and surgical factors, in comparison to women from urban areas.[5] It is worth noting that there is a scarcity of research on surgical menopause prevalence, not only in Jharkhand but also across India. Kingsberg et al. have highlighted that surgical interventions for benign gynecological issues contribute to an increasing number of women experiencing early menopause. This premature loss of ovarian function accelerates the onset of menopause and affects various bodily systems, such as cardiovascular, nervous, skeletal, and connective tissue systems. This, in turn, reduces the overall quality of life due to symptoms such as vasomotor disturbances, mood changes, sleep disturbances, and altered sexual function.[6] Our current findings strongly indicate that early surgical menopause has direct implications on psychological, skeletal, and functional well-being. It's imperative that this issue is addressed promptly from multiple angles. Women's empowerment should be promoted by enhancing awareness about sexual health and fostering a sense of ownership over their own bodies. Equitable access to reproductive health-care at the primary care level is crucial. Furthermore, public awareness campaigns through local media using Information, Education and Communication and Behavior Change Communication strategies should emphasize sexual health and the roles played by various organs. In conclusion, we propose that comprehensive mixed-method studies be conducted in the state of Jharkhand to delve into the actual prevalence, associations, and causal factors involving the intricate interplay of sociocultural elements contributing to early surgical menopause.

This chapter describes the most commonly used in vivo models for exploring urogenitosexual functions and for clarifying pathogenesis and evaluating potential treatments of urogenitosexual dysfunctions. Urogenitosexual functions include lower urinary tract and sexual functions. Lower urinary tract function can be evaluated by (i) monitoring changes in bladder pressure (cystometry), (ii) measuring urethral function (bladder outlet function), and (iii) recording of bladder somatosensory afferent (micturition trigger). Pathophysiological models of lower urinary tract dysfunctions comprise (i) bladder outlet obstruction that can be due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, (ii) overactive bladder leading to urinary incontinence that can be neurogenic or not (idiopathic), and (iii) painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis corresponding to exaggerated sensation of pain or pressure in the bladder in the absence of evident infection. Sexual functions are explored using behavioral paradigms or measurement of peripheral responses. Sexual behavior has been divided into appetitive (sexual desire/motivation) and consummatory (copulation) aspects that can be evaluated using sexual preference paradigms and copulatory tests in both females and males. Peripheral sexual responses that can be assessed by recording physiological markers include (i) vaginal blood engorgement in females and (ii) penile erection and ejaculation in males. A few pathophysiological models have been proposed for female (related to menopause) and male (erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation) sexual disorders. In the last section of this chapter, translational value of the experimental models in urology and sexual medicine is discussed with the help of examples.",

The parents will have to deal with the loss of one twin while coping with concerns about the safety of the remaining twin. The emotional impact of continuing the pregnancy while the dead twin remains in utero, sometimes for several weeks, will be considerable. The demise of one twin may also result in preterm delivery or significant neurological injury in the survivor. Obstetric management can also be complicated. There is controversy and a lack of good evidence regarding the optimal timing of delivery, as well as uncertainty regarding the correct frequency and type of antenatal surveillance and investigation for the detection of cerebral damage.",

      "abstract": "Concerns about possible early pubertal development are a common cause for referral to pediatric medical subspecialists. Several recent studies have suggested that onset of breast and/or pubic hair development may be occurring earlier than in the past. Although there is a chance of finding pathology in girls with signs of puberty before 8 years of age and in boys before 9 years of age, the vast majority of these children with signs of apparent puberty have variations of normal growth and physical development and do not require laboratory testing, bone age radiographs, or intervention. The most common of these signs of early puberty are premature adrenarche (early onset of pubic hair and/or body odor), premature thelarche (nonprogressive breast development, usually occurring before 2 years of age), and lipomastia, in which girls have apparent breast development which, on careful palpation, is determined to be adipose tissue. Indicators that the signs of sexual maturation may represent true, central precocious puberty include progressive breast development over a 4- to 6-month period of observation or progressive penis and testicular enlargement, especially if accompanied by rapid linear growth. Children exhibiting these true indicators of early puberty need prompt evaluation by the appropriate pediatric medical subspecialist. Therapy with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist may be indicated, as discussed in this report.",

As a consequence, endometrial hyperproliferation, anomalies of the cycle, and of menstrual bleeding may occur. Myomas become symptomatic. The incidence of curettage and hysterectomy rises. Premenstrual syndrome, mastopathy, and migraine are more common. Benign and malignant genital and breast tumors are more often found. Typical climacteric complaints (mostly of low to medium severity) occur in about 20% during the premenopause while they occur in 60%-84% during the postmenopausal period.

We can say that the postpartum hemorrhage is divided into immediate postpartum hemorrhage, which occurs in the 24 hours after delivery, and that the late postpartum hemorrhage is given after the 24 hours or until 6 weeks postpartum. The uterine atony is the most frequent cause. The second cause is the retention of placental or blood clots. Other causes are most often episiotomies and perineal tears, cervical or vaginal sex. You should try to quantify the volume of blood loss and value on the hemodynamic status of the patient. The initial behavior focuses on maintaining or restoring the hemodynamic stability through aggressive fluid therapy.

      "abstract": "O NLY during a relatively short period, approximately in the middle of the menstrual cycle, does a woman have an appreciable chance of conceiving. The average duration of this is not known precisely but almost certainly averages under 48 hours.3 Since the time period is so brief, coital frequency has a bearing on conception ease. This relevance is the more assured because of evidence, furnished primarily by the studies of MacLeod and Gold,4 indicating that coital frequency can be increased without jeopardizing virility, except possibly in cases where the increase is to very high levels or the male is oligospermatic. Any relationship of coital frequency to contraceptive effectiveness is more speculative. Strong libido, reflected in high levels of sexual activity, may contribute to less effective contraception by generating more occasions for chance-taking and, in the case of rhythm, by making continence more difficult to maintain during the unsafe period. Having a less direct but potentially important bearing on conception ease and contraceptive effectiveness is knowledge of the fertile period with reference to its timing within the",

      "title": "[The difficulties of contraception: conflicts and paradoxes].",
      "abstract": "This work uses clinical examples to explore sources of conflict and denial of patients and physicians during contraception consultations. The discovery of oral contraceptives (OCs) and improvements in mechanical contraception raised hopes that couples could achieve total control of their fertility. But continued high abortion rates and the persistence of sexual problems and maladjustments have demonstrated that contraception alone is not a panacea. Conflicts about contraception may be conscious and quickly expressed during a consultation, even if a medical pretext is given. The resentment when 1 partner desires a child and the other does not for example can translate into a conflict about contraception. Some women are fully aware of their own ambivalence about pregnancy and contraception and able to express it openly, but very often the woman's concerns are expressed by questions, fears, and verbal slips. The fear that pills are unnatural or will cause congenital defects can be interpreted as an expression of guilt over the pleasure that pills permit. Sterility is the ultimate fear caused by this unlimited possibility for pleasure. In the majority of cases, physical complaints are the means by which contraception clients address their physicians. In some cases, intolerance to OCs may actually be a hysterical manifestation that is not understood. Such symptoms as nausea, breast swelling, dizziness, vomiting, nervousness, and insomnia may be signs of early pregnancy as well as of intolerance for pills. Intolerance to pills may be caused by intolerance of a sexuality in which all things seem possible but in which the individual feels unrecognized by the partner. The resulting aggression may be turned inward in the form of a morbid symptom or of forgetting or stopping pill use, recourse to abortion, and demand for recognition. Acting out, especially by adolescents, is common in the area of contraception. In some cases the psychological or emotional needs of the patient might be better met by contraception that leaves some risk of failure, such as low-dose progestins or local methods. Their relative efficacy may allow the ambivalent desire for a child not to be completely stifled. Cases also arise in which patients use contraceptives to mask problems and to give the illusion of a normally functioning body. The possibility of having a child is very seldom raised during contraceptive consultations, perhaps because for the physician contraception subconsciously evokes the forces of death. The doctor can take refuge in the technical aspects of contraception, ignoring the emotional needs of the client.",

As a result of these studies, the following concept has been formulated. Functional menstrual disorders may result from lesions in any of the endocrine glands or from general constitutional disease secondarily affecting the endocrine system. The primary disease condition gives rise to ovarian hypofunction and this, in turn, gives rise to the menstrual abnormality. The severity of the ovarian disturbance is indicated roughly by the endometrium. There is no constant correlation between the primary lesion, the degree of ovarian involvement, as indicated by the endometrium, and the type of menstrual disturbance.",

Pain causes tachycardia in the mother, increased oxygen consumption, lactic (lactic) acid production, hyperventilation with a risk of respiratory alkalosis, and increased skeletal muscle tension. Regiosarcal Counter Pressure is an effective therapy to reduce pain due to uterine contractions. Based on research that has been done, Regiosarcal counter-pressure therapy can reduce pain levels and has also been shown to slightly reduce prostaglandin (PGE-2) levels in an insignificant amount. Changes in PGE-2 are suspected to have an impact on the stimulant hormone Interleukin-6 (IL-6). This study aims to determine the levels of IL-6 and prostaglandins in the first stage of labor.

      "abstract": "Menopause is the period of a woman's life that is characterized by the permanent cessation of menses associated to hormonal changes, of which the most important is the decrease of estrogen levels. Following menopause, the concentrations of circulating androgens decrease. However, increased concentrations of luteinizing hormone induce androgens secretion from the ovaries and presumably from the adrenal glands. Peripheral conversion of androgens results to the circulating hormonal androgen profile. Some pathological conditions are associated with greater concentrations of androgens after menopause than in controls, with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) being the commonest. These conditions can be distinguished in non-tumorous (adrenal or ovarian) or functional and tumorous (adrenal or ovarian benign or malignant) masses. Apart from PCOS, other non-tumorous (adrenal or ovarian) causes of hyperandrogenism in post-menopausal women are obesity, non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH), endocrinopathies, such as Cushing disease or acromegaly; ovarian hyperthecosis, drug use or abuse. Tumorous (adrenal or ovarian) causes include adrenal cortical cancers, adrenal benign adenomas and even incidentalomas, or ovarian tumors such as the sex-cord stromal ovarian tumors and metastases in the ovary. The diagnosis of hyperandrogenism is made through medical history, clinical examination, and laboratory tests. Total testosterone concentration of 150 ng/dL can be used at first to distinguish a malignant from a benign cause of hyperandrogenism. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate concentration may support adrenal source of androgens. Imaging techniques are used to localize the source of androgens: computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the adrenals and transvaginal ultrasound or MRI for the ovaries. Finally, treatment (etiologic and symptomatic) and long-term effects of hyperandrogenism are developed in this chapter.",

Management of Pelvic Floor Dysfunction Abstract Objective : to perform a literature review the identification and early management of new-onset or pre-existing pelvic floor dysfunction. Symptoms and anatomical changes related to pelvic floor muscle dysfunction may be related to hypertonicity, hypotonicity, or discoordination of the pelvic floor muscles. Diagnosis of pelvic floor dysfunction after delivery is difficult because there are no pregnancy-specific pelvic floor dysfunction screening tools. Clinical evaluation and diagnosis are primarily based on the patient's reported symptoms, which include four assessment domains related to sexual function, pelvic floor support function, urinary, and defecation. Methods : summarizes the latest references that provide guidance and treatment for pelvic floor dysfunction. Results: Management of pelvic floor dysfunction after the initial diagnosis was based on the evaluation domain from patient's symptoms. Management includes considering the symptoms onset, awareness of disturbing symptoms, conservative management, monitoring, and advanced management. Pelvic floor exercises (Kegel) are clinically proven to identify and strengthen the muscles associated with micturition, defecation, or sexual function. Conclusion : Kegel exercises can act as routine independent management of pelvic floor dysfunction patients with symptoms in all domains. The exercise can be combined with biofeedback therapy or other rehabilitation modalities. Key words : clinical evaluation, hypertonicity, hypotonicity, kegel exercise, pelvic floor, rehabilitation",

Women with positive genital self-image experience higher levels of sexual functioning and lower levels of sexual distress. Female genitalia modified by genital cosmetic surgery are considered more attractive regardless of age and gender. For vaginal tightening procedures, there appears to be an evidence-proven anatomic justification. Evidence in the literature confirms that orgasm and orgasmic intensity may be produced by, and intensified by, pressure on the more intensely innervated anterior vaginal wall approximately one-quarter of the way in from the introitus, in the approximate area considered by many to be the G-spot or G-area. Patient selection, especially in relationship to reasonable expectations, is crucial. Also of paramount importance, as pointed out by Liao and Creighton, is as considered an evaluation of motivations as possible, in an effort to primum non nocere.",

Indeed, some degree of trauma is almost inevitable, particularly in nulliparous women. In most cases the trauma is minor and full recovery can be expected, although perineal pain and superficial dyspareunia can persist for several weeks. However, long-term studies have shown that uterovaginal prolapse and urinary and faecal incontinence are not uncommon following the stretching and tearing of the pelvic floor musculature and the enclosed branches of the pudendal nerve. In addition, a surprising amount of blood can be lost in a short period of time from lacerations of the perineum, vagina and cervix and this is a major risk factor for post-partum haemorrhage. Knowledge of the predisposing factors and recognition and appropriate management of lower genital tract trauma are essential in the provision of safe obstetric care.",

Severe cramps are the hallmark for primary dysmenorrhea. But severe menstrual cramps and other symptoms may reduce whatever social life women are able to muster. Affecting overall quality of daily life, it lowers work achievement and increases any kind of absenteeism. This paper discusses the division of primary and secondary dysmenorrhea. It also summarizes risk factors that can lead to primary dysmenorrhea, such as the gene predisposition and age-related but it also highlights the role of Vitex Agnus Castus, the traditional Chinese medicine method for relieving physical discomfort and symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea during menstrual periods. Through modulating hormone levels, this product affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, but has no direct impact on lutein hormone (LH) or follicle stimulating hormone FSH. The extract helps to relieve the psychological and physical symptoms closely associated with dysmenorrhea. Agnus Castus is supported by many clinical studies and has no known drug interactions. Through various studies the extract's solid safety profile makes it a reliable possible alternative treatment for primary dysmenorrhea when compared with traditional therapies. It is non-pharmacological pain relief treatment while providing nutritional values and almost no side effects.",

In addition, pregnancy is a period during which stresses between partners and domestic violence may be elevated. Recent research suggests that the stresses and strains that women experience in pregnancy can have long-term adverse effects on the fetus and the child. Stress/anxiety during pregnancy can double the risk of a range of emotional, behavioural and cognitive problems. There is a wide variation in outcome among exposed children; current research seeks to clarify the interaction between prenatal stress/anxiety, genetic vulnerabilities and postnatal risk exposures and protective factors. Although such research is important, it is clear that there are immediate practical applications of the findings so far. There needs to be appropriate prenatal screening and intervention. It should be possible to significantly reduce the incidence of child neurodevelopmental disorder.",

      "title": "Why do women have menopause?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Menopause is the result of an inevitable decline in ovarian function. The term usually denotes the completion of a full year without a menstrual period. As menopause approaches, the ovaries decrease in size as virtually all the egg-containing ovarian follicles are lost due to a process called atresia. Estrogen production diminishes, and cycles tend to become shorter and more erratic. Menopause follows this last phase of the life cycle of the ovary which starts early in fetal life when the gland mobilizes the resources it will later need to assure egg and hormone production throughout a woman’s reproductive years. The link between deterioration of ovarian function and menopause is the fall in estrogen production. Estrogen is not only important for maintaining reproductive function, but it is a key hormone in maintaining bone density and for protecting against other physical and mental health disorders associated with aging. Sleep disturbances, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and urinary incontinence are all conditions associated with estrogen fluctuation or deprivation. Osteoporosis, thinning of the bones, is a life-threatening condition for postmenopausal women. The onset of menopause, in other words, has many more health-related implications for women than simply the loss of reproductive capacity.",

      "abstract": "Although Klinefelter syndrome (KS) is common, it is rarely recognised in childhood, sometimes being identified with speech or developmental delay or incidental antenatal diagnosis. The only regular feature is testicular dysfunction. Postnatal gonadotropin surge (mini-puberty) may be lower, but treatment with testosterone needs prospective studies. The onset of puberty is at the normal age and biochemical hypogonadism does not typically occur until late puberty. Testosterone supplementation can be considered then or earlier for clinical hypogonadism. The size at birth is normal, but growth acceleration is more rapid in early and mid-childhood, with adult height greater than mid-parental height. Extreme tall stature is unusual. The incidence of adolescent gynaecomastia (35.6%) is not increased compared with typically developing boys and can be reduced or resolved by testosterone supplementation, potentially preventing the need for surgery. Around two-thirds require speech and language therapy or developmental support and early institution of therapy is important. Provision of psychological support may be helpful in ameliorating these experiences and provide opportunities to develop strategies to recognise, process and express feelings and thoughts. Boys with KS are at increased risk of impairment in social cognition and less accurate perceptions of social emotional cues. The concept of likely fertility problems needs introduction alongside regular reviews of puberty and sexual function in adolescents. Although there is now greater success in harvesting sperm through techniques such as testicular sperm extraction, it is more successful in later than in early adolescence. In vitro maturation of germ cells is still experimental.",

In dogs, growth plate closure is delayed when surgery is performed prior to puberty, but the delay is significantly longer when neutering is done at 7 weeks as compared to 7 months. External genitalia do not develop fully: penile and preputial immaturity and decreased radiodensity of the os penis are frequently observed. Vulvar development is also often insufficient in bitches gonadectomised at 7 weeks. Heat production is 28% lower in neutered compared to intact cats. A decrease in urethral diameter has been observed in neutered female but not male cats. Effects of prepuberal gonadectomy on behaviour vary depending on species and sex. In general, excitability and degree of activity are increased in males and females gonadectomised at 7 weeks or 7 months, and when surgery is done at 7 weeks animals are found to be more excitable if compared to those gonadectomised at 7 months. Incidence of urinary incontinence in the canine population may increase significantly when gonadectomy is done prior to 3 months of age. The most important anesthetic and surgical considerations concern fasting, the use of a warm environment, the use of short-acting inducing drugs, of volatile anesthesia. Prepubertal neutering is probably an acceptable technique for dogs and cats, although it carries some (minor) risks which should be explained in details whenever using it for client-owned animals.",

      "abstract": "Trauma to the perineum, either spontaneous or secondary to the performance of an episiotomy, during childbirth is a frequent event. It has been estimated that 85% of women sustain some form of perineal trauma during a vaginal birth with 60–70% requiring suture repair.1 Posterior obstetric perineal trauma may be associated with short- and long-term morbidity, particularly when involving the anal sphincter. Short-term morbidity includes prolongation of postdelivery stay, requirement for additional medications and operative intervention. Long-term pain (3–18 months postdelivery) has been reported in 10% of women, superficial dyspareunia or urinary problems at 3 months post-partum in 25% and faecal incontinence in 3–10% of women.1-3 The more severe the perineal trauma, the more likely is long-term morbidity (Box 1).4 The incidence of obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS), which encompasses third- and fourth-degree perineal trauma, varies widely, both between countries and within hospitals in the same country. Anal sphincter injuries are reported to occur in 0.5% of vaginal births in the United Kingdom, 1.4% in Japan, 2.5% in Denmark and 9% in Canada.5, 6 There is likely to be significant variation in incidence reporting in addition to differences in obstetric practices that lead to these wide variances in occurrence. The estimated occurrence of OASIS in Australia and New Zealand is 2.9%.7 In this edition of ANZJOG, Peter Baghurst reports on variance in reporting practices in obstetric hospitals in South Australia.8 Concerningly, Ampt and co-workers, also in this issue of ANZJOG, report an increase in the incidence of OASIS in the state of New South Wales from 2.1% in 2001 to 2.9% in 2009.9 Whether this increase reflects an improvement in clinical recognition and/or reporting is unclear, but both these manuscripts should raise the awareness of obstetricians, midwives and obstetric data collection services to OASIS and vigilance in accurate reporting and risk minimisation strategies. There are several recognised risk factors for OASIS, and all commence with a vaginal delivery – prelabour caesarean delivery is protective against traumatic anal injury.10 More specific risk factors include the following: first vaginal birth, operative vaginal delivery, fetal macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, prolonged second stage of labour, epidural analgesia, persistent occipito-posterior position and Asian ethnicity.11-13 The role of episiotomy in OASIS is controversial. Episiotomy is frequently performed to prevent anal sphincter damage; however, midline episiotomy increases the risk of anal sphincter injury.14 The evidence would suggest that a correctly timed and performed mediolateral episiotomy protects the anal sphincter and is associated with a lower rate of OASIS.13 Indeed, a third manuscript in this issue of ANZJOG by Twidale and co-workers, although noncontrolled and subject to potential bias, demonstrated a decrease in OASIS with an increase in mediolateral episiotomy performance.15 Primary prevention strategies and techniques to reduce the incidence of OASIS are clearly central to the short- and long-term well-being of women having a vaginal birth. There have been several studies conducted to reduce the occurrence of obstetric anal sphincter injury, with variable results. A recent Cochrane Collaborative Systematic Review assessed the value of perineal techniques in the second stage of labour to decrease obstetric perineal trauma.16 Eight randomised trials involving 11 651 women were accessed by the reviewers – all had heterogeneity in definitions of techniques used, and it is difficult to directly compare them. The use of warm compresses on the perineum in the second stage of labour significantly decreased the incidence of third- and fourth-degree tears in two studies of 1525 women (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28–0.84). Massage was more protective than no massage in the reduction of anal sphincter complex damage in two studies of 2147 women (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29–0.94).16 The use of hands-on compared with hands-poised techniques was associated with a significant reduction in the use of episiotomy without an increase in OASIS, consistent with a previous meta-analysis demonstrating the restrictive use of episiotomy to be associated with less severe perineal trauma.17 Instrumental deliveries increase the risk of significant perineal trauma. The use of the vacuum extractor has been demonstrated to be associated with a lesser incidence of severe perineal trauma than the use of forceps; however, this instrument may also produce anal sphincter injury either directly or through the concomitant use of an episiotomy.13 Concerns have been raised about pudendal neuropathy and the prolongation of the second stage of labour that frequently accompanies the use of epidural analgesia.18 Delayed pushing in nulliparous women with a functioning epidural was not associated with a lower incidence of operative vaginal delivery than immediate commencement of pushing at full dilatation in the randomised trial by Fitzpatrick and co-workers in Ireland.19 They reported no difference in operative vaginal delivery rates between the two groups, and episiotomy rates were similar (although high at 70%). Obstetric anal sphincter damage is an important cause of short- and long-term obstetric morbidity and one that maternity units should continuously review and monitor. I recommend to the readers of ANZJOG the three manuscripts in this issue on OASIS and to then reflect on the practices and outcomes in their own units. The achievement of a vaginal delivery at the expense of a woman's long-term faecal continence is not an obstetric success.",

Progestational agents affect the physiochemistry of the cervical mucus, spermatozoa capacitation, the endometrium, and the secretory process of the tubes. Progestins can be administered intramuscularly at a dose of 250 mg every 3 months, or of 450 mg every 6 months; they can also be administered in microdoses of 0.5 mg per os per day. Method of administration can be continuous, every day, discontinuous, from the 5th to the 25th day of the cycle, or mixed, i.e. one agent on a continuous basis every day, and another progestational agent for 5-10 days only. Progestational agents are usually well tolerated; they do, however, cause a series of menstruation disorders, including spotting, amenorrhea, and irregularities of the cycle. Reversibility is very good. Contraindicatoins to this type of contraception are diabetes, obesity, lipid metabolic problems, any cardiovascular pathology, any uterine and breast pathology when it is hormonodependant. Sequential contraception would be better indicated than progestational contraception for premenopausal women.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Babies born through both normal and caesarean (sc) procedures, 50-80% make the mother face the risk of baby blues syndrome and post-partum depression. Baby blues syndrome, occurs in the first 2 weeks after giving birth, triggered by physical changes such as swelling of the breast, pain in the area around the birth canal and uterus, changes in muscle tone, physical and mental fatigue that the mother feels. While post-partum depression lasts several months to many years later, this syndrome begins with a psychiatric disorder suffered by the mother before pregnancy, psychosocial stress, inadequate social support, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. For that, this condition needs to be addressed immediately, through the healing techniques of Chandra namaskara and Brahmari Pranayama. Chandra namaskara arouses the feminine energy, the lunar energy in the mother’s body, keeping the cerebral circulation fresh so that the sympathetic nerve activity diminishes. The effect of massage on the organs in the abdomen, increase peristaltic activity in the intestine, the lateral wall of the heart stretched perfectly so that no ischaemia occurs. Alteration of arthritis of the spinal joint can be removed by stretching the spinal muscles and ligaments between the vertebral bones through this series of asanas. While brahmari pranayama stimulates the brain part of the hypothalamus to activate the adrenal cortex system by sending signals to the pituitary gland so as not to secrete adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), so that ACTH, which had previously stimulated the outer layer of the adrenal glands (the adrenal cortex) to release a group of hormones (cortisol) did not secrete cortisol, but instead produced by the brain is actually the endhorpine that works for the body’s immune, regulate emotions, relax of the body and be able to eliminate depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disproportionately affects women in their reproductive age years. Pregnancy in this systemic autoimmune disease has long been associated with poor obstetric outcomes. However, the frequency of pregnancy loss in lupus has dropped to a level commensurate with that of the general US population. The outcomes of lupus pregnancies are better if conception is delayed until the disease has been inactive for at least 6 months, and the medication regimen has been adjusted in advance. Pregnancy in lupus is prone to complications, including flares of disease activity during pregnancy or in the postpartum period, preeclampsia, miscarriage, stillbirth, intrauterine growth retardation, and preterm birth. Active lupus nephritis poses the greatest risk. The recognition of a lupus flare during pregnancy may be difficult because the signs and symptoms may mimic those of normal pregnancy. Monitoring should include baseline and monthly laboratory tests, serial ultrasonography, fetal surveillance tests, and fetal m-mode echocardiography for mothers with SS-A (Ro) or SS-B (La) antibodies. In the absence of any signs or symptoms of active SLE, affected patients require no specific treatment during pregnancy. If hydroxychloroquine was in use before conception, it should be maintained throughout pregnancy. If a woman with SLE has antiphospholipid antibodies, prophylactic treatment with aspirin and/or low-molecular weight heparin is indicated to prevent fetal loss. Lupus flares during pregnancy are generally treated with hydroxychloroquine, low-dose prednisone, pulse intravenous methylprednisolone, and azathioprine. High-dose prednisone and cyclophosphamide are reserved for severe lupus complications but are associated with significant pregnancy-related complications and poor obstetrical outcomes. Target Audience: Obstetricians and Gynecologists and Family Physicians Learning Objectives: After completing the CME activity, physicians should be better able to provide preconception counseling to a woman with lupus, differentiate signs of a lupus flare from symptoms of pregnancy, differentiate preeclampsia from a flare of lupus nephritis, and differentiate the serious medical complications of pregnancy in a lupus patient.",

Pregnancy itself may be associated with some injury, but the main damage occurs during vaginal delivery. It is well documented that vaginal delivery may cause denervation of the pelvic floor as well as direct injury to muscles and connective tissue. These injuries may lead to the development of stress urinary incontinence, anal incontinence, voiding difficulties, and/or urogenital prolapse. Previous studies showed correlation between various obstetric risk factors and the development of these symptoms, however, there is no consensus regarding the relative contribution of the different parameters. Moreover, the apparently protective effect of cesarean section is questionable. Further studies are required to define obstetric risk factors as well as patients at increased risk.

Eunuchs suffer from urinary retention as a side effect of castration.

      "abstract": "Approximately 10-15% of all women experience symptoms of anxiety or depression during the antenatal or postpartum period. Having elevated stress levels in the antenatal period has been associated with adverse outcomes in the child, but the mechanism behind this observation has not been found yet. Amongst the main risk factors for anxiety or depression in the antenatal or postpartum period are having a history of previous symptoms, traumatic events during childhood, recent major life events and specific personality traits. Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis focus on the influence of traumatic events specifically during pregnancy, delivery or in the immediate postpartum period on the course of anxiety and depression in the antenatal and postpartum period. Screening for anxiety and depression during pregnancy is generally recommended by guidelines on antenatal and postpartum anxiety or depression, although antenatal screening tools that accurately predict an individual risk on symptoms in the postpartum period are not available yet. Chapters 4 and 5 of this thesis investigate whether two commonly used tools in screening for current symptomatology can be used in predicting later symptomatology. Treatment options for symptoms of anxiety or depression can be divided into pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment. During the antenatal and breastfeeding period, women generally prefer non-pharmacological treatment, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. Outside pregnancy, this therapy has been proven to be successful in treating anxiety and depression. Chapter 6 focuses on a randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy on pregnant women and their babies.",

The loop of the umbilical cord is compressed between the maternal pelvis and the presenting part, resulting in fetal hypoxia. Total cord compression for more than 10 minutes can cause fetal cerebral damage, and more than 20 minutes of this can cause fetal death. The fetal condition can rapidly deteriorate if the fetus is already compromised, as in prematurity and fetal growth restriction. Awareness about the risk of umbilical cord prolapse in the presence of risk factors should prevent this complication from occurring. Women with abnormal fetal lie, e.g. transverse, oblique or unstable, should be advised immediate admission to a hospital in case of the onset of labour or rupture of membranes, because prelabour rupture of membranes, especially in the presence of a high presenting part, carries high risk of umbilical cord prolapse.",

      "abstract": "Asthma is characterized by respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, cough, and chest tightness that are often worse at night and may vary over time and intensity, together with variable airflow obstruction.Symptoms can be triggered by viral infections, exposure to allergens, smoke, exercise, changes in weather, and irritants.Detailed anamnesis and physical examination support asthma diagnosis.Additionally, documented expiratory airflow limitation and excessive variability in lung function corroborate the diagnosis 5 .Symptoms of asthma are similar in pregnant and nonpregnant patients.However, if a pregnant woman complains of shortness of breath or chest tightness, the asthma diagnosis should be carefully made based only on her symptoms 6 .Frequently, pregnant women complain of shortness of breath or chest tightness (approximately two-thirds) during the pregnancy period 7 .During pregnancy, several physiological and structural changes can contribute to a sensation of dyspnea, such as the dilated uterus, elevated diaphragm, and increased anteroposterior and transverse diameter of the thorax.Such changes are compensated by a reduction of thoracic compliance, and as a result, the functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung function (TLC) decrease by 20 and 5%, respectively 8 .Spirometry parameters such as forced expiratory volume in first second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/ FVC do not change during pregnancy compared to reference values in the nonpregnancy period.Spirometry may help asthma diagnosis in pregnant women by detecting reversible airway obstruction and helping monitor response to treatment.Bronchial provocation tests are not advisable to be carried out in pregnant women to prevent maternal hypoxia and fetal distress.",

Around the time of the menopause, women describe both physical and psychological symptoms, sometimes before changes occur in menstrual pattern, some of which are sufficiently troublesome to lead women to seek medical help. Flushes and sweats, the most commonly reported symptoms, affect some women both day and night and can lead to profound sleep disturbance over many months. Women describe low mood, irritability and poor concentration which may be due to changing hormonal levels or to sleep disturbance. Symptoms relating to sexual function include vaginal dryness, dyspareunia and low libido. Symptoms vary between women and the duration of symptoms has been reported to be up to 10 years in around 10% of women.",

      "title": "Anxiety for procedures or anxiety for results",
      "abstract": "Successful pregnancy and subsequently healthy live birth is one of most exciting events in majority of couples.1 However, it is not always easy. Subfertility and infertility make the pregnancy difficult or impossible, and many of them need help by modern assisted reproductive technology.2,3 Miscarriage or premature preterm labors make pregnancy loss, which is a long-term biggest challenge for both physicians and pregnant women.4–6 Pregnancy-related adverse events and concerns of well-being of the fetus make couples anxious and fearful during the entire pregnancy course.7–11 All contribute to psychological stress for all couples that want to establish a healthy family. In this February issue of the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association, Dr. CM Kang retrospectively evaluated the effects of psychological intervention on pregnant women who needed an invasive perinatal diagnosis and found that psychological intervention before procedure, including fully understanding psychological status, giving psychological guidance, calming the anxiety and fear, and building confidence to whether the pregnancy stages before and after the procedure, will improve the success rate of puncture and reduce the incidence of complications.12 We congratulate author’s successful publication and since the relevant studies are important, we are happy to comment this article. Amniocentesis is one of the most frequently procedures to confirm the chromosomal abnormalities of fetus in pregnant women, although now noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has become one of most popular tools worldwide to detect common chromosomal aneuploidies.13,14 However, NIPT is a nondiagnostic test, and positive test results need to be confirmed by a definitive diagnostic test, such as amniocentesis.14 It is more reasonable to believe that these pregnant women undergoing amniocentesis may have different indications, such as advanced maternal age, positive screening test (NIPT), and structure abnormalities detected by ultrasound.15,16 Among these indications, fetal abnormalities detected either by ultrasound may contribute to certain percentage of them. By contrast, some pregnant women undergoing amniocentesis may belong to the relative “low risk”, and this low-risk group might be biased by many factors. Since Dr. Kang’s study was a retrospective study, the indication for amniocentesis might be needed. Without these data, the risk of selection bias is high. Why this view is important? If structure abnormalities of fetus are present, the results of a further amniocentesis might be a critical factor for the fetus fate—continuous or discontinuous pregnancy. It is reasonable to believe that baseline of psychological problem may be significantly different between “expected” and “unexpected” results in these pregnant women who should face these challenges. Amniocentesis, itself, is an invasive procedure. Therefore, experience of pregnant women might influence their response. This also emphasizes the importance of baseline background, or history. All pregnant women were the fresh cases, who did not have amniocentesis before. It is reasonable to believe that experience of previous procedure is also an important confounding factor to affect the psychological status of the pregnant women undergoing amniocentesis. Unfortunately, Dr. Kang did not provide the data. Since the current study needs to introduce the goal to the research subjects, we do not know this explanation can be neglected that women in the controls have not been treated with psychological intervention. In addition, we are wondering whether the standard guidelines and preparation protocol of pregnant women who need amniocentesis in Dr. Kang’s hospital. Based on the description of psychological intervention methods intervention group, we cannot find any additional psychological support procedures in the aforementioned group. Psychological support, introducing the procedure, relaxation training, and family support are all included in prenatal consultation in our hospital. Therefore, it is difficult to know what is difference between psychological support and standard group in the current study. It is interesting to find higher success rate of amniocentesis in intervention group and little time needing to finish amniocentesis in intervention group in the current study. What is the success rate? Although it is not clear what is the definition of the success rate in Dr. Kang’s study, we believe there are at least three components to be fulfilled, including (a) adequate amount of amniotic fluid should be obtained, (b) the culture of amniocytes should be successful, and (c) the final chromosome analysis should have an informative result. We are also wondering to know why Dr. Kang said duration of the procedure is shorter in intervention group. Did the author mean that the first aspiration rate was higher in intervention group? Alternatively, times of obtaining amniotic fluid may be higher in controls. If two or higher attempts of aspiration for amniotic fluid occurred frequently in controls, the author’s conclusion can be easily and fully understood.

      "abstract": "Menopause, an aged process due to loss of permanent ovarian function (mainly decreased production of estrogen) without another pathological or physiological cause becomes one of the most health issues in the world. Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) is a hallmark of menopause, occurring in up to 80 % of women experiencing and persisting for over seven years with significant negative impacts on physical, psychological, social, and overall wellbeing. Conventionally, menopause hormone therapy (MHT) is considered the most effective therapeutic opinion for many years based on the fact as \"deficiency of estrogen\"; however, the ratio of benefits and risk is highly debated and always in concern. Therefore, the non-MHT agent focusing the underlying pathophysiology of VMS, such as hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis is becoming attractive. Based on this concept, the hypothalamus neural construct containing Kisspeptin (Kp) neurons in median pre-optic area (POA) or Kp-neurokinin B (NKB)-dynorphin (DYN) neurons (KNDy neurons) in the infundibular nucleus is identified as the thermoregulatory circultry to involve the pathophysiology of normal reproduction and menopause-associated VMS. The neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) antagonists applied to VMS are an enthusiasm with a big success. Fezolinetant is one of the best breakthroughs. Recent three randomized clinical trials (RCTs), including SKYLIGHT 1,2, and 4 confirmed the safety and efficacy for treating moderate-to-severe VMS women. By contrast, another MONGLIGHT RCTs for East Asia population seemed to controversial therapeutic effect for VMS treatment, but there is no doubt that safety issue is also satisfied, contributing to the need of more RCTs to validate its efficacy in diverse population. The current review will summary the recent advance of this new landscape in the management of women with moderate-to-severe VMS and particularly focus on the fezolinetant product.",

The latter describes a clinical syndrome thought to be a consequence of failing placental function.

A history of second or early third trimester fetal loss, after painless dilatation of the cervix, prolapse or rupture of the membranes, and expulsion of a live fetus despite minimal uterine activity, is characteristic for cervical insufficiency. In such cases the risk of recurrence is high, and a policy of prophylactic cerclage may be safer than one of serial cervical length measurements followed by cerclage, tocolysis and bed rest in case of cervical shortening or dilatation. In low risk cases, however, prophylactic cerclage is not useful. There is a need for more basic knowledge of cervical ripening, objective assessment of cervical visco-elastic properties, and randomized controlled trials of technical aspects of cervical cerclage (e.g. suturing technique).",

Parturients who experience such types of perineal tears may suffer from flatus or fecal incontinence and also fistula to various surrounding organs. There is no consensus in the relevant medical literature regarding the risk factors for the development of these tears, as contradictive results are presented in various relevant studies. Traditional methods for perineal protection, executed by midwives, such as perineal massage with oil, have also failed to be proven as an effective measure for that purpose. The only theme on which there appears to be a consensus is the fact that protective episiotomy is not helpful in protecting the perineum during vaginal delivery. The inability to predict which parturient will have a perineal tear that involves the anal sphincter, as well as the lack of predictive measures to avoid their occurrence, drive more and more women to demand and receive cesarean section by maternal request, which is accepted by most obstetricians nowadays.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Mental health disorders in adolescence are a significant problem, relatively common, and amenable to treatment or intervention. Obstetrician–gynecologists who see adolescent patients are highly likely to see adolescents and young women who have one or more mental health disorders. Some of these disorders may interfere with a patient’s ability to understand or articulate her health concerns and appropriately adhere to recommended treatment. Some disorders or their treatments will affect the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, causing anovulatory cycles and various menstrual disturbances. Adolescents with psychiatric disorders may be taking psychopharmacologic agents that can cause menstrual dysfunction and galactorrhea. Adolescents with mental illness often engage in acting-out behavior or substance use, which increases their risk of unsafe sexual behavior that may result in pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections. Pregnant adolescents who take psychopharmacologic agents present a special challenge in balancing the potential risks of fetal harm with the risks of inadequate treatment. Whether providing preventive women’s health care or specific obstetric or gynecologic treatment, the obstetrician–gynecologist has the opportunity to reduce morbidity and mortality from mental health disorders in adolescents by early identification, appropriate and timely referral, and care coordination. Although mental health disorders should be managed by mental health care professionals or appropriately trained primary care providers, the obstetrician–gynecologist can assist by managing the gynecologic adverse effects of psychiatric medications and providing effective contraception and regular screening for sexually transmitted infections. This Committee Opinion will provide basic information about common adolescent mental health disorders, focusing on specific implications for gynecologic and obstetric practice.",

They represent 1% of all pregnancies. Repetitive fetal loss with alive fetus should also be counted as such. An explanation is found for less than 50% of such patients. Most recurrent first trimester fetal losses are of chromosomal, hormonal, immunological, uterine or environmental origin. The most frequent causes for in utero fetal death are renovascular syndromes, hormonal or immunological pathologies, hereditary thrombophilias, red cell or platelet allo-immunisation and chromosomal anomalies. Second trimester miscarriage is generally due to a cervical incompetence, uterine malformations or infections.",

      "abstract": "Background: Menopause occurs between the ages of 40 and 50, and marks the end of a woman's menstrual cycle. A period of time during which a woman does not have a monthly cycle for more than 12 months is known as post-menopause. Women may suffer challenges in their daily lives during this period, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep loss, all of which can have a negative impact on their quality of life. A decrease in hormone production, such as estrogen and progesterone, can cause menopause. To treat psychological difficulties in menopausal women, drugs such as vortioxetine and paroxetine, as well as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and anti-depressants, were advised. Objective: To evaluate the effects in women how menopause inducing depression, anxiety, quality of life and lack of sleep. Methodology: The recent studies related to the aim of the review were undertaken through a literature search to evaluate the effects in women how menopause inducing depression, anxiety, quality of life and lack of sleep. Conclusion: Menopause, post-menopause, and peri-menopause are age-related causes in women who are going through the menstrual cycle. There is no need for medication during this time, but in severe cases, medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and antidepressants should be administered and also for vaginal dryness and irritation Ospemifene is suggested. Many more clinical researches on the benefits of menopausal compilations will be needed in the future. Keywords: Menopause, post- menopause, depression, estrogen, progesterone",

These conditions are mostly in the setting of an anatomical obstruction, usually an imperforate hymen. Usually, clinical presentation may be characterized by primary amenhorrea, recurrent abdominal or pelvic pain, urinary retention and dys-uria or constipation. Imaging techniques such as trans-abdominal ultrasound and nuclear magnetic res-onance are respectively the exam of choice and the “gold standard” exam for diagnosing hematocolpos. The paper reports the case of a 12-year-old girl with a sacral pain present for a month, not associated with other symptoms with a diagnosis of hematocolpos that became evident to the magnetic resonance.",

Preoperative measures include 1) proper selection of cases to avoid apprehensive patients 2) education of patients preferably with a schematic model or diagram to explain operative measures and 3) brief systemic and local examination with testing of urine for sugar. For operation cetrimide seems the best antiseptic. Crushing and ligation with unabsorbable material prevents failure. Testing of the removed vas for patency of lumen by passing nylon is necessary. Postoperatively moderate rest for a few days is required. Stitches may be removed after 48 hours (preferably) or on the seventh day. Slight testicular ache may occur. Hematoma and infection are not rare but are easily treated. Sexual activity without risk of pregnancy depends on a negative finding of spermatozoa in seminal fluid usually 6-8 weeks after operation. Restricted sex is advised because excess may lead to exhaustion of the lower sex center resulting in inadequate erection.",

Extensive epidemiologic evidence estimates that almost 50% of perimenopausal and postmenopausal women experience FSD. Screening for FSD is not readily conducted and patient–physician discussion of sexuality is limited by the lack of physician training on the topic and by the patient-held belief that sexual issues are not medical in nature. The purpose of this commentary is to provide clinicians with a framework to approach the discussion of FSD, to clinically identify FSD through patient symptoms and physical signs, and to manage FSD in perimenopausal and postmenopausal patients with the available U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved and off-label treatments. Particular attention will be paid to FSD with common midlife onset including vulvovaginal atrophy, vulvodynia, and hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Although evaluating FSD can be a challenge, triaging symptoms by addressing pain before desire and arousal will improve patient outcomes and greatly simplify FSD management.",

Hysterograms were evaluated by means of pressure amplitude, frequency, duration, interval of uterine contractions and also by electromyography. During the last 2-3 weeks of pregnancy only single weak uterine contractions of different intensity were seen. About 18-20 hours a.p. frequency and amplitude of mainly tubocervical directed waves continuously increased. When the fetus entered the birth canal and especially during expulsion of the calf extremely strong irregular contractions occurred, which became very regular during the first hours p. p. After the placenta has been released 3-8 hours p. p., spontaneous uterine motility drastically decreased until the second postpartal week, when it started to increase again.",

The stimulus affects both the epithelial and connective tissue elements of the breast. In many women the breast changes associated with menstruation pass unnoticed. Many others complain of pain and tenderness in one or both breasts, and at times moderate enlargement is observed. In extreme examples, actual secretion of a milky fluid from the nipples may occur.

Data discussed are based on experimental studies in vivo that generally lasted for longer than one year. Information is given on the background of osteoporosis and on several means of inducing changes in bone quality. In young women who start using oral contraceptives based on progestins alone shortly after pubertal development, a significant decrease in bone quality has been documented. World Health Organization experts have concluded that this is not a real argument for restrictions on the use of these contraceptives. In postmenopausal women, no evidence has been found for a bone-protective or an estrogen-antagonistic effect of progestins. A wide range of estrogens have been used that have shown positive effects on bone, which are not antagonized by progestins. The therapeutic use of high-dose megestrol acetate may result in marked negative effects on bone, leading to severe osteoporosis, possibly due to the inherent glucocorticoid activity of this progestin. Other pharmacotherapeutic agents that can be used in postmenopausal therapy, and that clearly have beneficial effects on bone, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP, 147480) is a liver disorder unique to pregnancy, which usually manifests during late pregnancy and disappears spontaneously after delivery. Maternal symptoms are characterised by generalised pruritus with or without jaundice. The main biological features are increased serum alanine transaminase (ALT) activities and serum bile acid concentrations.1–3 Serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) activity remains within normal limits or is increased.4,5 The occurrence of ICP carries a risk for the baby because of premature spontaneous delivery or sudden fetal death and pruritus may cause considerable discomfort for the mother.1–3,6 Cholestasis frequently recurs in subsequent pregnancies and rarely during administration of oral contraceptives.5 The cause of ICP is unknown. However, clinical and epidemiological studies suggest mainly hormonal and genetic factors.1–3,7 Genetic factors have been suggested by the existence of familial cases and by the high incidence of ICP in some ethnic groups, such as the Araucanos Indians of Chile.8 The multidrug resistance 3 ( MDR3 , ABCB4 , 171060) gene, localised on 7q21.1, was first reported to be involved in ICP by de Vree et al .9 In a large consanguineous family, subjects affected by a subtype of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis called PFIC3 were homozygous for a nonsense mutation in exon 23 (R957X) and women affected by ICP were heterozygous; in another family, the same authors reported a homozygous deletion of exon 6 (426-432del) in a PFIC3 patient with consanguineous, healthy parents.9 A mutation in exon 14 of MDR3 (1744delT) was identified in another large pedigree in which all PFIC patients were homozygous for the mutation and women with ICP were heterozygous.10,11 Dixon et al 12 investigated eight women affected by ICP with increased serum GGT activity and no familial history of PFIC. …",

The present aim was to investigate whether the perception of pain varies by phases of the menstrual cycle. 20 women with chronic low pain volunteered to participate and were asked to rate their pain each day during three successive menstrual cycles. The menstrual cycle was divided into four and five phases to be able to compare results. Analysis showed there were phase differences in pain ratings during the menstrual cycle. Regardless of whether the menstrual cycle was divided into four or five phases, women rated pain significantly higher in the menstrual and premenstrual phases than in the midmenstrual and ovulatory phases. This is consistent with other studies showing less pain sensitivity during phases of the menstrual cycle associated with high estrogen. Women with high pain frequency reported more frequency a passive coping style and catastrophizing thoughts.",

      "title": "Atrophic Vaginitis: Diagnosis and Treatment",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Atrophic vaginitis is an inflammation of the vagina which develops when there is a significant decrease in estrogen levels after menopause. The initial and most common symptom is often lack of lubrication during intercourse. Eventually, persistent vaginal dryness may occur leading to dyspareunia. The onset of symptoms may not be immediate and may occur 3 to 4 years after menopause. Nonhormonal treatment includes vaginal moisturizers for atrophy symptoms, lubricants for dyspareunia, hyaluronic acid vaginal tablets and phtoestrogens. Estrogens are known to increase vascularity, secretions and thickness of vagina and decrease vaginal pH. They can be given both systemically or vaginally. Local therapy has been found to be more efficacious than systemic therapy and has the advantage of not having systemic adverse effects. They can be given as pessaries, creams or rings. Delivery system used should be convenient to patient so that therapy is consistent, as that is critical for effect. Improvement in vaginal atrophy symptoms starts within a few weeks of starting vaginal estrogen but, some may need to use it for 4 to 6 weeks before adequate improvement is observed. Selective estrogen receptor modulator bazedoxifene may be combined with estrogens. Postmenopausal vaginal atrophy is a common cause of easily treatable distressing symptoms which severely affect quality of life. How to cite this article Ghumman S.

      "title": "An Uncommon Cause of Debilitating Hip Pain in Pregnancy",
      "abstract": "Introduction Transient osteoporosis of pregnancy (TOP) is an uncommon diagnosis for acute hip pain, which can be found in young healthy women who are progressing through an otherwise normal pregnancy. The pathology and risk factors for TOP are poorly understood, and the diagnosis may be elusive with initially normal radiographs. The emergence of Magnetic Resonance (MR) has enhanced our abilities to identify signs consistent with that of TOP, but once recognized, there still remains a lack of literature on treatments to best care for both mother and fetus (1). Because of its overlap with other pathologies in terms of clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, health care providers must have a high index of suspicion for TOP when assessing acute hip pain in the pregnant patient. Case Report A 27-year-old G5P3013 female presented with acute left hip pain during the 23rd week pregnancy. Deep posterolateral hip pain began a month prior and had worsened rapidly over several weeks. The pain was described as a constant dull ache at rest, which became increasingly sharp in nature with ambulation, pressure, and resisted abduction. Minimal relief was provided by acetaminophen, a 5-d steroid dose pack (previously prescribed by her primary care provider), heat, ice, and rest (ibuprofen was not utilized due to pregnancy). The patient denied a history of trauma to the hip or leg; however, she has had nonspecific hip pain in the past. On examination, the patient exhibited an antalgic gait without lower limb asymmetry, atrophy, soft tissue swelling, nor gross deformity. Moderate tenderness to palpation over the left greater trochanter and lateral tendinous portion of the piriformis was present. Strength testing revealed 5/5 strength with hip flexion, extension, abduction, and adduction. Reproducible moderate pain was present on hip flexion, adduction, and internal rotation. Crepitus was not appreciated and other provocative tests (log roll, single leg raise leg, Ober's test, and FABER/FADIR) were negative. Comparatively, the right hip was without tenderness or strength deficits. Trochanteric bursitis with piriformis strain was diagnosed based on history and physical examination, and a left trochanteric bursa injection (2 mL of 0.25% Marcaine, 2 mL of 0.1% Lidocaine, and 1 mL of Celestone) was performed. The patient was instructed to use acetaminophen as needed for pain and was educated on how to perform rehabilitative stretches and exercises. Five days later, the patient reported a marked increase in pain with radiation down the left leg and difficulty in ambulation. With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) not being immediately available, X-rays of the hip (with an abdominal shield to protect the fetus) were obtained to expedite further evaluation of the hip. Radiographs were read as being without acute pathology despite the worsening clinical picture prompting an MRI to be obtained. Ten days from the initial visit, the patient scheduled an urgent appointment for very sharp left hip pain while ambulating and a dull ache at rest. The pain was 7/10 at its worst and was located deep to the left inguinal region, proximal posterior thigh, and lateral hip. Acetaminophen no longer relieved any of the pain, and the corticosteroids had been ineffective. A cane was obtained 2 d prior, which provided some relief of pain with ambulation. On physical examination, the patient had a difficult time bringing her left leg onto the examination table because of the hip pain. Tenderness was palpated at the left anterior and lateral hip. Severe pain was present with passive range of motion to 90 degrees of flexion, 10 degrees of internal rotation, and 20 degrees of external rotation. Raising the leg off the table caused severe pain of the left hip. Gross sensation to the lower extremity was intact with 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses. Her calves were nontender and without any lower extremity edema nor inguinal adenopathy. The MRI of her left hip demonstrated bone marrow edema in the femoral head, neck, and intertrochanteric region without occult fracture or femoral head collapse (Fig. 1).Figure 1: T1 FSE coronal images of left hip. Bone marrow edema in the left femoral head and neck with a linear hypointense signal in the subchondral bone at the superior aspect of the left femoral head.Transient osteoporosis, pending stress fracture, and early avascular necrosis (AVN) were highest on the differential. Without an indication for surgery, the patient remained in the care of nonoperative specialists. Management at this time involved patient education on transient osteoporosis of the hip (TOH) and its benign, self-limited natural history. Crutches were given to the patient, and she was advised to put no more than 10% of her body weight on the left leg. In contrast to making the patient nonweight bearing, allowing for toe touch weight bearing was considered to help with ambulation and is consistent with a previous meta-analysis, which suggested that there is little difference in partial versus nonweight bearing in the progression of AVN (2). The patient also was advised to avoid rotation on a fixed foot because of the susceptibility of sustaining a fracture. The use of a wheelchair was reserved for later in the pregnancy when the patient's fall risk would increase because of her small body habitus and advanced pregnancy state, making it more difficult to support her weight with crutch walking. At work, the patient was limited to light duty/desk work. Three weeks after the initial presentation, the left hip was worsening despite weight bearing restrictions and activity modification. Additionally, over the past couple of days, she had experienced intermittent numbness in the left calf and foot, foot swelling, and a \"cold\" sensation when her foot was numb. The symptoms were improved with a hot shower and positional changes. The decision was made to repeat an MRI and to obtain a left lower extremity Doppler ultrasound to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) because of the progression of symptoms. Ultrasound imaging showed no DVT, while the MRI demonstrated findings in the left femoral head, suggesting small early subchondral fracture versus mild AVN of the left hip with associated left femoral marrow edema. The findings were slightly less prominent as compared with the prior study, and there was no evidence of femoral head collapse (Fig. 2). These repeat findings continued to be consistent with transient osteoporosis of the left femoral head and neck, and the recommendations for treatment remained unchanged. A later diagnosis of concomitant left lumbar radiculopathy explained the patient's paresthesias to be unrelated to the patient's hip pathology.Figure 2: RADAR Coronal STIR images of L hip (3 wk later). The curvilinear low T1 signal in the subchondral bone the left femoral head was less conspicuous than previous MRI, and there was no evidence of femoral head collapse. Edema-like signal within the left femoral head extending to the neck and intertrochanteric region is similar but less pronounced.Five weeks after the initial presentation, the patient had become increasingly frustrated because she was now bed bound, and her use of crutches had caused pain in the right hip along the adductor tendon in the right groin. The patient requested information about the use of several drugs, including deflazacort, alendronate, and calcitonin for additional treatment. The patient was not a candidate for deflazacort because it is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy due to crossing the placenta. Alendronate and calcitonin are category C for pregnancy and would need to be closely managed by the patient's obstetrician. The risk and benefits of starting a pregnancy category C medication was discussed with the patient versus continuing with symptomatic treatment while allowing the self-limited course of TOP to proceed. Our patient was educated on the knowledge of bisphosphonates crossing the placental barrier, although there were no reports of congenital abnormalities or growth defects (3). Because of the severity of her symptoms, it was decided along with the consultation and guidance of the patient's obstetrician to begin alendronate weekly. One month after the initiation of alendronate, the patient went from being bed bound to returning to work without limitations. She had complete resolution of her hip pain and was ambulating normally without assistance. The patient delivered approximately 3 wk following the resolution of symptoms without complications. Discussion TOP is a rare pathology that can occur in young healthy women in the midst of a normal pregnancy. For the pregnant mother, this may cause severe pain and fractures both before and during delivery which may require surgical intervention. TOP most commonly occurs in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy with degeneration of the femur (TOH) being most often affected. TOH is characterized by the onset of nontraumatic hip pain, which progresses in severity within weeks resulting in decreased hip range of motion, painful ambulation, and immobilization. TOP is a self-limited pathology with symptoms fully resolving after the birth of the child within 6 to 12 months (1,4–8). The pathophysiology and specific risk factors for TOH are poorly understood. TOH is thought to have three stages. The first stage consists of several weeks of progressive hip pain with development of an antalgic gait without radiographic changes, although MRI may show edema. In the second stage, symptoms continue to worsen with radiographs now showing bone demineralization consistent with osteoporosis and normal joint spaces. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans will show a decrease in bone density, and MRI will demonstrate focal edema. After the birth of the child, the third stage consists of a gradual resolution of symptoms and radiographic changes over a 6- to 12-month period (1,4,7). The etiology of TOP is unclear with postulated theories of TOP being a result of an early state of AVN, increased osteoclast activation, viral infection, neurovascular injury, transient ischemic insult to bone, microvascular injury, hormonal imbalance, trauma, or subchondral fracture of the femoral head (1,4,7). The most common risk factor for TOH is pregnancy with others, including poor nutrition and a low calcium diet, trauma, alcohol consumption, smoking, drug use, corticosteroid use, vascular insult, inflammation, osteogenesis imperfecta, hypothyroidism, hypophosphatemia, low testosterone, or low vitamin D. There also have been cases of recurrent TOP in subsequent pregnancies (4,7). A diagnosis of TOH is usually made when conservative treatment of the painful hip has failed, and the decision is made to pursue imaging. Conventional radiography and computed tomography (CT) are often unremarkable and show only subtle changes if there is no fracture present (9). CT may show reduced bone density of the affected area (10). Bone scintigraphy scans show increased uptake of radiotracer; however, this finding is nonspecific and may result from inflammatory changes associated with infection, AVN, or tumors (11). MRI is the most useful imaging modality in TOH and will show findings consistent with bone marrow edema, such as low signal intensity of the marrow on T1-weighted sequences and high signal intensity on T2-weighted and fat-suppressed sequences. This edema typically involves the subchondral bone of the femoral head and often extends to the neck of the femur and intertrochanteric region (12). Bone marrow edema is in itself a nonspecific finding, which can be seen with TOH, subchondral stress fractures, or AVN. Because AVN requires emergent intervention, studies have looked for MR patterns that can differentiate TOH from early AVN. One study showed that lack of subchondral changes on T2-weighted or contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images yielded a 100% positive predictive value for identifying transient lesions presenting with bone marrow edema (13). When considering choices for imaging during pregnancy, radiographs, CT, and bone scintigraphy are typically withheld because of the concerns of fetal exposure to ionizing radiation. MRI is the imaging of choice in pregnancy because it avoids ionizing radiation, although MRI has not conclusively been proven to be without harm to the fetus, thus it should be ordered judiciously (1,12). When making the diagnosis of TOH, one must consider the overlap in clinical and diagnostic presentation TOH has with other pathologies. The relationship between TOH and subchondral stress fractures has been debated because there have been reported cases of TOH with and without the coexistence of subchondral stress fractures. It is unclear if one begets the other, although the existence of cases of TOH without stress fractures would tend to point to stress fractures being a consequence of TOH. Additional support for this theory comes from the weakening and demineralization of bone that occurs with the transient edema of TOH. This inadequate bone structure is likely unable to keep up normal stresses placed on the bone (14). The differentiation between AVN — a surgical emergency, and TOH, a self-limited pathology that does not progress to collapse of the femoral head or future arthritis, through careful evaluation of MRI, can prevent unnecessary surgical intervention (15). Regional migratory osteoporosis (RMO) is diagnosed when transient osteoporosis affects other joints, most commonly the contralateral. Similar to TOH, RMO follows a benign self-limited course (16). With only a small number of published cases of TOP, treatment guidelines are not well established, although conservative therapy has primarily been documented in the literature. An approach focused on reduction of weight-bearing activities, resting the joint, and the use of anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce pain is thought to take advantage of the naturally self-limited course of TOP (17). Any further interventions in the treatment of TOP should be discussed in terms of risks and benefits for the pregnant patient given the self-limited and fully resolving pathology. Surgical decompression to reduce the intramedullary pressure caused by bone marrow edema has been demonstrated in case reports, although there is debate on the utility of this procedure and its potential to increase the fracture risk of already osteoporotic bone (14,18). Oral and intravenous bisphosphonate therapies have shown rapid efficacy in resolving TOH (19,20). Ringe et al. (21) found that administering an initial 4-mg intravenous dose of ibandronate with an optional second 2-mg dose at 3 months decreased visual analog pain scales by an average of 94.3% (n = 12). There also was a decrease from 10.1% to 2.6% difference in bone mineral density from the affected hip to the unaffected hip at 6-month follow-up. The use of bisphosphonate to treat TOH in a pregnant woman is debated because of the confirmed deposit in fetal bone due to transplacental pass. However, cases exist that show the benefit of this treatment without causing fetal harm (22). Potential alternatives to bisphosphonate therapy include the use of calcitonin (23,24) or teriparatide (25) therapy. Case reports have demonstrated that both of these treatments are potentially effective in resolving TOH, but there is a general lack of evidence that they are superior to conservative therapy alone. Conclusions TOP can result in devastating debilitation for an otherwise young healthy pregnant female. TOP is often difficult to diagnose because of the need for advanced imaging and the nonspecific nature of its clinical presentation. Conservative treatment may not be sufficient for TOP, and the risks versus benefits for both the mother and fetus must be discussed prior to using second-line treatments. Health care providers must have a high level of suspicion for this acute cause of pain. With greater recognition and reporting of this pathology, there can be a more robust establishment of guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of TOP.",

CONTENTS: We searched the literature in Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Ovid and Google using the terms \"low back pain\", \"pelvic girdle pain\", \"lumbopelvic pain\", \"posterior pelvic pain\", \"pregnancy-related low back pain\", \"pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain\" and \"pregnancy-related lumbopelvic pain\", for articles in English, Portuguese and Spanish in the last 20 years or older, where relevant. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy is one of the main causes of lumbosacral pain, and one of the most frequent diseases during gestation. The correct management of this pathology reduces negative impacts on the life of pregnant women.",

During pregnancy, the course of this disease is unpredictable; worsening of symptoms occurs more likely during the first half of pregnancy and postpartum. MG can be well managed during pregnancy with relatively safe and effective therapies. Cesarean section is recommended only for obstetric reasons; epidural anesthesia is advised to reduce physical and emotional stress. Anticholinesterase drugs are the mainstay of treatment, when MG symptoms are not satisfactorily controlled, corticosteroids, azathioprine and in some cases cyclosporin A may be used. Life-threatening conditions (e.g., respiratory insufficiency) may occur during pregnancy; therefore, intensive check-ups by a gynecologist and a neurologist are necessary.",

      "abstract": "This article reports on 11 cases of complete uterine perforation in multiparous women aged 22-45. The perforations occurred with several types of IUDs and 2 months-5 years after insertion. In all 11 cases the device was found in pelvic or abdominal position and laparotomy was necessary in 5 cases. Risks of perforation are increased by uterine malformations by pathological conditions weakening the uterine walls by an inappropriate choice of the device or by an insufficiently experienced doctor. Symptoms of perforations are either nonexistant or nonspecific; often pelvic pain is present or the device strings are missing. Diagnosis was in most cases done at the time of gynecological examination done for purposes other than perforation; if perforation is suspected echography and/or hysterosalpingography would be very useful diagnostic tools. The device must then be removed by celioscopy or if necessary by laparotomy. Incidence of uterine perforation varies greatly according to different authors; however it can be estimated to be near 1.2/1000. (Summary in ENG)",

      "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the predictive value of the symptoms of an intrauterine hematoma (IUH) for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods A literature review was performed with the search terms, including intrauterine/subchorionic/retroplacental/subplacental hematoma/hemorrhage/bleeding/collection/fluid, covering the period from January, 1981 to January, 2014. We just focused on the pregnancy outcomes associated with different symptoms of an IUH. Results It is generally agreed that a retroplacental, posterior or subchorionic in the fundus of uterus, and/or persistent IUH is associated with adverse outcomes in the ongoing pregnancy. However, the prognosis value of both volume and gestational age at diagnosis of IUH still remains controversial. Some researchers argue that a large IUH is associated with an increased risk of adverse events during pregnancy while others refuted. It is believed by some that the earlier an IUH was detected, the higher the risk for adverse outcomes would be, while no or weak association were reported by other studies. The prognostic value of the simultaneous presence of vaginal bleeding on pregnancy outcome is also controversial. Conclusions Both the position relative to the placenta or uterus and duration of IUH have strong predictive value on the prognosis in the ongoing pregnancy. However, the prognostic values of the IUH volume, gestational age at diagnosis and the simultaneous presence of vaginal bleeding remain controversial up to now. Moreover, most of previous reports are small, uncontrolled studies with incomplete information. Prospective, large sample, cohorts studies which take all detailed symptoms of an IUH into consideration are needed when we evaluate its clinical significance in the prognosis of pregnancy.",

It is a condition when a female has absence of menses for more than 3 months when she was menstruating regularly or 6 months when she was having irregular menstrual cycles. It may be caused by a variety of reasons like mental stress, physical stress, hormonal imbalance etc. It may be associated with a number of symptoms which together constitute a disease to be cured. Homoeopathic mode of treatment considers totality of symptoms as the basis of prescription which restore the original well being of the patient by removing signs and symptoms of the disease. Along with this homoeopathic medicines remove the underlying pathology.

The prevalence estimated range from 25 to 90 percent among women adolescents studies India reported the prevalence range between 50 to 87.8 percent. Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as cramping pain in the lower abdomen occurring just before or during the menstruation period in the absence of pelvic pathology showing signs and symptoms of nausea, vomiting, mood swings, headache, lethargy and diarrhea which all are common complaints associated with dyspareunia, infertility and menstrual disorder. SHIATSU is a Japanese word that means fingers pressure which is a type of massage treatment that uses gentle manipulations, stretches and pressure methods on fingers, thumb, elbows, knees and feets to promote the body's natural ability to recover. Hot pack for cramps are also used by women to treat their montly discomfort. Heat is a common method for coping with dysmenorrhea which causes lowers muscle tension and stress can also improve pelvic blood circulation.

Inferior vena cava compression, usually detected by reductions in mean and/or pulse pressure in the brachial artery, did not occur at any time, whether or not the uterus was displaced to the left. Abdominal aortic compression, suggested by popliteal pressure fall, was maintained into the second stage of labor, was aggravated when the women bore down, and was alleviated only when bearing down efforts ceased and the uterus was displaced to the left. Bearing down efforts are therefore yet another mechanism by which distal aortic and possibly uteroplacental blood flow can be prejudiced. Their avoidance can be advantageous to the fetus at risk.",

      "title": "Some Aspects of Sexual Difference in Prenatal Growth and Death",
      "abstract": "A first attempt is made to examine three groups of newly developed facts concerning intrauterine fetal life in their relation to sexual difference in prenatal death; the result of this examination is applied to the current conclusion that the mammalian and human male is \"inherently weaker than the female.\" Male and female fetuses are alike forced to undergo their development in a female environment provided by the mother. This condition, combined with the further probable fact that maleness (from the Y-sperm stage to adult life) has tendencies, demands and requirements other and greater than those of femaleness, provides unequal chances to male and female for unrestricted growth and health. An apparently sex-specific hormone (alcohol-soluble; from ovary, placenta, etc.) enters the fetal circulation and is responsible for a special phase of prenatal growth in the uterus of the female; in the mammae and suprarenals (and thyroid?) of both males and females; in the prostate and Mullerian duct system of males. Adverse or antagonistic effects-oedema and degeneration in some cases-have been described in the testes, prostate, penis and epididymis of males. The serological studies in progress at the Frauen-klinik at Halle indicate that the mother's blood reacts to the fetus as to a foreign body. This \"antitestis\" body probably enters the fetal blood and apparently induces a reaction in the male fetus. The mother's blood does not appear to react similarly against a female fetus. The vitamine B, protein and metabolic requirements in postnatal stages are shown to be unequal in males and females, and this difference is probably present during fetal life. Since these requirements are apparently greater in the male this should result in a higher male death-rate in that fraction of mothers whose nutritional status is near the border line. From the fact that an abnormally high proportion of males is found among the prenatal dead the conclusion is currently drawn by physicians, geneticists and others, that the male is inherently and genetically the weaker sex. This conclusion can be drawn only on the assumption that intrauterine environment is essentially equivalent for male and female. The facts discussed here show that such equivalence does not exist.",

      "abstract": "Let's talk about it Suppression of menstruation, by extending the duration of contraceptives containing estro-progestins (oral contraception, patch or vaginal ring) to long cycles, is a new approach in the field of contraception. These extended cycles aim at obtaining prolonged amenorrhea, interrupted periodically by a free interval of 7 days without hormone intake and thus causing breakthrough bleeding. Pathologies, which are supposed to get some benefit from the suppression of menstruation and of hormone level variations related to ovarian activity, are widely recognized as an indication. Some interest is also coming up for so called life style indications. Treatment issues, advantages and disadvantages are examined in the light of women's expectations and right to access to informed consent and independent choice.",

      "abstract": "Актуальность. Беременность — очень важный, критический этап в жизни каждой женщины. Хронический стресс может влиять на течение беременности, приводя к увеличению числа осложнений. Перемещенные лица обычно имеют более высокие показатели депрессивных и посттравматических симптомов, чем население регионов, в которые они переселяются. В антенатальном периоде повышена склонность к психоэмоциональным расстройствам, около 54 % женщин испытывают тревогу в течение всей беременности. Угроза прерывания беременности (УПБ) — самое распространенное осложнение беременности, возникающее в 15–20 % случаев продолжающейся беременности и связанное с осложненным течением беременности и родов. Гормональный гомеостаз играет важную роль в поддержании и развитии беременности. Цель работы: изучить особенности взаимосвязи гормонального профиля и тревожных расстройств у женщин — внутренне перемещенных лиц (ВПЛ) с угрожающим прерыванием беременности, проживающих в Луганской области, для усовершенствования лечебно-профилактических мероприятий и профилактики акушерских и перинатальных осложнений у таких женщин. Материалы и методы. Обследовали 24 беременных со статусом ВПЛ, находившихся на стационарном лечении по поводу УПБ в учреждениях здравоохранения Луганской области (I группа). Контрольную группу (II группа) составили 25 беременных с неосложненным анамнезом с физиологическим течением беременности аналогичного гестационного срока. Определяли концентрацию эстрадиола, прогестерона, пролактина, кортизола. Для оценки уровня тревожности применялся тест Спилбергера. Результаты. У пациенток группы I выявлен статистически значимый относительный прогестероновый дефицит, достоверное превышение уровней стресс-ассоциированных гормонов пролактина и кортизола. Показатели реактивной и личностной тревожности достоверно выше в группе I. Установлена положительная корреляционная связь между показателем реактивной тревожности и концентрацией кортизола. Предикторами развития тревожных расстройств, по данным множественного регрессионного анализа, выступают уровень личностной тревожности и концентрации кортизола и прогестерона. Выводы. Антенатальное изучение показателей тревожности, уровня стресс-ассоциированных гормонов, прогестерона у беременных — ВПЛ с симптомами УПБ позволит индивидуализировать подход к ведению и своевременно разработать в случае необходимости корректирующие и реабилитационные мероприятия, которые будут способствовать благополучному завершению беременности и влиять на здоровье матери и ее потомства.",

Balance is also impacted throughout this time, leading to symptoms such as vertigo and unsteadiness. These symptoms may appear at any time and can cause disability and physical impairment. Little has been published about vertigo in pregnancy. We performed a narrative review of vertigo in pregnant patients. Vertigo in pregnant females may be associated with hormonal changes in peripheral structures and inner ear organs. Meniere’s disease, vestibular migraine, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo are usually exacerbated during pregnancy. Specific changes to hearing and proprioception in the physical examination are also noted between the second and third trimester of pregnancy. These symptoms are usually seen in pregnant patients throughout this time. Some types of vertigo may be exacerbated and others may present at any time of pregnancy. Further research is needed to understand the clinical and pathological association of audiovestibular symptoms during pregnancy.",

There is another class of infants who may be considered in practically the same category as premature infants—the weaklings, infants born at term or nearly at term, who have suffered more or less severely during their intra-uterine existence through factors which interfered with their nutrition, and consequently interfered with their development. They are classed as congenitally diseased infants. For our purposes, we shall consider the conditions most frequently seen in premature infants which are of especial interest to the surgeon in three groups: ( 1 ) congenital malformations of the fetus due to intrauterine diseases and deformities, (2) pathologic conditions developing at or shortly after",

Prevalence ranges from 10% to 50% but fewer than half of affected women consult primary care.\n\nA clear history of symptoms and a good obstetric and gynaecological history are essential, as is a history of bowel habits, as constipation can be associated with stress incontinence.

Use of combined oral estrogen-progestin contraception in extended \"cycles\" of 3, 6 and 12 or more months is now under active study. Extended cycle contraception is abided by a better compliance than conventional cycle contraception with ensuing optimized contraceptive effectiveness. Hypothetically, transdermal or transvaginal combined contraception could be used in extended cycles. Tolerance is comparable for both methods and unpredicted bleeding, initially more frequent during long cycle treatment tends to become less frequent after about 6 months a compared with conventional cycles. Usual safety parameters appear to be similar under both contraceptive modalities. Comfort and well being brought by extended cycle use (5 to 10 times fewer days of bloating or perimenstrual pain) allow to estimate that, according to acceptability studies, 10 to 40 percent of women of reproductive age would currently choose extended cycle contraception.",

      "title": "Effect of pregnancy on periodontal and dental health",
      "abstract": "AbstractClinical studies have shown that oral tissues can be affected by pregnancy. Pregnancy-related changes are most frequent and most marked in gingival tissue. Pregnancy does not cause gingivitis, but may aggravate pre-existing disease. The most marked changes are seen in gingival vasculature. Characteristic of pregnancy gingivitis is that the gingiva is dark red, swollen, smooth and bleeds easily. Women with pregnancy gingivitis may sometimes develop localized gingival enlargements. The gingival changes usually resolve within a few months of delivery if local irritants are eliminated. The inflammatory changes are usually restricted to the gingiva and probably do not cause permanent changes in periodontal tissues more often than those in the non-pregnant state. Although it is widely believed that pregnancy is harmful to the teeth, the effect of pregnancy on the initiation or progression of caries is not clear. Previous studies, however, indicate that the teeth do not soften, i.e. no significant withdrawal of calcium or other minerals occurs in the teeth. It is mainly the environment of the tooth that is affected. The number of certain salivary cariogenic microorganisms may increase in pregnancy, concurrently with a decrease in salivary pH and buffer effect. Changes in salivary composition in late pregnancy and during lactation may temporarily predispose to dental caries and erosion. Although their underlying mechanisms of action are not fully understood, pregnancy-related changes in the oral environment may have some untoward temporary or permanent effects on oral health. Most of these effects could be avoided by practising good oral hygiene.KeywordsEstrogensGingivaProgesteroneSalivaTooth",

      "abstract": "In Brief Background Certain situations dictate conservative management of grade 4 uterine or vaginal vault prolapse in women. The reduction of a prolapse may not be possible if the vagina cannot retain a single pessary. We have used double pessaries in the management of this condition. Technique With the patient in the dorsal lithotomy position, either a Donut or Inflatoball (Milex Products Inc., Chicago, IL) pessary is inserted and pushed into the vagina as far as is comfortable. A second pessary, either a flexible Gellhorn or Shaatz (Milex Products Inc.), then is placed caudad to the first. Experience We have used this approach in five women who have been followed for 7-15 months. There have been no erosions or vaginitis and all the women experienced symptomatic relief. Conclusion In women who want or require conservative management of grade 4 prolapse and are unable to retain a single pessary, the placement of two pessaries often will be successful. Two pessaries may be used to reduce grade 4 uterine or vaginal vault prolapse when one pessary cannot be retained.",

Endometriosis is often co-morbid with psychological distress that worsens the quality-of-life of affected women. Methods: The main aim was to review the current evidence about the management of endometriosis from a psychosomatic perspective. The literature was synthesized and summarized in a narrative format. The literature search was conducted using PubMed, based on reports, review articles, meta-analysis, overviews and guidelines published in English in the last 15 years. Results: Five main topics are covered and discussed: pathogenesis of endometriosis, endometriosis and psychological features, endometriosis and psychiatric comorbidity, early life stress as predisposing factor for pain sensitization; and implications for treatment. Conclusions: The available literature clearly emphasizes that it is important to consider and to treat the comorbidity of endometriosis with psychological factors that affect pain management.",

Although many life-threatening causes such as malignancies or infections have been described, most patients who report persistent night sweats in the primary care setting do not have a serious underlying disorder. Conditions commonly associated with night sweats include menopause, mood disorders, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hyperthyroidism, and obesity. If a clinical diagnosis is apparent based on the initial history and physical examination, specific treatment for four to eight weeks may be offered. When the history and physical examination do not reveal a specific cause, physicians should proceed with a systematic and cost-conscious strategy that uses readily available laboratory and imaging studies, such as a complete blood count, tuberculosis testing, thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, HIV testing, C-reactive protein level, and chest radiography. Additional tests that could be considered selectively include computed tomography of the chest and/or abdomen, bone marrow biopsy, polysomnography, and/or additional laboratory studies if indicated. If these results are normal, and no additional disorders are suspected, reassurance and continued monitoring are recommended.

      "abstract": "Menopause is a normal developmental stage in a woman's life, marking the permanent cessation of menstruation resulting from irreversible changes in the hormonal and reproductive functions of the ovaries and is associated with a large number of symptoms ranging from physical to psychological. Some of the common oral manifestations are oral burning sensation with associated mucosal infections, pain, altered taste perception, and alveolar bone loss. These symptoms may unfavorably affect oral health and treatment needs requiring dentists to devise newer methods that would add along to the treatment modalities advised by gynecologists in relieving menopausal women from above symptoms. The present case report describes an innovative method of fabricating a metal base denture in an edentulous female that would help perimenopausal/menopausal/post-menopausal edentulous women feel hot/cold sensations of food/liquids, thereby giving them relief from pain, better taste perception, and relief from associated allergic and candidal infections that are common with conventional acrylic base dentures.",

      "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this rapid review is to provide a systematic overview of the literature on the use of pregnancy pillow interventions during pregnancy to support the pelvis, lower back, gravid uterus and left lateral recumbent maternal sleeping position. Introduction: Symptoms and complications experienced during pregnancy are often individualised. They can vary over time and in intensity during the antenatal period. The prevalence rates of physiological pregnancy symptoms or complications highlights the need for interventions that ideally address multiple issues. It is unclear whether pregnancy pillow interventions offer support for pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain; pregnancy-related lower back pain; abdominal ligament/muscle weakness; and/or facilitate a left lateral recumbent maternal sleeping position. Inclusion criteria: This review will consider cross-sectional, longitudinal, prospective or retrospective studies; reviews of any type; and syntheses featured in peer reviewed journals or developed by highly regarded organisations. Outcomes will include supporting the pelvis; supporting the lower back; supporting the gravid uterus; and/or supporting a left lateral recumbent maternal sleeping position. Methods: The review aims to find published research studies, reviews of any type and syntheses (practice or evidence-based recommendations or practitioner guidelines). The key information sources to be searched are the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); EBSCO; and EMBASE (Ovid). Two reviewers will screen the titles and abstracts for inclusion. The full text of publications meeting the inclusion criteria will then be examined for eligibility. Meta-data will be extracted using a standard template. Eligible publications will be critically appraised using the relevant JBI Critical Appraisal Tool as appropriate to the publication type. Reviewer two will evaluated the assessment made by reviewer one in line with rapid review practice. The results will be synthesised as a narrative synthesis of the publications.

      "abstract": "Pendahuluan: Berbagai keluhan dapat terjadi pada masa kehamilan, salah satunya adalah mual dan mutah pada awal kehamilan. Mual (nausea) dan muntah (morning sickness) adalah gejala yang wajar dan sering didapatkan pada kehamilan trimester pertama. Hampir 50-90% wanita hamil mengalami mual pada trimester pertama. Hal ini dapat menimbulkan kerusakan jaringan yang dapat membahayakan kesehatan ibu dan perkembangan janin yang dikandungnya. Intervensi medis untuk mual muntah pada kehamilan tidak ada yang disetujui oleh FDA. Beberapa pegobatan yang dianjurkan adalah salah satunya pengobatan Cina titik akupresur pada titik perikardium 6 (P6). Metode: Pencarian artikel jurnal dilakukan secara elektronik dengan menggunakan beberapa database, yaitu: database Sage, Sience Direct, Proquest, dan Google Scholar Perpustakaan Universitas Airlangga dari tahun Januari 2004 sampai April 2014. Keyword yang digunakan adalah “Pressure /Akupresur”, “Nausea/Mual”, “Vomiting/ Muntah”, “Pregnancy/Ibu hamil”; sehingga didapatkan 6 artikel untuk di-review. Hasil: Intervensi keperawatan komplementer akupresur pada titik P6 dapat dikategorikan sebagai intervensi yang aman dan cukup efektif dalam mengurangi mual dan muntah pada ibu hamil yang tidak mendapatkan terapi lain selain akupresur pada titik P6. Pembahasan: Penggunaan metode keperawatan komplementer dengan akupresur pada titik P6 efektif dalam mengurangi mual dan muntah pada ibu hamil yang belum memerlukan antiemetik. Metode keperawatan komplementer dengan akupresur pada titik P6 penggunaannya harus lebih dipromosikan dan diimplementasikan sebagai rutinitas pada penanganan ibu hamil dengan keluhan mual dan muntah. Kesimpulan: Stimulus pada titik P6 dapat mengatasi mual dan muntah.",

      "abstract": "In Brief BACKGROUND: The NuvaRing is a soft, flexible, ring-shaped vaginal contraceptive device that is placed by the user herself. Incorrect placement has not been described, because any intravaginal position allows appropriate hormonal delivery through the vaginal mucosa. CASE: A 22-year-old otherwise healthy woman presented with 2 months of urinary urgency, frequency, and pelvic pain, which were unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. Her symptoms began immediately after placement of a NuvaRing vaginal contraceptive device, which she was subsequently unable to locate. Thorough evaluation revealed the ring in the urinary bladder. CONCLUSION: Bladder or urethral foreign body should be considered in the evaluation of patients with chronic cystitis, especially if the patient uses vaginal medical devices. Intravesicular placement of a device may occur even without psychiatric or physical comorbidities. The intravaginal contraceptive ring device may be inadvertently placed into the bladder, even by a patient with no underlying psychiatric or medical conditions.",

One of the factors causing the syndrome is Body Mass Index. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between Body Mass Index and premenstrual syndrome. The formula used in selecting respondents was total sampling with a cross-sectional approach. The assessment form used is SPAF and data analysis used Spearman rank to measure the relationship between Body Mass Index and PMS in Harapan Bangsa University. The conclusion of this study there is a relationship between BMI and PMS p: 0.00 and the relationship is quite close (0.456). Women with PMS disorders have low serotonin levels which causes early or late ovulation. This can trigger the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which cause complaints such as breast pain and bloating. At the same time, an increase in the hormone prostaglandin causes the uterus to contract which causes abdominal pain during the menstrual cycle.&#x0D; Keywords: Body Mass Indeks, premenstrual syndrome, female student",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Urinary and Fecal Control depends on two factors, the first is an inherent, and the second is an acquired. The inherent factor is the presence of an intact sound IUS and IAS. The acquired factor is, through toilet training, having and maintaining high sympathetic tone at the IUS and the IAS. This keeps the sphincters contracted and the urethra and the anal canal empty and closed all the time.\r\n\r\nLaceration of the collagen chassis of the IUS leads to its weakness and subsequent stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and/or over active bladder (OAB).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, lacerations of the collagen chassis of the IAS lead to its weakness and subsequent fecal incontinence (FI).\r\n\r\nThe lacerations in one/or both sphincters are mainly caused by childbirth trauma (CBT). The pelvic collagen is hormone dependent and drop in the estrogen level causes further weakness of the sphincters.\r\n\r\nIn men senile prostatic enlargement compress the upper part of the urethra leading to irregular dilatation of the bladder neck allowing some urine to enter the urethra on increases of abdominal pressure causing frequent desire to void. The start of voiding may take some time (hesitancy) because of the effort to open the urethra which is compressed by the enlarged prostate.\r\n\r\nReconstructive surgery: In women the commonest cause of incontinence is traumatic lacerations of the collagen chassis of the IUS and/or the IAS from CBT. Reconstructive surgery is to restore the normal anatomy and it will restore the function. A new operation “urethra-ano-vaginoplasty” is introduced where mending the torn collagen chassis of the IUS and overlapping the anterior vaginal wall flaps over the mended IUS; and mending the torn chassis of the IAS, overlapping the posterior vaginal wall flaps over the mended sphincter, approximate the two levator ani muscles and repair of the perineum is done.",

Perubahan tersebut terjadi dalam berbagai aspek yaitu, perubahan hormonal, fisiologis, psikologis maupun sosial Salah satu perubahan fisiologis yang dialami oleh perempuan pada saat pubertas yaitu dengan mengalami mensturasi. Menstruasi adalah siklus bulanan yang terjadi pada wanita dengan ditandai oleh pengeluaran darah dan sel-sel tubuh dari vagina yang berlangsung selama tiga hingga tujuh hari. Beberapa hari sebelum kita mengalami kejadian menstruasi biasanya ditandai dengan beberapa gejala seperti gangguan menstruasi yang dapat berupa payudara yang membengkak, nyeri dan mudah tersinggung. Dan gangguan cukup berat seperti kram yang disebabkan oleh kontraksi otot-otot halus rahim, sakit kepala, sakit pada bagian tengah perut, gelisah, letih, hidung tersumbat, dan rasa ingin menangis sering pusing dan menjadi emosional, Adapun kondisi yang melibatkan emosi seperti depresi dan kemarahan , kondisi ini dikenal sebagai premenstrual syndrome.

Ectopic pregnancy must be primarily tubal, tubo-ovarian, or ovarian, but as it can not develop to term in any of these structures, it ruptures either into the folds of the broad ligament or into the peritoneal cavity; and if the chorionic attachments are not then destroyed, there is no reason why the pregnancy may not continue to term.

      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> Pituitary apoplexy is a clinical syndrome of selective or multi-hormonal pituitary failure, classically described as a result of infarction of a pre-existing pituitary adenoma associated with pituitary or peri-pituitary haemorrhage. Previous reports in pregnancy have described pituitary apoplexy complicating macroprolactinomas, growth-hormone secreting tumours, and auto-immune lymphocytic hypophysitis. Radiological diagnosis is difficult, particularly with the reticence to use contrast media in pregnancy. In addition, the profound changes in most pituitary axes during pregnancy complicate interpretation of hormone levels. <h3>Case study</h3> MI, a 31-year-old with three previous low-risk pregnancies, presented with recurrent new-onset unexplained collapse from 28- to 33-weeks gestation. The history was suggestive of vaso-vagal episodes; precipitated by headache, or prolonged standing. However, progressive frequency, spontaneous onset at rest and generalised seizure activity necessitated further investigation. Electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and continuous cardiac monitoring during episodes demonstrated no cardiological cause. No neurological deficit was demonstrated. Following transfer to a tertiary centre, magnetic resonance imaging identified changes in-keeping with acute haemorrhage within an enlarged pituitary gland, consistent with pituitary apoplexy. A short synacthen test suggested sub-optimal pituitary-adrenal axis function. No other pituitary deficiency was demonstrated. MI was treated medically with steroid replacement therapy and proceeded to term with emergency caesarean section for failure to progress. <h3>Discussion</h3> Hypopituitarism can present insidiously with variable involvement of trophic hormonal axes. It is plausible that the increased frequency and severity of the episodes was a presenting feature of progressive corticotrophin deficiency, reinforced by clinical improvement on steroid replacement.",

      "title": "Late‐stage clinical development in lower urogenital targets: sexual dysfunction",
      "abstract": "In recent years, late‐stage clinical drug development that primarily focuses on urogenital targets has centered around four areas of medical need (both unmet need and aiming to improve on existing therapies). These include male sexual dysfunction (MSD), female sexual dysfunction (FSD), prostatic pathology (neoplastic, pre‐neoplasitic, and non‐neoplastic), and improvement in lower urinary tract symptoms. Despite the regulatory approval of compounds to treat erectile dysfunction (ED), benign prostatic hyperplasia, a number of treatments for overactive bladder, and stress urinary incontinence, there remains a deficiency in addressing a number of conditions that arise out of pathophysiological dysfunction resulting in lower urogenital tract sexual conditions. In terms of late‐stage clinical development, significant progress has most recently been made in MSD development, especially in understanding further a common and complex sexual dysfunction – that of premature ejaculation. The search also continues for compounds that improve ED in terms of better efficacy and superior safety profile compared to the currently marketed phosphodiesterase‐5‐inhibitors. Whilst there are no approved medications to treat the subtypes of FSD, there has been significant progress in attempting to better understand how to appropriately assess treatment benefit in clinical trial settings for this difficult to diagnose and treat condition. This review will focus on late‐stage human clinical development pertaining to MSD and FSD. British Journal of Pharmacology (2006) 147 , S153–S159. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0706638",

      "abstract": "Numerous studies have demonstrated how routine episiotomies can cause additional problems like poor postpartum sexual function, ongoing perineal pain, and increased anal sphincter damage resulting in flatus or fecal incontinence. To combat the high frequency of maternal labor morbidity, antibiotic prophylaxis is recognized as a method of intervention that can be applied. . On the other hand, several studies seem to support the use of preventive antibiotics in situations of severe perineal rupture. It is not advised to use antibiotics excessively due to the rising prevalence of their use, which increases the danger of antibiotic resistance. As a result, following a serious perineal tear, the use of prophylactic antibiotics is crucial to preventing infection and determining whether a side effect is present in the mother or infant. Therefore it is necessary to assess the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce maternal morbidity and side effects of third and fourth-degree perineal rupture during vaginal delivery.",

It is present when there has been a period of amenorrhea for 12 consecutive months with no underlying pathological cause and it occurs at a mean age of 51 years. Prior to the menopause the patient is subjected to a period of fluctuation in estrogen levels, with menstrual irregularity as the main characteristic.3",

      "title": "Is it Time to Test the Effect of Weight Loss on Testosterone?",
      "abstract": "Testosterone is a sex-steroid hormone, synthesized in the testes, with biologic effects on numerous tissues. Low circulating concentrations, seen with testicular or hypothalamic–pituitary defects, are often associated with decreased sexual function, muscle mass, and poor quality of life, along with a risk of osteoporosis. Primary testicular failure can be due to testicular trauma, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or chromosomal abnormalities, although secondary causes, also termed centrally mediated hypogonadism, are associated with pituitary tumors or hypothalamic disease. In addition to these well-known etiologies, there is an increasing appreciation that hypogonadism can be the result of aging, medications, and chronic diseases.\n\nA physiological decrease in testosterone concentrations has been well documented after the fourth or fifth decade of life and has been postulated to result from a decline in both testicular and hypothalamic–pituitary function. In scenarios in which the patient has a clear pathophysiologic mechanism for the hypogonadism, treatment with testosterone is nearly always recommended to alleviate symptoms of hypogonadism and maintain secondary sexual characteristics (1).\n\nMen on replacement therapy should be monitored for polycythemia, falls in serum high-density lipoprotein, worsening of sleep apnea, and increase in prostate-specific antigen concentrations (2, 3). Because long-term evidence of safety with supplementation is yet to be established, testosterone therapy is not routinely recommended in older men or in men with an unclear underlying etiology for their low testosterone concentrations. Because low serum testosterone is commonly observed in chronic illness, there may be less invasive ways to naturally increase serum concentrations. This circumstance creates an opportunity to explore other intervention options that could favorably increase the endogenous testosterone production in the absence of potential side effects.\n\nThe interpretation of laboratory tests can be confusing in men as they age and become more obese because both factors modulate sex by hormone-binding globulin (SHBG)3 concentrations.

      "abstract": "Pregnancy and childbirth as a physiological process in most cases go smoothly. However, sometimes there are sudden complications that lead to conditions that can endanger the women and baby. Observing and recognizing signs that point to possible complications is the foundation of the midwifery care. In premature labor, the first supply and care of the newborn is important in accordance with its condition.Shoulder dystocia, fetopelvic disproportion, irregularity of the posture and position, deflection attitudes are states that are important to notice and recognize in time. They often lead to prolonged birth. The prolapsed umbilical cord is an extremely urgent condition that requires a rapid reaction from the whole team to prevent neonatal mortality. One of the leading causes of mortality during and / or after delivery is bleeding. The most common causes of extreme bleeding directly or during childbirth are: abnormal placenta implantation; the placenta previa, the accreta, the increta, the percreta, the abruption of the placenta. Severe perineal (third or fourth degree of laceration) may be left short-term and long-term consequences. Immediately after birth there is a loss of blood, the need for surgical treatment of early pain. It is possible to develop hematoma and the appearance of vaginal bleeding immediately after delivery. Bleeding is continuous, not dependent on uterine contractions and is usually contractioned during uterine examination. These bleeds fall into an emergency because relatively large amounts of blood can be lost in relatively short periods of time, especially if there is a disruption of the cervix which is protected against the inner lining and the lateral veins of the vagina . It is needed after postpartum placement and placement examination, access audit and soft exploration, locate lacerations and correctly surgically care for them. Preeclampsia is a disorder of unknown etiology, specific to pregnancy, characterized by newly developed hypertension and proteinuria after the 20th week of pregnancy in previously normotensive women. Eclampsia is the sudden onset of convulsions during pregnancy or postpartum period with gestational hypertension, proteinuria, preeclampsia, or superimposed preeclampsia. In all the complications at birth, the most important is character recognition and rapid intervention. The primary midwife activity is to recognize irregularities and signs of complications in time. The basis of the midwifery care is knowledge of physiological birth, the observation of pathological changes and in accordance with their competences, the proper conduct of the procedures.",

This occurs first during adolescence, during which the prostate gains 2 times. The next period starts at about 25 years and continues until the end of life. In fact, during this period, we say that the prostate grows benign. This increase until 40 years of age does not usually make a mark, but about half of the people between the ages of 51 and 60 and 90% of men over the age of 80 are symptom-free. In addition to age, factors such as familial history, obesity, heart disease, diabetes and lack of physical activity also contribute to the disease. Benign prostatic hyperplasia causes pressure on the urethra and narrowing down, resulting in symptoms such as frequent urination, delayed urination, poor urine flow, urinating during sleep, pain in the urine, disconnecting urine and pain during ejaculation. Of course, in some cases, as long as urine retention does not occur, one does not notice his illness. In this book, the order for the production of a herbal remedy for the treatment of prostate is given.",

Studies were also carried out of the relationships between artificial insemination or natural mating times, oviposi‐tion time and female fertility. 2. Sexual activity (as measured by the number of complete matings observed) followed a trimodal pattern with peaks of activity in the second to third, 5th to 6th and 10th to 15th hours of the photo‐period. The last peak in sexual activity was the most important in both length and intensity. 3. The rhythm in sexual activity was entrained by the light/dark transition. 4. Female fertility was lowest during the period from 4 h before to 1 h after oviposition and greatest in the periods 8 to 4 h before and 1 to 7 h after oviposition. 5. The periods of maximum female fertility did not coincide with the periods of greatest sexual activity. More than 60% of all matings observed occurred during periods of intermediate female fertility. It would therefore appear that natural mating is not consistent with optimal female reproductive performance under artificial husbandry conditions. 6. The results are discussed in relation to a possible reduction in the number of males necessary in breeder populations of Muscovy ducks with a view to reducing the cost of producing ducklings.",

PFPT is a program of functional retraining to improve pelvic floor muscle strength, endurance, power, and relaxation in patients with pelvic floor dysfunction. Based on the available evidence, PFPT with or without supplemental modalities can improve or cure symptoms of urinary incontinence, POP, fecal incontinence, peripartum and postpartum pelvic floor dysfunction, and hypertonic pelvic floor disorders, including pelvic floor myofascial pain, dyspareunia, vaginismus, and vulvodynia. Currently, there is conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of perioperative PFPT before or after POP and urinary incontinence surgery.PFPT has robust evidence-based support and clear benefit as a first-line treatment for most pelvic floor disorders. Standards of PFPT treatment protocols, however, vary widely and larger well designed trials are recommended to show long-term effectiveness.",

Numerous foreign things, including hair, thread, rubber bands, metallic rings, nuts, and vacuum erection devices, have been reported to be used for garroting in the literature search. Determining the precise cause of such anomalous behavior can be difficult. If there is an underlying mental disorder, the situation becomes even more complex. While such mishaps in the elderly population may be for the relief of lower urinary tract symptoms such as frequency or incontinence, in young persons, they may be for sexual stimulation and erection augmentation. These devices tightly constrict the penis root, obstructing the venous return and causing corpora congestion that leads to ischemia, gangrene, or necrosis. We describe our observations of three incidents of penile garroting and its aftereffects. Here, we also talk about the several gadgets that our patients use and the methods that we employ to remove the constriction.",

      "title": "Treatment of vaginismus and subsequent pregnancy after 18 years of marriage: a case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Sometimes couples refer with complaints of long-term infertility, while their main problem is vaginismus and inability to have  intercourse. This study reports the treatment of a patient with severe lifelong vaginismus using a cognitive-behavioral approach.\r\nCase presentation: The couple with a history of 18 years of marriage, childless, had requested the use of assisted reproductive techniques for having a child. At first visit, due to the woman's inability to perform the vaginal examination and the history of fear of intercourse, they were referred to the sexual health clinic for treatment of vaginismus. The woman had a history of hymenectomy under anesthesia, which was ineffective in resolving the problem. Woman's anxiety and embarrassment of expressing the problem, her reluctance of treatment with a male doctor, and the husband's fear of having child due to the death of his mother during childbirth were the factors in the persistence of vasinismus during these years. The 18 years vaginismus was resolved with cognitive-behavioral therapy in less than 3 months. Spontaneous pregnancy occurred 3 months after treatment of vaginismus.\r\nConclusion: Taking an accurate sexual history and encouraging the couple to treat vaginismus prevents invasive assisted reproductive techniques. Prolonged vaginismus should not cause the couple and the therapist to be disappointed with the treatment. The happy and hopefull mood of the therapist in the counseling session, having patience and calmness, designing the treatment in accordance with the couple's lifestyle, paying attention to the husband's feelings and gaining his companionship in the treatment and promoting couple's self-confidence and self-management are among the success factors of vaginismus treatment. Also, continuous follow-up and giving positive feedback to the patient in cyberspace will speed up and continue the treatment process.",

There is also no doubt that the fetus feels pain but disagreement exists about when exactly during gestation does this fact have clinical and moral meaning. Those who disagree and those who agree that fetal pain is perceived in one way or another, actually look at the same data but from different perspectives. At present, there are indirect hormonal, sonographic, and Doppler evidence that fetal pain exists at 18-20 weeks' gestation and continues into the neonatal period. The debate is mainly about the presence or absence of functional thalmo-cortical axons—the probable prerequisite for nociception. When a fetus may undergo partial birth abortion, painful interventions, or termination, we believe that it is the duty of our profession to adopt a compassionate attitude to alleviate pain and suffering of the unborn child, starting at 18-20 weeks' gestation, as we do for our neonates.",

      "abstract": "Toilet training is a developmental task that typically can be accomplished without medical intervention. Parent counseling about it can begin approximately at the 18- to 24-month well child visit. Guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend beginning toilet training when the child shows signs of readiness, but typically not before age 2 years; praising success using positive terms; avoiding punishment, shaming, or force; and making training positive, nonthreatening, and natural. Nocturnal enuresis is defined as urinary incontinence that occurs at night during sleep in children 5 years or older for 3 consecutive months. It is common, affecting 5%-10% of 7-year-old children in the United States. Nonpharmacologic management includes behavioral interventions (eg, limiting fluid intake before bedtime, waking the child at night to attempt to urinate, lifting the sleeping child onto the toilet and then waking him or her to urinate, bladder training to increase bladder capacity, or instituting a reward system). Bed alarms are the first-line intervention but typically are not reimbursed by health insurance. Pharmacotherapy includes desmopressin, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticholinergics. The combination of a bed alarm with pharmacotherapy can be considered as initial management or after an unsuccessful initial intervention.",

      "abstract": "Postpartum uterine prolapse occurs in all animal species. It is most common in cows and ewe, less common in the doe and rare in the mare. It is an eversion of the uterus, which turns inside out as it passes through the vagina. Prolapse of uterus generally occurs immediately after or a few hours of parturition when the cervix is open, and the uterus lacks tone (Hanie, 2006). The prolapse is visible as a large mass protruding from the vulva, often hanging down below the animal’s hock. The etiology of uterine prolapse is not yet fully known. Hormonal imbalance, hypocalcemia, mineral imbalances, injuries or stretching of birth passage, excessive traction at assisted parturition, dystocia or forceful removal of fetal membranes may contribute to the occurrence of prolapse (Hanie, 2006; Jackson, 2004). Animals with uterine prolapse should be treated promptly; otherwise, it may lead to edema, ischemia, laceration, internal hemorrhage (Noakes et al., 2001), prostration, and shock making prognosis poor to hopeless. The success of treatment depends on the type of case, the degree of damage, and contamination. The present case highlights the successful management of postpartum uterine prolapse in a goat.",

The incidence of postpartum depression in Indonesia ranges from 50-70% in postpartum mothers. Postpartum depression is a mood disorder that occurs after childbirth and reflects the psychological dysregulation that is a sign of major depression symptoms. There are several studies that prove that the occurrence of postpartum depression is often associated with side effects experienced by mothers during pregnancy, childbirth, or experiences of mothers with babies. Regarding obstetric causative factors, medical action is one of the factors that influence the psychological adaptation of postpartum mothers. The type of delivery affects the risk of postpartum depression due to the unpleasant experiences of the mother during childbirth. In the type of normal delivery, there are several factors that increase the risk of postpartum depression, such as prolonged labor, pain during labor, labor with device assistance and interventions in labor. In addition, the type of cesarean section delivery is a strong predisposing factor for the occurrence of postpartum depression childbirth with tool-assisted measures and interventions in childbirth.

      "abstract": "The question of periviability in Italy represents an area of conflict between science, religion and politics. There is an ever widening gap between laws, which are strongly influenced by the Roman Church and the judiciary and the laicism of many Italians, too. From an obstetrical point of view the first contradiction in this field is found in the law that regulates voluntary abortion after the 90th day of pregnancy. An Eugenetic abortion is not allowed. Fetal malformations can not be an indication for abortion, but only in the case the knowledge of this induces a physical or psychical illness in the mother that can worsen with the continuation of pregnancy end. Fetal intra cardiac injection of potassium chloride is not allowed and although the limit in performing an abortion is represented by the possibility for the fetus of having an autonomous life, if there is any possibility of fetal survival, every effort should be done to save the fetal/neonatal life. From a neonatological point of view the kind of care strategies in extremely preterm infants is underlined by a document produced by the National Ministry of Health released on march 08. The consideration that can be drawn from this document is that the science and conscience of a doctor in protecting fetal and neonatal life, continues to be the only indicators in the choices of which kind of assistance a neonate should receive at the threshold of viability, and that the doctor’s science and conscience is superior to parental opinion.",

      "abstract": "In this exhibition we aim to describe a clinical case and the different consequences that may present additional problems with eating disorders, focusing with emphasis on development and clinical picture. This disorder usually occurs in non-obese adolescents accused, showing symptoms significantly related to interpersonal functioning of these adolescents, who tend to be isolated or seek company of younger guys. They are characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorders related or unrelated to the food. Dietary restriction involves biological and physical changes, highlighting the alteration of hypothalamic and endocrine system, leading to signs and symptoms such as amenorrhea, cold intolerance, hypotension … Neurochemical changes have also been attributed to malnutrition. The present case is a 31 year old woman. Initiates contact with Mental Health at age 15 by anorexia nervosa. Patient requests for worsening nutritional status, family relationships, and alcohol consumption, being the turning point and main motivation, the birth of his daughter. 8 months ago gave birth, being an unexpected delivery at home. Unaware that pregnancy, justifying as secondary amenorrhea eating disorder and abdominal inflammation malnutrition. Daughter born seven months income requires low weight and withdrawal symptoms during pregnancy as continuous with anxiolytic and antidepressant treatment. It has a favorable, always maintaining therapeutic commitment announced at the beginning of tratamiento.

Through Professor Marker's work progesterone was made available. Dr. Pincus and Dr. J. Rock started clinical trials with progesterone in Puerto Rico. The chief effect of progesterone in the 20 day pill is to prevent the release of the ripe egg. It also disrupts the normal sequence of hormones that make the lining of the womb receptive to a fertilized egg. Small amounts of a substance resembling estrogen are added to the progesterone to reduce the unpleasant side effects produced by progesterone. Oral contraceptives should not be used by women with thrombophlebitis, thromboembolic disorders, cerebral apoplexy or past history of these conditions, markedly impaired liver function, known and suspected carcinoma of the breast, uterus, and cervix, estrogen dependent neoplasms, jaundice, diabetes, congestive cardiac failure, epilepsy, or severe allergic conditions. It is also advised that oral contraceptives not be used by nursing mothers in the first 6 months and by those with vaginal bleeding. There are side effects to the contraceptives, and certain precautions should be taken before oral contraceptives are prescribed. Physical examinations should be carried out. The patient with history of psychic depression should be carefully observed on orals, and if severe depression occurs, use of the pills should be discontinued. British studies have shown higher mortality and hospitalization rates due to thromboembolic disease in oral contraceptive users than in nonusers.",

Some researchers conclude that adverse effects maybe related to hormonal abnormalities, e.g., premature luteinization or improper timing. This study evaluated the initial and accumulative effects of CC on postcoital testing (PCT) and attempted to determine if supplemental estrogen (E) improves PCT and/or inhibits follicular maturation. The majority of patients taking CC had poor PCT tests even on the first treatment cycle. Good initial PCTs tended to remain so in subsequent cycles or at least to respond to subsequent supplemental E. Poor PCTs responding to E tended to continue to respond to the combination. PCTs not responding to E therapy continued this pattern in subsequent cycles. Supplemental E did not suppress follicular maturation.",

      "abstract": "We report a case of neonatal symptoms of irritability, increased tonus and convulsions after in-utero exposure to paroxetine 30mg/day. The infant’s symptoms commenced on the first day after birth and persisted for 10 days. Paroxetine levels were undetectable on day 6. Extensive investigations excluded infective and metabolic causes. Serotonin toxicity due to paroxetine seems the most likely mechanism, though an important differential diagnosis is a paroxetine discontinuation (withdrawal) syndrome. Differentiating between these two syndromes in the neonate presents a dilemma for clinicians. Irrespective of the mechanism, we recommend that all neonates exposed to antidepressants, particularly serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), during the last trimester should be followed-up closely for adverse symptoms commencing in the first 10 days after birth. The possibility of such symptoms needs to be discussed with women who are considering starting or continuing antidepressant treatment in pregnancy. All neonatal adverse drug events should be reported to a pharmacovigilance centre. Further research is warranted.",

Die Hyperprolaktinämie wirkt auf sämtlichen Ebenen der Hypothalamus-Hypophysen-Ovar-Achse supprimierend. Das Ovulationsrisiko kann durch ein korrektes Stillverhalten stark vermindert werden. Der Stillfrequenz wird dabei eine größere anovulatorische Wirkung zugeschrieben als der Stilldauer. Ebenfalls muß zur Erhöhung der antikonzeptiven Sicherheit vollgestillt werden. Zur Verhinderung eines Abfalls des Prolaktinspiegels sollte auch nachts gestillt werden. Die Amenorrhö während der Laktationsphase ist eine der wichtigsten Voraussetzungen für eine angemessene Antikonzeption. Treten vaginale Blutungen auf, so steigt das Ovulationsrisiko erheblich. Andererseits sind die ersten Zyklen in der Laktationsphase häufig anovulatorisch und durch eine Corpus-luteum-Insuffizienz charakterisiert. Die Laktationsamenorrhö, eine Stillfrequenz von mind. 6 × /d, eine Stilldauer von mind. 60 min/d, Zusatznahrung von max. 1 × /d und das nächtliche Stillen sind die Bedingungen für eine suffiziente Antikonzeption durch Stillen. Trotz der Erfüllung dieser Bedingungen nimmt das Ovulationsrisiko mit der postpartalen Dauer zu. Ein effektiver, antikonzeptioneller Schutz wird lediglich bis zur 9. p.p. Woche erreicht. Wird post partum eine hohe antikonzeptive Sicherheit gefordert, muß eine Minipille resp. Mikropille empfohlen werden. Die Laktation als antikonzeptive Maßnahme kann nur beim Anspruch auf eine mäßige Sicherheit angegeben werden.

This study aims to estimate the magnitude of the effect of anxiety during pregnancy on premature birth and low birth weight with a meta-analysis study. Subjects and Method: This was a meta-analysis and systematic review conducted with PRISMA flow diagrams. Population= pregnant women, Intervention= anxiety, Comparison= not anxious, Outcomes= premature birth and low birth weight. Search articles through journal databases include: Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct. The articles used in this study are articles that have been published from 2000-2021. The keywords to search for articles were as follows: “antenatal anxiety” OR “pregnancy anxiety” OR “anxiety during pregnancy” OR “anxiety disorder” OR anxiety OR pregnancy AND “Perinatal outcomes” OR “adverse birth outcome” OR “neonatal outcome” OR “low birth weight” OR “Low Birth Weight” AND “preterm birth” OR “preterm infant”. The inclusion cri­teria were full text with a cohort study design, articles in English, analysis used multivariate with adjusted odds ratio. Eligible articles were analyzed using the Revman5 application. Results: 10 observational studies showed that anxiety during pregnancy increased the risk of preterm delivery by 1.49 times compared with no anxiety (aOR=1.49; 95% CI 1.33 to 1.66; p&lt;0.001). A meta-analysis of 7 observational studies showed that anxiety during pregnancy increased the risk of low birth weight by 1.55 times compared with no anxiety (aOR=1.55; 95% CI 1.26 to 1.91; p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Anxiety during pregnancy increases the risk of premature birth and low birth weight.",

Our knowledge concerning its pathogenesis is scarce although it seems that most women who experience fragility fractures during this period have a pre-existing bone disease which is further burdened by the mechanical and metabolic changes during pregnancy and lactation. Breastfeeding produces an obligatory loss of maternal skeletal mineral which contributes to the decline of bone density. Little is known whether pharmacological treatments exert a beneficial role upon the situation of PLO since there is lack of firm evidence and bone density seems to recumb spontaneously during weaning.",

      "abstract": "Obstetric brachial plexus injury (OBPI) is uncommon but accounts for a significant proportion of obstetric clinical negligence claims. There is debate in the medical literature and in legal proceedings regarding the causation of OBPI, particularly whether OBPI is caused by the accoucheur applying excessive traction or simply through the forces of labour itself. This paper reviews the medical literature and legal case law surrounding OBPI and presents a template for reviewing the strength of evidence for OBPI in clinical negligence claims. The template contains factors more likely to be present if the OBPI was caused by the maternal forces of labour ‘propulsion injury’ (injury to the posterior arm, no documented evidence of shoulder dystocia, up-to-date training, appropriate shoulder dystocia management, no evidence of excessive traction, correct number of birth attendants, precipitous second stage, temporary injury) and factors more likely if the injury is iatrogenic (injury to the anterior arm, shoulder dystocia, no recent training, incorrect shoulder dystocia resolution manoeuvres used, evidence of excessive traction, insufficient birth attendants, fundal pressure, permanent injury). Each factor does not, in itself, establish causation, but the template may provide a useful aid to legal teams reviewing medical notes.",

Anxiety in response to this situation is very common and somewhat adaptive. However, for several reasons, some mothers have excessive worries and experience a severe (and invalidating) level of anxiety in perinatal period. Important gonadal steroid levels modifications have been reported, with as much as a 100-fold variation in serum estrogen levels and a 1000-fold change in serum proges‐ terone levels during pregnancy. These changes can exacerbate such emotional difficulties. Psychological factors may also have an important role to play in the development of anxiety disorders at this time. Often the expectant mother has concerns over the health of the child, the change in lifestyle likely to occur in her own life after the birth of the child (especially if the first child), her own ability to be a good mother, and finances. There are also instances where the pregnancy is unexpected or unwanted, which may further increase stress and anxiety [1].",

Steroid hormones are measured at baseline or after stimulation with ACTH (adrenal hormones) and/or with HCG (gonadal hormones).Different patterns of hormone profiles depend on the etiology and the severity of the underlying disorder and the age of the patient at diagnosis. Molecular diagnosis includes detection of gene dosage or copy number variations, analysis of candidate genes or high-throughput DNA sequencing of panels of candidate genes or the whole exome or genome.Differential diagnosis of 46,XX or 46,XY DSD requires a multidisciplinary approach, including patient history and clinical, morphological, imaging, biochemical and genetic data.

The effect of some of the component stimuli of coitus on uterine contractions was investigated by using M-mode ultrasound. The number, amplitude and duration of the uterine contractions of each uterine horn and of the uterine body were measured in oestrous mares for four minutes before and four minutes after teasing by a stallion, mechanical stimulation of the vagina and cervix, the intrauterine infusion of 80 ml of sterile saline, the intrauterine infusion of 10 ml of sterile saline, the intrauterine infusion of 150 ml of sterile saline, and the transcervical passage of a uterine catheter. Teasing by a stallion did not affect the total number, mean amplitude or mean duration of the uterine contractions. Mechanical stimulation of the vagina and cervix increased the total number of uterine contractions, but did not affect the amplitude or duration of the contractions. The intrauterine infusion of 80 ml of sterile saline resulted in an increase in the total number of contractions and a significant increase in the mean amplitude and the mean duration of the contractions in the uterine horns but not the uterine body. The intrauterine infusion of 10 ml of sterile saline caused a significant decrease in the number of uterine contractions in the uterine horns, but had no effect on the contractions of the uterine body. The infusion of 150 ml of sterile saline reduced the number of contractions in the uterine horns but not the uterine body, and did not affect the mean amplitude and mean duration of the contractions. The transcervical insertion of a catheter reduced the number of contractions in the uterine horns, but did not affect the amplitude or duration of the uterine contractions.",

Bucks were introduced into two groups of anestrous goats (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 15 each) and remained with them for 53 days. Estrous behavior, ovulation and pregnancy rate were determined. &lt;strong&gt;Results.&lt;/strong&gt; All goats came into estrus, ovulated and were mated by bucks at least once during the study. The proportions of females that displayed estrus with or without ovulation did not differ between the two groups within 9 days after the introduction of bucks. However, the proportion of goats that came into estrus with or without ovulation was greater in goats mated by vasectomized bucks from 20 to 28 and from 50 to 53 days after introducing the bucks (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Finally, the proportion of goats that ovulated after the introduction of the bucks, but later returned to anestrus did not differ in goats mated by vasectomized or intact bucks (14% vs 33%; P &amp;gt; 0.05). &lt;strong&gt;Implications.&lt;/strong&gt; These results indicate that in nonpregnant goats, refractoriness to the continuous presence of the same bucks may explain at least in part, the return to anestrus of most goats that stop cycling after an initial sexual response to the introduction of bucks. &lt;strong&gt;Conclusion.&lt;/strong&gt; Nonpregnant goats mated by sexually active bucks become in anestrus, probably because they become refractory to the presence of the same males.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "title": "Fecal Incontinence and Diarrhea During Pregnancy",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION AND PHYSIOLOGY Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common during pregnancy, with the most common reports being nausea and vomiting, reflux, and constipation. The topics of diarrhea and fecal incontinence (FI) in pregnancy receive less attention in the GI literature, with diarrhea being less common than constipation in pregnancy and FI being often at the intersection of GI and obstetrics. Although acute infection is the most common cause of diarrhea in pregnancy, noninfectious, noninflammatory diarrhea can also occur during pregnancy because of several factors: hormonal changes, recent uptake of a “healthier diet” with fiber-rich foods or calcium-rich milk products, prenatal multivitamin side effects, or preexisting conditions. Diarrhea can lead to fecal urgency and FI that becomes amplified during pregnancy because of the increased intra-abdominal pressure from the gravid uterus, preexisting pelvic floor dysfunction, and potentially decreased mobility during the last trimester of pregnancy. Previous pregnancy is associated with pelvic floor dysfunction in up to 45% of patients (1), and prior trauma to the posterior pelvic floor, such as a prior obstetrical laceration involving the anal sphincter, can lead to FI in the absence of altered bowel habits. Although cesarean deliveries are associated with less pelvic floor dysfunction and organ prolapse than vaginal deliveries, it seems that the main stress on the pelvic floor comes from the pregnancy itself more than the mode of delivery. Constipation, which is also common during pregnancy and the postpartum period, can lead to overflow diarrhea and FI as well. Patients with prior anorectal surgeries or with ileal pouch anal anastomosis are also at higher risk of FI during pregnancy (2). Whether the diarrhea and/or FI are related to the pregnancy itself or due to new onset or exacerbation of a preexisting disorder, these symptoms negatively affect the physical, emotional, and social health of the pregnant person and need to be properly addressed and managed. EVALUATION Differential diagnosis The differential diagnosis of acute and chronic diarrhea in pregnancy is similar to that in the nonpregnant population. The most common cause of acute diarrhea is infection, typically from a viral pathogen, such as rotaviruses and Norwalk virus. Clostridioides difficile infection is associated with an increased risk of maternal sepsis, paralytic ileus, thromboembolism, and mortality (3). Because of the negative impact of pregnancy-associated listeriosis on the fetus and neonate, a high index of suspicion should be maintained in a pregnant patient presenting with diarrhea and fever or flu-like symptoms. Chronic conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac disease, lactose intolerance, and hyperthyroidism can be unmasked or exacerbated during pregnancy. Finally, with the incidence of colorectal cancer increasing in younger individuals, it is important to consider rectal malignancy in a patient presenting with a new change in the bowel habit pattern and FI. Key elements for the evaluation of FI are summarized in Table 1.Table 1.: Summary of workup of diarrhea and fecal incontinence during pregnancyHistory A thorough review of travel history, household or work-related sick contacts, dietary habits (including raw food intake, fiber supplements, milk products, and sugar substitute intake), and new medications including antibiotics should be performed. Acute large volume and watery diarrhea is likely to be due to viral agents, whereas bacterial pathogens produce inflammatory diarrhea with frequent small bowel movement and occasional blood in the stool, abdominal pain, and fever. Foul-smelling diarrhea alternating with soft greasy stool, abdominal cramps, and bloating suggest Giardia infection, the most common intestinal parasitic infection in the United States and the world. Extraintestinal symptoms such as flu-like symptoms, neurological symptoms, IBD, or celiac-associated joint or skin manifestations should be assessed. A history of cholecystectomy or ileocolonic resection suggests bile acid diarrhea while prior bowel surgeries can lead to diarrhea from small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Patients with FI are often reluctant to report their symptoms, and physicians should screen pregnant patients for FI, especially when the main report is diarrhea, and patients at higher risk of FI during pregnancy as described above (4). Once identified, further questioning should determine the onset, frequency, and type of FI (i.e., gas, liquid, staining, and full); association with change in bowel habits; rectal urgency or straining; and blood in the stool. Motor or sensory dysfunction in the lower extremity and coexisting urinary incontinence suggest a neurological disorder such as a spinal cord lesion. A history of anorectal surgery (e.g., hemorrhoidectomy and fissurectomy), ileal pouch anal anastomosis, and prior vaginal deliveries complicated by perineal lacerations or forceps use may suggest the presence of a weakened anal sphincter. Finally, patients who report of tissues protruding from the anal canal may indicate prolapsing hemorrhoids or rectal prolapse. Physical examination In addition to a general physical examination looking for evidence of dehydration or extraintestinal manifestations of infectious or inflammatory disease in patients presenting with diarrhea, a focused examination of the perianal area and digital rectal examination (DRE) should be performed in patients with FI (5). The DRE is generally performed with the patient in the left lateral position and begins with inspection of the perineal area to assess for skin abnormalities, such as irritation from chronic anal leakage, presence of a fistula, prolapsed hemorrhoids, or a prolapsed rectum. On simulated defecation, the perineum normally descends 2–4 cm; a descent of the pelvic floor muscles of more than 4 cm (or beyond the ischial tuberosities) is associated with FI (6). The perineal sensation and anal wink (i.e., reflexive contraction of the external anal sphincter by gently stroking the perianal skin) suggests integrity of the motor and sensory nerves at the levels of S4–S5. The DRE allows for the assessment of the anal sphincter pressure at rest, during squeeze and simulated defecation, as well as the evaluation of anorectal mass and of fecal impaction. Laboratory testing The evaluation of acute diarrhea includes stool studies for bacterial (including C. difficile), parasitic, and viral (norovirus and rotavirus) infections. When listeriosis is suspected, blood culture (and an infectious disease consultation) should be obtained. Checking for inflammatory markers, such as fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin (recognizing that C-reactive protein can be elevated in normal pregnancy), thyroid, and celiac serology should be performed in patients with a history of IBD or other chronic illness associated with diarrhea or who develop chronic diarrhea during pregnancy or diarrhea suggestive of an organic disease. Imaging Flexible sigmoidoscopy (with or without sedation) may be necessary in patients where there is concern for IBD or malignancy. Colonoscopy is relatively safe during pregnancy and can be performed when strongly indicated in the second or third trimester (please refer to endoscopy in the pregnancy chapter in this monograph for more details). Further anal sphincter imaging for FI with endoanal ultrasound or MRI is rarely necessary during pregnancy. Endoanal ultrasound provides superior imaging of the internal anal sphincter while MRI has the advantage of assessing for external anal sphincter abnormalities or the presence of a fistula. MR defecography, which can detect rectal prolapse and assess the anorectal angle, perineum, and pelvic organs during simulated defecation, is rarely necessary for the evaluation of FI during pregnancy. Other testing Anorectal manometry (ARM) can provide important information regarding anal sphincter pressures (resting and squeeze), anorectal inhibitory reflex, rectal sensation during balloon distention, and rectal and anal pressures during simulated defecation (7). When available, 3D high-definition ARM can also assess for pressure symmetry within the sphincter (8). The balloon expulsion test, which is performed on a bedside commode by asking the patient to expel a 50-cc water-filled balloon, is important for the evaluation of dyssynergic defecation, which may be present in patients with fecal impaction and overflow FI. The assessment of the electrophysiological activity of the anal sphincter is most commonly performed by evaluating pudendal nerve latency and less commonly with needle EMG (9). Although ARM testing may be helpful and, in general, well tolerated in pregnancy, they should be limited to those who fail to respond to conservative treatments. TREATMENT AND PHARMACOTHERAPY OF DIARRHEA The treatment of diarrhea in pregnancy varies by diagnosis and should target the underlying organic cause when present. The management of a new diagnosis of IBD or IBD exacerbation is covered in a separate chapter in this monograph. In this review, we will focus on the management of acute diarrhea and chronic functional diarrhea and review the safety of commonly used medications for those conditions during pregnancy and breastfeeding (Table 2).Table 2.: Summary of the safety of medical therapies for infectious and noninfectious diarrhea and fecal incontinence in pregnancy and breastfeedingAcute diarrhea Fluid repletion/Dietary recommendations Most episodes of acute diarrhea are usually self-limited and mild; however, there should be a low threshold to seek care and replenish fluids during pregnancy because of the serious risk of dehydration in this population. Conservative management including oral rehydration and careful monitoring of fetal well-being is essential. Oral rehydration solutions (ORSs) that contain glucose will accelerate absorption in the jejunum; however, an ORS that contains a microbially fermentable starch (termed hypo-osmolar high-amylose maize starch) has been found to be superior (10–12). This type of ORS allows the delivery of a nonabsorbed starch into the colon, which is then fermented into short-chain fatty acids and stimulates colonic sodium and fluid absorption (e.g., CeraLyte 70). If there is prolonged diarrhea, IV hydration with the correction of electrolyte abnormalities may be needed. Dietary modifications with small, frequent meals, which include salty soups, carbohydrates, fruit juices that are low in fat, and caffeine and do not contain artificial sweeteners, are advised (13). Dairy products, except yogurt, should be avoided because the enteritis can cause secondary lactase deficiency, which may last for months after the original insult (14). Pharmacologic treatment Opioids. Loperamide is a peripherally acting opiate-receptor agonist, is the preferred antidiarrheal agent in pregnancy, and should be used for persistent or severe symptoms. Loperamide has been associated with a moderate risk of infant malformations in one registry trial, but in a prospective, controlled multicenter trial, there was no association with infant malformations, except for lower birth weights (15–17). Diphenoxylate with atropine showed adverse events in animal studies and is not recommended during pregnancy (15). Bile acid sequestrants. Bile acid sequestrants, such as colestipol or cholestyramine, can be used to treat bile acid diarrhea and IBS diarrhea (IBS-D). Bile acid sequestrants can interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, which could lead to maternal coagulopathy by a low-vitamin-K mechanism (18). Patients who take bile acid sequestrants regularly during pregnancy should be checked for fat-soluble vitamin deficiency and disordered clotting function because regular prenatal supplementation may not be adequate (15,18). Bismuth preparations. Bismuth subsalicylate, found in Pepto-Bismol and Kaopectate, is commonly used in acute diarrhea in the nonpregnant population and reduces the number of unformed stools and symptoms (19). However, fetal toxicity experts recommend against the use of these products during pregnancy, especially in the second and third trimesters, because it is hard to control how much of the subsalicylate is converted to salicylate, which at high dose is associated with fetal adverse effects (15). Probiotics. Probiotics are nonpathogenic microorganisms meant to promote colonization resistance; they are not recommended for acute diarrhea, except in cases of postantibiotic-associated illness (13). In a large meta-analysis of 26 studies, there was no evidence that taking probiotics during pregnancy had any deleterious effect on birth, infant, or maternal outcomes (20). Empiric antibiotics. Empiric antibiotics are not routinely used in acute diarrhea because symptoms are often short lived and secondary to viruses (13). Antibiotics should be considered in patients with severe disease warranting hospitalization and features suggestive of invasive bacterial infection with bloody stools. However, enterotoxin-producing E. coli is in the differential for bloody stools, and there is the possibility of inducing hemolytic uremic syndrome with antibiotic use in that setting (21). Therefore, it is important to withhold empiric antibiotic therapy pending the results of stool testing to rule out enterotoxin-producing E. coli infection. Certain antibiotics are contraindicated or should be used with caution during pregnancy, including metronidazole in the first trimester (potential risk of birth defects), tetracyclines in the last half of pregnancy (risk of hepatotoxicity in the mother and potential for permanent teeth discoloration in the fetus and impairment of fetal long bone growth), and sulfa antibiotics (potential congenital malformations if used in the first trimester as well as jaundice and hemolytic anemia when used in the last month of pregnancy). Acute diarrhea from Clostridioides difficile. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends vancomycin 125 mg 4 times a day or fidaxomicin 200 mg twice a day for 10 days for the treatment of C. difficile. Both antibiotics are safe to use in pregnancy. Acute febrile diarrhea from Listeria monocytogenes. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends the use of high-dose aminopenicillin for at least 14 days or until delivery for symptomatic, febrile patients diagnosed with Listeria monocytogenes (ampicillin intravenously 6–12 g/d or amoxicillin orally 100 mg/kg/d) (22). Gentamicin synergy is also considered first line, in combination with ampicillin/amoxicillin for 3–5 days (23). In summary, the management of acute diarrhea in a pregnant woman consists of oral rehydration, dietary changes, and loperamide for severe symptoms. Exacerbation of chronic diarrhea/IBS-D Antidiarrheals/bile acid sequestrants (see acute diarrhea) 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists inhibit peristalsis, which slows colonic transit time to allow more water absorption, leading to formed stool. Alosetron is FDA-approved for IBS-D but has a black-box warning for the rare event of ischemic colitis and serious complications of constipation and, hence, should not be initiated during pregnancy. Animal reproduction studies failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus, and although there are no adequate studies in humans, alosetron does not need to be discontinued during pregnancy if it is clearly needed (15). Ondansetron has demonstrated efficacy in IBS-D, and its use in pregnancy seems safe overall. In a cohort study, the use of ondansetron in the first trimester was associated with an increased risk of oral cleft, whereas a meta-analysis showed no significant association between ondansetron and congenital malformations or adverse pregnancy outcomes (24,25). Rifaximin. Rifaximin is a nonabsorbed oral antibiotic, FDA-approved for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea and IBS-D. There have been no studies of rifaximin in human pregnancy. According to the manufacturer, studies in pregnant rats and rabbits demonstrated craniofacial and skeletal developmental toxicity at higher than normal doses (26). Although its lack of gut absorption should imply that the risk to the fetus is low, until human data are available, the safest course is to avoid this medication in the first trimester. Mixed opioid receptor agonist/antagonist. Eluxadoline is a peripherally acting, mixed mu-opioid and kappa-opioid receptor agonist/delta-opioid receptor antagonist that is US FDA-approved for the treatment of IBS-D. Studies using very high doses in pregnant rats and rabbits did not demonstrate any teratogenic effects (27); however, there are no reports of its use in human pregnancy at this time. Contrarily, buprenorphine, an investigational drug for IBS-D, exhibits good safety data in its approved indication for opioid disorders in pregnancy (28). MANAGEMENT OF FI Assessing for prior obstetric anal sphincter injury Anticipating and proactively managing FI and discussing future delivery in pregnant people with 1 or more prior obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASIS) is important because the risk of FI with prior OASIS and the risk of another OASIS in those with a history of OASIS are significantly increased (29–31). All women who have an episiotomy or a perineal tear at the time of delivery should undergo a rectal examination to evaluate for a rectal or anal sphincter injury. Patients with suspected injuries, which are not apparent on clinical examination, should undergo additional testing with endoanal ultrasound or MRI. Primary repair of the external anal sphincter may be performed using an end-to-end (approximation) or overlap technique immediately or, when resources are not available, within 12 hours of delivery (32). Dietary interventions First-line dietary intervention should include dietary fiber, such as psyllium. Psyllium reduces FI by up to 50% in multiple randomized controlled trials of nonpregnant patients (33,34). Although there are no published studies on the use of fiber to treat FI in pregnancy, a similar efficacy of fiber supplementation is expected in this population. To reduce the incidence of bloating, a slow introduction of supplemental fiber of no more than 5 g/d 1 week at a time is recommended. Target psyllium doses used in clinical trials range from 6 to 16 g/d. There are additional dietary interventions that can focus on beverages and foods that are associated with urgency or loose stools such as dairy, fat-free substitutes, unabsorbable sugars, and caffeine (35). There is also evidence that foods high in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, and monosaccharides and polyols can cause symptoms of diarrhea, urgency, and FI (36). Although avoidance of fermentable carbohydrates reduces FI symptoms, such a restrictive diet would not be recommended during pregnancy. Lifestyle modifications Potentially modifiable risk factors, such as inactivity and smoking, should be addressed. Certain behavioral techniques to help reduce FI should also be used, such as implementing a toileting scheduling, particularly after meals to help counter the gastrocolic reflex. Kegel exercises that engage the perineal muscles should be performed to reduce episodes of incontinence and when there is fecal urgency (37). Pelvic floor muscle training/biofeedback Learning to engage and strengthen the pelvic floor through pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with or without biofeedback may help reduce FI. In nonpregnant patients with FI, the most recent Cochrane review found that biofeedback training or electrical stimulation was more efficacious than PFMT alone in patients who have failed to respond to other conservative measures (38). A Cochrane meta-analysis reported varying interventions on FI outcomes during pregnancy and in the postpartum period (39). In pregnant people with or without FI, PFMT led to little or no difference in the prevalence of FI in late pregnancy. In postpartum patients with persistent FI, it was uncertain whether PFMT reduced incontinence in the late postnatal period compared with usual care (2 trials; 620 participants; very low-quality evidence). For postnatal PFMT in a mixed population, there was considerable uncertainty about the effect on FI in the late postnatal period (107 participants, very low-quality evidence). However, several trials have demonstrated evidence of improvement in FI symptoms after physical therapy in postpartum people with OASIS (40–42). Therefore, after appropriate healing of the sphincter injury postpartum, patients should be referred for pelvic floor therapy. Pharmacologic therapy of FI In the general population, two-thirds of FI episodes are associated with loose stool or diarrhea (43). Medications that reduce diarrhea can be used in pregnant and postpartum patients with FI, with the same caveats stated previously in the acute diarrhea section. In nonpregnant patients, loperamide has been evaluated as a single agent or in combination with other treatments in several randomized controlled studies and has shown efficacy in reducing FI (44,45). In one small prospective trial of nonpregnant older adults, cholestyramine as an adjunct to biofeedback therapy improved stool consistency, reduced stool frequency, and reduced the number of incontinent episodes compared with biofeedback alone (46). Perianal injection of bulking agents The use of an injectate that is composed of dextranomer microspheres stabilized with hyaluronic acid to augment the native anal sphincter can be considered in nonpregnant patients with FI who have failed conservative medical therapies and can be offered in people who suffer from FI before a pregnancy (47). Anal inserts Anal inserts which temporarily occlude the anal canal and prevent stool leakage are an option for pregnant patients with FI. Renew inserts are a single-use, disposable silicone device that are expelled at defecation. In a multicenter, open-label study of 73 patients, 78% had a ≥ 50% reduction of FI and were very or extremely satisfied with the result, with a median reduction of 0.9–0.2 episode/d (48). In this trial, 35% of subjects dropped out because of complaints of feeling constant rectal pressure. This device could be considered for patients with low-grade FI and soilage; however, these are currently no longer commercially available in the United States because of US Food and Drug Administration import restrictions. Other therapies Other therapies have been studied in the nonpregnant population, and no data are available regarding the safety and efficacy of their use during pregnancy. The vaginal bowel control system (Eclipse System) is a vaginal device with an inflatable balloon that occludes the rectal vault and prevents incontinence. Richter et al (49) demonstrated that 86% of patients achieved treatment success (>50% reduction in FI events) and 41% attained continence. The most common adverse event was vaginal wall injury, with most adverse events (90/134, 67%) occurring during the fitting period. In patients with moderate-to-severe FI who have failed to respond to more conservative measures, sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) can be considered. SNS is believed to improve FI by chronically stimulating the sacral nerves, the surrounding muscles, and the production of colonic retrograde propagated contractions, thus delaying colonic transit and delivery of stool to the rectum (50). SNS is effective in improving FI and is also durable with up to 89% of subjects reporting persistent reduction and relief from FI at 5 years (51,52). Studies have demonstrated good results even in patients with known sphincter defects, regardless of the degree of the defect (53,54). In concept, percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is comparable with SNS and is used for the treatment of urinary incontinence. Initial trials of PTNS showed promise in FI subjects; however, 2 subsequent, large, randomized controlled trials failed to demonstrate a difference in FI clinical outcomes between different study arms (55,56). Therefore, PTNS is not recommended as a primary treatment of FI alone but as a noninvasive treatment option in those with concurrent urinary incontinence. CONCLUSION Both diarrhea and FI are not uncommon during pregnancy and the postpartum period. The causes of diarrhea in pregnancy are similar to those in the nonpregnant population, and the evaluation is reflective of this. Acute diarrhea is managed with dietary modification, rehydration, and a judicious use of loperamide. C. difficile and Listeria infections carry significant morbidity in pregnant patients and should be recognized and treated effectively. The first-line treatment of FI, regardless of pregnancy status, involves noninvasive strategies, such as dietary and lifestyle changes, control of diarrhea, and PFMT. Postpartum patients can be referred for PFMT 6–8 weeks from OASIS repair. If these noninvasive strategies fail, patients can be considered for sphincter augmentation using injectable bulking agents or for a vaginal insert in the postpartum period. Continued failure to respond to these measures would warrant stepwise escalation to minimally invasive options, such as SNS, and surgical interventions, such as secondary sphincteroplasty repair or fecal diversion surgery for the most severe cases.

Provide adequate rehydration with an oral rehydration solution, and use loperamide for severe diarrhea. ✓ Most acute diarrhea are due to self-limited viral infections. However, a high index of suspicion should be maintained for C. difficile and listeriosis infections because both are associated with high morbidity of the pregnant patient and the fetus. ✓ Ask pregnant persons about fecal incontinence if they have associated diarrhea. If fecal incontinence is present, treat with dietary modification, fiber supplements, and pelvic floor muscle therapy.",

      "title": "Role of Pelvic Floor Muscles in Female Orgasmic Response",
      "abstract": "There are many important outcomes from the responsive muscle contractions in the female orgasm. A number of these outcomes are structural and these structural outcomes have a direct positive effect on the well-being of the woman. Though these direct physiological outcomes may or may not have an adaptive history, they affect the well-being of the woman and include structural load management, continence, and sexual function. These benefits of orgasm for adult women last a lifetime; positive outcomes do not end at menopause—female urinary incontinence and pain in the lower back, hip(s), and knee(s) are not a de facto consequence of aging. So although the conveyance of sperm helps the act of reproduction and is considered the major function of the orgasm, this reading is limited; glossing the appreciation of the female orgasm in maintaining pelvic floor muscle tone and missing the function of the clitoral gland in maintaining pelvic floor muscle tone. The point of this paper is to suggest that the role of the pelvic floor muscles in female orgasmic response has much more immediate and more wide-ranging physiological outcomes for the human female than the reproductive primacy perspectives suggested in many studies to date. Clearly defining the broad structural importance of the pelvic floor muscles in female orgasmic response would have positive epidemiological outcomes for all women. While pelvic floor muscle performance has psychological outcomes that synergistically affect the woman's well-being, the psychological outcomes are not within the scope of this paper.",

      "title": "Mood, anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period",
      "abstract": "Introduction Mental illness in pregnancy and postpartum has significant and potentially serious long-term consequences for a mother, her entire family, and in particular, for her infant (Grigoriadis, VonderPorten et al. 2013c). Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are not culturally bound: they affect women in every society and from every socioeconomic background. The aim of this chapter is to increase awareness among healthcare providers about mood- and anxiety-related disorders in pregnancy and postpartum (the “perinatal” period). To achieve this goal, the chapter provides key information about the presentation of these disorders in the perinatal period, along with research about biological and psychosocial risk factors for illness. Clinical presentations Most psychiatric disorders can occur in the perinatal period, but mood and anxiety disorders are particularly common among women of reproductive age. Pregnancy is not protective against the development or recurrence of these disorders, and evidence suggests that the postpartum period is a time of increased risk for new-onset mood and anxiety problems. In particular, there is a risk of mood-related psychosis in the postpartum period, with women suffering from bipolar disorder at high risk. Further, there is a high risk of comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders co-occurring (Grigoriadis, et al. 2011). In the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-5) mood and anxiety disorders are classified into five separate categories: Depressive disorders, Bipolar and related disorders, Anxiety disorders (including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social anxiety disorder), Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and Trauma and Stressor-related disorders (including adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Mood and anxiety disorders occurring in pregnancy or postpartum are not classified as distinct disorders in the DSM-5. However, due to the distinct risks related to perinatal mood disorders, episodes of depressive and bipolar disorders occurring during this time are classified with the use of the specifier: “with peripartum onset.” Specifically, the DSM-5 specifier indicates that “peripartum-onset” pertains only to episodes occurring in pregnancy or with onset in the first four weeks after delivery, although research suggests that risk is likely elevated throughout the first postpartum year.",

The purpose of the actions of intra – natal nursin care though conter preassure techniques to reduce pain in lambor when 1 phase is active. This case study method uses descriptive methods. The author applies the preassurecounter action to reduce and control pain labor when 1 active phase. The author observes and describes the response of pain in the labor process when 1 active phase. Conclusionsfrom the 3 respondents who faced labor during contraction in the first phase of the active phase experienced severe pain, then the 3 respondents received a counter preassure by her husband by assisting health workers everi 10 minutes or every contraction. The result is pain that can be controlled and controlled from severe pain to moderate pain. Counter preassure is carried out in the lumbal region where the sensory nerves of the uterus and cervix run along with the nerves of the uterine sympathy into the spinal cord through the thoracic nerve 10, 11, 12 to the lumbal.That way pain impulse can be blocked that is by giving stimulation to a large nerve that causes the controll gate to be closed and painful stimuli cannot be passed to the cortex. The couter preassure technique will block pain impulses which will be transmitted to the brain faster compared to other techniques. Counter preassure technique action advice can be used on the mother with 1 active phas4 in normal labor. \r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords: 1 Active Phase, Acute pain, Counter Presure",

      "title": "Female urinary incontinence and sexuality",
      "abstract": "Urinary incontinence is a common problem among women and it is estimated that between 15 and 55% of them complain of lower urinary symptoms. The most prevalent form of urinary incontinence is associated with stress, followed by mixed urinary incontinence and urge urinary incontinence. It is a symptom with several effects on quality of life of women mainly in their social, familiar and sexual domains. Female reproductive and urinary systems share anatomical structures, which promotes that urinary problems interfere with sexual function in females. This article is a review of both the concepts of female urinary incontinence and its impact on global and sexual quality of life. Nowadays, it is assumed that urinary incontinence, especially urge urinary incontinence, promotes anxiety and several self-esteem damages in women. The odour and the fear of incontinence during sexual intercourse affect female sexual function and this is related with the unpredictability and the chronicity of incontinence, namely urge urinary incontinence. Female urinary incontinence management involves conservative (pelvic floor muscle training), surgical and pharmacological treatment. Both conservative and surgical treatments have been studied about its benefit in urinary incontinence and also the impact among female sexual function. Unfortunately, there are sparse articles that evaluate the benefits of female sexual function with drug management of incontinence.",

Allegations of negligence include erroneous diagnosis of the true extent and grade of the injury, failure to perform a rectal examination prior to suturing a perineal tear, overlooking consideration to carry out a caesarean delivery or to perform or extend the episiotomy, inability to do the repair and inadequacy of the repair. Occipitoposterior position is associated with incomplete flexion of fetal head, an increase of the presenting diameter and a prolonged second stage of labour.

      "title": "Management of Menopausal Symptoms",
      "abstract": "Menopause, due to loss of ovarian follicular activity without another pathological or physiological cause, typically occurs between the ages of 45 years and 56 years. During the menopausal transition, approximately 50% to 75% of women have hot flashes, night sweats, or both (vasomotor symptoms) and more than 50% have genitourinary symptoms (genitourinary syndrome of menopause [GSM]).Vasomotor symptoms typically last more than 7 years and GSM is often chronic. Efficacious treatments for women with bothersome vasomotor symptoms or GSM symptoms include hormonal and nonhormonal options. Systemic estrogen alone or combined with a progestogen reduces the frequency of vasomotor symptoms by approximately 75%. Oral and transdermal estrogen have similar efficacy. Conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) with or without medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) were the only hormonal treatments for which clinical trials were designed to examine cardiovascular events, venous thromboembolism, and breast cancer risk. Compared with placebo, the increased risk of stroke and venous thromboembolism associated with CEE (with or without MPA) and breast cancer (with use of CEE plus MPA) is approximately 1 excess event/1000 person-years. Low-dose CEE plus bazedoxifene is not associated with increased risk of breast cancer (0.25%/year vs 0.23%/year with placebo). Bioidentical estrogens approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (with identical chemical structure to naturally produced estrogens, and often administered transdermally) also are available to treat vasomotor symptoms. For women who are not candidates for hormonal treatments, nonhormonal approaches such as citalopram, desvenlafaxine, escitalopram, gabapentin, paroxetine, and venlafaxine are available and are associated with a reduction in frequency of vasomotor symptoms by approximately 40% to 65%. Low-dose vaginal estrogen is associated with subjective improvement in GSM symptom severity by approximately 60% to 80%, with improvement in severity by 40% to 80% for vaginal prasterone, and with improvement in severity by 30% to 50% for oral ospemifene.During the menopausal transition, approximately 50% to 75% of women have vasomotor symptoms and GSM symptoms. Hormonal therapy with estrogen is the first-line therapy for bothersome vasomotor symptoms and GSM symptoms, but nonhormonal medications (such as paroxetine and venlafaxine) also can be effective. Hormone therapy is not indicated for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.",

Moreover, the extremely evident clinical entity of this phenomenon (M-LB) and its striking similarity to the menstruation in the same woman led me to the conclusion, that a little time before menstruation as well in its beginning the hypothalamic part of the sympathetic system is in a state of increased activtiy, to which the menstruation, the menstruation-like bleeding during pregnancy (M-LB) and the premenstrual tension is related. The adrenalin and the not-adrenalin are one of the factors producing the hemorrhagic phenomena of the endometrium in menstruation.",

      "abstract": "Healthy women at reproductive age experience a cyclical alteration of gastrointestinal (GI) symptomatology during their menstrual cycle. Additionally, the majority of healthy women also complain of worsening of GI symptoms either during the premenstrual or menstrual phase. Despite conflicting evidence, studies suggest that sex hormones may increase GI transit time during the luteal phase. Similar phenomenon is also observed in women with underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The mechanism underlying this complex pathophysiology is still not completely understood. However, a possible influence of sex hormones on the brain-gut-microbiota axis is hypothesized. The diagnosis of IBD is associated with a delay in menarche as well as menstrual function irregularities including alterations in cycle length and the duration of flow. There is little data on the effect of menopause on IBD disease activity and conflicting data on the effect of IBD diagnosis on the onset of menopause. The role of contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies on the development or disease activity of IBD has not been yet established. Moreover, IBD patients with concomitant dysmenorrhea report heightened pain during menses. The effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in treating primary dysmenorrhea on the disease course of IBD is unknown. In addition, the effect of IBD medications including immunomodulators and biologics on menstrual function remains unclear. Also, the role of IBD surgery on menstrual irregularities needs to be fully elucidated. Hence, understanding the influence of menstrual function on IBD disease activity and vice versa and the maintenance of normal menstrual function in those patients is important in improving overall reproductive health and fertility and outcome of IBD.",

Women with eating disorders typically see their gynecologists because of menstrual and other endocrine disorders or unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, and often report on psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression or decreased libido). In spite of anovulation, menstruation may occur and ovulation without menstruation may be possible, which may lead to an increased incidence of unwanted pregnancies in case of prior or current eating disorders. Ovulation induction due to anovulation associated with weight loss or inappropriate dietary habits, or pregnancy with amenorrhoea may be a significant risk among women with unrecognized eating disorders. In such cases, the primary care is the change of dietary lifestyle and only secondary care is the ovulation induction. The prevalence of eating disorders is high among women who approach infertility clinics. If an eating disorder is confirmed prior to infertility treatment, the patient should be informed of the possible consequences and referred to the necessary psychological support. Such a multidisciplinary approach would allow successful infertility treatments without complications.",

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Though uncommon, primary movement disorders can occur in pregnancy, the most common being restless legs syndrome and chorea gravidarum. New onset dystonia in pregnancy has been reported four times previously with a resolution of symptoms within six months of delivery. Exacerbation of pre-ex- isting movement disorders and the onset of de novo movement disorders during pregnancy support the hypothesis that female sex hormones play an important role in the regulation of basal ganglia circuitry. We describe a 36-year-old right-handed, secundigravid, Caucasian woman presenting at 8 weeks gestation with involuntary movements of the head, neck and right shoulder. Ancillary investigations were normal. Symptoms persisted throughout pregnancy and resolved completely 3 days post-partum. The patient began breastfeeding and once mature milk was produced the dystonic movements remerged, albeit less severe than during pregnancy. Over three years of regular follow up, symptom fluctuations have abated and evolved into typical cervical dystonia with good response to regular botulinum toxin injections. This case of new-onset cervical dystonia during pregnancy with persistence of symptoms after delivery demonstrates significant phenotypic overlap with previously reported cases further establishing dystonia gravidarum as a distinct clinical entity.",

      "title": "Erectile Dysfunction: A Review on Prevalence, Perceptions, Diagnosis and Management in India.",
      "abstract": "Erectile dysfunction (ED) is defined as the inability to achieve or maintain penile erection sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual activity. The prevalence increases with age. Basic and clinical research is identifying the neurovascular and humoral control of the mechanisms. The initial evaluation should differentiate erectile dysfunction from premature ejaculation and loss of libido. Myocardial insufficiency, hypogonadism and peripheral neuropathy should be looked for. Initial laboratory investigations should be restricted to identifying previously undetected medical illness that may directly contribute to erectile dysfunction. Discussing the available options with the couple is an important aspect. If erectile dysfunction is secondary to other treatable disorders these should be treated simultaneously. When other diseases that require intervention are ruled out and if there are no contraindications, therapy may be initiated with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. In selected cases, psychosexual therapy may be beneficial. If phosphodiesterase inhibitors are contraindicated, vacuum constriction devices may be tried. Further options include intracavernosal injection, intraurethral instillation, penile revascularization and prosthesis. The availability of effective and well-tolerated oral medications has dramatically changed the clinical approach to erectile dysfunction. Pharmacotherapy is the preferred cost-effective first-line therapy in the vast majority of patients. A stepped-care approach is followed in the primary care and family practice settings. Appropriate urological, endocrine and psychiatric referrals, and shared decision-making with the couple will enable effective treatment of men with erectile dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Menstruation, or period, is normal vaginal bleeding that happens as a part of a woman’s monthly cycle. The menstrual cycle is that the hormonal process a woman’s body goes through monthly to get ready for a possible pregnancy. Regular menstrual periods within the years between puberty and menopause are usually a sign that the body is functioning normally. Irregular or heavy, painful periods are not normal. Many women get premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms. It encompasses the foremost common issues, like mild cramping and fatigue, but the symptoms usually get away when the period begins. Menstruation that is too heavy or too light, or the entire absence of a cycle, may suggest that other issues are contributing to an abnormal menstrual cycle. Menstrual hygiene plays an important role in the health of young women. This study focuses on menstrual problems among adolescent girls. The main objectives of the present study are; to find out the awareness regarding menstrual problems among adolescent girls, and to investigate the problems about menstruation among adolescent girls.",

In ovulatory cycles, seizure frequency shows a statistically significant positive correlation with the serum estradiol/progesterone ratio. The premenstrual exacerbation of seizures has been attributed to the withdrawal of the antiseizure effects of progesterone. Reproductive dysfunction and endocrine disorders are unusually common among women who have partial epilepsy. Reproductive endocrine disorders, including polycystic ovarian syndrome and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, as well as possibly premature menopause and functional hyperprolactinemia appear to be overrepresented among women with partial seizures of temporal lobe origin. Normalization of reproductive endocrine functions and menstrual cycles among women who have both partial seizures and menstrual disorders with documented inadequate luteal phase has been demonstrated to significantly and sometimes dramatically lessen seizure frequency. Improved seizure control has been related to normalization of the reproductive endocrine cycle but, as yet, has not been recognized as an approved indication for continued clomiphene use.",

      "title": "Reproductive outcomes after different treatment and secondary prevention options for Asherman syndrome",
      "abstract": "Asherman syndrome is characterized by the appearance of clinical symptoms of pain syndrome, as well as menstrual and reproductive dysfunction, which develop as a result of obliteration of the uterine cavity and/or cervical canal by connective tissue synechiae. It is believed that the leading cause of Asherman syndrome is mechanical damage to the basal layer of the endometrium due to intrauterine interventions performed during pregnancy, the postpartum period, or in the detection of uterine cavity pathologies. They lead to impaired cervico-uterine-tubal sperm transport, fibrotic changes in the endometrium, and resistance to hormonal stimulation. The primary surgical treatment for Asherman syndrome is hysteroscopic adhesiolysis. It is known that this type of surgical intervention is associated with high risks of synechiae reformation, complicated course of gestation and unsatisfactory reproductive outcomes. For this reason, in the postoperative period, it is advisable to carry out preventive measures aimed at restoring female reproductive function. Most of the currently available methods of secondary prevention have no effect on the pregnancy rate and live birth rate. Low efficacy of the complex therapy creates a need to search for new alternative approaches to the treatment of Asherman syndrome and to develop tactics for postoperative management of patients. Cell therapy with mesenchymal stem cells is of particular interest. This literature review examines the relationship between various treatment and secondary prevention options for Asherman syndrome and their impact on improving reproductive outcomes.",

It is characterized by classical triad of occipital encephalocele, infantile polycystic kidneys and postaxial polydactyly. Diagnosis of MKS is made on the basis of ultrasonography, gross morphology &amp; histopathological findings. Here, we describe a case of MKS presenting with the classical triad. Case presentation A 25 year old lady presented with missed abortion at 17 weeks of gestation on her first conception. There was no history of previous fetal demise or any congenital anomaly. History of consanguineous marriage was not present. Ultra sonogram revealed death of the fetus in utero. Planned termination of pregnancy was performed &amp; the products of conception were sent for study to the laboratory for autopsy, histopathological examination &amp; genetic studies. Conclusion Rare genetic anomalies can present with missed abortion &amp; an understanding of the same is important considering the clinical as well as psychological strain it can have on the pregnant mother. The case moreover should be reported for it being a genetic anomaly which results in death at a young age &amp; also for its historical value.",

Intraoperatively acute appendicitis and levorotation of the uterus by about 100 degrees were found. As the signs of ischemia were absent, the uterus was returned into its normal position. Intraoperative and postoperative period was uncomplicated. Close outpatient monitoring was introduced and the pregnancy continued without further complications. The patient underwent cesarean section at 36 weeks of pregnancy due to early leakage of amniotic fluid and failure to progress during first stage of labor.Uterine torsion may present with non-specific symptoms or be asymptomatic. Urgent laparotomy and rotation of the uterus into its normal anatomical position gives chance for normal course of pregnancy.

LUTSs have a multifactorial status. The risk factors are age, race, pregnancy, birth, menopause, hysterectomy, obesity, chronic cough, depression, profession and family history. LUTSs have negative effects on women's quality of life, especially on the medical, physical, social, psychological, economical and sexual aspects. Studies report a relationship between the sexual dysfunction and urogynaecological diseases. Although the pathophysiology of high prevalence of sexual dysfunction in women with LUTS is not well known, it is estimated that the LUTS and sexual dysfunction occur due to the effects of low oestrogen levels on vagina, urethra, trigone epithelium and the atrophy of pelvic floor muscles. Especially women, who experience urinary incontinence (UI) and subgroup problems, report more common sexual dysfunctions (hypoactive sexual desire disorder, very urgent need for urination during the sexual intercourse and leakage, lack of sexual arousal, orgasm problems, sexual pain disorders). Despite the high prevalence of LUTS and its negative effects on the quality of life, the help‐seeking behaviours of women for overcoming LUTS differ according to the level of disturbance. Nurses should cooperate with other health care personnel in LUTS prevention, diagnosis, treatment/follow‐up, in the diagnosis of sexual dysfunction due to LUTS and its management. This article discusses the prevalence of LUTS, the risk factors of LUTS, the quality of life of women with LUTS, the negative effects of LUTS on sexual life and its nursing care.",

The time of implantation after fertilization varies widely amongst the common domestic animals and so, therefore, do the stage and size of embryonic development at the initiation of a functional contact with the uterine tissues (Wimsatt, 1975). Delayed implantation of the blastocyst—the period of embryonic diapause found in certain species of deer, carnivore and rodents during seasonal or lactational anoestrus—has not been documented as a feature of reproduction in domestic cattle, sheep or pigs. Before considering endocrine aspects of the implantation process, it seems necessary to comment upon some of the significant stages preceding this critical phase of development. More extensive treatments of the topic can be found in the reviews of Blandau (1971), Finn (1971), McLaren (1972) and Psychoyos (1973), although rodents rather than the larger domestic species are the principal concern of such works.",

The growth in utero seems to be divided into two well defined parts; that of the first six months, and that of the last three months. Of the first period, not so much is known, for the opportunities to study this growth are relatively few. The second period, that of the last three months in utero, has been rendered very important from the pediatric point of view, firstly, because there is great growth during this period, and secondly, because this period is unfortunately often spent outside, instead of inside the uterus. It has always been an interesting theme to know whether: if the infant, although of full term, for some unknown reason does not obtain this added growth of the last three months and comes into the world",

      "abstract": "Hemorrhage during delivery or postpartum occurs in around 2% of deliveries in France and is responsible for 8-15% of maternal deaths. The causes of obstetrical hemorrhage are well known, but the factors leading to serious hemorrhage are often multiple. Knowledge of etiologies should permit early diagnosis before major clinical problems develop. This work defines hemorrhage of delivery as loss of 500 ml or more of blood at the site of placental insertion during delivery or within 24 hours. The work begins by describing the three phases of normal delivery of the placenta: separation, expulsion, and hemostasis. The mechanisms by which they occur and possible problems in each phase are described. The compensating physiological mechanisms that limit bleeding during normal deliveries are described. The various etiologies of hemorrhage during delivery are next examined: placental retention, uterine atony, uterine inversion, lesions of the genital tract or uterine rupture. Indirect or preexisting causes are also described, including retroplacental hematoma, preeclampsia, retention of a dead embryo in utero, placenta previa, amniotic embolism, or pathology of hemostasis. Criteria for diagnosis of hemorrhage rely primarily on abnormal duration and intensity of bleeding. Treatment of hemorrhagic shock and of the obstetrical problems is then described, as are preventive measures and possible complications. A flow chart summarizes the main steps to be taken in case of hemorrhage.",

      "abstract": "Sexual function is an important aspect of health and quality of life and is influenced by both medical conditions and health-care interventions, especially when gynecologic disorders are involved. Coital pain is among the main factors that affect sexual functioning, and this symptom is reported by almost half of women suffering from endometriosis. However, sexuality is a complex phenomenon driven by social, psychological and biological/hormonal factors and the presence of endometriosis might further affect domains of sexual function and the quality of a sexual relationship.The objective of this report is to review the current state of knowledge on the impact that endometriosis and its treatments have on the sexual function of women and their sexual partners.A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies evaluating sexual function in endometriosis patients, and a narrative analysis of results is presented. The review discusses relevant quantitative and qualitative studies analyzing the effect of endometriosis and its hormonal and surgical treatments on measures of sexual function and quality of sexual relationship.Endometriosis negatively affects different domains of sexual function, and the presence of dyspareunia is not the only determinant of sexual health in these women. Chronic pelvic pain, advanced stages of disease and the presence of physical and mental comorbidities affect sexual function, as well as personality traits and women's expectations. Although a number of studies have evaluated the effect of surgery and hormonal treatment on deep dyspareunia, overall sexual function and quality of the relationship with the partner are often under-investigated.Multiple clinical and personal determinants affect sexual function in women with endometriosis, with potentially negative consequences on the sexual function of partners and quality of the relationship. Additional prospective and longitudinal investigations are warranted using specific instruments to analyze biopsychosocial variables of sexual pain in endometriosis patients and the effects that actual treatments have on measures of quality of sexual function and relationship.",

She had a history of severe generalized abdominal and back pain of sudden onset, dizziness, and syncope with no history of trauma. Ultrasonography revealed free peritoneal fluid with a live intrauterine fetus. Blood transfusion, emergency laparotomy, and cesarean delivery were performed. A live female infant was delivered and admitted to the newborn unit. Postoperatively, the patient was started on antibiotics and analgesics and was stable at discharge.&#x0D; Conclusion: Spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy is a rare cause of maternal collapse, which may mimic uterine rupture and abruptio placentae.

Eating disorders in adolescence and young adulthood is associated with psychiatric and medical comorbidities and has a significant impact on pregnancy as well. Obvious symptoms of eating disorder include the person's body dissatisfaction, the fear to gain weight and disordered eating behaviors and may affect women at different times during the life cycle, including pregnancy and postpartum. Many women experience discomfort in their normal eating habits during pregnancy. The pica seen during pregnancy is a eating disorder characterized by the consumption of substances not identified as nutrients. The presence of pica behavior may result in a high-risk pregnancy with increased risk of perinatal and life-threatening consequences and undesirable consequences for the fetus and the mother.",

      "abstract": "In the public mind, pregnancy, childbirth and newborn care is one of the most wonderful living experiences. However, epidemiological studies have shown that the risks of psychiatric disorders in the perinatal period are multiplying. Pregnancy entails with dramatic physical, mental and social role changing. The birth is a big, irreversible life event, and it should also be nominated as \"rite of passage\". This process represents a normative crisis during life, which needs new coping mechanisms to be developed. The stress and anxiety during the development of the fetus causes negative consequences in the short and long-term and it causes dangerous complications for the mother, too. During postpartum period, the incidence of major depression is approximately 15-20% that most frequently occurs within 6 months after birth but until the child is 2 years old it can develop any time. Serious risks of the postpartum depression are suicide and infanticide. In addition, it also represents serious teratogenic effects of cognitive and psychomotor development of children. It makes harder to recognize that the symptoms are largely the same as in any other stage of depression occurring during lifetime, but some of the symptoms compliant of normal pregnancy and the postpartum period. In addition, the majorities of women recognize heavily the problem and visit a doctor, because based of social expectations they should feel happiness. After the disclosure of risk factors and securing preventive conditions, preparing to be a mother is effective in prevention of development of perinatal depression. The effective therapy is primarily based on the coaching approach, and requires multi-directional approach.",

When women have signs and/or symptoms of both stress and urge incontinence, it is referred to as mixed urinary incontinence. Overactive bladder syndrome is defined by the Standardization Subcommittee of the International Continence Society (ICS) as urinary urgency, with or without urge incontinence and usually with frequency and nocturia.

There are three main factors that influence labor, namely pasegge (birth canal), pessengger (fetus), and power (contractions). These three factors 90% contributed to the onset of pain during labor, most commonly caused by contractions, which occurred at the beginning of labor which increased in intensity over time. The intensity of pain in every mother in labor varies depending on the characteristics of the mother, experience, physical and psychological conditions of the mother and support during delivery. Mothers giving birth today tend to choose labor with surgery to avoid pain, one of the effects of labor pain on the mother is prolonged labor, and the baby has asphyxia. The labor pain experienced by the mother should be reduced or even eliminated if the mother is given information about how to deal with pain during labor with various relaxation techniques, positioning, mentoring, diversion and others. The purpose of this study was to determine the mother's behavior regarding pain management during labor. This study uses an analytical survey with a cross sectional, when the research was carried out from April to May 2021, with a total sample of 30 people. The results of the chi square test p = 0.03 (P &lt; 0.05). There is a relationship between labor pain and the length of labor. The majority of pain management behaviors during labor are still lacking. It is advisable to carry out ANC at least 4 times and if there are complaints, husbands provide physical and psychological support, for midwives to provide information through social media.Â",

      "abstract": "Background: Pelvic girdle pain is frequently reported musculoskeletal disorder in pregnant women. Thecondition is complex and underlying mechanism is unclear. Onset of pain is usually at 14-30 weeks ofgestation.Pregnancy hormones soften and stretch the ligaments of the body allowing the pelvis to open slightly duringlabour thus allowing easier passage. This leads to less stable pelvis. Women experiences reduced capacityfor activities such as standing, walking and sitting.PGP results in greater disability in pregnant women.Pelvic instability and pain due to increased lumbar, thoracic and pelvic mobility due to secretion of relaxinhormone lead to increased ligament laxity and there is slightly larger range of movement in the pelvic joint.[3]PGP is diagnosed on the basis of site of pain and ability to the pain by using the pain provocation tests. PGPis managed conservatively by a multidirectional team. It include addressing the psychosocial implication forthe women and family. Approach should be implemented for activity modification , pelvic support garments,manage acute exacerbations, physiotherapy and exercise program to prevent progression of symptoms.Objective: To find out the prevalence of pelvic girdle pain in post partum women.Method: An observational study was carried out using a cross sectional study design. The study wasconducted in the city of Karad, Maharashtra. Study was conducted using a sample size of 64 post partumwomen for a period of 6 months. The inclusion criteria was 20-40 years of females were included who werehad FTND. Exclusion criteria was obese females, pre pregnancy low back pain, women with high risk ofpregnancy and any kind of trauma to pelvic during pregnancy.Results: The results showed that 60.93% women have pelvic girdle pain during their post partum period byusing FABER, P4 test and pelvic girdle questionnaire (PGQ).Conclusion: On the basis of the result of the study, it was concluded that there is significant pelvic girdlepain in post partum period.",

The present study hypothesized that the maternity blues are a hormonally‐assisted grief reaction which will occur predominantly in women whose antenatal expectation of baby or delivery fails to be fulfilled by the reality events. The hypothesis was tested in a prospective study of 89 women. The phenomenology of the blues was not found to be associated with the hypothesized sense of disappointment or anti‐climax despite many womens’ experiences falling short of expectation. Rather, the most powerful predictor of the blues was a sense of “pessimism” in late pregnancy which was actually fulfilled by postpartum reality. In addition, the triad comprising of severity of pre‐menstrual tension, unplanned pregnancy and consideration given to elective termination in early pregnancy was associated with increased incidence of the blues.",

Successive reports into maternal mortality have testified to the frightening speed with which obstetric haemorrhage can become life-threatening. Minor lacerations are common as a result of vaginal birth, but excessive maternal haemorrhage may be associated with delivery of a large infant relative to the mother's size or a difficult instrumental delivery. Massive obstetric haemorrhage can be fatal before coagulation failure supervenes, but Disseminated intravascular coagulation may complicate some 10% of cases of placental abruption and 40% of cases of the much rarer condition of amniotic fluid embolism syndrome. The physiological compensatory responses described help to explain the clinical features that accompany major haemorrhage. Traumatic delivery of a large baby after prolonged labour, for example, may be complicated both by uterine atony and by lower genital tract trauma.",

      "title": "Fiqh Al Iddah Li Al Mar’ah Al Muslimah",
      "abstract": "The Iddah ( period of waiting ) is period a Muslim woman must observe after death of her spouse or after a divorce , during which she may not marry another man. Its purpose is to ensure that male parent of any offspring produced after cessation of a marriage would be known. The length of iddah varies according to a number of circumstances. The iddah of a woman divorced by her husband is three monthly periods, ] unless she is pregnant in which case ‘iddah lasts until she gives birth, or unless marriage was not consummated in which case there is no `iddah, or unless she does not menstruate, in which case the scholars say that she should observe an ‘iddah of a full year, nine months for pregnancy and three months for ‘iddah. For a woman whose husband has died, `iddah is four lunar months and ten days after death of their husbands, whether or not marriage was consummated. The period, four months and ten days after death of a spouse, is calculated on number of menses that a woman has. Islamic scholars consider this directive to be a balance between mourning of husband's death and protecting widow from criticism that she might be subjected to from remarrying too quickly after her husband’s death. This is also to ascertain whether a woman is pregnant or not, since four and a half months is half length of a normal pregnancy. Husbands should make a will in favor of their wives for provision of one year’s residence and maintenance, unless wives themselves leave house or take any other similar step.",

      "title": "Fetal Pain: Do We Know Enough to Do the Right Thing?",
      "abstract": "Raising the possibility of fetal pain continues as a tactic to undermine support for abortion in the US and the UK. This paper examines anatomical and psychological developments in the fetus to assess the possibility of fetal pain. Neurobiological features that develop at 7, 18 and 26 weeks gestation suggest an experience of pain in utero. Pain, however, cannot be inferred from these features because they are not informative about the state of consciousness of the fetus and cannot account for the content of any presumed pain experience. We may be confident the fetus does not experience pain because unique in utero neuroinhibitors and a lack of psychological development maintain unconsciousness and prevent conscious pain experience. Before an infant can experience sensations and emotions, the elements of experience must have their own independent existence in the infant's mind. This is achieved after birth through discoveries made in action and in patterns of adjustment and interaction with a caregiver. Recommendations about anaesthetic practice with the fetus and the newborn or young infant should not focus on pain but on outcomes with obvious, and measurable, importance. In the case of an unwanted pregnancy, the health of the woman should guide anaesthetic practice. In the case of a wanted pregnancy, the survival and long-term health of both the woman and fetus should guide anaesthetic practice. In any case, current evidence does not support efforts to inform women of the potential for fetal pain. Any policy to mitigate fetal pain could expose women to inappropriate intervention, risk and distress.",

      "abstract": "Adolescence is a transitional period from childhood to adulthood characterized by physical, emotional, and psychological changes. Adolescence, which is between the ages of 10-19 years, is a period in which the maturation of reproductive organs is often called puberty. During puberty, especially in adolescent girls, they will experience their first menstruation (menarche). Menstruation is a normal periodic uterine bleeding and is a physiological function that can occur in women. One of the disorders that women often experience during menstruation is dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea is pain felt in the lower abdomen extending to the back due to uterine cramps and occurs before or during menstruation which causes activity disorders in women. The incidence of dysmenorrhea in Indonesia is still quite high. The combination of murottal surah ar-rahman &amp; lavender aromatherapy is one of the non-pharmacological interventions to reduce the intensity of dysmenorrhea pain. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the combination of murottal surah ar-rahman &amp; lavender aromatherapy on dysmenorrhea pain intensity in adolescent girls. This study is expected to add insight into the treatment of dysmenorrhea, especially complementary therapy in adolescent girls. This research design is quasi experiment with prepost- test design. The sample determination used the Federer formula, with a total sample of 36 respondents divided into 2 groups, namely 1 experimental group given an intervention for 30 minutes and 1 control group without intervention. The results of the paired t-test test in the experimental group obtained a p value = 0.001 (p value &lt;0.05). The results of this study indicate the effect of a combination of murottal surah ar-rahman &amp; lavender aromatherapy on dysmenorrhea pain intensity in adolescent girls. It is hoped that further research can develop non-pharmacological therapies, especially aromatherapy originating from Indonesia",

Although the classic clinical presentation is dysmenorrhea with premenstrual intensification, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain, some patients, who may or may not know they have the condition, experience acute pelvic pain. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an iatrogenic complication of superovulation induction therapy with a varied spectrum of clinical and laboratory manifestations. Crampy pelvic pain due to hormonal changes, rapid growth of the uterus, and increased blood flow is a common sign of early pregnancy. If a patient fails a single course of methotrexate or has pelvic pain that is increasing, ultrasound can be helpful. If a patient continues to have pain after a presumed miscarriage, even if products of conception were confirmed cytologically, a heterotopic pregnancy should be a considered.",

Symptoms, when present, can be severe and affect many organ systems including the gastrointestinal and urinary systems. Other etiologies of pelvic pain must be ruled out and/or need to be addressed concurrently for optimal patient care.

Recurrence is common when medications are discontinued and even after surgical therapy.

Nikah bağının sona ermesi veya nikah şüphesinin ortaya çıkması durumunda kadın için söz konusu olan iddet, bu görevlerden biridir. İddet, nikahın sona ermesine neden olan hususlar ve kadının fizyolojik durumu doğrultusunda beklenmesi gereken süreyi ifade ederken iddetin sebepleri arasında ölüm ile talâk, fesih ve benzeri işlemler yer alır. Bu makalede, menopoz öncesi adet sorunları yaşayan kadınların iddeti incelenmiştir. Adet sorunları yaşayan kadından, adet görmeye başladıktan sonra bilinen veya bilinmeyen nedenlerle hayız görmeyenlerle sürekli istiḥāḍa kanı gören ve hayız kanını bundan ayırt edemeyen kimseler kastedilmektedir. Kur’an ve Sünnet’te bu durumu doğrudan açıklayan bir nas bulunmamakla birlikte literatürde konuyla alakalı farklı yaklaşımlar mevcuttur. Hususen 65/eṭ-Ṭalāḳ suresinin 4. ayetindeki \"irtebtum/şüphe ederseniz\" ifadesi etrafında bazı yorumlar bu konuyla irtibatlandırılmıştır. Ayrıca, hayız görmeye başladıktan sonra bir daha adet görmeyen kadının iddeti, sahabe döneminde yaşanan olaylar etrafında ihtilaflara konu olmuş ve mezhepler arasındaki görüş ayrılıklarının temelini bu ihtilaflar oluşturmuştur. Makalede tümevarım yöntemi esas alınmış, kategorik detaylandırma ve yorumlama unsurlarından istifade ile ayet, sahabe uygulaması ve mezheplerin görüşleri tahlil edilmiştir. Meselenin aktüel yönüne dikkat çekmek üzere günümüzde İslam hukuku çerçevesinde oluşturulan aile hukuku kanunlarına da atıfta bulunulmuştur. Elde edilen bulgulara göre tıbben adete dair durumun süreklilik arz ettiğini ortaya koyma şartıyla hayız görmeyen kadın ile musteḥāḍanın iddetinin üç ay olarak takdir edilmesi hem maslahatın temini hem de zararın izalesi açısından daha isabetli bulunmuştur.",

      "abstract": "Anorectal dysfunction includes anal incontinence and constipation, in addition to other conditions such as anorectal prolapse, anorectal pain and anorectal sexual dysfunction. It is widely accepted that childbirth may predispose to anorectal dysfunction, through pregnancy, labor, or vaginal delivery-induced injury to the pelvic floor musculature and to the rectovaginal septum, to the anal sphincter complex and to the pudendal nerve and regional branches. There is a growing body of evidence on the effect of particular obstetric events on anorectal dysfunction after vaginal delivery. However, the recommendation of an elective cesarean section with the sole purpose of preserving the maternal pelvic floor should be taken with caution, as there is no direct evidence about the protective effect of the procedure. It is more likely that women with a history of anal sphincter lacerations during the first vaginal delivery develop new lacerations and heightened incontinence symptoms with a second one. Operative delivery and episiotomy (especially median) should be avoided because they aggravate the risk of further damage in all these women. After a detailed discussion about the risks and benefits of attempting a new vaginal delivery, an elective cesarean section may be considered in women with symptoms of anal incontinence.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Pregnancy and new parenthood is an exciting time, but also a stressful life event that can predispose to mental health challenges. Perinatal anxiety is one such challenge, and is an important contributor to parental distress and other negative outcomes. Sleep and biological rhythms are often disrupted in the perinatal period. These disruptions have been associated with postpartum depression, and in some cases with perinatal anxiety. However, the literature concerning the association with perinatal anxiety is inconsistent and may be methodologically limited. To our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive review published characterising the relationships between sleep, biological rhythms, and perinatal anxiety and related disorders to date. In this systematic review, we will summarise the current state of the literature concerning these relationships, allowing us to highlight gaps and potentially inform clinical understanding of perinatal anxiety, sleep and biological rhythms. Methods and analysis Primary research articles will be eligible for inclusion if they assess perinatal anxiety or related disorders using validated criteria (self-report or diagnostic), assess sleep and biological rhythms in the perinatal period, include &gt;4 participants and meet other inclusion/exclusion criteria. We will conduct comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and CINAHL, with coverage spanning from database conception to search date (August 1, 2021). Key search concepts include (1) the perinatal period, (2) sleep/biological rhythms and (3) anxiety. Risk of bias will be evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Data will be narratively synthesised, with quantitative synthesis included if possible. When relevant, strength of evidence will be assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria, and potential publication bias will be assessed. Ethics and dissemination Research ethics approval is not required. Study results will be reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders as conference presentation(s) and submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. PROSPERO registration number 200166.",

      "title": "Os Impactos da Endometriose na qualidade de vida e fertilidade",
      "abstract": "A endometriose é uma condição crônica que afeta muitas mulheres em idade fértil, caracterizada pela presença de tecido endometrial fora do útero. O diagnóstico muitas vezes é tardio, levando em média 6,7 anos desde o início dos sintomas até a confirmação da doença. Isso resulta em um agravamento do quadro de saúde e uma redução na qualidade de vida das mulheres afetadas. A endometriose provoca uma série de sintomas, incluindo dor intensa durante a menstruação, dor durante o sexo, problemas intestinais e urinários, dor pélvica e, em alguns casos, infertilidade. Além disso, afeta não apenas a saúde física, mas também a saúde emocional das pacientes, interferindo nas relações pessoais, profissionais e sexuais. A pesquisa revela que a endometriose não é devidamente compreendida pela sociedade, muitas vezes sendo rotulada como \"cólica menstrual\" e, consequentemente, subestimada. Isso leva à estigmatização das pacientes e dificulta o diagnóstico precoce. No que diz respeito ao diagnóstico, a endometriose é desafiadora devido à variedade de sintomas e à falta de testes definitivos. A confirmação da doença pode ocorrer tardiamente, resultando em sofrimento prolongado para as pacientes. Quanto ao tratamento, as terapias convencionais, como terapias hormonais e cirurgias, são comuns, mas muitas vezes associadas a efeitos colaterais significativos. Alternativas terapêuticas não farmacológicas, como acupuntura, massagem, terapia cognitivo-comportamental e exercícios como o pilates, mostram potencial no alívio da dor e na melhoria da qualidade de vida. Além disso, a pesquisa sugere que a cannabis medicinal pode ser eficaz no tratamento da endometriose, aliviando a dor crônica com poucos efeitos colaterais. No entanto, essas abordagens ainda requerem mais investigação. Em resumo, a endometriose é uma condição complexa que afeta profundamente a vida das mulheres afetadas. É fundamental promover a conscientização sobre a doença, buscar o diagnóstico precoce e desenvolver abordagens de tratamento abrangentes e eficazes para melhorar a qualidade de vida das pacientes.",

      "title": "Application Of Kegel Gymnastics And Audio Hypnobirthing In Midwife Care During Pregnancy To Reduce Urine Incontinence And Anxiety",
      "abstract": "Physiological changes during pregnancy such as increased abdominal pressure and progesterone levels can make women more susceptible to urinary incontinence. As a result, more than half of women suffer from urinary incontinence during pregnancy and peaks in the third trimester. Urinary incontinence during pregnancy is a strong predictor of urinary incontinence postpartum and later in life. To prevent urinary incontinence during pregnancy, it is recommended to do pelvic floor muscle exercises (kegel exercises). In addition, the physical changes of pregnant women can also interfere with their physical and mental health so that their emotions are unstable. One of the ways that pregnant women can reduce their anxiety level is the relaxation method or self-hypnosis. Relaxation is a method that is considered quite effective for reducing muscle tension and anxiety. One of them is through audio hypnobirthing. This research was conducted to get a clearer picture of the application of the Kegel exercise method and self-hypnosis through audio hypnobirthing as an effort to reduce urinary incontinence and the resulting anxiety. This case study uses a descriptive observational method with a Continuity Of Care approach during pregnancy at Ny. N at PMB Zuniawati on 07 October 2022 to 22 October 2022. Mrs. N, who previously complained of anxiety about her pregnancy and fetus due to urinary incontinence, after being given midwifery care that was integrated with kegel exercises and self-hypnosis through audio hypnobirthing, was finally able to reduce her anxiety and expedite the delivery process",

L’objectif de cette etude est de rechercher les difficultes auxquelles les femmes font face, au moment de cet evenement et dans les mois qui suivent.Patientes et Methode: Cette etude qualitative, realisee aupres de 14 patientes, se compose d’entretiens semi-directifs qui ont fait l’objet d’une analyse thematique avec triangulation afin d’explorer les problematiques rencontrees a chaque etape.Resultats : L’emotion avec laquelle certains evenements sont rapportes par les femmes, tels que les termes ou conditions de l’annonce, l’attente avant expulsion, mais aussi et surtout l’expulsion elle-meme, avec parfois l’apparition de fortes douleurs et/ou de saignements importants, traduit un veritable psycho-traumatisme. L’absence de preparation des femmes a leur survenue constitue un facteur aggravant. Le caractere « imprevisible » de la premiere fausse couche explique que cetraumatisme soit plus frequemment relate dans le cas des fausses couches sporadiques. A l’inverse, la medicalisation instauree lors de la survenue d’une troisieme fausse couche est rassurante pour la plupart des femmes.Conclusion : Au-dela des difficultes deja connues retrouvees dans ce travail, deux elements nouveaux y sont mis en evidence : il s’agit, d’une part, de la perception negative par les femmes de la banalisation des fausses couches sporadiques et, d’autre part, d’un encadrement insuffisant de l’expulsion, source de traumatisme psychologique",

Stabili pacientų emocinė būklė, pakankamas pacientų informuotumas yra siejamas su sklandžiu pooperaciniu laikotarpiu. Tyrimo metodai: mokslinės literatūros analizė; statistinė duomenų analizė, naudojant SPSS 21 (aprašomoji statistika, vidurkių palyginimo T testas, Anova testas). Tyrimui atlikti buvo naudojama anketinė apklausa raštu. Tyrimo rezultatai. Beveik pusė respondentų priešoperacinį nerimą vertino gan aukštais balais. Didžiausią nerimą jaučia asmenys, kuriems operacija atliekama pirmą kartą Nerimas dažnai susietas su skausmu. O tai reikštų, kad kuo stipriau pacientai išgyvena skausmą priešoperaciniu ar pooperaciniu laikotarpiu, tuo jiems nustatomas aukštesnis nerimo lygmuo. Moterys daugiau nerimauja prieš operacijas nei vyrai. Mažesnis nerimo lygmuo buvo nustatytas vyresnio amžiaus asmenų grupėje. Didžiausiu priešoperaciniu nerimu pasižymėjo moterys prieš cezario, ginekologines operacijas. Praktiškai kas antras tyrime dalyvavęs asmuo savo iniciatyva bandė įveikti nerimą priešoperaciniu laikotarpiu (informacijos ieškojo internete, konsultavosi su gydytoju, artimaisiais). Psichologiškai pasiruošti operacijai daugiausia padeda artimieji. Mažiausias vaidmuo tenka slaugytojoms. Išvada.

      "abstract": "Combined pills which include an estrogen (usually ethinyl estradiol) and a progestin (usually a norsteroid) in amounts which remain constant over the 21 or 22 days of treatment are the most widely used and classic type of oral contraceptive. In diphasic combined pills the dose of the 2nd half of the cycle is stronger and in sequential combined pills which are used only in special circumstances the progestin is added only for the last 6 or 15 days. Minipills contain less than 50 mcg of estrogen. The primary mode of action of combined pills is blockage of hypothalamic and pituitary secretions so that ovulation does not occur but modification of the uterine mucus to impede implantation and of the cervical mucus to impede sperm mobility also occur. Combined pills have almost 100% effectiveness. Prescriptions should be preceded by a complete medical history and examination to identify contraindications. Genital or breast cancer arterial hypertension cardiovascular problems severe lipid elevation jaundice or serious neuropsychic problems are absolute contraindications. The patient should be examined 3 months after beginning pill use and every 6 months thereafter. If a minipill is skipped the woman should not consider herself protected for the duration of the packet. In women desiring pregnancy pills should be discontinued for 1 cycle every 2 years to insure that ovulation occurs. Spotting oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea breast swelling heaviness nausea headaches problems of libido nervousness depression and problems of pigmentation or hair loss are occasional side effects which usually disappear after the 1st few cycles but may require changing to another prescription or method. The most serious risk is of vascular problems which are more likely in cases of arterial hypertension obesity smoking hyperlipidism surgical intervention and a few other conditions. Pills do not appear to be carcinogenic but after 40 years of age another method should be chosen. Modifications of metabolism heapatic risks teratogenic risks for pregnancies begun during or in the 1st cycle after pill use postpill amenorrhea and interactions with other drugs are possible effects for which some patients are at high risk. Progestin-only pills or injections avoid the secondary effects and risks of estrogens. Synthetic progestins administered in tri-monthly injections are over 99% effective but may cause irregular bleeding or amenorrhea the major causes of termination. Discontinuous high dose oral progestins and low-dose continuous progestins are also recommended for some conditions.",

      "abstract": "#### Summary points\n\nUnscheduled vaginal bleeding—bleeding that occurs outside the normal menstrual period or the regular withdrawal bleed associated with the combined oral contraceptive pill—is a common reason for women of reproductive age to attend primary care. It is also referred to as intermenstrual bleeding. As well as intermenstrual bleeding, unscheduled bleeding also includes postcoital bleeding; it can be difficult to distinguish between the two because they often occur together. Because postcoital bleeding may have different implications, the causes of both need to be considered in a woman with unscheduled bleeding. Irregular bleeding associated with hormonal contraception is generally called breakthrough bleeding.\n\nIn a study of women presenting to primary care with menstrual problems, 36% of women reported intermenstrual bleeding or postcoital bleeding in addition to heavy menstrual loss.1 Unscheduled bleeding causes anxiety and concern because it can be a presenting symptom for gynaecological cancer, particularly cervical and endometrial cancer. This symptom can also be associated with other menstrual disorders, such as heavy menstrual bleeding, particularly when caused by benign lesions such as fibroids or endometrial polyps, but also heavy menstrual bleeding of no known cause (formally called dysfunctional bleeding). \n\nHowever, it …",

Pemakaian sepatu ber-hak tinggi ( > 5 cm) merupakan salah satu contoh bagaimana wanita justru mengundang masalah pada kaki. Dengan penggunaan sepatu tersebut biomekanika pada kaki menjadi abnormal, sudut sendi kaki menjadi lebih besar sehingga kemampuan dan kontraksi otot yang diperlukan untuk menopang beban tubuh semakin besar, serta faktor lainnya yang dapat mengakibatkan kelelahan dalam bekerja adalah posisi berdiri. Saat berdiri cenderung otot gastrocnemius cenderung statis, dan apabila posisi berdiri ini lebih dari 2 jam akan terjadi kelelahan dikarenakan otot mengalami kontraksi terus menerus tanpa adanya rileksasi kelelahan terjadi akibat sirkulasi darah yang kurang lancar. Pada karyawati SPG (Sales Promotion Girls) kedua faktor tersebut sangat dominan dalam aktivitas bekerja mereka, selain menggunakan sepatu berhak tinggi, aktivitas bekerja mereka lebih dominan dalam posisi berdiri. Oleh karena itu bekerja dengan penggunaan sepatu berhak tinggi serta dominasi posisi berdiri yang lama saat bekerja tanpa adanya rileksasi dapat menyebabkan terjadinya kelelahan akibat sirkulasi darah tidak lancar serta dapat menimbulkan penurunan produktifitas kerja. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk mengetahui apakah ada pengaruh penggunaan sepatu berhak tinggi terhadap potensi terjadinya varises pada tungkai bawah pada karyawati SPG di Matahari Solo Square Surakarta. Desain penelitian yang dipakai adalah deskriptif Analitik metode survey dengan jumlah sampel 60 orang. Namun dibagi lagi berdasarakan kriteria-kriteria yang ada untuk dilakukan treadmill. Treadmill dilakukan untuk mengetahui berapa lama responden merasakan keluhan, di hitung dengan menggunakan detik, dengan kecepatan rata-rata 90rpm. Kemudian hasilnya diadakan uji normalitas dengan uji kolmogorov smirnov dan uji hipotesis dengan uji-t menggunakan program SPSS 11,5. Hasil penelitian menunjukan bahwa ada pengaruh penggunaan sepatu berhak tinggi terhadap potensi terjadinya varises pada tungkai bawah dengan nilai probabilitas 0,110, berarti lebih besar dari 0,05. sedangkan nilai thitung sebesar 10,850..Disarankan bagi karyawati SPG menggunakan sepatu hak dengan ketinggian hak < 5 cm, memanfaatkan waktu istirahat sebaik mungkin, untuk melakukan peregangan ( rileksasi ) serta melakukan olah raga secara teratur.

Pressure in the ears due to obstructed eustacian tubes are often seen in pregnancy and in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Whether ear pressure is the consequence of vascular congestion or of the cyclic response of the nasal mucosa to female hormones is unknown but patients can often find relief by switching from sequential to combined pills. Vertigo unsteadiness and imbalance are often noted a few days before menstruation during pill cycles. Their relationship with thrombosis is unknown. In menopause estrogen relieves vertigo. Distortion of sound is probably caused by patulous or obstructed eustacian tubes and requires discontinuing the pill. Nasal congestion can often be relieved by sequential pills because nasal mucous glands respond like the genital tract to estrogen in hypogonadal women. Premenstrual headache related to traction or alteration of cranial blood vessels can be treated with 2 mg Halotestin (fluoxymesterone) sublingually. Migraine headaches often respond to progestin because these hormones raise the threshhold of the reticular system and have an anitconvulsive effect.

The first stage or transabdominal that occurs during the first 3 months of gestation is probably produced by the differential growth of the fetus and is believed to be mediated by the Müllerian inhibiting hormone. The second stage or transinguinal migration that occurs during the 8th month of gestation is a complex event depending on the interaction between the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular hormonal axis and mechanical factors as gubernaculum, intra-abdominal pressure, epididymis. This stage is believed to be androgen dependent. Although hormonal involvement in testicular descent appears clear-cut, there is nevertheless some discrepancy in the literature as to whether cryptorchid children show abnormalities in their hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis. Certainly cryptorchidism is a syndrome with various causes. Few cases show primary anatomical abnormalities or are associated to complex congenital anomalies or to clear hormonal defects. Most cases do not recognize an evident cause and an endocrinological abnormality has been suggested. A deficiency in LH and testosterone secretion has been reported in the cryptorchid child.",

The most common symptoms are PV bleeding, in both pregnant and non-pregnant females, PV discharge, and lower abdominal pain. The majority of these cases are benign and the patient can be discharged after reassurance and arrangement of primary care follow-up, but a few of them may have an underlying life-threatening condition. One classic example is a ruptured ectopic pregnancy. About 10% of females who present to the ED with PV bleeding or abdominal pain in the first trimester of the pregnancy have an ectopic pregnancy. Such patients may present in shock following a catastrophic haemorrhage in the abdomen or arrive at the ED well but collapse in the waiting room. Management of these emergencies requires establishment of IV fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and involvement of an O&amp;G specialist. Such patients are often rushed to the theatre for emergency operation to control the haemorrhage. In other situations, the normal practice of taking a history and physical examination should be followed. Bear in mind that close attention to privacy and confidentiality is most crucial during the procedure. Interview the patient without the other family members if possible, as the patient may be reluctant to tell the whole story in their presence. Pelvic examination is sometimes painful, undignified, and embarrassing to many patients especially if the examining doctor is a male. This can be avoided to a large extent by explaining the process of examination, and performing it gently in the presence of a chaperone. It must not be forgotten that vaginal bleeding during pregnancy produces maternal distress, for which also the patient will need support. Patients presenting with lower abdominal pain often have a disease related to the female genital tract or the urinary system. But the lower GI tract may also contribute to the pain and should therefore be included in the differentials. With regard to the reproductive system, there are a few causes of pain during pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "Over the course of approximately 150 years the medical community has advanced considerably in managing women’s child delivery-related pain . Obstetrical analgesia has evolved from first the inhaled administration of chloroform to mollify labor pain in 1843 to morphine use at the beginning of the 20th century to the current approaches employing epidural anesthesia and spinal block. A number of different analgesic techniques can now be suggested to pregnant women entering labor. The author considers the peridural administration of anesthesia to quell women’s childbirth pain. The various effects of being in a horizontal rather than standing or squatting position when delivering a fetus selecting the most appropriate analgesic and practical aspects of effecting pain sensation blockage below the waist during labor are discussed. Spinal block and the epidural approach must be proposed to all pregnant women and not seen as extra work for the attending obstetrical team. Spinal block increases the intensity of uterine contractions lowers ocytocic need affects aortic cava compression improves patient comfort and reduces the duration of dilatation. Furthermore related pelvic movements facilitate proper positioning of the fetus’ head.",

Not infrequently the mother has not been able to adapt to these changes so that the mother feels uncomfortable, if not addressed wisely it will have an impact on worry and anxiety that can interfere with the mother's daily activities. Prenatal yoga is one way to overcome or reduce these complaints, preparing pregnant women physically, mentally and spiritually to face the birth process. Teluk Kenidai Village is located in Kampar district where the people there are not familiar with prenatal yoga. After doing prenatal yoga, the majority of pregnant women feel that there has been a change in their complaints, such as reduced back/waist pain, cramps and reduced nausea, headaches and other complaints. Prenatal yoga can also be done by pregnant women while at home, even though not all yoga movements can be memorized, but by still doing some easy yoga movements to help pregnant women to overcome complaints during pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "This literature review reports on risk factors for postpartum anoestrus in zebus and their potential treatments. Prolonged postpartum anestrus is one of the major factors limiting reproductive efficiency in cattle, particularly in Bos indicus cows in tropical regions, as it prevents a calving interval of 365 days from being achieved. During anestrus, ovulation does not occur despite ovarian follicular development, as the growing follicles do not reach maturity. This period is very variable and depends on various factors whose importance is relative or, on the contrary, essential. Some are specific to the animal (breastfeeding or food); others relate more to its social environment, season sanitary conditions. Several hormonal treatments have been used to induce ovulation and cyclicity in postpartum cows. Generally speaking, given the inconsistency of the effects or even their lack of practicability, treatments using a single or repeated injection of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) have been gradually abandoned in favour of progestagens. These are administered for 8 to 12 days on a continuous basis in the form of a subcutaneous implant (Crestar®), a vaginal coil (PRID®) or a CIDR. A prostaglandin injection is given two days before the implant is removed. The addition of an ECG treatment at the time of device removal, which increased plasma progesterone concentrations and pregnancy rates in anestrous postpartum suckled Bos indicus cows, may be useful to improve reproductive performance. This improvement requires a better understanding of the effect of different risk factors on the recovery of postpartum cyclicity.",

The psychological work that takes place is not necessarily conscious, although it is well known that during pregnancy there is a tendency for women to become more introspective. As with pregnancy, there are many rituals surrounding the care of babies, practices concerning feeding, winding, and wrapping, or about the mother's diet. These again are meant to keep evil forces at bay and are one way of dealing with the anxieties concerning the very real physical and mental fragility of the infant. Women frequently expect to have the same sort of childbirth and pregnancy experience as their own mother had. The fear of damage to herself or the baby can stem from a woman's feelings about childbirth as the first separation of mother and baby, a symbol for all future separations.",

      "title": "Prevalence of Scapulothoracic Dysfunction in Primipara after One Year of Delivery",
      "abstract": "Background: During pregnancy, there are various physiological, biomechanical, postural, and emotional changes taking place. The changes in posture which occurs during pregnancy are even maintained in postpartum period if they remain uncorrected. Due to the enlargement of breasts, size of the uterus, and mother’s weight, there is increase in lumbar and cervical lordosis and there is compensatory thoracic kyphosis, the shoulder and upper back become rounded. There is scapular protraction and internal rotation of the upper extremity; these adaptations of posture may also persist in the postpartum period due to infant care demands. Pectoralis muscles tightness and weakness of the scapular stabilizers may be pre-existing to or may occur due to pregnancy postural changes. Hence, there is a need of evaluating the upper quadrant musculoskeletal involvement during the postpartum period and its correlation with changes that occur during pregnancy. Objective: The objective of this study was to study the prevalence of scapulothoracic dysfunction in primipara after 1 year of delivery. Methods: A total 150 primipara women who had completed 1 year of delivery were randomly selected from the Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences, Karad in this analytical observational study. Scapulothoracic dysfunction was assessed using postural examination chart in the anterior, lateral and posterior views by plumb line, manual muscle testing for muscle strength, and special tests for scapular dysfunction. Results: The result showed that 71% found to be positive for scapulothoracic dysfunction through YES/NO test, respectively. Majority of the subjects (45%) had type II scapular dyskinesis, while 18% subjects had type I, 11% had type III, and 22% had type IV. On postural examination, 27% had forward head posture, 55% had protracted shoulder, and 60% had kyphotic posture. The strength test showed that 57% subjects had weak trapezius, 60% had serratus anterior weak and significant amount of weakness with gradings in the range of −3–+3 for 57% subjects in trapezius, 60% in serratus anterior, and 65% had weak rhomboid’s major with gradings in the range of −3–+3, respectively. Conclusion: The study concludes that, statistically, there was high prevalence of scapulothoracic dysfunction in primipara women after 1 year of delivery. This was due of the slouched posture that the women’s adapted due to increase in breast size, increased size of the uterus, breast feeding positioning, and also infant care which demanded hunched back posture. It was also found that women had lack of knowledge about posture.",

This chapter describes additional methods that can be considered for stallions with ejaculation difficulty, including for stallions where the known contributing conditions cannot be sufficiently relieved or where the cause of dysfunction is uncertain. Modifications in breeding schedule or semen collection and processing, as well as upgraded mare management modifications, can often help prolong the breeding career of stallions with chronic ejaculatory difficulty.",

      "title": "Dyspareunia in Postmenopausal Women: A Critical Review",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dyspareunia, or pain during sexual intercourse, is among the problems most frequently reported by postmenopausal women. Past literature has almost unanimously attributed dyspareunic pain occurring during or after the menopausal transition to declining estrogen levels and vaginal atrophy. OBJECTIVES: To critically review the literature on the prevalence, risk factors, etiology, clinical presentation and treatment of post‐menopausal dyspareunia. The present review also examines the traditional and widely held conceptualization of postmenopausal dyspareunia as a direct symptom of hormonal decline. METHODS: Searches of medical and psychological databases were performed for relevant articles and empirical studies. The methodological quality and outcomes of the studies were systematically reviewed. RESULTS: Available empirical evidence suggests that dyspareunia is common in postmenopausal women, and that it is not highly correlated with menopausal status, estrogen levels or vaginal atrophy. Decreasing levels of endogenous estrogen contribute to the development of dyspareunia in postmenopausal women suffering from vaginal atrophy. Hormonal supplementation is beneficial in alleviating their pain. However, a substantial proportion of treated women do not report relief. CONCLUSIONS: Postmenopausal dyspareunia occurring concurrently with vaginal atrophy is strongly associated with a lack of estrogen in the genital tract. However, a significant percentage of postmenopausal women experience dyspareunic pain that is not caused by hypoestrogenism. It is likely that other types of dyspareunia that occur premenopausally are also occurring in postmenopausal women. Research is needed to adequately address this issue. A change in perspective toward a multiaxial pain‐focused approach is proposed for future research concerning dyspareunia in postmenopausal women.",

      "abstract": "Background: The postnatal period begins immediately after the separation of the placenta extending up to 6 weeks, otherwise called as the puerperium or puerperal period. The care given during this period is called as Sutika Paricharya (postnatal care) in Ayurveda. During the time of labor, the mother undergoes tremendous physical exertion and becomes extremely debilitated, physically and mentally, which leads to derangement of Dosha especially Vatadosha in the mother. These factors cause general weakness, pain in the abdomen, low back pain, loss of appetite, dysfunction of the bladder, postnatal psychosis, etc. Apart from these, the mother also suffers with Dhatukshaya (weakness of body tissue). Prevention of puerperal sepsis, management of other complications, proper involution of genital organs, and proper lactation need to be well managed during the puerperal period. Based on the information available in the Ayurvedic texts regarding the management during Sutika Kala (postnatal phase), this study has been designed to assess the clinical efficacy of two Ayurvedic classical formulations, viz., Saubhagyashunthi Paka and Dashamularishta for the effective management of the puerperal phase. Materials and methods: A single-center, noncontrolled, open-label clinical trial as a means of assessing the therapeutic efficacy of Saubhagyashunthi Paka and Dashamularishta will be conducted. A total of 40 participants will be recruited for the study. The study period is 12 months, during which all the participants will be given the trial drugs for a duration of 8 weeks along with the standard care as recommended by established guidelines. Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is to restore the strength of the mother and minimize the complications and establishment of sufficient lactation. The secondary outcomes are improvement in the quality of life and clinical safety of the trial drugs. Statistical evaluation would be done at the end of the trial period to compare the changes in the assessment parameters from the baseline. Discussion: The study will generate the preliminary evidence of the efficacy of Saubhagyashunthi Paka and Dashamularishta in Sutika Paricharya (w.s.r. to postnatal care), which will validate the Ayurvedic therapeutic approach for the management of Sutika Paricharya and will also help to design a randomized controlled trial.

Periovulatory migraine can be easily treated with oral contraceptives (o.c.). In women already taking o.c. with headaches in the perimenstrual period either low dose progestogens (minipill) or 0.5 mg estriol up to three times per day during the whole interval can be tried. In women not taking o.c. a corresponding therapy from day 20 of the cycle is indicated. It is important to choose the dosage to be neutral towards bleeding behavior.",

Kelainan atau gangguan yang ada hubungan dengan menstruasi diantaranya premenstrual tension (ketegangan sebelum haid), mastodinia (rasa nyeri pada payudara), mittelschmerz (rasa nyeri saat ovulasi), dan dysmenorrhea (rasa nyeri saat menstruasi). Nyeri haid (dysmenorrhea) adalah salah satu kelainan yang menyebabkan perempuan muda pergi ke dokter untuk berkonsultasi dan berobat. Nyeri haid atau disebut Dysmenorrhea adalah nyeri yang biasanya timbul pada masa remaja, yaitu sekitar 2 sampai 3 tahun setelah menstruasi pertama. Nyeri haid merupakan keluhan yang sering dialami remaja pada bagian perut bawah (Kusmiran, 2013). Nyeri haid membuat perempuan tidak bisa beraktivitas secara normal dan memerlukan resep obat. Keadaan tersebut menyebabkan menurunnya kualitas hidup perempuan, sebagai contoh mahasiswi yang mengalami nyeri haid primer tidak dapat berkonsentasi dalam belajar dan motivasi belajar menurun karena nyeri yang dirasakan.&#x0D; Tujuan: Untuk melihat serta mengevaluasi perilaku pada penderita nyeri haid (dysmenorrhea) dalam melakukan perilaku protektif (protection motivation theory).&#x0D; Metode: Penelitian yang bersifat evaluatif yang bertujuan untuk melihat kerasionalan penanganan nyeri haid (dysmenorrhea) pada mahasiswi Fakultas Kesehatan Universitas Sari Mulia Banjarmasin.

The therapy of disturbances during the premenopausal stage mainly consists of the substitution of progesterone or in a cycle-like estrogen-progesterone-therapy. In the premenopausal stage estrogens are the therapy of choice. Among orally efficient estrogens the conjugated estrogen and the estradiol-valerianat are preferred. Side-effects and contraindications are discussed in detail. Among gynecologists there exists no disagreement about the necessity of therapy of serious climacteric disturbances, the opinions about prophylactic estrogen-therapy in women differ.",

      "abstract": "The four major hypertensive disorders related to pregnancy are preeclampsia, chronic hypertension, preeclampsia superimposed upon chronic hypertension, and gestational hypertension. The development of hypertension and proteinuria in pregnancy is usually due to preeclampsia, particularly in a primigravida. These findings typically become apparent in the latter part of the third trimester and progress until delivery, but some women develop symptoms in the latter half of the second trimester, or intrapartum, or the early postpartum period. Preeclampsia is characterized as mild or severe. Severe hypertension, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, liver function abnormalities, and fetal growth restriction are features of severe disease. Laboratory evaluation should assess haemoglobin/hematocrit and platelet count, renal and hepatic function, as well as assessment of fetal well-being and growth. Timing of delivery is based upon gestational age, maternal and fetal condition, and the severity of preeclampsia. Maternal end organ dysfunction and nonreassuring tests of fetal well-being are indications for delivery at any gestational age. Antihypertensive treatment aims at protecting the mother from severe hypertensive encephalopathy, but may jeopardize the fetus. We recommend antenatal corticosteroids (betamethasone) be given to women with preeclampsia at 26 to 34 weeks of gestation. Magnesium sulfate is more effective than phenytoin for prevention of eclamptic seizures.",

      "abstract": "This review covers the literature on CA125 and endometriosis; data on CA125 and oncology are not discussed. In normal women, plasma concentrations of CA125 are increased slightly at ovulation and significantly during menstruation. Marked increases are observed during pregnancy and following peritoneal irritation by infection or surgery. These data are consistent with the concept that CA125 in normal women is mainly derived from the endometrium and the irritated peritoneum. Plasma concentrations of CA125 are markedly elevated in women with cystic ovarian endometriosis and/or deeply infiltrating endometriosis, but not, or only slightly, in the luteal phase of women with minimal or mild endometriosis. This is consistent with the recent concept which considers minimal endometriosis as a normal condition occurring intermittently in many women, in contrast with deep endometriosis and cystic ovarian endometriosis which are called 'endometriotic disease'. Serum CA125 is not a good marker for endometriosis but it is a helpful additional parameter to diagnose endometriotic disease in patients with chronic pelvic pain. Following treatment of endometriosis, elevated plasma concentrations of CA125 could be used as an argument that treatment has been incomplete, or that the condition has recurred. Assaying CA125 in peritoneal fluid requires high sample dilutions or a modified immunoradiometric assay, and until now, its clinical value has been questionable.",

As indicated by the relative weights of accessory glands, males born in spring matured earlier compared with animals born in other months of the year. Variation in the relative testicular weights during maturation was not influenced by the month of birth. Female mice also showed a significant relationship between the month of birth and sexual maturation. Females born in March reached puberty, as measured by the age of vaginal opening and first oestrus, earlier than those born in other months of the year.",

      "abstract": "Several studies have shown an association between local/systemic infections and preterm-low birth weight (PTLBW), and it might be an important part of the etiology. Oral Infections such as periodontitis may act as a distant reservoir of microbes, microbial products and inflammatory mediators. These might influence pregnancy and contribute to restriction of fetal growth and induction of early labor and PTB. Enamel formation of the primary teeth begins at 11-14 weeks of fetal life and is completed by the end of 3rd postnatal month. The initial phase consists of matrix formation, followed by calcification in utero. Since enamel is a stable structure, defects involving its matrix secretion and/or maturation of primary teeth can act as a permanent record of insults occurring pre- or perinatally. Any stressful event during pregnancy and birth may lead to metabolic changes in the formation of the enamel, resulting in clinically enamel defects. Severe infections occurring during amelogenesis may be associated with enamel hypoplasia. Babies born after maternal complications during pregnancy or babies who experience a traumatic birth must be considered to be at risk of developing Early Childhood Caries - ECC when exposed to excessive bottle nursing. Therefore oral healthcare should be kept during pregnancy.",

In some cases activation was resumed when light time or intensity was increased again. These results are taken to indicate that, in female ferrets, any inherent rhythm or cycle of sexual activity is modified either naturally or artificially by changes of the cycles of duration and intensity of the light to which they are exposed daily, and so made to correspond in phases with the seasons, or changed therefrom. The rising daily illumination in spring and the falling one in late summer and autumn probably accelerate and retard the sexual activity of the female ferret, or accelerate the onset of anoestrus in late summer and autumn. The data on modification of sexual cycles or activity in ferrets, so far obtained, are consistent with these conclusions.",

Epidemiological studies that yield evidence of toxic effects of substances on the human embryo or foetus are of particular importance for the assessment. The evaluation of the developmental toxicity of substances is based mainly on animal studies. Prenatal toxic effects which are observed in the presence of marked maternal toxicity are of low relevance for the situation at the workplace as they are prevented by observance of the maximum workplace concentration (MAK) value. Inhalation studies are of particular importance in assessment of the prenatal toxicity of substances present at the workplace. This chapter defines the pregnancy risk groups.",

In contrast, secondary dysmenorrhea refers to pelvic pain that presents as a symptom of other gynecologic conditions. Diagnosis is based on detailed clinical history, physical and gynecological examination, and complementary tests may be performed in specific cases. Treatment of primary dysmenorrhea is multimodal and aims to relieve pain and improve the patient’s quality of life.

      "abstract": "Having children is a dream for every married couple. However, this process is not that easy for 15% couples worldwide who suffer infertility. Infertility is the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after twelve months of regular and unprotected intercourse. Half of infertility causes come from the man called male infertility. Male factors of infertility vary greatly from mild one like oligozoospermia to severe one like extreme oligozoospermia which make the natural pregnancy difficult to happen, hence a help from assisted reproductive technology is needed. In more extreme case like testicular agenesis, having children really becomes a necessity and it will bring bad news to him. Bad News (BN) refers to a condition of hopelessness, threatening life and body or anything which raises the patients’ anxiety about his future. In this case, male infertility can be categorized as BN since it causes loss of hope and anxiety. The process of Breaking Bad News (BBN) requires good communication skill. There were several BBN protocols formulated previously covering Advance preparation, Build relationships, Communicate well, Deal with the patient, Encourage emotion (ABCDE), Background, Rapport, Explore, Announce, Kindling, Summarize (BREAKS) and Settings, Perception, Invitation, Knowledge, Empathy, Strategy (SPIKES). Each protocol had been applied to other medical fields such as oncology, pediatric etc. Whilst its application on male infertility cases has never been published. Even if this protocol is able to be applied properly, it is capable to increase the patients’ knowledge, improve their psychological condition and maintain the threshold of hope for having children",

      "abstract": "Analogous to gynecological fertility diagnostics as applied to women, the andrological methodology for the examination of men has been expanded into a simple and extended method of fertility diagnostics. Generally, the examination of a male patient begins with simple fertility diagnostics and is followed-up individually by detailed diagnostic procedures only when a certain suspicion exists. As a rule extended diagnostic procedures are not applied to a husband before the wife's ability to conceive has not first been determined at least by a simple gynecological examination. This proceeding sequence is rational and satisfying particularly since some fertility diagnostic interventions can only be imposed upon a patient after all other possibilities are exhausted. Primarily in cases of cohabitational disorders caused by male impotence, a similar diagnostic method is applied. As in the case of fertility examinations, all other possibilities, such as endocrinological malfunctions, metabolic disorders, disease symptoms and neurological defeciencies are thoroughly investigated. After all pathological findings are ruled out, psychoanalytical tests are advised. In most cases, behavioural disorders can be left to the guidance of the andrologist within the framework of minor sexual-psychological psychiatry. In more severe cases, specialized psychiatric diagnostic procedures are recommended. Although the classic spermiogram is still the focal point of diagnostics, normo-zoospermia is no longer necessarily synonymous with reproductive ability. Under given circumstances, differential diagnostic considerations are sometimes necessary taking the entire equipment of extended diagnostic procedures for granted.",

      "abstract": "A dor relacionada ao trabalho de parto e parto é uma preocupação histórica para as mulheres, com o primeiro método moderno de analgesia obstétrica introduzido em 1847. Os mecanismos de dor incluem dilatação cervical, contrações miometriais e pressão nas estruturas pélvicas e raízes nervosas. Apesar do avanço nas técnicas de analgesia, ainda há controvérsias sobre sua aplicação. Este artigo busca investigar os benefícios e a segurança da analgesia peridural durante o parto normal, conforme estudos científicos. Realizou-se uma revisão narrativa de literatura, analisando estudos das bases de dados PubMed, BVS Saúde, SciELO e Brazilian Journal of Health Review. Foram selecionados sete estudos que demonstram a eficácia e a segurança da anestesia peridural durante o trabalho de parto. Observou-se que a analgesia peridural proporciona controle adequado da dor com mínima interferência nas funções sensoriais e motoras, sendo fundamental que as gestantes expressem seus desejos através de um plano de parto. A combinação de sufentanil e bupivacaína mostrou-se eficaz e sem efeitos colaterais significativos. O desejo materno por analgesia é suficiente para sua indicação, garantindo satisfação e aderência às recomendações do Ministério da Saúde para promover partos vaginais e reduzir cesáreas. A técnica peridural é amplamente usada por proporcionar alívio significativo da dor com mínimo bloqueio motor. A orientação detalhada durante o pré-natal é essencial para uma experiência positiva no parto.",

      "abstract": "Urinary incontinence is a bothersome situation to the ailing woman. Many times, the woman does not come to medicos due to shyness, and if she comes also she does not reveal all the information. Hence, a sympathetic and structured approach will help to provide judicious management to these women. When a woman with the complaint of urinary incontinence approaches us, we should collect maximum information with the help of structured questionnaire and protocol. Structured questionnaire provides most of the information pertinent to the urinary incontinence. Associated medical disorders are also looked for. Past obstetrical performance can have implication on this ailment. Pelvic organ prolapse, mass lower abdominal, etc., also can lead to urinary incontinence. Adverse effect of some medicines causes urinary incontinence. During general physical examination, attention has to be paid toward body mass index, joint hypermobility, spine, etc. During local examination, stress test, Bonney test, Q-tip test, etc., may help to some extent. The levator ani muscle is assessed of its strength. Neurological evaluation is to be done for all the patients with urinary incontinence. Urinary culture and sensitivity are routinely done. Once urinary infection is ruled out, then the woman is subjected to frequency/volume diary, ultrasonography, urodynamic study, cystoscopy, etc., depending on the necessity. A systematic approach to urinary incontinence will provide the best comfort to these ailing women.",

      "abstract": "Pregnant women are usually worried about pain during childbirth. It is caused by the force of contractions in the uterus and the pressure that occurs. Pain will increase when the cervix is fully dilated due to fetal pressure on the pelvic structures followed by stretching and tearing of the birth canal. The fear of pain during childbirth is a reason for women to choose to give birth by caesarean section. Every woman has a different pain threshold. Handling labor pain needs to be considered by health workers when helping deliveries. One of the interventions that can be done to reduce pain is pain management. Pain management is an action to reduce and relieve the pain that is felt. Pain management aims to help patients control pain so that the pain is lost or reduced. Pain management can be done with pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques. Both of these techniques aim to reduce or eliminate labor pain by blocking the pain nerves. Related to this problem, a literature review is needed to dig deeper into the information in scientific research journals, so that we can get an overview from various points of view of research, especially regarding the names of pain management performed on maternal patients. This type of research is a literature review with a rapid review technique from journals on the Cochrane library and pubmed data base.",

      "abstract": "Endometrial calcifications occur sporadically and are associated with infertility. Previous uterine trauma during instrumentation and/or uterine infection are likely involved in their pathogenesis. The association between endometrial calcifications and recurrent pregnancy loss has been very infrequently reported. A 28-year-old woman with a history of two consecutive first trimester pregnancy losses presented with ultrasonographic hyperechoic endometrial areas associated with histologic endometrial calcification foci. A third pregnancy conceived before starting micronized oral progesterone supplementation also spontaneously aborted at eight weeks. During the fourth pregnancy, progesterone supplementation was taken for the initial 12 weeks. The endometrial lesions were no longer detectable and the pregnancy progressed to term without complications. Endometrial calcifications, related to intrauterine bone tissue, have been previously treated with curettage or with endoscopic surgery, and to the best of our knowledge, have not been reported to disappear spontaneously. In this case, regression of the endometrial calcifications and a favorable pregnancy outcome occurred in concert with oral micronized progesterone supplementation. A combination of transvaginal ultrasonography and endometrial biopsy appears to be an effective method for diagnosing and monitoring of this rare condition.",

During this transitional phase, the gradual decline and eventual cessation of ovarian function within the complex regulatory network of the endocrine system result in the progressive loss of reproductive capacity, culminating in the termination of menstruation. The associated reduction in estrogen levels gives rise to a spectrum of somatic and mental manifestations that may substantially impair women’s quality of life, work productivity, and social engagement. While in times of peace these symptoms frequently contribute to diminished vitality and adaptive potential, under the extraordinary circumstances of war their significance and impact may be considerably amplified.",

Objective: to show alternative methods to epidural analgesia in pain control during childbirth, benefits and disadvantages. Methodology: for this research has been done a wide documentary review in these databases Cuiden, Scielo, The Cochrane Library and Pubmed, of the articles of the last ten years both in English and Spanish. Results: the continuous support during labor, the liberty in movement, the sterile water injections and the immersion in water have given very good scientific results, being applicable by the midwife. To confirm the effectiveness of the acupuncture, hypnosis and TENS more results are require. These techniques can be used alone or convened with other methods, including pharmacologic analgesic. More controlled and random investigation are necessary to demonstrate the effectively of some of these techniques. Conclusion: The pain of childbirth is subjective and multidimensional, so it varies greatly from one pregnant woman to another, its relief will be conditioned to the characteristics of the woman being the one who determines the type of analgesia that she needs",

      "abstract": "About one in six couples experience difficulty in achieving conception at some stage during their reproductive years. For some, this is temporary and pregnancy ensues spontaneously after a variable period of trying. However, there are others who can only become pregnant through medical intervention. Infertility is common, and most people will not find it hard to remember friends, relatives and/or other acquaintances with such problems. Not only is infertility common but the list of possible causes is quite extensive and to many this may initially appear intimidating. However, for conception to be possible, adequate numbers of good quality spermatozoa must be produced in the testes and delivered to the vagina at the right time in a woman's menstrual (ovarian) cycle. Conditions must be favourable for enough of these spermatozoa to ascend the female genital tract and arrive at the site of fertilization in the fallopian tube. They should be functionally adequate for the task of breaking through the cells that surround the oocyte to enable one of them to fertilize the oocyte. The fertilized egg should develop normally and implant successfully when it arrives at the uterine cavity as an embryo. Difficulty with conception will be experienced if any factor prevents the successful completion of these events.",

The production of sperm, however, is not interrupted, and an increase in pressure proximal to the ligation site may cause rupture of the epididymis or the ductus deferens, with extravasation of spermatozoa and the formation of granulomas or sperm antibodies. Increased pressure may also explain the postvasectomy pain syndrome.",

      "title": "Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG) Associated with Abnormal Transaminases: A Case in Point",
      "abstract": "Purpose: HG is a clinical diagnosis of intractable vomiting associated with weight loss exceeding 5% of prepregnancy weight. Reported in 0.3-2% of pregnancies, it occurs in the first trimester of pregnancy, between 4-10 weeks' gestation. Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) may play a role in the etiology of this disorder. HG can be associated with maternal morbidity and rare mortality and may recur in subsequent pregnancies. We report a case of HG resulting in six abortions and correlate HCG and transaminases. A 32-year-old black female G6P0050 presented 11 weeks pregnant with 1-week of intractable nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain in the setting of elevated transaminases. She denied jaundice, icterus, pruritis, dark urine, or clay-colored stools. She had no risk factors for viral, metabolic, or autoimmune liver disease. Detailed obstetrical history was significant for five prior pregnancies over the past six years, all associated with severe HG complications that led to two spontaneous abortions and two elective abortions. Physical examination was unremarkable. Abdominal ultrasound, upper endoscopy, and renal ultrasound showed no abnormalities. The patient terminated the pregnancy in the setting of severe HG again. Transaminases normalized two days after termination. The correlation of her HCG levels with transaminases in relation to each HG admission had a most impressive pattern over the six-year course (Figure). Liver disease is a rare complication of pregnancy. More commonly, it is distinguished with relation to preeclampsia. HG and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy have no relationship to preeclampsia. Physiologic changes of pregnancy can portray abnormalities associated with liver disease. Many serum results are abnormal according to non-pregnant population standards (increased plasma volumes lowering serum albumin, placental leak of alkaline phosphatase causing elevation). Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase are normally unchanged in pregnancy and increases in these may reflect hepatobiliary pathology. This case illustrates that B-HCG levels correlate with aminotransferase elevation in the setting of HG and can result in significant maternal morbidity.Figure",

      "abstract": "An analysis of the current literature shows that today there is an increased number of complications in women during pregnancy, which pose a real threat not only to the health and life of the future mother, but also to the unborn child, which in turn can act as an additional stressor. The women who have experienced constant fear, anxiety, and stress during pregnancy give birth to children who become sensitive to external stimuli, including frequent crying and poor sleep, and are at increased risk of developing neuropsychiatric disorders as they grow up.For women of reproductive age around the world, anxiety is a serious problem often leading to other mental health issues. If the level of anxiety is constantly rising indefinitely, this can lead to negative outcomess, including pregnancy interruption. In addition, an increased level of anxiety also affects the somatic state of a pregnant woman, which can lead to the development of psychosomatic illness. Miscarriage, especially recurrent miscarriage, is also a risk marker for obstetric complications, including preterm birth, fetal growth retardation, placental abruption and stillbirth in future pregnancies, as well as a factor of long-term health problems.Miscarriage affects psychological well-being of some women, increasing their stress levels after the negative experience. Women who have suffered a miscarriage may be at risk of maternal stress during the next pregnancy, which in turn is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. The presence of one reproductive loss in a woman’s history leads to impaired reproductive function and affects the course of pregnancy and childbirth. These risks increase, namely 16%, 25%, 45% and 54% after one to four previous consecutive spontaneous abortions, respectively.It is also worth considering the fact that each next pregnancy after a previous loss is perceived by the woman as more stressful due to the fear of repeating the loss. Therefore, examination, counselling and management of pregnant women with reproductive losses should be comprehensive and include not only highly professional medical care, but also appropriate psychological support.",

Although a positive diagnosis of endometriosis justifies a recognized treatment programme, the majority of women with negative investigations are left without a diagnosis and often accused of psychological abnormalities. The reasons for the negative investigations are just as likely to be due to the inadequate techniques of the operator as the lack of pathological signs. The early use of menstrual suppression with GnRH analogue allows pain relief sooner in the majority of sufferers and separates those with pain related to the menstrual cycle, from whatever cause, from those whose pain is not related to pelvic physiology and who would not benefit from further medication or operative therapy. The majority, who have obtained relief from the analogue therapy, then have time to discuss alternative long-term treatments without the feeling of desperation that chronic monthly pelvic pain can produce.",

Intense childbirth pain was more common in women having a low educational level. A negative attitude towards the present pregnancy and motherhood was also associated with painful deliveries. There was a high incidence of mental disturbance during pregnancy in women reporting intense pain. Antenatal training and the partner's presence in the delivery room did not influence the woman's experience of pain. The course of the delivery from an obstetrical point of view was unrelated to the women's self-reports of pain.",

Comparisons are made with comparable data previously reported for the estrous cycle and pseudopregnancy. Ovarian and adrenal weights are significantly interrelated in pregnancy. Weights of both drop prior to and after parturition, remaining elevated above pseudopregnant and cyclic values in the lactating females, dropping more sharply in nonlactating females where ovarian weights approach cyclic values as ovulation recurs, usually on the 4th day after parturition. Pituitary weights do not change significantly in pregnancy but do increase significantly above those of the cycle or pseudopregnancy. Pituitary LH content rises until day 11–12, attaining a level at least twice that found in pseudopregnancy. Pituitary LH content remains at a high level in nonlactating females, dropping only with recurrence of ovulation on postpartum 4. In lactating females no ovulation occurs, although the pituitary LH content drops to a level similar to postovulation values by 48 hours postpartum. During pregnancy, uterine dry and wet weights rise and growth is linear; percent of solids drops markedly in late gestation, which, however, is due to the conceptual mass; no such change is obvious in the uterus itself as shown by observations on uteri from which the conceptuses had been stripped. No conclusive evidence was found of a latent cycle during pregnancy, but suggestive points are discussed.",

Classically, the clinical diagnosis of preterm labor has been based on the presence of regular, painful uterine contractions accompanied by cervical dilation and/or effacement. Most women with the clinical presentation of preterm labor deliver at term (37 weeks or beyond) even without intervention.

The breeding season extends from the middle of March to September or even October, but males are fecund a month earlier in spring. Animals born early in the year breed during the same season, when only a few weeks old. Animals born late in the season do not attain puberty until the following year. The mean number of ova ovulated at oestrus is 5.5; the mean number of embryos in utero is 5.0. The female has a polycestrous cycle. Young females frequently experience one or more diœstrous cycles after puberty before becoming pregnant. A post partum oestrus follows parturition; many animals then becoming pregnant although lactating. Animals which do not become pregnant at the post partum oestrus enter a period of ancestrus while lactating, which may be followed by the recurrence of oestrus. We wish to express our thanks to Mr. D. H. S. Davis for providing us with the 22 females of M. agrestis neglectus (Thompson) and to all those who assisted in the collection of the material. Our thanks are due to the Rt. Hon. Lord Penrhyn for permission to trap on his estates.

There is no physiological requirement for the monthly hormone withdrawal bleed that is experienced by women taking cyclic OCs or for a menstrual period in women who do not desire to (or cannot) become pregnant. Thus, the use of continuous or extended-cycle OC regimens that eliminate the menstrual cycle represents a viable and attractive option for many women. The availability of more choices for menstrual suppression, such as continuous use of OCs, will improve the quality of life for many women who suffer from menstrual-related disorders and provide greater convenience for women with busy and active lifestyles.",

The author studied somatic condition, perinatal and postnatal periods in women in labor (WLs) with MP in comparison with healthy WL. A comprehensive clinical examination of 130 pregnant women, WLs and puerperae has revealed some regularities. Women with MP are more frequently affected with extragenital infectious and non-infectious diseases, have disorders of intracardiac hemodynamics. Because of frequent occurrence of anomalous labour and postnatal period, pregnant women with MP should be referred to a group of obstetric and perinatal pathology risk. The results of current research urge the necessity of a comprehensive examination of pregnant women for MP. They should be placed under early special observation, adequately treated or get advice on whether the pregnancy should be continued.",

Metodo: Participaron 20 hombres con vasectomia. El estudio se realizo en la Ciudad de Mexico. Se empleo la entrevista cualitativa semiestructurada Resultados: Los deseos sexuales que los hombres buscaron alcanzar con la vasectomia fueron: poder satisfacer y disfrutar de su sexualidad, variar sus practicas y parejas sexuales e incrementar la frecuencia de relaciones sexuales pero sin reproduccion. Las quejas por las que optaron por la vasectomia fueron: tener que negociar con las mujeres para tener relaciones sexuales, que las relaciones sexuales sean poco frecuentes, rechazo por parte de la pareja por la eyaculacion (precoz o tardia), tener control escaso de la eyaculacion o frustracion por no eyacular, incompatibilidad sexual con la pareja y demora del orgasmo femenino, dificultad en mantener la ereccion peneana para la adaptacion al deseo sexual de la pareja; y tener que usar condon. Conclusiones: Para las expectativas de los hombres la vasectomia es una opcion anticonceptiva que les permitira aumentar la calidad de su vida sexual, logrando asi algunos deseos sexuales, resolver algunas quejas sexuales y mejorar la relacion de pareja.",

The strengths are in the identification of preovulatory infertility, and the peak which indicates ovulatory fertility and postovulatory fertility. Cervical mucus identification, which is described, is a secure method of insuring the effectiveness of the Billings Ovulation Methods when fertility returns during or after breast feeding and delayed ovulation due to stress. Charting should begin immediately regardless of whether one is breast feeding or not. Daily records provide information on the sensation of the vulva and the appearance of the mucus: a green stamp for a dry vulva and no mucus; a yellow stamp for slight, cloudy discharge that remains the same and dry vulva; a white baby stamp for a wet vulva and fluid mucus; an X for peak fertility or ovulation on the last day of fluid mucus to a change for 3 days of thick sticky mucus; and a red stamp for menstruation which begins 11-22 days after the peak. The basic infertile period is characterized by either no mucus or vulval dryness or an unchanging discharge at the vulva which accompanies a low unchanging estrogen level, or a combination of the preceding 2 conditions. Except for the first case of vulva dryness, the patterns of discharge originate in the vagina. Possible fertility is signified by rising estrogen levels which cause a cervical response. Changing levels of estrogen also produce endometrial responses of breakthrough or withdrawal bleeding. Fertility continues until menopause.",

Menopause is seen as the end of female menstruation and marks the end of a woman's ability to conceive children. While menopause itself is a normal life stage that does not cause health problems, the menopausal transition is marked by some physical, emotional and psychological symptoms caused mainly by hormonal imbalance. The causes, types and transitional phases of menopause were discussed.  It was noticed that menopause negatively affects the overall sexuality in the menopausal woman in that her sexual drive, desire, arousal and sexual activity declines. Dryness and thinning of the vagina which makes  penetration during sex painful was seen as a problem during this period.  It was also noted that some women pass this change in life without much stress while some encounter all  symptoms  and conditions. The overall conditions of the menopausal woman is challenging and therefore implicated for  Counselling.Some counselling interventions were outlined for helping women yet to reach menopause and the menopausal woman in particular get proper information about menopause, get adjusted and help herself during this period of change in life .Finally, it was concluded that  Counselling services are a  sine quo non   for the proper adjustment of  women who are yet to reach menopause, menopausal women, their husbands and entire family during this trying stage of life.

      "abstract": "Most women discover that they are infertile in a gradual manner after many failed attempts at conception. By contrast, most women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) uncover their infertility as part of an evaluation of other presenting complaints, frequently before attempts at conception have even been contemplated. The most common words women use to describe how they feel in the hours after getting the diagnosis of POI are \"devastated,\" \"shocked,\" and \"confused.\" Clearly, the news propels some patients onto a difficult journey. POI is a serious and incurable chronic disease. The diagnosis is more than infertility and affects a woman's physical and emotional well-being. Management of the condition must address both. Patients face the acute shock of the diagnosis, associated stigma of infertility, grief from the death of dreams, anxiety from the disruption of life plans, confusion around the cause, symptoms of estrogen deficiency, worry over the associated potential medical sequelae such as reduced bone density and cardiovascular risk, and the uncertain future that all of these factors create. There is a need for an evidenced-based integrated program to assist women with POI in navigating the transition to acceptance of the diagnosis, ongoing management of the condition, and ongoing maintenance of wellness in the presence of the disorder. A health-centered approach can gradually replace the disease-centered approach and put patients in partnerships with professional health-care providers. Ideally, the journey transitions each patient from seeing herself as a victim, to a survivor, to a woman who is thriving.",

These symptoms are commonly caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and additional risk factors include obesity, diabetes, hypercholesteremia and hypertension. In order to understand the pathological changes that occur in the lower male genitourinary (GU) tract, it is important to review the normal anatomy, physiology, vascular and neural control of the bladder, prostate and penis. Significant alterations in the male GU tract with aging manifest as impairments in physiological functions such as blood flow, neuropathy, fibrosis, and hypertrophy. Prostate enlargement (BPH) with bladder outlet obstruction due to dynamic and statics factors such as smooth muscle cell hyperplasia impair bladder emptying and promote dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent and results from loss of compliance of the penile sinusoids associated with increased deposition of collagen, decreased elastic fibers, endothelial dysfunction, and neuropathy. Additionally, aging and cardiovascular disease can impair the structure and function of the internal pudendal arteries which supply blood to the penis during an erection. Understanding the changes in anatomy, the symptoms associated with impaired lower GU function and disease‐specific therapies for these conditions will no doubt improve the care and quality of life for our aging male population.",

Case Report: A five years old girl was observed because of vaginal bleeding. Personal and family history was unremarkable. Physical examination confi rmed uterine haemorrhage and bilateral breast development. Pelvic ultrasound examination demonstrated a 30mm right ovarian cyst. Laboratory fi ndings, including thyroid function, were normal, excepting elevated oestrogen levels. GnRH stimulation test showed prepubertal response. There was no advanced bone age nor accelerated height velocity. She was regularly monitored at paediatric endocrinology consultation, without recurrent menorrhagia, there was regression of thelarche, associated with involution of the ovarian cyst. Discussion/Conclusion: Most autonomous ovarian cysts regress spontaneously with regression of pubertal signs, as in the present case. Therapy with a GnRH agonist may become necessary in the case of transformation from precocious pseudopuberty to central precocious puberty after recurrences of the ovarian cysts or when there is significant loss of height potential.",

      "title": "Factors associated with persistent pain after childbirth: a narrative review",
      "abstract": "A systematic literature search was performed to identify studies that reported risk factors for persistent pain after childbirth. Many studies have sought to identify risk factors for post-delivery pain in different populations, using different methodologies and different outcome variables. Studies of several different but interrelated post-partum pain syndromes have been conducted. Factors strongly and specifically associated with persistent incisional scar pain after Caesarean delivery include a coexisting persistent pain problem in another part of the body and severe acute postoperative pain. For persistent vaginal and perineal pain, operative vaginal delivery and the magnitude of perineal trauma have been consistently linked. History of pregnancy-related and pre-pregnancy back pain and heavier body weight are robust risk factors for persistent back pain after pregnancy. Unfortunately, limitations, particularly small samples and lack of a priori sample size calculation designed to detect specific effect sizes for risk of persistent pain outcomes, preclude definitive conclusions about many other predictors and the strength of outcome associations. In future studies, assessments of specific phenotypes using a rigorous analysis with appropriate predetermined sample sizes and validated instruments are needed to allow elucidation of stronger and reliable associations. Interventional studies targeting the most robustly associated, modifiable risk factors, such as acute post-partum pain, may lead to solutions for the prevention and treatment of these common problems that impact a large population.",

      "abstract": "O climatério é uma fase natural na vida das mulheres que inclui a menopausa, caracterizada pela cessação permanente das menstruações após um ano consecutivo sem menstruar, seguido por diversas alterações hormonais. Os diversos sintomas vivenciados durante este período podem surgir em vários níveis de intensidade e impactar diretamente a qualidade de vida dessas mulheres. Este trabalho objetivou identificar e avaliar a prevalência e severidade dos principais sintomas ao longo das diversas fases do climatério/menopausa. Os dados foram extraídos de artigos presentes nas bases de dados Medline, Pubmed, Lilacs, Scielo e Google Acadêmico, sendo selecionados 19 artigos entre 2014 e 2024. Foi possível concluir que os sintomas mais característicos desse período são: alterações no ciclo e fluxo menstrual até a menopausa, fogachos, sudorese, calafrios, cefaleia, insônia, fadiga, dificuldade de concentração e memória, irritabilidade, ressecamento e atrofia vaginal, diminuição da libido, baixa autoestima, ganho de peso e humor depressivo. Esses sintomas surgem dos 40 até os 62 anos de idade. Observou-se alta severidade e prevalência de falta de ar, suores, calores e ansiedade. Dessa forma, se faz necessário a capacitação de profissionais de saúde para atender e orientar a mulher climatérica e menopausada, promovendo qualidade de vida durante esse período.",

      "title": "Dysmenorrhea",
      "abstract": "Pain during the menstrual period is of two types: primary, in which the pelvic organs are normal and secondary, in which pathologic lesions are found on pelvic examination or laparoscopic examination of the pelvic organs. Since the incidence varies between 31-92% of the population it has serious implications for our society. It is important to distinguish dysmenorrhea from the premenstrual tension syndrome. Currently primary dysmenorrhea is thought to be due to increased contractility of the myometrium or decreased uterine blood flow from the excessive contractions or increased sensitization of pain fibers to mechanical and chemical stimuli. These three mechanisms of pain production are due to the release of certain prostaglandins from the endometrium during menses which then go directly into the myometrium producing these effects. Situational or psychological factors may accentuate or decrease the pain. Treatment is with antiprostoglandin drugs. There are several causes of secondary dysmenorrhea both congenital and acquired. Laparoscopy is frequently needed along with D&C to make the diagnosis. After diagnosis is made appropriate treatment can be undertaken to relieve the pain.",

      "title": "[Influence of contraception on psychology and sexual life].",
      "abstract": "This essay on the effects of modern effective contraception on psychological and sexual behavior concentrates on the characteristis of French society. Contraception is obviously a weapon against multiple illegal abortons, and a means for professional, social and sexual liberation of women. For physicians it provides a medium of interacting for the first time with the sexual life of patients, sometimes resulting in spectacular cures of psychosomatic disorders such as pelvic pain, menometrorrhagia, depression and anxiety. The opportunity for more frequent sexual relations, free of fear of pregnancy, may permit the release of orgasm and an experience of new sensation, authenticity and confidence for the woman. But contraception may also reveal or aggravate sexual dysfunction and participate in the deterioration of sexual adjustment. The physician must be aware of patients' prior psychosexual situation in order not to make contraception a scapegoat for so-called pill or IUD side effects. This requires sound medical training and a good doctor-patient relationship. For many young women maternity is the sign of womanhood, and for mature women and their partners, fertility is the essence of feminine attraction. This unconscious belief is often the basis for forgetting pills, frigidity, impotence and masochistic pregnancy. Children are unconsciously the bridge toward immortality.",

      "title": "THE CYCLIC CHANGES IN THE MAMMARY GLAND UNDER NORMAL AND PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS",
      "abstract": "1. A definite cycle exists in the mammary gland of the non-pregnant guinea pig which corresponds to the cycle in the ovary and uterus. This cycle can be presented through a curve in which the ordinates represent the degree of activity of the gland in a series of animals, and the abscissæ the time since ovulation (period of sexual cycle). The curve passes through a first maximum at the time of heat and ovulation and gradually falls. The minimum is reached on the 6th day and continues until the 15th day after ovulation. Next begins the period when a new ovulation is imminent and the number of the proliferating glands again increases. We see. then that during the normal cycle the presence of well preserved, functioning corpora lutea does not lead to proliferation, neither do mature follicles have such an effect. On the other hand, the absence or degeneration of the corpora lutea is required to insure the proliferation of the mammary gland in the first period of the sexual cycle. If the sexual period is experimentally prolonged, we find in some instances proliferation, while in others it is absent. As far as we can determine at the present time, two factors seem to favor proliferation of the mammary gland under these conditions: (1) the presence of well preserved corpora lutea, particularly if they are associated with well preserved experimentally produced deciduornata, and (2) the imminence of a new period of heat. The connection between good corpora lutea and good deciduornata and the presence of proliferating mammary glands at this stage of the sexual cycle is, however, not absolute. There are cases in which a proliferating gland is associated with some degeneration of the corpus luteum. Or on the other hand a well preserved corpus luteum is associated with a non-proliferating gland. In some of the latter cases the simultaneous presence of a necrotic deciduorna may perhaps explain the lack of proliferation in the mammary gland. However, in the majority of cases we found the presence of good corpora lutea and good deciduomata associated with a proliferating mammary gland. Whether a living corpus luteum as such is able to produce proliferation of the gland is as yet doubtful. 2. Extirpation of the ovaries prevents not only the proliferation of the mammary gland associated with the first stage of the sexual cycle, the condition of heat and ovulation no longer taking place in castrated animals, but in all probability also inhibits the proliferation of the mammary gland which occurs under certain conditions towards the end of the sexual cycle, or in instances of experimentally prolonged sexual cycle in which well preserved corpora lutea and deciduornata are present. 3. In animals in which the ovaries were hypotypical, the mammary glands were in an inactive condition. The presence of hypotypical ovaries has the same influence on the mammary gland as castration. In the majority, but not in all of these cases well preserved corpora lutea were absent. 4. Complete extirpation of the corpora lutea seems directly or indirectly to prevent the secondary proliferation of the mammary gland, which occurs during the latter part of the sexual cycle or during an experimentally prolonged cycle, in cases in which the extirpation is not followed at once by a new ovulation. This conclusion we consider, however, merely as suggested, not yet as definitely established through our results. On the other hand, the primary proliferation of the mammary gland, during the first stage of the sexual cycle, as well as ovulation and the objective signs of heat, is accelerated through complete extirpation of the corpora lutea. Thus the effect of extirpation of the corpora lutea differs from the effect of castration, in that after the latter neither a new heat nor the primary proliferation of the mammary gland occurs. As one of the authors has pointed out previously, the absence of functioning corpora lutea and the presence of either well developed ovarian follicles or of mature follicles are necessary for the occurrence of heat and ovulation. The same conditions are prerequisites for the primary proliferation of the mammary gland. 5. In cases in which the whole or almost the whole uterus had been extirpated, the corpora lutea were well preserved and the mammary gland was proliferating.",

      "abstract": "Systemic rheumatic diseases commonly affect women during the childbearing years. Many women with these diseases may be contemplating pregnancy or discover an inadvertent pregnancy, leading to concerns regarding medication use, changes in disease activity during pregnancy, safety of lactation, and future ability to care for a child given the presence of chronic illnesses. There are outstanding reviews that summarize the safety and use of immunosuppressive medications during pregnancy. However, in addition to medication use, providers need to be aware of the available data regarding fertility, pregnancy outcomes, delivery, and lactation issues that may be specific to individual diseases. Optimally, women should plan pregnancies to occur around times of disease quiescence, several months after potentially teratogenic medications have been discontinued. The course of the underlying rheumatic disease during pregnancy is variable, and there are no specific clinical or laboratory variables that consistently predict disease improvement or worsening during pregnancy. Recent data suggest that increased disease activity in women with most autoimmune diseases during pregnancy may lead to increased risk of premature delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Arthritis involving the cervical spine and hips may impact delivery and must be considered by both obstetricians and obstetric anesthesiologists. Data are mixed regarding the impact of breastfeeding on underlying autoimmune diseases; the choice to continue breastfeeding is a personal decision.",

      "title": "Clinical management of vaginal bleeding in postmenopausal women",
      "abstract": "Menopause is characterized by permanent cessation of menstrual periods and is clinically diagnosed after 12 months of complete amenorrhea. It occurs at a median age of 51 years alongside the physiological process of aging, although it can happen at an earlier age for other medical conditions or after surgery (surgical menopause). Due to reduced circulating estrogens and progesterone, the reproductive organs undergo progressive atrophy. This physiologic process of aging is also present at an endometrial level; without the cyclic hormonal actions of the menstrual cycle, the endometrium during menopause becomes atrophic. Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) is a common gynecologic complaint encountered by the clinician. Endometrial cancer is present in about 10% of patients with PMB. Nevertheless, many other conditions, such as endometrial or cervical polyps, genital atrophy, or non-gynecologic conditions, may also be present. Historically, dilation and curettage (D&C) was the main diagnostic procedure in patients with PMB; however, newer methods of investigation have replaced D&C. The aim of this review is to present an up-to-date analysis of the current evidence for the clinical management of vaginal bleeding in postmenopausal women.",

Basic assessment includes investigations such as urine testing, bladder residual volume measurement, and a bladder diary. Urodynamic testing is not required in all patients or before initiating conservative treatment. Indications for specialist referral and urodynamic testing are discussed.",

      "title": "ACOG Committee Opinion No. 776 Summary: Immune Modulating Therapies in Pregnancy and Lactation",
      "abstract": "Because autoimmune conditions occur more often among women of childbearing age, continuation of these medications during pregnancy is often considered to optimize disease management in the woman and pregnancy outcomes, without placing the fetus at undue risk. Many commonly prescribed drugs can be used safely during pregnancy, without risk of teratogenicity or pregnancy complications, whereas a few are strictly contraindicated. The decision to use any agent during pregnancy should be based on the clinical context, risks associated with individual medications, and gestational age. For immunomodulators considered appropriate to use during pregnancy, the common clinical practice of stopping use at approximately 32 weeks of gestation because of theoretic concerns regarding the immune system of the fetus is not supported by currently available data. Low-risk medications typically are continued in pregnancy, or initiated during pregnancy as needed, because the benefits of therapy and disease control far outweigh any theoretic risks associated with the medication. Use or initiation of medications with intermediate risk or little or no data during pregnancy or lactation (or both) should be individualized. High-risk medications are typically not continued or initiated in pregnancy. However, it is critical that counseling occur, ideally in the prepregnancy and interpregnancy periods, to review the individual risks and benefits as they relate to disease management and pregnancy-associated risks with high-risk medication. There may be select circumstances when continued treatment is the safest option. In general, immunomodulating drugs that are not contraindicated in pregnancy are compatible with breastfeeding.",

The present case is the first to our knowledge to report post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms immediately following defibulation, a procedure common in women with female genital mutilation/cutting type III.We present the case of a 31-year-old Sudanese nulliparous woman in the second trimester of pregnancy with female genital mutilation/cutting type IIIa who was referred for antepartum defibulation to facilitate a vaginal birth. Immediately after an uncomplicated surgery under local anesthesia and just before the first micturition, she developed post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms and suddenly recalled the traumatic experience of her first micturition after female genital mutilation/cutting when she was a child in Sudan. The woman was offered psychiatric follow-up with psychotherapy for 4 months and a short course of benzodiazepines. She had fully recovered by the time of delivery, 4 months after surgery.We discuss the possibility of recall of a past traumatic experience of female genital mutilation/cutting during defibulation or other genital surgeries. We review the benefits and risks of defibulation, the impact of this procedure, and the setting and timing in which it is performed, focusing on women's mental health and psychological support.",

      "title": "Management of Complications After Tension-Free Midurethral Slings",
      "abstract": "Since their introduction in 1996, tension-free midurethral slings (MUS) have been proven to have long-term efficacy and safety. They are considered the gold standard treatment of female stress urinary incontinence, especially in cases that are associated with urethral hypermobility. However, they are not free of complications and, although rare, some of these complications can be challenging for both patients and physicians. Some complications occur intraoperatively, whereas others appear in the early or late postoperative period. There is less controversy in the diagnosis and treatment of complications such as vaginal extrusion or urinary system erosion, whereas de novo voiding problems are at best not completely understood. Voiding dysfunction after MUS placement may vary in a wide range from urinary frequency or urgency to retention and is usually attributed to the obstructive or irritative effect of the sling. However, present urodynamic criteria for the diagnosis of female infravesical obstruction are not satisfactory, and the best management policy for de novo voiding dysfunction remains controversial. In the majority of cases, the diagnosis of obstruction leading to a urethral release surgery depends on a combination of several clinical findings. The timing of urethral release surgery varies depending on the preferences of the surgeon, and the outcome of this surgery is not always predictable. The purpose of this review was to assess the diagnosis and management of the immediate, short-term, and long-term complications of MUS in light of the current literature in an attempt to determine the best management policy.",

      "title": "Urodynamic Evaluation of Lower Urinary Tract Function in Relation to Total Hysterectomy",
      "abstract": "EDITORIAL COMMENTS: The lower urinary and genital tracts are closely associated both anatomically and functionally. It is not surprising therefore that many gynaecological conditions, such as pregnancy, pelvic tumours (ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids) and genital prolapse may cause urinary symptoms. Pelvic surgery can also predispose to urinary tract dysfunction by anatomical distortion of the lower urinary tract, disruption of its nerve or vascular supply, or by less obvious means such as alteration of the woman's hormonal status or mental well‐being. It is my clinical impression that simple hysterectomy without vaginal repair or ovarian ablation is an uncommon cause of urinary incontinence or voiding dysfunction. Clinical impressions are notoriously unreliable so the truth will only be established by carefully controlled prospective trials. This study does show that urinary symptoms are common both before and after hysterectomy and emphasizes the importance of taking a careful urological history in all women with gynaecological symptoms and giving appropriate counselling prior to any pelvic surgery. Hysterectomy is such a common operation that any causal relationship with bladder disorder is an important consideration. I find it difficult to believe that a total abdominal hysterectomy could cause significant permanent stress incontinence of urine. The paper reported here will interest readers but is not the last word on the subject and is not, by itself, sufficient to incriminate abdominal hysterectomy as a cause of urinary problems. After accepting this paper for publication we were relieved to read another prospective study: The Effect of Total Abdominal Hysterectomy on Bladder Function in Asymptomatic Women. Longer R, Neuman M, Ron‐El R et al, Obstet Gynecol 1989; 74: 205–207. This paper studied 16 patients, all who lacked urinary symptoms preoperatively, who had cystometry and uroflometry performed preoperatively, at 4 weeks and again 4 months postoperatively. This study reported ‘no clinical symptoms of frequency, nocturia, urgency, or urge or stress incontinence postoperatively. There were no significant differences from the preoperative values for cystometry, uroflometry and urethral pressure profiles.’ However this is not the end of the story since Taylor et al have recently found a ‘highly significant association between persistently reduced bowel frequency and persistently increased urinary frequency after hysterectomy’ (Effect of hysterectomy on bowel function. Br Med J 1989; 299: 300–301). Summary: Although many women relate the onset of urinary symptoms to the operation of simple hysterectomy, many also have symptoms prior to surgery. Prospective study is therefore the most valid method of objective analysis of the effects of this operation upon micturition. To determine whether total hysterectomy is associated with increased postoperative vesicourethral abnormality, the incidences of urinary symptoms and urodynamic abnormality were assessed pre and postoperatively in 36 women undergoing hysterectomy. Preoperative symptoms were present in 58.3%, although urodynamically proven dysfunction was found in only 38.9%. After hysterectomy, 75% of women were symptomatic with a further 30.6% developing a urodynamic abnormality. The operation of total (simple) hysterectomy is associated with a significant increase in the subjective and objective incidence of vesicourethral dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Objective: To determine the effects of delivery on bladder and anorectal functions. Methods: One hundred forty-nine nulliparas were studied once during pregnancy and again about 9 weeks after delivery by means of questionnaire, clinical examination, perineal sonography, urethral pressure profiles, and recording of intravaginal and intra-anal pressures during pelvic-floor contraction. Results: Stress urinary incontinence was present in 46 patients (31%) during pregnancy and persisted in ten of them after delivery. After vaginal delivery, urinary and fecal incontinence were present in 36% and 4% of forceps-delivered women, respectively, and in 21% and 5.5% of spontaneously delivered women. Bladder neck mobility was increased significantly after all vaginal births, whereas bladder neck position at rest was lowered only in forceps-delivered women. Functional urethral length was decreased in the supine and standing positions after spontaneous and forceps deliveries. Otherwise, indices of urethral sphincter function were unchanged or improved after vaginal delivery. A significant decrease in intravaginal pressure and in intra-anal pressure was observed in all vaginally delivered women. The intra-anal pressure decrease correlated significantly with infant weight (r = 0.24, P = .01). Women who underwent cesarean had no specific complaints and only slight modifications of these measurements. Conclusion: After spontaneous and instrumental deliveries, 21% and 34% of women complained of stress urinary incontinence and 5.5% and 4% reported fecal incontinence, respectively. Substantial bladder neck hypermobility was present together with diminished functional urethral length and intravaginal and intra-anal pressures. Only 22% of patients with stress urinary incontinence during pregnancy had such incontinence after delivery.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The prenatal diagnosis of a fetal abdominal cyst raises the following possibilities: mesenteric cysts, obstructive uropathy with dilated ureter, intestinal duplication and ovarian cysts when the fetus is female. Ovarian cysts have been described in association with diabetes mellitus, alloimmunization and fetal hypothyroidism, but the etiology is often unknown. In normal pregnancies, the development of ovarian cysts has been attributed to hormonal stimuli due to immaturity of the neuro–endocrine axis. A possible mechanism involves gonadotropin elevation that stimulates fetal foliculogenesis and the development of cysts. Management is usually expectant since most cysts resolve spontaneously after birth. However, complications such as rupture or torsion of the cyst can lead to destruction of this organ. Drainage is indicated when the diameter is greater than 5 cm or there signs suggestive of internal hemorrhage, such as internal septa or echogenic debris. N.M.F., a 31‐year‐old, first pregnancy, had an ultrasound scan at 22‐weeks which showed no fetal abnormalities. At 30 weeks, repeat scan showed an abdominal cyst between the bladder and the right kidney measuring 4.3 cm × 4.2 cm × 3.8 cm in a female fetus. Two weeks later, it became larger (6.3 cm × 5.5 cm × 5.4 cm) and drainage was performed with aspiration of 50 mL of sero‐sanguineous fluid. Progesterone levels in the aspirated fluid were 17 000 ng/dL and estrogen levels, 1350 ng/dL; these findings confirmed the hypothesis that it was an ovarian cyst. This case highlights the need to perform follow up scans when a fetal abdominal cyst is diagnosed and the importance of intrauterine drainage as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool to preserve ovarian function.",

Equally, young women may temporarily present this clinical problem while receiving various pharmacological or endocrine treatments or radiotherapy.Aim To determine clinical and diagnostic exams required to confirm the presence of VVA (also referred to as atrophic vaginitis, urogenital atrophy, or genitourinary syndrome of menopause) and rule out other genital or pelvic clinical conditions.Materials and methods Literature review searches were carried out on the main scientific article search engines (PubMed, SciELO, Cochrane) using different clinical terms, treatments or interventions and comorbidity related to VVA.Results The development and severity of VVA depend mainly on the duration of hypoestrogenism. Hypoestrogenism causes changes in the urogenital tissue, generating signs and symptoms, such as dryness, burning, soreness, itching, and irritation of the genital skin. The diagnosis can be made through anamnesis (patient history), questionnaires, physical exam, and, sometimes, complementary exams. Objective vaginal assessment is essential and can be completed with the Vaginal Health Index, the Vaginal Maturation Index, or vaginal pH in the absence of infection or semen. The exclusion of other vulvovaginal organic pathology is essential to reach an accurate diagnosis and provide adequate treatment.Conclusions The specialist should be able to identify VVA, rule out other pathologies that make a differential diagnosis and conduct proper management.",

      "title": "Transperineal ultrasound assessment of the anal sphincter after obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI)",
      "abstract": "Obstetric anal sphincter injury (OASI) is the most common cause of anal incontinence and anorectal symptoms in women1. Reported rates of anal incontinence following primary repair of OASI range between 15% and 61%, with a mean rate of 39%2, 3. Other possible complications of OASI include perineal pain, dyspareunia and, less commonly, abscess formation, wound breakdown and rectovaginal fistulae. Symptom onset may occur immediately after delivery, several years postpartum or only late in life, when aging of tissues adds to the delivery insult. Having sustained an OASI may impact significantly on a woman's physical and emotional health. Missed OASI, inadequate repair or lack of follow-up are potential sources of litigation4. The reported incidence of OASI may be as high as 4–6.6%4, averaging 2.9% in the UK3. The incidence is higher in primiparae (6.1%) than it is in multiparae (1.7%)3. In recent years, we have seen an increase in awareness and structured training programs, which have apparently resulted in an increase in the detection rate of OASI3. The following risk factors have been identified, with various risk rates reported3: Asian ethnicity (odds ratio (OR), 2.27; 95% CI, 2.14–2.41), primiparity (relative risk (RR), 6.97; 95% CI, 5.40–8.99), birth weight > 4 kg (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 2.18–2.36), shoulder dystocia (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.72–2.08), occipitoposterior position (RR, 2.44; 95% CI, 2.07–2.89), prolonged second stage of labor (RR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.62–2.51, after 4-h duration). Instrumental delivery and the use of episiotomy have been studied extensively, resulting in the following evidence5: the OR for OASI during vacuum delivery without episiotomy is 1.89 (95% CI, 1.74–2.05); vacuum delivery with episiotomy is protective (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.51–0.63), while forceps delivery without episiotomy carries the highest potential risk (OR, 6.53; 95% CI, 5.57–7.64); and the OR for forceps delivery with episiotomy is 1.34 (95% CI, 1.21–1.49). Other potential risk factors, such as advanced maternal age at first birth, vaginal birth after Cesarean delivery and type of obstetric care provider, have been suggested with various levels of evidence4. Possible protective factors include obesity, perineal massage (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86–0.96)6, perineal protection at crowning3, warm compression during the second stage of labor (RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.28–0.84)3, mediolateral episiotomy in instrumental delivery5, a wide angle of the mediolateral episiotomy (at least 60° away from the midline when the perineum is distended)7 and prelabor Cesarean section4. However, clinicians and patients alike should be aware that knowledge of a patient's risk factors does not necessarily allow accurate prediction of OASI3. OASI is usually diagnosed in the period immediately postpartum. The classification is based on the extent of lacerations to the external and internal anal sphincters (EAS and IAS, respectively) and epithelium, as defined by Sultan and coworkers (Figure 1) and adopted by the World Health Organization2, 3, 8. The degree of damage impacts on the development of symptoms, with 3C and 4th-degree tears carrying a graver prognosis than do 3A and 3B tears9. It is not unusual for a tear to be missed in the labor ward: the reported rates of missed OASI range from 26% to 87%10. Since all women having a vaginal delivery are at risk of sustaining OASI, prior to suturing they should be examined systematically, including a digital rectal examination, to assess the severity of damage3. Overall, outcomes following OASI are not encouraging; adequate intra- and postpartum management is important both in order to prevent symptoms and to counsel women regarding a subsequent delivery. There are published guidelines which discuss this extensively (including a Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Green-top guideline3 and a Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada practice bulletin4). Pelvic floor physiotherapy can manage anal incontinence successfully3. Management and counseling, preferably in dedicated perineal clinics that provide a combination of perineal examination, anal manometry and ultrasound evaluation of the anal sphincter, can aid decision-making regarding future delivery3, 4. It is widely accepted that women who have sustained an OASI in a previous pregnancy and who are symptomatic or have abnormal endoanal ultrasonography (EAUS) and/or manometry should be counseled regarding the option of elective Cesarean delivery3. The available imaging modalities include EAUS2, transvaginal ultrasound11 and transperineal/translabial ultrasound (TPUS)12-14, with or without three-dimensional (3D) imaging. EAUS is still considered the modality of choice and is also used widely by gastroenterologists and colorectal surgeons. TPUS has emerged within the last decade or so, arising originally as a result of the wide availability of new high-resolution wide-sector probes and volume imaging commonly used in obstetric ultrasound practice. There have been only a few studies comparing these modalities and current understanding is that TPUS is at least as good as EAUS15. TPUS evaluation of OASI shows characteristic signs which correlate well with the clinical complaints of incontinence12, 13. Advantages of this modality include its wide applicability and acceptability by patients because of its painless and non-intrusive nature. Unlike EAUS, in TPUS, using either a transvaginal or a transabdominal probe, there is no distortion of the anal canal by the transducer during the examination, and evaluation of the anal sphincter and mucosa is possible in the resting position. The advanced ultrasound systems available in both tertiary and primary care facilities support the establishment of dedicated one-stop clinics administered by a combination of gynecologists, perinatologists, urogynecologists, sonographers and physiotherapists4. The aim of this Opinion is to describe the methodology for TPUS assessment of the anal sphincter in women who have sustained an OASI. A two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound examination may be performed with any machine of good resolution. 3D examination has the advantage of allowing extensive evaluation of the anal sphincters along their entire length and width, thus improving standardization of measurements and facilitating examination. 3D TPUS is performed with a 3D transabdominal or transvaginal probe developed for obstetric imaging (e.g. RAB 8–4-MHz or 5–9-MHz 3D transvaginal probe, GE Healthcare Ultrasound, Milwaukee, WI, USA; AVV 531, Hitachi Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan; V 8-4, Philips Ultrasound, Bothell, WA, USA; 3D 4–7 EK, Medison, Seoul, South Korea). We have employed Voluson ultrasound systems in recent years (Voluson 730 Expert, E8, E6 and E10, GE Healthcare Ultrasound). The transabdominal transducers combine an electronic curved-array RAB 4–8 MHz with mechanical sector technology, which allows a fast sweep of at least 70° through the field of view. 3D and 4D ultrasound imaging allow real-time acquisition of volume ultrasound data comprising successive planes acquired during the sweep. The data can be stored for offline analysis and post-processing with the help of dedicated software (e.g. 4D View, GE Healthcare Ultrasound). It can be displayed in orthogonal planes or rendered volumes. Assessment of the longitudinal (sagittal) plane may aid in location and evaluation of the area of rupture, which may be more cephalad to the anus and not amenable to diagnosis by standard clinical examination ('button-hole tear'2). A transvaginal probe, such as the 5–9-MHz 3D probe, placed in the area of the fourchette, may also be effective for examination of the anorectum by the transperineal approach. The area is scanned in the transverse and sagittal planes. When the probe is placed appropriately in the midsagittal plane, the anorectum can be visualized fully. Additionally, we find that, with just a little pressure exerted on the probe, the entire sphincter can be visualized, including the distal part. Transvaginal and transabdominal probes each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Their use is dependent on operator preference, and they are rarely used interchangeably. The transvaginal probe is characterized by better resolution and high-quality imaging, but the drawback is decreased visualization at the 12 o'clock position. The transabdominal probe allows better visualization at the 12 o'clock position and a thorough examination of the pelvic floor is possible simply by tilting the transducer. Using a transvaginal probe requires increased pressure on the fourchette in order to prevent the probe from sliding backwards and may cause discomfort or pain. The transducer can be covered with a glove, condom or thin plastic wrap to maintain asepsis. Powdered gloves create reverberations that impact on image quality and should be avoided. Mechanical cleaning and alcoholic wipes should be used for disinfection. The patient is placed in the dorsal lithotomy position with hips flexed and slightly abducted. Pelvic tilt can be improved by bringing the patient's heels closer to her buttocks. She is asked to void before the examination but bowel emptying is not mandatory. If a transabdominal probe is used, a midsagittal view is obtained by placing the transducer on the perineum in the area of the fourchette and perineal body. The transducer axis is oriented in the midsagittal plane; the symphysis pubis, bladder neck and urethra, compressed vagina, distal part of the rectum with anorectal junction, and proximal part of the anal canal are seen. A transverse view is obtained by turning the transducer 90° counter-clockwise and tilting it backwards towards the anal sphincter. Similarly, if using a transvaginal probe, this is placed in the area of the fourchette and perineal body. The angle of acquisition differs from that of the transabdominal probe, but the operator can visualize the same structures. Maximum angle of acquisition and quality settings will provide the best volume for later offline analysis. Volume acquisition is performed in the transverse plane and volumes are saved and stored. When the probe is placed appropriately in the midsagittal plane, the anorectum is visualized fully, with the anal verge on one side of the screen and the anorectal angle on the other. The orientation can be in either direction as long as consistency is maintained. Rendering is initiated with the 2D transverse image plane positioned 1.5 cm from the distal margin of the anus, where the characteristic star shape of the anal mucosa can be visualized. During post-processing, the display is switched to show the multiplanar projection, in which the transverse plane of the anal sphincter complex should appear in panel A. The transverse plane can be adjusted along x-, y- and z-axes to obtain an image optimal for measurement. The correct plane has been obtained when the sphincter is visualized as in Figure 2a. The reference dot is placed in the middle of the anal mucosa. The EAS appears as a ring of hyperechogenicity surrounding the thin hypoechogenic ring of the IAS. The mucosal folds of the anal canal are visible as symmetric structures of mixed echogenicity creating a characteristic star shape radiating from the center. The transverse perinei muscles (superficial and deep) can be visualized superior/cephalad to the EAS in panel A. The zoom is set to 1.3–1.6. Panel B of the multiplanar image shows the longitudinal plane, which allows measurement of the length of the hyperechogenic EAS and the hypoechogenic IAS. The puborectalis muscle can be visualized as a U-shaped echogenic structure surrounding the EAS posteriorly, in the proximal part of the sphincter complex. The EAS and IAS widths can be measured in the transverse plane, 1.5 cm from the distal margin of the anus (Figure S1). Activating the tomographic ultrasound imaging (TUI) option will allow tomographic multislice imaging of the anal sphincter in the transverse plane (Figure 3). Nine slices should be displayed in a three-by-three matrix, with an interslice interval ideally of about 2 mm. This will suffice in most cases since the length of the EAS anteriorly rarely exceeds 3 cm. The TUI display is scrutinized for the presence of any sphincter defect. Although the minimum accepted requirements for diagnosis are the three central slices of the TUI image, in order to minimize false-positive or false-negative evaluations, it is imperative to examine all TUI slices. A defect in the EAS is suspected when discontinuity in the hyperechogenic ring is observed, whether it affects the whole EAS or only part of its thickness (Figures 4-8 and S2–S8). The size of the defect is measured by selecting a generic two-line angle from the menu and placing its vertex in the center of the anal mucosa (Figures 6, 7, S2 and S7). This can be done for both EAS and IAS, and reported as an angle measurement. A significant residual defect is defined as an EAS defect on ultrasound with ≥ 30° angle9. Four sonographic signs indicate damage to the anal sphincter following repair of OASI12, 13: discontinuity of the EAS and/or IAS; asymmetry in EAS and/or IAS widths, i.e. thickening of the IAS opposite the rupture site, with thinning or interruption in the area of repair, known as the 'half moon' sign (Figure 7); thickening of the EAS in the area of repair; and atypical rectal mucosal folds, these being considered abnormal if some deviation from the symmetrical star shape is observed. Sliding the region of interest to the left of the volume will depict the subcutaneous part of the sphincter. This part is distal to the IAS and therefore there should be no IAS in the image. In order to measure the defect correctly, the TUI image should include the subcutaneous part of the sphincter, which is generally considered to be the strongest part. In this TUI image, the first panel represents the midsagittal plane, followed by panels 2 and 3 which start at the subcutaneous part of the sphincter and continue towards the more proximal sphincter as the slices progress. Panel 9 will usually represent the upper part of the EAS where it terminates and merges with the levator ani. Corresponding images using a transvaginal probe can be seen in Figures 8 and S3–S6. Another severely damaged sphincter can be visualized in Figure S5 and a rectovaginal fistula is depicted in Figure S8. The following parameters may serve as a general guide but can of course be modified in each individual examination to optimize imaging: gray map 4, tint off/sepia according to preference, line filter low, persistence 4, enhancement 1, speckle reduction imaging at least 3, line density normal. The rendered view direction is set to 'up' without 3D tinting, but sepia is a good option as well. The image is optimized by combining the surface smooth and gradient light modes at an 80/20 mix with a low-threshold setting, transparency near 20 and dynamic contrast 8. The acquisition angle is set at 85°, with mid to high render quality. Further optimization can be achieved by using volume contrast imaging with a slice thickness of 2 mm and clear tinting. In selected cases, inversion mode can be used for evaluation of the IAS anatomy. Preferably, the analysis should be performed at least 10–12 weeks postpartum. This allows time for the initial edema to subside and enables a complete evaluation of the pelvic floor. Such an examination is not the subject of this article and will not be discussed further here. The report should include details of the examination technique and findings, such as extent of visualization of the anal canal, type of probe used, measurements of sphincter complex and extent of defect. It might, for example, read as follows: 'The anal canal was visualized in its entirety with transperineal 3D sonography, using a transabdominal probe. In the longitudinal section, the length of the EAS is 10 mm. In the transverse section there is a residual full-thickness defect of the EAS between 10 o'clock and 2 o'clock, corresponding to an angle of 120°, which can be visualized in all sections of the TUI (2-mm interslice interval). The IAS and mucosal folds appear normal. The measurements in the 12 o'clock position are as follows. EAS: not present; IAS: 2 mm; transverse perinei muscles: 5 mm'.

      "title": "Comparison of efficacy of Labetalol Versus Alpha Methyl Dopa in the management of Pre eclampsia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pre Eclampsia is a multi-system disorder of unknown etiology, unique to pregnancy characterized by occurrence of Gestational Hypertension along with proteinuria after the 20th week of pregnancy in a previously normotensive and non-protienuric patient. Gestational Hypertension is defined as Systolic blood pressure of 140 mm of Hg or more and Diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm of Hg or more on two occasions, measured at least 6 hours apart but within 7 days. Proteinuria is defined as excretion of 0.3 g or more of protein in a 24 hour urine sample or >1+ on dipstick in a random sample after excluding urinary tract infection. Pre Eclampsia complicates 2-8% of pregnancies. Pre Eclampsia can affect virtually every organ system in the body and is a major cause of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Pre Eclampsia, when not controlled or left untreated can lead to catastrophes like Eclampsia, Abruptio placenta, HELLP syndrome, fetal growth restriction, and intrauterine fetal death. Though the definitive treatment of Pre Eclampsia is termination of pregnancy, aggressive treatment is necessary to ameliorate the disease progression in order to carry on the pregnancy till adequate fetal maturity is obtained. Oral anti hypertensive drugs have a major role in the management of Pre Eclampsia. A comparison is made here between Labetalol and the commonly used drug Alpha methyl dopa in the management of Pre Eclampsia.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY: This study compares the efficacy of oral Labetalol versus oral Alpha methyl dopa in the management of Pre Eclampsia in terms of reducing the blood pressure, need for labour induction, mean birth weight, APGAR score and rate of neonatal admissions.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This randomized prospective comparative study was conducted at Institute of Social Obstetrics and Govt. Kasturba Gandhi Hospital for Women and Children, Triplicane, Chennai, on hundred patients, diagnosed as preeclampsia and admitted in the Eclampsia ward.\r\nStudy Design: Prospective case control study.\r\nDuration of Study: From September 2010 to August 2011.\r\nMETHODOLOGY: The patients included in this study were assigned to two groups at\r\nrandom of 50 patients in each group.\r\nGROUP 1: Tablet Alpha methyl dopa (Aldomet) 250 mg was given thrice daily.\r\nGROUP 2: Tablet Labetalol 100 mg was given twice daily.\r\nInclusion Criteria:\r\nAll patients with Gestational Hypertension (more than 20 weeks of gestation till term).\r\n• Systolic Blood Pressure of 140 mm of Hg or more.\r\n• Diastolic Blood Pressure of 90 mm of Hg or more.\r\n• Proteinuria ( 0.3 g in 24 hours or more/ 1+ dipstick or more).\r\nExclusion Criteria:\r\n• Chronic Hypertension.\r\n• Renal Disease.\r\n• Liver Disease.\r\n• Bronchial Asthma.\r\n• GDM.\r\n• Cardiac Disease.\r\n• Imminent symptoms :\r\n_ Headache.\r\n_ Blurring.\r\n_ Epigastric pain.\r\n_ Oliguria(<500 mg/24 hrs).\r\n• Complications –\r\n_ Acute LVF.\r\n_ Coagulation failure.\r\n_ Intracerebral Hemorrhage.\r\n_ HELLP Syndrome.\r\n• Eclampsia.\r\nSUMMARY: This is a study comparing the efficacy of oral Labetalol and Alpha methyl dopa in the management of preeclampsia, carried out in ISO KGH.\r\n• The time duration of the study was from September 2010 to August 2011.\r\n• 100 patients diagnosed as preeclampsia and admitted to ISO KGH were included in this study.\r\n• Inclusion criteria included those who came under the definition of preeclampsia.\r\n• Exclusion criteria included those who had pre-existing medical disorders, those who had features of imminent Eclampsia, Eclampsia and those who developed complications of preeclampsia like acute left ventricular failure and HELLP syndrome.\r\n• These 100 patients were assigned to two groups at random of 50 patients in each group. Group 1 was started on tablet Alpha methyl dopa 250 mg thrice daily and Group 2 was started on tablet Labetalol 100 mg twice daily. Blood Pressure and proteinuria was recorded every 12th hourly.\r\n• The treatment was continued till delivery if the blood pressure is controlled. If the blood pressure was not controlled within 48 hours, the dose of drugs was doubled.\r\n• The relationship of age, parity, gestational age and body mass index to prevalence of preeclampsia in both the groups has been analyzed. Also the fall in BP after 48 hrs, need to increase the dose of the drugs, need for labour induction, method of delivery, blood pressure at the time of delivery, birth weight, APGAR score and neonatal admissions in each group has been analyzed.\r\nCONCLUSION: This is a study comparing the efficacy of Labetalol and Alpha methyl dopa in the management of preeclampsia, in which 50 patients were\r\nstarted on oral Labetalol and 50 patients were started on oral Alpha methyl dopa.\r\n• Significant fall in the diastolic blood pressure after 48 hrs occurred only in the labetalol group (p = 0.007).\r\n• In the Alpha methyl dopa group, there was a significant need to increase the dose of the drug after 48 hrs (p = 0.043).\r\n• There appears to be no significant difference in the rate of induction between the two groups (p =0.585).\r\n• The mean birth weight was significantly higher (p = 0.00) in the labetalol group (3.11 kg) compared to the alpha methyl dopa group (2.67 kg).\r\n• There was no significant difference in the APGAR scores (p = 0.090) and rate of neonatal admissions (p =0.240) in both the groups.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Spontaneous preterm birth is the leading global cause of neonatal death, and countless efforts have failed to establish a single effective treatment for preterm labor. Labor dystocia is the major cause of primary cesarean delivery; however, its biological mechanisms during labor are poorly understood. When post-term pregnancy truly exists the cause is usually unknown. The objective of the study tries to identify the possible cause of these obstetric complications Design: Research Study Setting: Portiuncula University Hospital, Ireland Population: N/A Methods: This study investigated the current evidence-based literature that may support the hypothesis. Main Outcome Measures: N/A Results: Obstetric literature is replete with overwhelming evidence that malfunction of any exponential uterine wall tension (EUWT) component (stretch-dependent inhibitory system) terminates the pregnancy. Most of the current therapeutic preterm strategies are focused on preventing premature EUWT failure e.g. the cervical stitch. Progesterone treatment for preterm labor may be working by enhancing the stretch-dependent inhibitory system by modulating uterine wall plasticity and EUWT. Post-term pregnancy is due to the failure of the stimulatory system to transform the cervix into the lower uterine segment and to lose its resistance that terminating the pregnancy at full term. A combined malfunction of the two systems causes labor dystocia e.g rupture of fetal membranes with a long cervix. Conclusion: There is growing evidence to support the hypothesis that malfunction of the inhibitory system causes preterm labor, malfunction of the stimulatory system causes post-term pregnancy and labor dystocia is due to a combined malfunction of the two systems.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nThe pain of child birth is the most severe pain, most women will endure in their life time. All mothers who are on the verge of motherhood have one common fear. The fear is about acute labour pain during child birth.\r\nThe quantum of pain varies from one mother to another mother. Nulliparous women experiences more severe pain than the multiparous women.\r\nExperience of labour pain is complex and subjective. Labour is an emotional experience which involves both physiological and psychological mechanisms.\r\nLabour pain is ranked top in the pain rating scale when compared to other lifetime painful experiences.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\nTo study the fetomaternal outcome of epidural analgesia in labour in terms of duration of first stage and second stage of labour, mode of delivery, neonatal outcome in terms of apgar score.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nSTUDY DESIGN: Prospective case study.\r\nPLACE OF STUDY: Govt. Theni Medical College and Hospital, Theni.\r\nSTUDY POPULATION: Patient with singleton term pregnancy with cephalic presentation without any risk factors scheduled for normal vaginal delivery, when patient is in active labour (cervical dilatation > 3cm).\r\nSAMPLE SIZE: 100.\r\nINCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n◆ Age group 18 – 35 yrs.\r\n◆ Women with singleton pregnancy with cephalic presentation.\r\n◆ Term gestation.\r\n◆ Women is in active stage of labour with cervical dilation > 3 cm.\r\n◆ Women who are willing for epidural analgesia.\r\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\r\n◆ Multiple gestation.\r\n◆ Pre term pregnancy.\r\n◆ Antepartum hemorrhage.\r\n◆ Presence of medical complications(preeclampsia, diabetes, Neurological disorders.\r\n◆ Contraindication for epidural analgesia (Coagulopathy)\r\n◆ Allergy to local anaesthetics.\r\n◆ Patients refusal for epidural analgesia.\r\nMETHODS:\r\n◈ When patient is in active labour plan for epidural placement.\r\n◈ Written informed consent for epidural analgesia is obtained.\r\n◈ Progress of labour is monitored with partograph.\r\n◈ Uterine contractions are monitored and noted every 30 mins.\r\n◈ Fetal heart rate is monitored every 15 mins and by cardiotocograph every hour.\r\n◈ Duration of first and second stage of labour is noted.\r\n◈ Mode of delivery.\r\n◈ Apgar scores of new born at 1 min and 5 mins.\r\n◈ Presence of postpartum hemorrhage.\r\n◈ Patient satisfaction score.\r\n◈ Patient is followed up for 24 hours for any side effects.\r\nRESULTS:\r\n◆ This study includes 50 parturients who received epidural analgesia in group A and 50 parturients who did not receive epidural analgesia as group B.\r\n◆ Both the groups have similar demographic data and has no statistical difference.\r\n◆ The mean time for onset of analgesia is 12.42 and patients needed two to three top up doses.\r\n◆ The mean VAS score in epidural group is 1.6 and the patients had good to excellent pain relief and 90% of parturients expressed willingness for epidural analgesia in next pregnancy.\r\n◆ The mean duration of first stage of labour in epidural group is 222 min and in control it is 209 min.\r\n◆ The mean duration of second stage of labour in epidural group is 51 min and in control group is 46 min. The duration of labour in epidural group is not significantly prolonged and it is within the normal limits.\r\n◆ There is no significant difference in the duration of first and second stage of labour between two groups.\r\n◆ Epidural analgesia does not increase the caesarean rate.\r\n◆ The incidence of instrumental delivery in epidural group is 6% where as in control group is 2%.\r\n◆ There is no statistical difference in the incidence of instrumental delivery between the two groups.\r\n◆ There is no significant difference in fetal heart rate between the two groups.\r\n◆ Regarding complications 6% of patients in epidural group had vomiting while other patients had no complications with epidural analgesia.\r\n◆ None of them developed significant back pain or hypotension due to epidural analgesia.\r\n◆ One patient in control group had atonic PPH which is medically managed.\r\n◆ The mean APGAR score at 1 min and 5 min in epidural group is 7.7 and 8.7 respectively which is similar to the control group, hence epidural analgesia has no effect on the APGAR score, does not affect the fetus.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nThe inference of this study is that epidural analgesia provides significant pain relief with excellent patient satisfaction and it is a safe and effective technique with preservation of motor function.\r\nThere is increase in the time duration of both first and second stage of labour when compared to controls but well within the normal limits with no adverse maternal and fetal outcome. Epidural analgesia does not increase the incidence of instrumental and caesarean delivery.",

      "title": "Psihološki aspekti poroda",
      "abstract": "During pregnancy, the expectant mother experiences a wide range of psychological and physiological changes that enable her body to adapt to pregnancy, the growth and development of the child, prepare for birth and the birth itself, and nursing. This paper gives an overview of the psychological aspects of the birth, the most prominent of which is fear. Fear can cause spasms, which can prolong the birth, making it more painful, and it has been proven that fear can also result in a mental block, resulting in the need for emergency caesarean section. The birth process is known to include the essential birthing pain, as the pain the woman must endure, and additional pain, which arises out of fear. The reason for this is that during the birth, one of the muscle layers of the uterus is responsible for the opening during contractions, while another muscle layer is under the influence of the woman's mental and emotional condition. If the woman feels safe and calm, then these two muscle layers work in concert, towards greater opening. Such births pass quickly (due to wider opening) and more easily (due to less additional pain). However, when a woman is feeling threatened, in fear or panic, then these muscle layers counter one another. The result is one layer opening the uterus, while the layer under the influence of the woman's fear attempts to halt the birth and prevent opening.\r\n In order for the birth to be easier and with less pain, it is important for the expectant mother to properly prepare during the pregnancy. During the birth, it is important to stimulate all that gives the woman a feeling of security and trust and makes her more relaxed. This can be support from her partner, a close person, birth coach or midwife. A positive approach by the medical staff is essential, either through words of encouragement or, where possible, meeting the wants of the mother.\r\nIn recent years, new mothers are more frequently experiencing post-partum depression. The reasons may lie in traumatic events immediately before or during the birth, premature birth or very long birth, birth that ended in caesarean section, etc. In order to best prepare the expectant mother for the birth, attending birth classes either alone or with the partner, exercising during pregnancy, and social and psychological support during the birth are all beneficial.",

Management can be very problematic in girls with disability or medical disorders, as their condition and other medications may mean they are less likely to achieve satisfactory control with standard medical treatments. Those with disability tend to tolerate menses poorly. We report experience with the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG IUS) for treatment of menstrual problems in adolescents with a range of medical problems or with severe learning disability. It provided of significant therapeutic benefit for 12 of 14 participants, with the majority opting to continue for the 5-year duration of the device. The rates of expulsion, bleeding and amenorrhoea appear similar to those reported in older women, where contraception is the primary indication.",

      "title": "Climacteric: concept, consequence and care.",
      "abstract": "Climacteric is the period of life starting from the decline in ovarian activity until after the end of ovarian function. According to the definition, the period includes peri-menopause, menopause and post-menopause. Climacteric is considered to be a natural change of life which may be accompanied by various health consequences i.e., menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis, coronary heart disease, or Alzheimer's disease. The key concept is that women enter menopause with different menopausal status for instances, natural menopause, surgical menopause, early menopause or even premature ovarian failure. Women may experience various health consequences due to the difference in genetic and environmental interaction. The prevalence and incidence of menopausal problems vary according to ethnic groups. For instance, Asian women seem to have less problems after menopause than their occidental counterparts. Nevertheless, the problems do exist and seem to be increasing due to the longer life expectancy and lifestyle changes of people in the region. Clinical decision in menopausal therapy can be determined according to health risk stratification. Appropriated menopausal therapeutic strategies include medical and non-medical modalities. The non-medical modalities are mainly focussed on lifestyle modification, while the medical modalities are classified as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and non-HRT. Those in the high risk group will probably benefit most from medication besides lifestyle modification. There are various types, doses, routes and regimens of medication which need to be appropriately matched with the proper women's characteristics. Those who have contraindications to HRT or can not tolerate its side effects may choose other alternatives eg, selective estrogen receptor modulators, bisphosphonates, calcitonin or calcium and vitamin D. The success of menopausal therapy is to give an appropriate therapeutic option to the right woman. The future direction of research will remain focussing on the development in diagnosis and menopausal therapy particularly the main three areas of health promotion, disease prevention and treatment. The trend of research and development will probably be concentrated on new pharmaceutical agents with more specific action and high selectivity in an attempt to maximize its efficacy and safety. Attention may be paid more on the convenience of drug administration to increase its compliance. Alternative medicine and appropriated technologies are also the fields of special interest of which research is underway.",

We have reviewed the recent literature on AS following the description of a typical clinical case. The management of AS is not easy. It must be done by experienced surgeons. Realization of several surgeries is sometimes mandatory, with the use of anti-adhesive devices between interventions. Its complex management encourages insistence on the avoidance of its risk factors.Le syndrome d’Asherman (SA) correspond à une oblitération plus ou moins complète de la cavité utérine et se développe après un traumatisme intra-utérin.

      "abstract": "Dysmenorrhoea (usr-e-tams) is a usual gynaecological condition comprising of painful muscle spasms coming with menstruation, which in the absence of any fundamental irregularity or pathology, is known as primary dysmenorrhoea. Primary dysmenorrhoea is the nearly usual cyclical pelvic pain affecting the satisfaction of life. The relative incidence of primary dysmenorrhoea was reported to be within 20% and 90% in many societies. Studies have shown that regular exercise decreases dysmenorrhoea in women, which may be due to the effects of hormonal changes on uterine epithelial tissues or an enhancement in endorphin levels. It appears that exercise has pain-killing events that act in a non-particular way. Research has demonstrated that women with dysmenorrhoea have high degrees of prostaglandins, and hormones acknowledged to cause hampering abdominal pain. Exercise is a non-pharmacological treatment with the aim of reducing side effects commonly reported in association with NSAIDs, such as indigestion, headaches and drowsiness. Thus, diminution of pain may be due to consequences of hormonal changes on uterine epithelial tissues or an increase in endorphin levels. However, exercise has analgesic events that behave in a non-specific way and may be substituted for analgesics. Exercise may play a pivotal role in combating difficulties due to dysmenorrhoea. This article reviews the effects of exercise on dysmenorrhoea.",

Transvaginal cerclage is generally performed by one of two techniques: McDonald or Shirodkar. The most common morbidities associated with cerclage placement are rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and suture displacement. Cervical bleeding and contractions during and immediately after cerclage placement are common. Contraindications to cerclage placement include the presence of a lethal fetal abnormality, evidence of intrauterine infection (chorioamnionitis), active bleeding, preterm labor, and ruptured membrane.",

Este síndrome también puede ocurrir después de una cirugía histeroscópica, embolización de la arteria o tuberculosis uterinas. La histersonografía o histerosalpingografía con contraste, menos invasiva, es útil para el diagnóstico inicial. El diagnóstico final se realizó mediante histeroscopia. En caso de oclusión completa de la cavidad uterina, se requiere una resonancia magnética. Las adherencias en la cavidad uterina se clasifican mediante diferentes sistemas de clasificación según la gravedad y la ubicación de las adherencias diagnosticadas durante la histeroscopia.

      "title": "The functions of the corpus luteum. II.—The experimental production of placentomata in the mouse",
      "abstract": "During the luteal phase of the cycle in many mammals, notably in the rabbit, ferret, and dog, the uterus undergoes changes which are designed to facilitate the implantation of the fertilised ovum. In other animals, such as the guinea-pig(5), the uterine changes during the luteal phase are histologically less obvious, but physiologically the uterine mucosa is in a peculiar condition of irritability. Injury to the mucosa at this time results in the production of large blocks of decidua-like tissue, to which the terms placentomata or deciduomata have been given. It has been shown by Marshall, Hammond, Loeb and others that the presence of the corpus luteum is essential for these post-ovulative uterine changes, and therefore that the corpus luteum is directly or indirectly responsible for their production. In the rabbit decidual tissue can only be induced to develop when functional corpora lutea are present in the ovary. In the guniea-pig (Loeb, 5) placentomata can be produced during the post-ovulation phase of the cycle in the unmated female, but in the rat Long and Evans (6) were unable to obtain a similar result. This discrepancy is undoubtedly due to the fact that in the short diœstrous cycle of the rat the corpora lutea undergo comparatively little development, whereas in the guinea-pig the cycle is longer and the corpora luteá are known to become active. During the pseudo-pregnancy which follows sterile copulation in the rat (Long and Evans, 6) and also during lactation (Corner and Warren, 2) placentomata can be produced. During both of these times corpora lutea develop to a greater extent than during the diœstrous cycle and become functional.",

Most of these physiological changes gradually regress over the postpartum, returning to prepregnancy levels from a few weeks up to 6 months later. The changes that occur in pregnancy have an important impact on a woman’s sexual functioning (desire, arousal, orgasm, sexual satisfaction). Despite the implications of these physiological changes during pregnancy, which affect intimacy and sexual function, these are seldom discussed by health professionals and care providers. The adjustments and changes in different systems throughout the pregnancy are explained in this chapter, focusing on those with implications for sexual function and the mechanisms behind them.",

A large, well-designed study has found that progesterone supplementation is no better than placebo therapy. Elimination of menstrual cyclicity by surgical or medical means effectively treats PMS; replacement of sex steroids does not seem to make PMS symptoms recur, and may become a successful, long-term treatment.

Oestrogen deficiency has been implicated in the development of lower urinary tract symptoms. Urinary incontinence may be an isolated symptom, or it can coexist with pelvic organ prolapse. Sacral nerve neuromodulation (SNM) involves stimulation of the sacral nerve roots to modulate the reflexes that influence the bladder, colon, sphincter and pelvic floor. SNM uses mild electrical pulses to improve or restore normal voiding function. Vaginal and rectal repair is the preferred option for rectal mucosal or full thickness prolapse in women with limited anterior and/or posterior vaginal wall prolapse and adequate vaginal length. Anterior compartment prolapse refers to prolapse of the bladder due to defects in the anterior vagina and is called a cystocele.",

The aim of this study was to identify elements which may be of use in understanding the pathogenetic mechanisms of these disorders.Three weeks after birth 537 mothers underwent a clinical genitourinary evaluation including: collection of data regarding pregnancy development and birth, genitourinary history (urinary problem data collected in accordance with the proposal of the International Continence Society), an objective genitourinary examination with a PC-test and identification of possible antagonist abdominal-diaphragmatic muscular synergies, instrumental tests in cases of post-partum urinary incontinence.Maternal age at birth, parity, weight before pregnancy and at term, weight increase, gestational age, duration of the second stage of labour, development and characteristics of birth, perineal condition and neonatal weight were the variables considered as risk factors while genuine stress urinary incontinence, urge incontinence, frequency, urgency, dysuria and inability to interrupt urination were the disorders whose dependence on the various risk factors were to be studied. The analysis of the association of the various pairs of variables recorded both positive and negative correlations, whether the population taken was that of all puerperae or that of only primiparae.Maternal age at birth, parity and duration of the second stage of labour, even if not always separable from other co-existing risk conditions, are the main responsible risk factors in the pathogenesis of urination disorders in puerperium. These results once again confirm the fundamental role of birth in the pathogenesis of female pelvic statics anomalies and of the genitourinary disorders which are their most evident chemical demonstration.",

      "title": "Reaction of the reproductive system of hens to the chronic stressor",
      "abstract": "During the panic, hens of white egg crosses, which are generally characterized by excessive timidity, immediately resort to escape and hysterically fight against the partitions and other elements that enclose the territory of their stay. It leads to numerous injuries, bleeding in the liver and ovaries, peritonitis, mass physiological anovulations and other disorders of the ovulatory cycles, and thus -at overcrowding, ie at 26 and 28 hens/m2, respe to reduction or stop of egg production and even death. Therefore, it is the level of egg production that determines and evaluates the reaction of the body of hens to acute stress in the first place, also for the immediate elimination of its stimulus. With regard to chronic stress, its diagnosis is complicated by the subtle current effects on the body of laying hens. However, with prolonged and cumulative action of the stimulus, it also causes significant material losses. The lack of a significant number of eggs under uncomfortable conditions of keeping hens during the year is probably a consequence of their being in a state of chronic stress. However, the possibility and effectiveness of its detection by the level of laying hens, especially at the beginning of the stimulus, has not been studied yet. This is especially true of situations that arise when the density of laying hens in cages. The urgency of detecting chronic stressors by the egg laying capacity of hens is also connected with the lack of objective data on the amount of material losses during their operation. Due to it and the attempt to obtain as many food eggs as possible from 1 m2 of available technological areas, some of their powerful producers resort to keeping the laying hens in the cages of multitiered batteries and even at higher densities, ie not at the densities recommended by the developer of the cross, but at higher ones established by the domestic standards. Therefore, the aim of the experiment was to determine the response of the reproductive system of hens to the intensity of chronic stressors formed by keeping them in cages of 12-tier batteries at a slightly higher density. To do it, on the conditions of a modern complex of the alimentary egg production 3 groups of laying hens of industrial herd of the cross «Hy-Line W-36» were formed, each was kept in a separate poultry house-analogue (area 2463.3 m2) with 12-tier cages batteries «Salmet», consisting of 30912 cages with the area of 0.392 m2. Hens of the 1st (control) group were kept at a density of 23 hens/m2 in accordance with domestic standards, and the 2nd and 3rd groups – at overcrowding, ie at 26 and 28 hens/m2, respectively. The effect of chronic stress on hens was determined by standard zootechnic and morphological methods of measuring their egg production, preservation, live weight and weight of eggs, strength and thickness of the shell, intensity of yolk color, etc. It was found that in accordance with the domestic requirements the normative density of keeping (23 hens/m2) of the hens of the cross «Hy-Line W-36» does not provide their inherent productivity, which should be at least 262.2 eggs per initial laying hen within 62 weeks of life (and at the density of keeping in the range of 13–20 hens/m2). In particular, in hens of group 1 it was (231.4 eggs/hen), ie it was 11.7% lower. Preservation of hens of group 1 (91.3%) also did not reach the normative level (96.4%). The increase in the intensity of chronic stressors, namely the increase in the density of hens of groups 2 and 3 to 26–28 hens/m2, led to a corresponding reaction of their body, in particular, to a decrease in egg productivity (up to 220.8–227.2 pcs/hen.) and preservation (up to 88.4–91.1%). This increase in the density of laying hens in the cages of 12-tier batteries to 26–28 hens/m2 (by 4–27% relative to domestic standards) provides for obtaining of 1.6–5.2 thousand more eggs from 1 m2 of poultry area, but under conditions of reduction of the level of the European coefficient of efficiency of their production. Thus, it was found that overcrowding of hens of the industrial flock of egg cross «Hy-Line W-36» is a chronic stressor, which causes a decrease not only in egg production due to ovulatory cycles, but also their viability and efficiency of egg production in general.",

Non-urgent caesarean was defined as delivery occurring in the absence of prolapsed cord, third trimester haemorrhage, failure of labour induction, fetal distress or non-clear amniotic fluid. <h3>Main outcome measures</h3> PPV with bag and mask and with bag and endotracheal tube. Both outcomes were adjusted for potential confounding variables by logistic regression analysis. <h3>Results</h3> 2087 infants were born by non-urgent caesarean and 4842 by non-instrumental vaginal delivery. Non-urgent caesarean delivery under regional anaesthesia compared to vaginal delivery under local or no anaesthesia increased the risk of bag and mask ventilation (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.89) adjusted for number of gestations, maternal hypertension and birth weight. Ventilation with bag and endotracheal tube was associated only with low birth weight, adjusted for delivery mode and twin gestation. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Term neonates with vertex presentation and clear amniotic fluid born by non-urgent caesarean section under regional anaesthesia need to be assisted at birth by health professionals skilled in PPV.",

However, OHSS may rarely be associated with spontaneous ovulatory cycles, usually in multiple or molar gestations or hypothyroidism. Clinical manifestations vary and may be potentially fatal in severe cases.A 28-year-old primigravid, with no history of an infertility treatment, presented with enlarged ovaries and ascite. The patient had minor abdominal discomfort, without other complains. Ultrasound evaluation showed enlarged cystic ovaries and mild ascites. Hormonal profile revealed increased estradiol levels, with normal TSH and hCG. The patient was managed expectantly with no complications.Although spontaneous OHSS is a rare entity, it is important to consider it in cases of bilateral ovarian masses in pregnancy. Three different mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of spontaneous OHSS have been described. This syndrome is thought to be secondary to promiscuity of the FSH receptor for hCG and/or TSH. It may occur with normal or increased levels of hCG and/or TSH.",

      "abstract": "Pregnancy dating is determined by the patient's last menstrual period or an ultrasound measurement. A full-term pregnancy is considered 37 weeks' gestation or more. Spontaneous labor begins when regular painful uterine contractions result in a cervical change. Active labor begins at 6 cm dilation and is marked by more predictable, accelerated cervical change. In the absence of pregnancy complications, intermittent fetal auscultation may be considered as an alternative to continuous electronic fetal monitoring, which is associated with a high false-positive rate. Intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated in patients with group B streptococcus colonization or those at high risk to prevent newborn early-onset group B streptococcus. The likelihood of vaginal delivery is increased by providing continuous nonmedical support during labor, encouraging mobility, and using a peanut ball with epidural analgesia. Neuraxial analgesia is more effective for pain control than systemic opioids and is associated with fewer adverse effects. Delayed pushing during the second stage of labor has risks but does not affect the mode of delivery. Routine oropharyngeal suctioning of the newborn is not recommended, even with meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Delayed cord clamping reduces newborn anemia. Prevention of postpartum hemorrhage in patients at risk includes prophylactic uterotonic administration and controlled cord traction. Perineal lacerations that alter anatomy or are not hemostatic should be repaired. (Am Fam Physician. 2024;109(6):525-532.",

      "title": "The Effect of Lemon Aromatherapy on Decreasing Perineum Pain among Postpartum Women at Noah Arofah Medika Clinic Bekasi District in 2020",
      "abstract": "The puerperium period is a period that starts a few hours after the birth of the placenta until 6 weeks after delivery when the uterus organs return to their pre-pregnancy state. After vaginal delivery, a women often feels pain and trauma to the perineum. Perineal pain is pain that results from a tear that occurs in the perineum, vagina, cervix, or uterus that can occur spontaneously or as a result of manipulative action on delivery assistance. The effects of perineal pain are making the post partum women uncomfortable, having a bad effect on the mother's desire to breastfeed her baby, experiencing fear of early mobilization so that it can cause problems and complications during the puerperium such as sub-uterine involution, non-smooth discharge, infection and post-partum hemorrhage. This will increase the morbidity and mortality rates for mothers in Indonesia. One of the non-pharmacological pain management methods is using aromatherapy. Lemon aromatherapy is a type of aromatherapy that can be used to treat pain and disease. Substances contained in lemon one of which is linalool is useful for stabilizing the nervous system so that it can have a calming effect for anyone who inhales it. This study aims to determine the effect of lemon aromatherapy on reducing perineal pain among postpartum women at Noah Arofah Medika Clinic, Bekasi Regency. The design of this study used the Quasy Experimental Design method with the research design of The Non-equivalent Control Group Design. The sample in this study were 20 respondents. The sampling technique used is the Accidental Sampling technique. The results of the study using the Independent T-test showed that there was a statistically significant effect of lemon aromatherapy on reducing perineal pain among postpartum women with a p value of 0.007 (p <0.05). Lemon aromatherapy is effective in reducing the scale of perineal pain in postpartum women. Therefore, lemon aromatherapy should be applied as an alternative intervention in carrying out midwifery care that is used to reduce perineal pain",

Induction of labour is second best and this intervention is justified only for clear maternal, fetal or combined reasons. In induction of labour, uterine contractions are initiated by mechanical and/or pharmacological methods with the aim of achieving vaginal delivery. The options for induction of labour available in each centre should be discussed with the woman, including the possible success and failure rates and complications. The conditions for which induction is carried out will vary and depend on the medical or obstetric condition of the mother, the fetal condition, the knowledge and experience of the clinician, the willingness of the woman to undergo the procedure and the facilities available. Hence, the rates of induction of labour in the UK vary from 10% to 20%.",

      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and the perimenopause are each difficult conditions to manage. When they co-exist the difficulty is more than doubled. Understanding and recognising the differences and the similarities between these conditions should enable clinicians to provide appropriate treatment and significantly improve women's quality of life. Distinction between the two can be difficult. Anecdotally women seem more prone to PMS symptoms during the perimenopause, or at least they tolerate the symptoms less well. Symptoms of the perimenopause arise from falling oestrogen levels with irregular ovulation, resulting in symptoms of oestrogen lack and heavy irregular periods. Symptoms of the perimenopause are thus relieved by the administration of oestrogen. Premenstrual syndrome frequently results when ovulation occurs. PMS appears to be due directly to the progesterone produced following ovulation in women who have enhanced sensitivity to this steroid. Treatment can thus be achieved by suppressing ovulation or reducing progesterone sensitivity; the latter seems achievable by the administration of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors. Ovulation can be suppressed by a variety of methods and oestrogen is an approach which is frequently employed. This will also effectively treat menopausal symptoms. The main problem with using oestrogen is that a progestogen must be administered to prevent endometrial neoplasia; this can result in a return of the PMS symptoms. This article reviews the difficulties encountered in women with both disorders and provides a suggested management strategy.",

      "title": "Uterine Prolapse in a Croatian Drought Horse – a Case Report",
      "abstract": "Izvale maternice (prolapsus uteri) događaju u svih vrsta domacih životinja. Gravidni rog se najprije uvrne u vlastitu supljinu da bi se potom u tako izvrnutom stanju istisnuo između stidnih usana van. Izvala se može dogoditi na jednom rogu (inversio et prolapsus uteri incompleta), ili na oba roga i tijelu maternice (inversio et prolapsus uteri completa). Najcesce se događa u mlijecnih i tovnih krava i ovaca, rjeđe u krmaca. Rijetke su u kobila, kuja, macaka. Etiologija je nejasna. Postoje mnogi rizicni cimbenici za izvalu maternice: položaj u ležistu gdje je stražnji dio niže, invaginacija vrha roga maternice, pobacaj, pretjerano tiskanje zbog distokija ili zaostale posteljice, atonija maternice, hipokalcemija, slaba fizicka kondicija životinje. Izvala maternice može se zakomplicirati zaostajanjem fetalnih ovojnica, rupturom maternice, izvrnucem ili izvalom mokracnog mjehura, rupturom krvnih žila maternice ili hernijacijom crijeva. Moguce komplikacije su: tromboza, ulceracija i nekroza izvaljene maternice koja posljedicno dovodi do toksemije i smrti životinje. Kod lijecenja izvale maternice primarno treba smanjiti bolove. S obzirom na brzinu postupka, preporuca se intravenska sedacija sa zadovoljavajucom epiduralnom analgezijom. Za pocetak treba podignuti izvaljenu maternicu do visine stidnice da se uspostavi cirkulacija, smanji oteklina i navlacenje jajnickih i sirokih maternicnih ligamenata sto prozroci bolove. Maternicu treba staviti u sterilnu krpu koju sa strane u visini zdjelice pridržavaju dva pomocnika. Sljedeci korak je ispiranje i ciscenje necistoca s povrsine maternice. Najbolje je upotrijebiti blagi dezinficijens uz obilje vode. Ostatke placente nježno se odstranjuje da kasnije ne bi doslo do komplikacija retencije i mikroretencije. Povrsinu maternice dobro je namazati tankim slojem vazelina da bismo sprijecili nastajanje sekundarnih laceracija uslijed pokusaja repozicije izvaljene maternice. Da bismo sprijecili ponovnu izvalu maternice moramo biti sigurni da je rog u potpunosti vracen u prvobitni položaj. Preporuca se uterusnom pumpom utociti mlaku fiziolosku otopinu u lumen maternice kako bi volumen vode pomogao da se i vrh roga vrati u fizioloski položaj. Visak tekucine treba sondom ispustiti iz lumena maternice da je ne bi povlacila u trbusnu supljinu i usporavala normalnu involuciju. Nakon ispiranja dajemo male doze oksitocina 10 - 20 I.J. da potaknemo kontrakcije maternice i izbacivanje zaostalog sadržaja. Pjenusave uterusne tablete stavljaju se radi prevencije posljedicnih endometritisa. Potporna terapija ukljucje sistemske i lokalne antibiotike sirokog spektra, parenteralnu aplikaciju nesteroidnih protuupalnih lijekova, antihistaminika i kalcij ukoliko je potreban. Ne smijemo zaboraviti aplikaciju tetanus antitoksina niti eventualni nastavak lijecenja kao kod klasicnih endometritisa. Nakon zavrsenog zahvata, kobilu treba iduca dva dana staviti u stojnicu da bi ogranicili kretanje i smanjili mogucnost ponovne izvale maternice. Iz vlastitog iskustva preporucujemo sivanje stidnice ako su na raspolaganju lokalni anestetik koji koristimo prilikom zahvata i odgovarajuci analgetici tijekom 2 do 3 dana, dok u protivnom sivanje nije poželjno. Iako su prognoze u slucajevima izvala maternice kod kobila cesto puta nepovoljne, nas slucaj je dokaz da se uz pravovremenu i dobro odrađenu intervenciju kobila može spasiti. Buduci da je kobila ponovno ostala gravidna i porođaj je bio bez komplikacija, možemo zakljuciti da su cijeli postupak repozicije, lijecenje tijekom i nakon intervencije te postoperativna njega odrađeni profesionalno i prema pravilima struke.",

      "abstract": "The consciously unwanted pregnancy is a complex medical-psycological-social condition. Various methods of termination at midtrimester pregnancy were individually used up to the date. It is well known that prostaglandin E and F are effective in uterine contraction in both pregnant and non-pregnant uterus. The instillation of prostaglandin F2α through Foleys catheter into extraovular uterine cavity has been shown to be effective for terminating pregnancy at midtrimester. The terminations at midtrimester were carried out by extrovular infusion of prostaglandin F2αin 22 patients between 16 and 30 gestational weeks and this method has been proved to be a safe and effective mean of terminating pregnancies at midtrimester. The results were as follows: 1. The psychological-social problems were indicated in most cases. 2. Nullipara were 12 below 25 years of age and multiparar had 2 more children, 6 cases 4 or more children. 3. The mean abortion time from initial infusion to the abortion of fetus was 25.26 hours and the mean dosage of infused prostaglandin F2α was 7.284ug. The mean abortion time and mean dosage of the prostaglandin decreased disproportionately to the increase of gestational week from 16 up to 26. 4. The initial uterine contraction was noted around 10.28 minutes and Foleys catheter was expelled between 15 and 16 hours in most cases after first infusion of prostaglandin. 5. The mean time of oxytocin augmentation after expulsion of Foleys catheter as supporting aid was 5.08 hours. 6. The most common side effects consisted of face flush, nausea, and vomiting, which disappeared spontaneously after the expulsion of Foleys catheter without specific treatment. 7. The success rate of termination in 22 patients was 95% and 3 patients were complicated by incomplete abortion.",

Post-partum hemorrhages are generally separated in 2 categories. Acute hemorrhage occurs in the 24 hours following the delivery and is mainly caused by uterine atony, retained secondines, placenta accreta, birth canal trauma and uterine inversion. The delayed hemorrhage occurs after 1 day to 6 weeks after the delivery and is often related to uterine infection or abnormal involution of the placental bed. The management requires uterine massage and ocytocine or prostaglandins. Surgical or radiological selective ligation or embolization of the internal iliac arteries can be required. The hysterectomy is proposed in the most severe cases.",

We reported two cases with HFRS, at pregnant women, ended with pregnancy interruption. Both of them had nearly the same age, both 16 weeks pregnant. They presented with fever, malaise, muscle pain and headache. They were febrile when presented at the hospital, hypotensive, hyperemia on the face. They complained about oligo-anuria too. One of them continued to be hypotension, despite the supportive therapy she had an abortion after 8 hours. The other patient had the abortion on the 4 th day of hospitalization. The diagnose was set based on the clinical, epidemiological findings and the serological positive confirmation for IgM Hantavirus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence assay IFA. The abortion is a rare complication of HFRS in pregnancy. The symptoms are not specific. Early diagnosis and appropriate management are necessary to improve the maternal and fetal outcome.

      "abstract": "Retained placenta after vaginal delivery is diagnosed when a placenta does not spontaneously deliver within a designated amount of time, variably defined as a period of 18-60 mins. It may also be diagnosed if a patient experiences significant hemorrhage prior to delivery of the placenta. Normal placenta delivery requires adequate uterine contractions, with shearing of the placenta and decidua from the uterine wall and expulsion of the tissue. Thus, retained placenta can occur in the setting of significant uterine atony, abnormally adherent placenta, as with placenta accreta spectrum (PAS), or closure of the cervix prior to placental expulsion. Risk factors for retained placenta parallel those for uterine atony and PAS and include prolonged oxytocin use, high parity, preterm delivery, history of uterine surgery, and IVF conceptions. History of a prior retained placenta and congenital uterine anomalies also appear to be risk factors. Management entails manual removal of the placenta with adequate analgesia, as medical intervention alone has not been proven effective. Complications can include major hemorrhage, endometritis, or retained portions of placental tissue, the latter of which can lead to delayed hemorrhage or infection. Prophylactic antibiotics can be considered with manual placenta removal, though evidence regarding effectiveness is inconsistent. If hemorrhage is encountered, deployment of a massive transfusion protocol, uterine evacuation with suction, and use of intrauterine tamponade, as with an intrauterine balloon, should be initiated immediately. When a separation plane between the placenta and uterus is particularly difficult to create, PAS should be considered, and preparations should be made for hemorrhage and hysterectomy. Patients with risk factors for retained placenta should have a laboratory sample sent for blood type and antibody screening on admission to labor and delivery, and plans should be made for appropriate analgesia and preparations for hemorrhage if a retained placenta is encountered.",

      "abstract": "Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor sleep condition that causes pain or a \"creepy-crawly\" feeling in the legs. The association between pregnancy and RLS is well established. The incidence and progression of RLS are influenced by hormonal factors, notably during pregnancy. RLS is more prevalent among pregnant women than among the general population and its prevalence and severity increase with gestational age. In addition, multiparous women are more likely to experience RLS during pregnancy than single-birth mothers. The symptoms often improve over the first four weeks following childbirth. Pregnancy-related hormones, especially estrogen, likely play important roles. Dopaminergic agents, antiepileptics, and benzodiazepines can be used for treatment. The prognosis is good, and most patients recover quickly. Attention to serum ferritin levels is also important. A definite statement regarding it being the safest therapy strategy cannot be established because of the varying techniques used by various investigations and the paucity of data concerning the impact of RLS in pregnancy and its long-term consequences. Non-pharmacological treatments and nutritional supplements may be tried first in pregnant women with RLS.",

      "abstract": "Several pathological conditions can occur that directly impact the male external genitalia. These conditions may be congenital or acquired, and have implications for the patient's ability to breed. Hypospadias, a condition in which the urethra develops abnormally during fetal life, is one of the most common canine congenital anomalies. Although hypospadias may also affect females, the penile urethra is more often the target. Other conditions that may present to clinical practice include paraphimosis and priapism. The former involves a flaccid penis that cannot be replaced within the prepuce, whereas a penis that maintains erection without sexual stimulation characterizes the latter. In both cases, the affected penis is exposed for long periods of time. This protracted exposure causes the tissue to desiccate. The affected penile tissue also becomes increasingly irritated and/or edematous. If local circulation is compromised, the penis may become necrotic. In such extreme cases, phallectomy is indicated. This chapter emphasizes the approach to hypospadias, paraphimosis, priapism, and traumatic injury to the penis.",

In our case, the extra uterine pregnancy is peritoneally located and does not seem to respond to a specific risk factor. It is therefore considered primitive. The diagnosis is evoked by the presence of abdominal pain, often in a context of late menstruation. Gynecological examination found an enlarged uterus but not proportional to the presumed age of pregnancy, this was confirmed by ultrasound and determination of the Bhcg level. Depending on the acute nature of symptoms, surgical intervention is often essential. The latter is performed by general or local anesthesia depending on the urgency.

      "abstract": "4 kinds of progestin only oral contraceptives (OCs) and numerous combined OCs containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) or occasionally mestranol and either norgestrel or norethindrone are currently available in Australia. All progestins except norgestrel are effective in vivo after metabolism to norethindrone. Mestranol is effective in the human after demethylation to EE. The main side effects of OCs, including menstrual disturbances and changes in weight and mood, are primarily of nuisance value. Menstrual blood loss with OCs is almost invariably less than during spontaneous menses, but breakthrough bleeding and midcycle spotting may cause concern in patients. Amenorrhea and weight gain are rare with low dose pills. Approximately 6 in 1000 women remain anovulatory for 12 months or more after discontinuing OCs, but it is not yet know whether the amenorrhea is related to pill use and it is usually corrected by induction of ovulation. Cardiovascular side effects including venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are seen less frequently with new lower dose pills. The effects of OCs on the cardiovascular system are complex and depend on the interaction of estrogen and progestin. Amounts of estrogen and progestin should be the lowest possible to prevent ovulation, and routine monitoring should be provided for all women using pills. Older high dose formulations altered lipid metabolism in the direction of greater risk of coronary heart disease. Although research suggests the lowest dose triphasic pills have no significant effect, not enough large studies have been done with matched controls. Any effects on carbohydrate metabolism of the low dose pills are apparently minor and of little clinical significance. Insulin dependent diabetics with adequate supervision may safely use low dose pills. Combined OCs reduce the incidence of endometrial and ovarian malignancy. No relationship between OCs and the risk of breast cancer has been demonstrated except possibly in women under 35 when the cancer developed. The risk of intraepithelial neoplasia may be increased in women taking OCs for more than 8 years. Data on drug interactions are inconclusive, but women on rifampicin should use some other method. Absolute contraindications to OCs include breast cancer, history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, active liver disease, use of rifampicin, familial hyperlipidemia, previous arterial thrombosis, and pregnancy, while relative contraindications include smoking, age over 35, hypertension, breastfeeding, and irregular spontaneous menstruation. Progestin only OCs have a higher rate of failure and irregular bleeding than combined pills and their main use is for breastfeeding women and those with contraindications to estrogen. The pill of 1st choice should be a triphasic low-dose formulation.",

      "abstract": "Restraint has been used as a procedure to study the effects of stress on gestation outcome in rodents. The effects of restraint could potentially be used as a model for the impact of general stress produced by high doses of toxicants and other interventions. In mice, restraint in the peri-implantation period leads to implantation failure, and restraint at appropriate times in organogenesis produces cleft palate, supernumerary ribs, and resorption. In rats, there is some evidence for an association with restraint for implantation failure, but not for the morphological anomalies. Restraint in late gestation alters adult sexual behavior of male rat offspring, but consequences for their fertility are not known. Intrauterine growth retardation is not commonly associated with gestational restraint. In the few studies where they have been directly compared, different restraint procedures produced graded, qualitatively different, or no effects. Adrenocortical hormones have been implicated as mediating the effect of restraint on cleft palate, but not on supernumerary ribs, implantation failure, or sexual differentiation. Given the variety of restraint procedures and the varying species-dependent consequences, it is not possible to infer a generalizable pattern of developmental effects due to gestational stress from the restraint literature. As an alternative approach, contemporary methods in gene expression and developmental biology could profitably be applied to understanding different patterns of stress-mediated effects of toxicant exposures on intrauterine development.",

Fibroids are monoclonal tumors showing 40%–50% karyotypically detectable chromosomal abnormalities.

The potential effects of fibroids on pregnancy and the potential effects of pregnancy on fibroids are frequent clinical concerns, since these tumors are common in women of reproductive age. Most pregnant women with fibroids do not have any complications during pregnancy related to the fibroids. Pain is the most common problem, and there may be a slightly increased risk of obstetrical complications such as miscarriage, premature labor and delivery, abnormal fetal position, and placental abruption. Several factors make it difficult to assess the impact of fibroids on pregnancy outcome and to identify specific fibroid characteristics that are important.",

      "abstract": "Cervical cerclage is not recognized as the usual treatment of threatened premature delivery including uterine contractions and cervical modifications. Pregnant women with a threatened premature delivery limited to the presence of a short cervix at digital examination or internal scan may however be offered therapeutic cerclage, different from prophylactic first trimester cervical cerclage, when cervical insufficiency is suspected. Studies on cervical cerclage to prevent premature delivery suffered a poor design and do not allow any strong definitive conclusion. In the presence of a shortened or dilated cervix at digital examination without uterine contractions, there is no strong scientific evidence to support the practice of therapeutic cervical cerclage. Conversely there is however no strong scientific evidence to reject this procedure especially in early pregnancy (before the end of the second trimester). Therefore therapeutic cervical cerclage remains a possible option only if premature labor, intrauterine infection or placental abruption have been ruled-out by a 48 hours inpatient bed rest. In patients without previous history of premature delivery or second trimester miscarriage, there is no scientific evidence to support therapeutic cervical cerclage in presence of a short cervix. Moreover, in this low-risk group cervical length ultrasound screening is not recommended. In patients with one or more previous premature deliveries or second trimester miscarriage but who do not reach Royal College criteria for prophylactic cervical cerclage, there is currently not enough evidence to support a policy of therapeutic cervical cerclage compared to bed rest. This latter recommendation may however depend on the severity of previous obstetrical history.",

      "title": "Sexuality and Fertility after Cancer",
      "abstract": "As more people achieve long-term survival after cancer, sexual dysfunction and infertility have increasingly been recognized as negative consequences that impact quality of life. Sexual dysfunction is a frequent long-term side effect of cancer treatment, but damage to different underlying physiological systems is salient in men versus women. Men frequently have erectile dysfunction (ED) related to damage to the autonomic nervous system and/or reduced circulation of blood to the penis. Hormonal impairment of sexual function is less common. Women, in contrast, are able to overcome damage to autonomic nerves if genital tissues remain structurally intact and estrogenized. Female sexual dysfunction is frequently associated with sudden premature ovarian failure or direct effects of radiation fibrosis or scar tissue causing pain with sexual activity. The lack of validated interventions for sexual rehabilitation after cancer is a major problem, as is finding cost-effective ways of providing services. Concerns about fertility are also a major source of distress to people treated for cancer during childhood or young adulthood, yet many young survivors do not recall any discussion about future childbearing potential with their oncology team. Since fertility preservation is becoming more practical for both men and women, producing patient and professional educational materials and developing professional practice guidelines should be high priorities for oncology societies.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays it is known that sex hormones play an important role not only in the reproductive system but also in thermoregulation, somatosensory control, and pain perception. Several studies have shown that women are less tolerant of pain and have higher sensitivity and predisposition to somatization and pain chronification. In addition to sex, feeding status is also an essential factor for pain perception. Metabolic factors and glucose levels may play a role in the sensation of pain. In this paper, we report an evaluation of thermal pain thresholds induced by heat and cold stimulation in males and females during primary (pre-resorption) and secondary (metabolic) satiety.&nbsp; The obtained data showed that in both sensory-motor satiety and metabolic satiety, the heat pain threshold was significantly higher in males than in females in the follicular and luteal phases of the ovarian-menstrual cycle. Further studies are needed to detect more details on the influence of food satiety levels on pain perception regarding sex differences.&nbsp;&nbsp",

Those authors who classify puerperal insanity into the insanity of pregnancy, of the puerperal period proper, and of the lactational or nursing period, arbitrarily assume that the latter begins six weeks or two months after labor. In a general way this limitation though arbitrary may be accepted, for obstetric authors count as belonging to the puerperium that period of time occupied by the involution of the parturient organs which is usually stated to be six weeks. Prolonged or excessive lactation is given as the chief cause of insanity occurring during the nursing period. In most cases this is",

No changes in maximal nerve conduction velocity or simple reaction time could be found after either hysterectomy or ovariectomy. of the 20 ovariectomized patients, 3 developed subjective symptoms and electrophysiological signs of the carpal tunnel syndrome within a few months after surgery. Thus the carpal tunnel syndrome, which is common in women of menopausal age, seems to be precipitated also by iatrogenic menopause. the present findings indicate that ovarian relaxin overproduction cannot be the basis of the carpal tunnel syndrome, but they are consistent with the view that the syndrome is a sign of hypothalamic‐hypophyseal overactivity or imbalance.",

On examination of her perineum after delivery, it was noted that she had sustained an extensive perineal tear. The risk of third- and fourth-degree tears is approximately 1% of all vaginal births. Anal sphincter damage that is not identified and correctly repaired could lead to long-term physical and psychosexual complications. Written consent should be obtained for examination under anesthesia and perineal repair. Repair of an anal sphincter injury should be performed in an operating room with good lighting and appropriate instruments, rather than in a labor room where the lighting and the provision of instruments are likely to be suboptimal. Regular analgesia is essential to reduce pain associated with walking, sitting, passing urine, and opening of bowels.",

However, relative to trunk-length dimensions are rather stable and drop with a higher level of significance only in castration combined with estrogen or progesterone treatment. Relative pelvic width, as expressed by the transverse interiliac distance, is greatly widened in extreme muscular hypofunction but the sacrum does not participate in this widening. The widening results from a broadening of the proximal part of the ilium, following a general response of long bones to extreme muscular hypofunction. Pelvic width is reduced in castration and ovariectomy with and without testosterone or estrogen treatment, but not in the combination of castration with progesterone treatment. Changes of sacral width are, however, more often independent from than concomitant with the width changes of the pelvis. The transverse interventral spine distance is dependent on rectus femoris muscle activity and drops drastically in hind-leg removal. It also drops in castration and particularly when castration is combined with estrogen treatment; but progesterone adds little to the effect of castration alone. The effect of ovariectomy alone or combined with testosterone treatment is negligible.",

This phase may be accompanied by symptoms of anxiety, depression or irritability, which are part of non-pathological adaptation mechanisms. These symptoms can, however, be intense and constitute real psychiatric syndromes, particularly when the woman presents vulnerability factors. While fetal exposure to alcohol and other drugs is one of the leading preventable causes of developmental delay and birth defects in newborns, substance use during pregnancy is common, particularly in Europe. There is no amount and no time during pregnancy where consuming alcohol and other substances of abuse is safe. This narrative review reflects the point of view of the obstetrician, the constraints of his therapeutic framework with its limitations of time, training and tools to detect and manage substance-related disorders. Validated detection questionnaires are poorly adapted to obstetric practice; detection and first brief interventions can be delegated to save time but at the risk of reducing the involvement of the obstetrician. The combined management of pregnancy and addictions by a psychiatrist and an obstetrician comes up against different frameworks and working deadlines in the two disciplines.",

It appeared that under these conditions the extent of growth retardation in different embryonic and placental structures is dissimilar. The processes of cytoplasmic protein synthesis in heart tissues are more resistant to the damaging effect than in bodily tissues.

No significant association to \"true\" obstetrical complications or labor occurrences (breech, vacuum extractor, cesarean section, shoulder dystocia, pudendal block, epidural analgesia, general anesthesia or intravenous Syntocinon) was found.

Most work has documented shifts at high fertility times (i.e., ovulation) or during premenstruation. However, hormonal changes at menstruation also affect female physiology and behavior and could affect vocal production. The present studies investigated perceptual differences in voices recorded during menstruation compared with recordings taken at other times of the menstrual cycle. Results show that male raters could reliably identify voices recorded during menstruation with or without the presence of a voice recorded closest to ovulation. In addition, voices recorded at menstruation were identified as being the most unattractive. These findings indicate that voice recordings taken at times of lowest fertility may uniquely impact women’s vocal production and that perceptions of voice based on cycle phase are not specific to the time of heightened fertility. Implications for the evolution of human menstrual cycle cues are discussed.",

Result Regular exercise is associated with a lower risk of macrosomy and caesarean section during childbirth. Depression is a common complication in the prenatal and postnatal period due to increased stress and insufficient social support. Exercise is a potential non-pharmacological therapy. Regular exercise is also associated with lowering blood glucose and improving insulin sensitivity. To optimize weight and overweight, exercise is one of the main parts of treatment. Another therapeutic possibility of using the exercise is to influence the pain in the lumbosacral area and also the pain in the pelvic area. Another variant of exercises are exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor. Exercise of the pelvic floor muscles in the perinatal period is an effective method for preventing postpartum urinary incontinence. Conclusion Exercise is an important part of therapy in the prenatal and postnatal period.",

Consequently, the treatment of this problem is done secretly and by people who are not professionals, not to mention that they do not know what vaginismus really is. Vaginismus causes a woman’s pelvic floor muscles to contract at the attempt of vaginal penetration, making the vagina narrower and tighter. These muscle spasms are involuntary, and women with vaginismus often have trouble with any type of vaginal penetration, such as vaginal intercourse, tampon insertion, and gynecological exams. Penetration, when possible, is usually quite painful and causes great anxiety. For some women, intercourse is impossible. We present series of three cases treated in our Institute after a long-time treatment by others. All of them came et our Institute after a long period of time seeking alternative help and hiding the problem.

      "abstract": "Acute appendicitis is an important differential diagnosis in patients with right lower quadrant pain during pregnancy. Endometriosis, a hormone-related pathology, is another possibility. Patients with endometriosis are typically symptomatic before pregnancy. Stromal endometriosis is a variant of endometriosis that presents no symptoms before pregnancy but which occasionally presents with the new onset of symptoms during pregnancy. We report the case of a 35-year-old woman in her 8th month of pregnancy who presented with impending appendiceal rupture due to deciduosis of the appendix, a progesterone-related condition, during pregnancy. This case suggests that deciduosis/stromal endometriosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis of acute abdomen during pregnancy, even if the patient is asymptomatic before pregnancy.",

      "abstract": "A female calf of the breed German Holstein (GH) was spontaneously born on July 28, 2013 which was 35 days before the expected term of birth. The dam was a heifer when she got pregnant from the first insemination on November 23, 2012. Calving was without complications. The calf was fully viable and without visible anomalies. We assume that the calf was fully mature at the termination of the pregnancy. Growth rate after the second month of life was comparable to calves born in the same herd after normal length of gestation. The sire of this preterm calf was a GH-bull used for artificial insemination. This bull had already sired 151 daughters. For this bull, preterm calvings were not yet reported. The dam was a heifer, and neither external influences on this dam or in the herd could be identified that could have induced this premature calving. In the herd, no further premature calvings were observed or reasons associated with a preterm calving were found. In this exceptional case, however, gestation length was 248 days and the prematurely born calf survived without any signs of debility, organ defects and respiratory distress.",

      "abstract": "As alterações emocionais negativas vêm aumentando com o passar das décadas, chegando a atingir respectivamente 4,4% e 1,6% da população mundial, sendo as mulheres da ordem de 70%, estando mais expostas no período gestacional devido a mudanças hormonais. O pré-natal é o momento oportuno para estabelecer um relacionamento de confiança com a gestante, possibilitando a identificação de fatores de riscoao binômio,como alterações patológicas ou psicológicas, ao qual atualmente, deve-se incluir o homem nesse processo. Revisão: Perante gestação há maior destaque para mudanças morfológicas, psicológicas e funcionais. Durante gestação destaca-se mudanças morfológicas, psicológicas e funcionais. Algumas futuras mães podem apresentar episódios de ansiedade e de tristeza, ao invés da típica e esperada alegria, demandando necessidade de maior avaliação, pois, as mulheres podem ser mais suscetíveis ao estresse físico e metal. Já quanto ao Couvade, os sintomas contam com a perca de apetite, náusea, vômitos, desejos, aumento de peso corporal, dores dentários, insônia, dor de cabeça, entre outros. Há indicação também para que esta condição seja definida como uma expressão somática de ansiedade, toda oriunda do processo transitório para a paternidade. Objetivos: Relacionar as condições sociodemográficas das gestantes pré-dispostas a alterações emocionais possibilitando o aparecimento das psicoses, bem como, de seus parceiros, apontando os sinais e sintomas psicossomáticos de depressão ou psicose, discorrer sobre a atuação específica do enfermeiro na consulta de pré-natal para detecção precoce dos sinais e sintomas psicossomáticos de depressão ou psicose da gestante e seu companheiro e elaborar um protocolo de consulta de pré-natal masculino, para identificar e prevenir a síndrome de La Couvade. Método: Utilizou-se revisão integrativa da literatura, com estudo descritivo, de abordagem qualiquantitativa. Discussão: Embora a etiologia da Couvade seja desconhecida, inúmeros pesquisadores relacionam a condição com características emocionais, ansiedade, fatores hormonais e fisiológicos concomitantes, fatores sociais, idade, aspectos inconscientes, entre outros. Para tanto, um protocolo foi desenvolvido a fim de, sendo utilizado no pré-natal masculino, possa facilitar a identificação da síndrome. Conclusão: Concluindo, com o uso do protocolo de consulta (Quadro 2), se espera poder avaliar adequadamente os sinais e sintomas da Síndrome de La Couvade, para que, caso necessário, o companheiro participante do pré-natal seja encaminhado ao psicólogo da unidade, com o intuído de que seu bem estar seja restaurado o quanto antes.",

      "abstract": "In a developing country like Pakistan, health issues, especially those related to women’s health, always need prime focus, particularly in the far away and distant areas of the country where even basic medical facilities are hardly available. Endometriosis is one of the rarely addressed diseases, mainly because of two reasons, lack of proper education and socio-economic conditions. Endometriosis is becoming a more challenging disease for the medical community, observed primarily in females 15 to 45 years of age. The prevalence of endometriosis in females is approximately 8–11% of the reproductive period (with or without a medical diagnosis)1 . Despite the fact that patients do not show clinical symptoms but the majority of them mainly suffer from pain during menstruation (dysmenorrhea) and pain during intercourse (dyspareunia) is also common. Other conditions associated with endometriosis are chronic pelvic pain (CPP), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), loss of quality of life and fatigue2, 3. Even though endometriosis is the primary reason for infertility, and it affects the quality of life badly, but endometriosis cannot be cured in a definite manner. The focus on managing of endometriosis is either hormonal suppression of disease, analgesic, or surgical excision. Several qualitative types of research have been undertaken on endometriosis to improve our understanding of its effects on the general quality of life, social relationships, and intimate life4 . Despite many studies, physiotherapy has been the most neglected treatment for the management of endometriosis.",

      "title": "Early and late preterm premature rupture of membranes",
      "abstract": "The premature rupture of membranes (PROM), defined as rupture of the amniotic membranes before the onset of labor, remains a serious challenge for obstetricians, because of its high rate of comorbidity, including infection, cesarean section, and other associated problems.1 Preterm PROM (PPROM) (occurring before the 37 full gestational weeks), accompanied by preterm birth, is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period.2,3 The etiology of PROM and PPROM is multifactorial, but there now exists abundant evidence that localized or systemic infection and/or inflammation is one of the most important causative factors.4 The presence of vaginal infection is reported to be associated with an increased risk for PROM and PPROM.5 Management of pregnant women with or at risk for PROM and PPROM is still one of the most important issues in obstetrics practice, which is codified by international guidelines and influenced by gestational age and the presence of complicating factors including clinical infection, placenta abruption, labor, or nonreassuring fetal status.1 Unfortunately, strategies for prevention of PROM appear to be controversial based on inconsistent supporting evidence.5 Therefore, it is encouraging to learn that Chandra and Sun's study published in this issue of the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association investigated this topic.6 The authors enrolled 714 pregnant women with third trimester PROM and PPROM (577 women with PROM, 116 with late PPROM at 32–36+6 weeks, and 21 women with early PPROM, < 32 weeks’ gestation) in the Jiangsu Province Hospital between January and December 2015, to study maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes.6 The authors found that breech presentation and history of previous cesarean section was associated with occurrence of PPROM compared to that of PROM (9.5% vs. 1.9% and 14.6% vs. 4.7%, respectively; both p<0.01).6 In addition, high C-reactive protein levels and high maternal temperature were also found in the pregnant women with PPROM, suggesting that these indicate asymptomatic infection.6 Therefore, they suggested that this condition requires close monitoring to prevent adverse effects on pregnancy. Finally, they found that longer latency period in the PPROM group is predictable, and it is important to prolong the gestational age in PPROM patients.6 This study confirmed that accurate assessment of gestational age and understanding of the maternal, fetal, and neonatal risks are essential to appropriate evaluation, counseling, and care of patients with PROM and PPROM.1 This article is interesting and worthy of discussion. First, it was unfair to enroll the pregnant women with PROM in Chandra and Sun's study. One trial revealed that for 50% of women with PROM who were managed with an expectation of delivery within 5 hours, 95% of those patients delivered within 28 hours.7 The meta-analysis data (6814 pregnant women with PROM at 37 weeks of gestation or more) indicated that these pregnant women benefitted from induction of labor compared with expectant management, based on the findings that induction of labor reduced the time to delivery and the rates of chorioamnionitis, endometritis, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, without increasing the rates of cesarean section or operative vaginal delivery.8 Second, the optimal gestational age for delivery is unclear and controversial in pregnant women with PPROM,1 especially for those patients with late PPROM.1 The definition of late preterm birth often ranges from 34 weeks’ to 37 weeks’ gestation.9 It is unusual to use 32 weeks’ gestation as a cutoff value, as shown by Chandra and Sun.6 For example, recent new information from a meta-analysis and randomized controlled trials evaluated delivery versus expectant management between 34 weeks’ and 37 weeks’ gestation (late preterm birth) also failed to show a significant difference between the two groups.10,11 Analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the randomized controlled trial of preterm prelabor rupture of the membranes near term found that there was no significant difference between immediate birth and expectant management.12 Based on the above-mentioned findings, we might conclude that expectant medical management might be the better choice for women with late PPROM, and that induction of labor might be a superior choice for women with PROM. Unfortunately, Chandra and Sun did not provide any new information for us in this regard. Third, Chandra and Sun suggested monitoring for asymptomatic infection and longer latency period for PPROM to minimize perinatal morbidity and mortality. Of course, it is gratifying to learn that research studies have focused on more accurate clinical and/or microbiological surveillance systems, validated risk stratification strategies, and better point-of-care testing for women with early PPROM (< 34 weeks’ gestation), to offer improved intervention to minimize the risk of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, Chandra and Sun provided little information in this regard.6 In addition, the following concepts are clear indications for delivery, such as nonreassuring fetal status, clinical chorioamnionitis, and significant placental abruption.1 Chandra and Sun also missed this important point. Finally, Chandra and Sun did not perform routine culturing for patients with PPROM, and they also failed to mention any Group B Streptococcus (GBS) screening. GBS screening is a highly recommended procedure for pregnant women, and vaginal macrobiotics is an important issue for preterm births.13–15 The recent clinical management guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist for obstetricians and gynecologists recommend the following to reduce maternal and neonatal infection and gestational-age-dependent morbidity: (1) a 7-day course of combination therapy of intravenous ampicillin and erythromycin followed by oral amoxicillin and erythromycin in women with early PPROM; (2) a single course of corticosteroids; (3) the needs of intrapartum GBS prophylaxis; and (4) at risk of imminent delivery, magnesium sulfate might be used for fetal neuroprotection.1 Conflicts of interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest related to the subject matter or materials discussed in this article.

      "abstract": "Abnormal uterine bleeding is more frequent in adolescence. Although, most commonly, it has a non-structural etiology, it may be due to any cause described. A 12-year-old adolescent, with no relevant personal history, menarche 1 month before, was observed in the emergency department for severe menstrual bleeding with progressive worsening, and hemodynamic repercussion in need of transfusion support. Physiological ovulatory dysfunction associated with possible previously unknown coagulopathy was considered to be the most likely diagnosis and medical treatment was initiated. Without response, the patient was submitted to sedated observation and uterine aspiration, which ultimately led to the diagnosis of a Burkitt Lymphoma. Although structural causes, and particularly malignancy, whether gynecological or not, are a rare cause of abnormal uterine bleeding in this age group, they must be considered, thus enhancing the fastest and most appropriate treatment.INTRODUçãO: A hemorragia uterina anormal é mais frequente na adolescência. Apesar de maioritariamente de etiologia não estrutural, pode dever-se a qualquer causa descrita. CASO CLíNICO: Adolescente de 12 anos, sem antecedentes pessoais relevantes, com menarca há 1 mês, observada no serviço de urgência por hemorragia menstrual grave com agravamento progressivo e repercussão hemodinâmica com necessidade de suporte transfusional. Foi colocada a hipótese de disfunção ovulatória fisiológica associada a eventual coagulopatia desconhecida previamente e foi instituído tratamento médico. Por ausência de resposta a tratamento médico, foi submetida a observação sob sedação e aspiração uterina que evidenciou tratar-se de um Linfoma de Burkitt. DISCUSSãO: Apesar de as causas estruturais, e particularmente as neoplasias, do foro ginecológico ou não, serem uma causa rara de hemorragia uterina anormal nesta faixa etária, elas devem ser levadas em consideração potenciando assim um tratamento mais célere e adequado.",

      "abstract": "Epidural analgesia is commonly used for management of pain during childbirth. Need for emergent Caesarean section e.g. because of signs of foetal distress or lack of progress is however not an uncommon event. In females having an established epidural; general anaesthesia, top-up of the epidural or putting a spinal are all possible options. Dosing of the spinal anaesthesia in females having epidural is a matter of discussion. We describe a healthy 32 years, 0 para mother in gestation week 36 having labour epidural analgesia but due to foetal distress scheduled for an emergent Caesarean section category 2 that developed upper extremity weakness and respiratory depression after administration of standard dose high density bupivacaine/morphine/fentanyl intrathecal anaesthesia. She was emergent intubated and resumed motor function after 15–20 min. A too extensive cephalic spread was the most plausible explanation to the event. Whether or not reducing the dose for a spinal anaesthesia in mothers having an established labour epidural analgesia is a matter of discussion. It is of course of importance to achieve a rapid and effective surgical anaesthesia but also avoiding overdosing with the risk for a too high cephalic spread. To perform spinal anaesthesia for emergent Caesarean in patients having an epidural for labour pain is a feasible option and should be considered in category 2–3 section. The dose for a convert spinal block should be assessed on an individual basis and reasonably reduced.",

      "abstract": "The menstrual cycle has been reported to alter pain perception but the patterns differ among studies. It has been reported that estrogens may influence somatic sensory processes. The present aim was to investigate whether the perception of pain varies by phases of the menstrual cycle. 20 women with chronic low pain volunteered to participate and were asked to rate their pain each day during three successive menstrual cycles. The menstrual cycle was divided into four and five phases to be able to compare results. Analysis showed there were phase differences in pain ratings during the menstrual cycle. Regardless of whether the menstrual cycle was divided into four or five phases, women rated pain significantly higher in the menstrual and premenstrual phases than in the midmenstrual and ovulatory phases. This is consistent with other studies showing less pain sensitivity during phases of the menstrual cycle associated with high estrogen. Women with high pain frequency reported more frequency a passive coping style and catastrophizing thoughts.",

      "abstract": "Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is an important clinical problem associated with increased perinatal mortality and morbidity. The most preferred small for gestational age (SGA) definition is birth weight below the 10th percentile, adjusted for gestational age. The incidence of IUGR is about 4 to 7 %. A variety of hormones are involved. IUGR may be due to chromosomal defects, smoking, early-onset preeclampsia ( < 34 weeks), connective tissue and inflammatory rheumatic diseases, maternal infections, several drugs, twin-to twin transfusion, anorexia nervosa, low maternal pre-pregnancy or small weight gain during pregnancy. High hemoglobin (Hb) levels during the first 10-20 weeks of pregnancy may also cause IUGR. Complications due to IUGR include fetal or neonatal death, dysmaturity, and physical as well as temporary or permanent mental defects. Low birth weight children may have behavioral problems, psychiatric disorders and lower intelligence test scores later in life. There is a relationship between IUGR, timing and progression of puberty, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Fetal changes of lipid metabolism and homeostasis in IUGR may place the grown adult at risk for hypertension, diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease. Mothers of low weight offspring have an increased risk for cardiovascular and kidney disease later in life.

Its introduction has been facilitated by health policies which have led to the removal of certain obstacles hindering its use. In this context, sociological, statistical and scientific data have been employed which have often turned out to be biased or partial in nature. The reliability of the information provided by health authorities, pharmaceutical companies and other social entities has been called into question in various respects, particularly as far as the mechanism of action, side effects and pregnancy rate are concerned. This study focuses on the mechanism by which levonorgestrel acts, since a wider discussion would fall beyond the scope of a single study, and the mechanism of action is the aspect which is least understood and most controversial. It remains to be determined whether levonorgestrel is a product which only acts prior to ovulation or which has an effect on the human embryo.",

      "abstract": "В последние годы наблюдается рост гинекологических заболеваний и омоложение контингента оперируемых женщин. Одно из ведущих мест среди гинекологических заболеваний занимает миома матки, эндометриоз и патология эндометрия, часто им сопутствующая. Лечение указанной патологии может быть хирургическим и консервативным. В связи с необходимостью длительного применения для лечения данной патологии гормональных средств широко обсуждается вопрос о влиянии гестагенов на организм женщины, а также влиянии их на метаболизм липидов, особенно у женщин с избыточной массой тела. При применении гестагенов часто встречается синдром непереносимости гестагенов (СНГ), который проявляется в симптомокомплексах: психопатоло гическом – беспокойство, депрессия, раздражительность, эмоциональная ла бильность, физикальном – акне, себорея, головные боли, напряжение молочных желез и метаболическом – избыток массы тела с перераспределением жировой ткани, нарушение карбогидратного метаболизма (инсулинорезистентность), нарушение липидного обмена. Метаболические побочные эффекты прогестагенов отмечаются обычно при длительном применении достаточно высоких доз препаратов. Механизмы их развития окончательно не выяснены, но профилактика этих эффектов необходима. Это особенно важно при лечении пациенток с нарушениями липидного обмена, сахарным диабетом, ожирением, а также при повышенном риске развития этой патологии. Именно для данной категории больных особенно важен тщательный выбор типа прогестагена, его оптимальной дозировки, длительности лечения и пути введения. В последние годы для лечения гормонозависимой патологии матки и контрацепции широко используют левоноргестрелсодержащую рилизинг-систему Мирена. Целью нашего исследования явилось изучение влияния внутриматочной системы Мирена ® на метаболические и физикальные параметры у пациенток с гормонозависимой патологией матки и ожирением.Результаты проведенного изучения липидного обмена на фоне применения Мирены ® позволяют сделать вывод, что ее применение в течение года не сопровождается развитием патологической гипер - или дислипидемии у пациенток с избыточной массой тела и ожирением.",

      "abstract": "Examined in this article is a portion inside Hyang’yak Gugeub-bang that is related to female disorder and diseases, and the Goryeo society’s view on females’ pregnancy as well as giving birth to children. This portion is the “Bu’in Jab-bang” chapter (gynecopathy section) in the Hyang’yak Gugeubbang’s Second volume, and this chapter contains documentation of symptoms and prescriptions specifically meant for female diseases that are mostly associated with pregnancy or childbirth. Issues that are primarily dealt here are 1) things that should not be attempted or occur during pregnancy, including vaginal/anal blood discharge, 2) difficult deliveries (dystocia), with cases of stillborn or agrippa(upside-down) babies, and 3) postpartum complications, including excessive bleeding, stroke and depression.BR Further examination of “Bu’in Jab-bang” reveals other aspects as well.BR First, this chapter does not discuss the ‘cause’ for symptoms. Without engaging any “Byeonjeung Nonchi” discussion, it only provides symptoms and treatments. Primary symptoms listed here are difficult deliveries and postpartum complications. In other words, it is a chapter dedicated to pre-natal and post-natal emergency conditions and responses. Treatments are also simple ones that could be executed swiftly and efficiently.BR Second, as can be deduced from Hyang’yak Gugeub-bang’s very title, medication of this book usually employs local materials with medicinal properties that could easily be obtained and be used in emergency situations. The “Bu’in Jab-bang” chapter is no exception, as it is designed to be used and consulted in unusual situations -such as difficult deliveries or postpartum problems- rather than general female disorders.BR Third, in this particular chapter, several Chinese medical texts are quoted, while some Goryeo treatments are also introduced. The Chinese ones included in this book seems to have been ones that were selected by the Goryeo people for their own purposes and situations.BR Fourth, the ‘Symptoms & Prescriptions Only’ approach of this book and especially this chapter should have made this book a must-have one for females in emergency distress. Female childbirth and postpartum healthcare was an issue that had nothing to do with the individual’s social class or occupation, and literally a universal one. The book must have been used and consulted widely and massively.BR Other symptoms and prescriptions in the rest of Hyang’yak Gugeub-bang are related to male diseases and male conditions. It was created and used primarily by male Sadaebu figures. Female disorder is only addressed in a very limited fashion, and even the very chapter dedicated to that area only refers to childbirth-related issues. This shows us that Hyang’yak Gugeub-bang’s creators, practitioners and readers –all dominant male leaders of the Sadaebu class- only regarded the female body in the context of its role in human procreation.",

      "abstract": "All medical treatments for endometriosis are equally effective in relieving pain. However, all of them alleviate pain symptoms for as long as they are used, but pain always relapses when medication is discontinued. Therefore, medications need to be used in the long term.Formulations of estro-progestins that contain less than 50 µg of estrogen are associated with a low risk of venous thrombosis, myocardial infarction and stroke. When considering the neoplastic effects, data suggest that the overall risk of invasive cancer by age 60 is not increased in previous users of hormonal contraceptives. The use of progestins for contraception has never been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, venous thromboembolism or bone fractures. Although more data on long-term therapy with progestins are needed, treatment of endometriosis with progestins may be feasible in women with metabolic or cardiovascular contraindications to estroprogestin. The other medications for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis are less appropriate for long term administration because of side effects (danazol and GnRH analogues), costs (aromatase inhibitors and GnRH agonists) or necessity of complex regimens of associations (GnRH agonists and add back therapy or aromatase inhibitors plus progestins).Progestins and estroprogestins are safe drugs to use in the long term. Adherence to these medications may be high because, being a contraceptive, they are perceived less as a medication for the treatment of a disease. The annual cost of therapy compares favorably with other available medications. Progestins and estroprogestins represent the first-line medications for the treatment of endometriosis associated pain.",

      "abstract": "Perforations of the uterus are of 2 types: 1) the IUD is completely in the peritoneal cavity; or 2) the IUD is partly in the peritoneal cavity, partly embedded in the uterine wall. The incidence of uterine perforation is 0.6, 0.6, 1.6 and 5.0/1000 for the loop, spiral, steel ring, and bows respectively; the type of applicator used may influence the rate. Devices similar to the Grafenberg ring and the Birnberg bow are associated with intestinal obstruction and predispose to bowel herniation. There is a virtual absence of endometrial reactions in the polythelene spirals and loops, which are pliable and unlikely to penetrate the intact uterine wall due to muscle contraction alone. Most perforations occur at the time of insertion; insertion during the early postpartum period or during the period of lactational amenorrhoea, or in the case of an undiagnosed pregnant uterus or an acutely anteflexed or retroflexed uterus can be the cause. Other factors are 1) the manner of insertion; 2) the consistency of the uterine wall and its position; and 3) the type of device and introducer used. Thorough knowledge of gynecological anatomy is required to avoid defective placements. The hypothesis of erosion of the uterine wall was based on misdiagnosis due to the use of plain films in cases of incomplete perforation; perforation is best diagnosed by hysterography. Although polyethylene devices are said to be free of irritation or adhesions inside the peritoneal cavity, laparotomy is probably the best treatment for all cases and particularly where the IUD is in an anterior position.",

      "title": "Lactational Amenorrhea: Neuroendocrine Pathways Controlling Fertility and Bone Turnover",
      "abstract": "Lactation is a physiological state of hyperprolactinemia and associated amenorrhea. Despite the fact that exact mechanisms standing behind the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis during lactation are still not clear, a general overview of events leading to amenorrhea may be suggested. Suckling remains the most important stimulus maintaining suppressive effect on ovaries after pregnancy. Breastfeeding is accompanied by high levels of prolactin, which remain higher than normal until the frequency and duration of daily suckling decreases and allows normal menstrual function resumption. Hyperprolactinemia induces the suppression of hypothalamic Kiss1 neurons that directly control the pulsatile release of GnRH. Disruption in the pulsatile manner of GnRH secretion results in a strongly decreased frequency of corresponding LH pulses. Inadequate LH secretion and lack of pre-ovulatory surge inhibit the progression of the follicular phase of a menstrual cycle and result in anovulation and amenorrhea. The main consequences of lactational amenorrhea are connected with fertility issues and increased bone turnover. Provided the fulfillment of all the established conditions of its use, the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) efficiently protects against pregnancy. Because of its accessibility and lack of additional associated costs, LAM might be especially beneficial in low-income, developing countries, where modern contraception is hard to obtain. Breastfeeding alone is not equal to the LAM method, and therefore, it is not enough to successfully protect against conception. That is why LAM promotion should primarily focus on conditions under which its use is safe and effective. More studies on larger study groups should be conducted to determine and confirm the impact of behavioral factors, like suckling parameters, on the LAM efficacy. Lactational bone loss is a physiologic mechanism that enables providing a sufficient amount of calcium to the newborn. Despite the decline in bone mass during breastfeeding, it rebuilds after weaning and is not associated with a postmenopausal decrease in BMD and osteoporosis risk. Therefore, it should be a matter of concern only for lactating women with additional risk factors or with low BMD before pregnancy. The review summarizes the effect that breastfeeding exerts on the hypothalamus-pituitary axis as well as fertility and bone turnover aspects of lactational amenorrhea. We discuss the possibility of the use of lactation as contraception, along with this method's prevalence, efficacy, and influencing factors.

      "abstract": "Obstetric fistula accounts for most genital tract fistulae seen in the developing countries and poses significant psychosocial stress on the woman. It is a cause of marital disharmony, stigmatization, and infertility. Thus, women with unrepaired vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) rarely present with coexisting pregnancy. We present a rare case of a 29-year-old unbooked G3P2 (1A) with unrepaired VVF who presented with an advanced second stage of labor of a preterm fetus at 32 weeks of gestation. She was referred from a primary health center in labor. She had ruptured her fetal membranes about 3 days before presentation. She had been experiencing continuous involuntary leakage of urine about 2 weeks after vaginal delivery of a macerated male stillbirth following prolonged labor at a traditional birth home about 13 months earlier. She had not sought any specialized care for her condition due to financial challenges. She had regular unprotected coitus despite urinary soiling; her menstrual cycle was regular and she achieved conception. At presentation, she was in intermittent painful distress with bearing down efforts and had ammoniacal fetor. Fundal height was 34 cm and a singleton fetus was palpated in longitudinal lie and cephalic presentation with a normal fetal heart rate. The fetal head was visible at the introitus without parting the labia, and amnii liquor was foul smelling with ammoniacal dermatitis of the vulva and upper thigh. She delivered a live male baby with poor APGAR scores and birth weight of 1.96 kg. A 4 cm × 4 cm mid-vaginal defect was noticed on the anterior vaginal wall accommodating an inflated balloon of urethral catheter. She subsequently had VVF repair and rehabilitation. Financial challenge is an impediment to adequate care of VVF. This report establishes the possibility of regular coitus leading to conception and a live birth despite ongoing urinary soilage. Enhancement of social support services is advocated.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Raynaud phenomenon is a well‐known condition that is characterized by episodic vasoconstriction of the extremities leading to pain and discoloration. It is more common among women than men and often results from exposure to cold or stress. Raynaud phenomenon can also affect the nipple during breastfeeding, causing severe pain and distress for the lactating individual and newborn, leading to premature cessation of breastfeeding. Raynaud phenomenon of the nipple is often confused with other breastfeeding pain causes, which can result in treatment oversights. The etiology of Raynaud phenomenon of the nipple is complex and thought to be caused by an interplay of hormones and stress in the peripartum period. Literature on this condition is limited, mostly consisting of case reports, and there are very little data about its recurrence in subsequent peripartum periods. Treatment options are similar to those for Raynaud phenomenon and, if initiated in a timely fashion, can allow breastfeeding to continue uninterrupted. This clinical rounds article presents a case report of Raynaud phenomenon of the nipple after a first birth and a reoccurrence during a subsequent (second) postpartum period. Discussion of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic tips, and appropriate treatment options are included.",

These tears are often associated with urinary and faecal incontinence and sexual dysfunction.3,4 Perineal damage may not only cause physical injury but may negatively affect the mothers psychological and emotional state.2",

In patients with primary amenorrhea, the presence or absence of sexual development should direct the evaluation. Constitutional delay of growth and puberty commonly causes primary amenorrhea in patients with no sexual development. If the patient has normal pubertal development and a uterus, the most common etiology is congenital outflow tract obstruction with a transverse vaginal septum or imperforate hymen. If the patient has abnormal uterine development, müllerian agenesis is the likely cause and a karyotype analysis should confirm that the patient is 46,XX. If a patient has secondary amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out. The treatment of primary and secondary amenorrhea is based on the causative factor. Treatment goals include prevention of complications such as osteoporosis, endometrial hyperplasia, and heart disease; preservation of fertility; and, in primary amenorrhea, progression of normal pubertal development.",

The second trimester is characterized by the nearly complete development of organ systems. The third trimester represents a period of rapid fetal growth. The risks related to pregnancy in those over 35 years, old, especially primiparity. The higher rates of fertility (age specific fertility rate) were seen in women from 25-29 years or from 30-34 years29. Women are still considered to be the sole responsible for pregnancy, while men continue being absolved or omitted from their participation in the reproductive even. One of the most common risk factors for a high risk pregnancy is the age of the mother. Women with age under 17 or over 35 are at greater risk of complications than those between their late teens and early 30s35. It is advantageous to diagnosis the pregnancy as promptly as possible when a sexually active woman misses a menstrual period or has symptoms suggestively of pregnancy. In the event of Desired Pregnancy, prenatal care can begin early and potentially harmful medications and activities such as drug and alcohol use, smoking and occupational chemical exposed can be halted.",

Aromatase deficiency (AD), a rare cause of '46, XX' disorder of sex development, mimics virilising CAH in many aspects; thus, the disease is often overlooked. Diagnosis of AD in women is much easier around puberty due to the presence of primary amenorrhoea, undeveloped breasts, androgen excess and tall stature with eunuchoid proportions. Diagnosing AD with confidence immediately after birth or during early childhood is a challenging task without genetic analysis. In resource-restricted settings, AD remains a diagnosis of exclusion particularly in this age group and history of maternal virilisation, non-progressive genital ambiguity, elevated gonadotrophins (follicle-stimulating hormone >>luteinising hormone), mildly delayed bone age with/without enlarged polycystic ovaries serve as important clues to the underlying AD.",

One of the causes of the short vagina is the hypoestrogenism that some women have, for various reasons, but in the premenopausal and menopausal women is, mainly, the decrease in hormones steroids by ovarian failure. There is a medical condition called deep dyspareunia (DD) that affects some climacteric and menopausal women with or without GSM, as well as women of any age. The DD does not occur, exclusively, during menopause, but is a source of discomfort at any age and is better explained by another diagnosis, the RSVS that presents chronic pelvic pain (CPP). The repeated deep dyspareunia leads to pelvic pain due two situations: 1- by primary dyspareunia - during intercourse, a bigger penis than the vagina can lead to injury of the vaginal tissue, 2- by secondary dyspareunia - there is an organic cause, as endometriosis or other, and just a penis touch this tissue, the patient fill pain. The goal is to show that many causes of chronic pelvic pain treated as a psychological cause, is concerned the RSVS. The ultimate aim is to improve the quality of sexual life of women.",

      "title": "Urinary incontinence in women",
      "abstract": "Diagnosis of a nonanatomic cause of urinary incontinence in a female patient depends on the examiner's powers of observation and willingness to listen and take a thorough history and perform a meticulous physical examination to identify symptoms that seem atypical of stress incontinence. In particular, the external genitalia, urethra, vagina, perineum, and lower extremities should be carefully examined. Also, thorough assessment of neurologic status is a must because abnormal neurologic function of the bladder is an absolute contraindication to surgery. Laboratory studies to rule out infection, intrinsic urinary tract disease, and associated medical problems presenting as voiding difficulties must be performed when deemed appropriate. Tests of bladder capacity and intravesical pressure and internal examination of the bladder and urethra may be done when the problem is not straightforward. In the majority of patients, however, the cause of urinary incontinence can be diagnosed or strongly suspected without such studies. Most likely to benefit from systematic evaluation and, depending on the findings, pharmacologic therapy are patients whose urinary incontinence does not match the pattern usual for stress incontinence. These patients may or may not have a demonstrable anatomic lesion, but their voiding complaints are definitely inconsistent with stress incontinence. Medical management may also produce great improvement in incontinent patients who are unfit for surgery or have undergone one or more failed operations. Most patients with atypical voiding problems, including those in whom incontinence develops after pelvic surgery, can meet with a great degree of success if evaluated and treated as described herein.",

      "abstract": "Infertility is defined as failure to achieve pregnancy during one year of frequent, unprotected intercourse. Evaluation generally begins after 12 months, but it can be initiated earlier if infertility is suspected based on history or if the female partner is older than 35 years. Major causes of infertility include male factors, ovarian dysfunction, tubal disease, endometriosis, and uterine or cervical factors. A careful history and physical examination of each partner can suggest a single or multifactorial etiology and can direct further investigation. Ovulation can be documented with a home urinary luteinizing hormone kit. Hysterosalpingography and pelvic ultrasonography can be used to screen for uterine and fallopian tube disease. Hysteroscopy and/or laparoscopy can be used if no abnormalities are found on initial screening. Women older than 35 years also may benefit from ovarian reserve testing of follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels on day 3 of the menstrual cycle, the clomiphene citrate challenge test, or pelvic ultrasonography for antral follicle count to determine treatment options and the likelihood of success. Options for the treatment of male factor infertility include gonadotropin therapy, intrauterine insemination, or in vitro fertilization. Infertility attributed to ovulatory dysfunction often can be treated with oral ovulation-inducing agents in a primary care setting. Women with poor ovarian reserve have more success with oocyte donation. In certain cases, tubal disease may be treatable by surgical repair or by in vitro fertilization. Infertility attributed to endometriosis may be amenable to surgery, induction of ovulation with intrauterine insemination, or in vitro fertilization. Unexplained infertility may be managed with ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination, or both. The overall likelihood of successful pregnancy with treatment is nearly 50 percent.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Neonatal menstruation is considered the most neglected uterine bleeding, but it was concluded to be a marker of fetal stress. It is more common in preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and isoimmunization.¹ It has a prevalence of 5% in healthy newborns, which is lower in preterm newborns and higher in low birth weight newborns.² Case description: A 6-days-old female born with 41 weeks of gestation presented a 2-day history of vaginal bleeding without other symptoms or history of trauma. Physical examination evidenced vaginal bleeding, without external lesions (fig.1). Complementary diagnostic tests were not performed. Following vigilance, vaginal bleeding was present for 6 days and stopped on the 10th day of life. Discussion: Vaginal bleeding in the neonatal period results from desquamation of the endometrium, triggered by the decline in circulating steroid hormones. It often begins 3 to 5 days after birth and typically lasts up to 10 days³ - a chronology similar to the case presented. Some newborns with neonatal menstruation experience retrograde menstruation, which causes implantation of endometrial cells in the abdominal cavity, which may lead to an increased risk of early endometriosis. Newborns who have this complication should be evaluated so that an early diagnosis of endometriosis can be made in the future in children who begin with pelvic pain or severe menstrual pain.",

      "abstract": "A case report of a 31-year-old woman gravida 1 para 1 who was hospitalized after almost 1 year of amenorrhea following the discontinuance of oral contraception is presented. Before the patient was hospitalized withdrawal bleeding was not produced by Gestest Provera or Clomid. A 4-day period resulted from withdrawal of Premarin. A light period also occurred after Clomid treatment after 13 months of amenorrhea but it was not until after 20 months of amenorrhea that the patient experienced her first spontaneous period. The author noted that in the previous 5 months he had seen 5 other patients experiencing prolonged amenorrhea following oral contraception. A review of the literature shows that more than 100 cases have been reported in which amenorrhea followed discontinuance of oral contraception. It is recommended that when amenorrhea persists for 12 months or longer thorough investigation is indicated to exclude pituitary adenoma or other endocrinopathies. While it appears that spontaneous remission will eventually occur treatment with clomiphene glucocorticoids or gonadotropins might be tried after appropriate studies. Sequential products appear to be preferable to combination products for patients with menstrual abnormalities dating from the menarche and for patients with unproven fertility. It is further recommended that the tablets be discontinued after 2 years of consecutive use and that menstrual function be allowed to return to normal prior to resumption.",

      "title": "Management of Mesh and Graft Complications in Gynecologic Surgery",
      "abstract": "This document focuses on the management of complications related to mesh used to correct stress urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse. Persistent vaginal bleeding, vaginal discharge, or recurrent urinary tract infections after mesh placement should prompt an examination and possible further evaluation for exposure or erosion. A careful history and physical examination is essential in the diagnosis of mesh and graft complications. A clear understanding of the location and extent of mesh placement, as well as the patient's symptoms and therapy goals, are necessary to plan treatment approaches. It is important that a treating obstetrician-gynecologist or other gynecologic care provider who seeks to revise or remove implanted mesh be aware of the details of the index procedure. Diagnostic testing for a suspected mesh complication can include cystoscopy, proctoscopy, colonoscopy, or radiologic imaging. These tests should be pursued to answer specific questions related to management. Given the diverse nature of complications related to mesh-augmented pelvic floor surgery, there are no universal recommendations regarding minimum testing. Approaches to management of mesh-related complications in pelvic floor surgery include observation, physical therapy, medications, and surgery. Obstetrician-gynecologists should counsel women who are considering surgical revision or removal of mesh about the complex exchanges that can occur between positive and adverse pelvic floor functions across each additional procedure starting with the device implant. Detailed counseling regarding the risks and benefits of mesh revision or removal surgery is essential and can be conducted most thoroughly by a clinician who has experience performing these procedures. For women who are not symptomatic, there is no role for intervention.",

      "title": "The concept of superfetation: a critical review on a ‘myth’ in mammalian reproduction",
      "abstract": "Superfetation is understood as another conception during an already ongoing pregnancy. This implies the existence of young of different developmental stages within the female reproductive tract during certain periods of pregnancy. Nevertheless, a clear definition of the term as well as distinct criteria to identify the occurrence of superfetation in a species is missing. The variable anatomy of mammalian reproductive tracts seems to make the occurrence of superfetation more or less likely but impedes the simple evaluation of whether it is present or not. Additionally, adequate determination methods are missing or are difficult to apply at the right time. Superfetation or rather superfetation-like pregnancies are reported for numerous species including humans, livestock and rodents. The usual criteria to assume a case of superfetation include the finding of discordantly developed young within the uterus during post mortem or parturition of young after a birth interval shorter than the assumed pregnancy length. Often the occurrence of superfetation is concluded because other explanations of reproductive artifacts are missing. Even severe reproductive pathologies are often confused with superfetation. True superfetation or superfetation as a reproductive strategy may exist in some mammals. In the American mink (Neovison (Mustela) vison) and the European badger (Meles meles) superfetation occurs in combination with embryonic diapause. In the European brown hare (Lepus europaeus), superfetation has long been assumed to exist but evidence is still controversial. Superfetation definitely occurs in certain species of poeciliid and zenarchopterid fish, some of which also exhibit viviparity and maternal care. In mammals, the evolution of such a reproductive mechanism poses many interesting evolutionary, endocrine, microbial and immunological questions that require further investigation. Here we review the scant and at times ancient literature on this poorly understood topic. The different manifestations of superfetation are defined and reliable criteria to detect superfetation are outlined. Also, the differentiation of superfetation into a reproductive strategy or as a disrupted, abnormal reproductive function is discussed. Due to the different discussed functional aspects of superfetation, it is appropriate to establish a more detailed scheme to classify the true natural superfetation cases into superfertilization, superconception and superfetation proper. To date, there is no mammal species known for which superfetation proper in terms of finding discordantly developed fetuses has been conclusively demonstrated to be not only a rare occurence but an evolved reproductive strategy.",

      "title": "Chronic Stress and Ovulatory Dysfunction: Implications in Times of COVID-19",
      "abstract": "Stress is known to be associated with adverse health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdowns are examples of chronic stressors. Lockdown measures inadvertently caused significant psychological distress and became a powerful source of anxiety/stress, sleep disturbances, nutritional changes and weight gain. Stress is known to impact women's health specifically, through hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis dysfunction and resultant ovulatory dysfunction. Such dysfunction may manifest in menstrual irregularities and/or infertility due to hypothalamic hypogonadism. Here, we review the key physiological mediators of stress and associated ovulatory dysfunction. The kisspeptinergic system is comprised of sets of neurons located in the hypothalamus, the rostral periventricular region of the third ventricle (RP3V) and the arcuate nucleus (ARC). This system links nutrition, reproductive signals and stress. It plays a key role in the function of the HPG axis. During chronic stress, the kisspeptinergic system affects the HPG axis, GnRH pulsatility, and, therefore, ovulation. Leptin, insulin and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) are thought to be additional key modulators in the behavioral responses to chronic stress and may contribute to stress-related ovulatory dysfunction. This mini-review also summarizes and appraises the available evidence on the negative impact of chronic stress as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. It proposes physiological mechanisms to explain the observed effects on women's reproductive health and well-being. The review suggests areas for future research.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Perineal pain in the puerperium of women with perineal traumas can affect the quality of life and interfere with normal activities and physiological needs. In addition, many obstetric practitioners neglect this symptom and an incipient scientific production about the characterization of this pain is observed. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the characteristics of perineal pain in women with perineal traumas due to episiotomy and laceration, according to the Brazilian Version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire, in a public maternity hospital in the interior of Bahia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out with 499 postpartum women who had a vaginal delivery and who presented with perineal pain associated with local traumas. RESULTS: The characterization of perineal pain was the same for both traumas, being described as \"that jerk\", \"boring\" and \"uncomfortable\". CONCLUSION: Perineal pain has considerable intensity and causes discomfort in women. Therefore, it is important that the episiotomy is performed in a restricted way and that the professionals seek to use techniques of perineal protection, as this will reduce the frequency of perineal pain and provide greater comfort to the woman in the immediate puerperium.",

It sets out by saying that these causes may lie in both partners or in either of them, but in the sequel the author devotes most of his attention to problems of the female body. Thus he discusses the state of the uterus, the occurrence and modalities of menstruation, the condition and position of the mouth of the uterus, the emission of fluid during sleep (when the woman dreams that she is having intercourse with a man), physical weakness or vigour on awakening after this nocturnal emission, the occurrence of flatulence in the uterus and the ability to discharge this, moistness or dryness of the uterus, wind-pregnancy, and spasms in the uterus. Then he briefly considers the possibility that the cause of infertility lies with the male, but this is disposed of in one sentence: if you want to find out whether the man is to blame, the author says, just let him have intercourse with another woman and see whether that produces a satisfactory result.",

      "abstract": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation of menstrual CA-125 levels with pregnancy rates (PRs) after 6 months of treatment for infertility.The sample consisted of a heterogenous group of 160 women who sought treatment for infertility. Treatments include progesterone supplementation, donor insemination, intrauterine insemination, and ovulation induction therapy. No laparoscopies were done during the study period. A baseline CA-125 level was drawn during menses before the initiation of therapy. Patients were followed for 6 months of treatment or until a pregnancy was achieved.There was no difference in the 6 month PR or viable PR by CA-125 level.Elevated CA-125 levels are not predictive of poor fertility potential at least during the first 6 months of infertility therapy. Even though these higher levels sometimes suggest that endometriosis is present, the data suggest that correction of male factor, cervical factor or ovulation factor provides effective PRs without the need for laparoscopic intervention.",

      "abstract": "( J Clin Anesth . 2022;80:110795 | https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinane.2022.110795 |) Labor involves significant pain for the mother, influenced by various factors. The ability to control this pain positively impacts the mother’s psychological and physiological well-being. Epidural analgesia is commonly chosen for pain relief during vaginal delivery. Mother-infant bonding, crucial for a child’s later attachment and self-perception, develops from pregnancy into early childhood. A strong bond correlates with positive parenting, cognitive development, and improved neurobehavioral outcomes. Impaired bonding, affecting 7% to 11.3% of mothers, can lead to long-term issues for both mother and child, including depression, anxiety, and socioemotional challenges. Several risk factors for impaired bonding include primiparity, negative feelings toward pregnancy, low birth weight, higher education, and postpartum depression. Pain during labor, a significant element, may impact the bonding process. Studies on epidural analgesia’s association with postpartum depression yield conflicting results, and no research examines its connection to mother-infant bonding. The primary study’s aim is to explore the link between epidural analgesia and mother-infant bonding, with a secondary focus on its association with postpartum depression immediately after childbirth.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: Foetal surgery is a relatively new branch of medicine; the health providers involved are currently wondering what kind of anaesthesia should be provided to the foetuses. In the last few years, new advances have been reported on foetal sensoriality and capability for feeling pain; meanwhile alerts have been issued on the risks of prolonged anaesthesia in the early infancy. Aim of this paper is reviewing the main data on foetal pain, to be aware of which is the time in pregnancy when it is likely to be felt. The secondary aim is to point out which are the anaesthetics and analgesics appropriate for prenatal surgery. Mechanism: A review of the literature published in the last 20 years in the field of fetal sensoriality and fetal sergery has been carried out; the most pertinent papers have been retrieved, and their conclusions are here summarized and analysed. Findings in brief: Pain can be felt by the human fetus in the second half of pregnancy: data of physiological and behavioural studies show it with increasing evidence, as long as the gestational age increases. With regard to the best anaesthesia in this case, it seems that the mere anaesthetics given to the mother, though apparently sufficient during laparoscopic surgery, are not sufficient to anesthetize the foetus during open surgery; here some references are given for the best and safest foetal direct analgesic treatment. Conclusions: Surgeons should approach carefully fetal surgery, according with the latest findings in this field.",

      "title": "Abortion beyond limits : rights, restrictions, and reform in Belgium",
      "abstract": "Abortion laws worldwide increasingly restrict access to abortion as the gestational age of the pregnancy advances. In Belgium, abortion after 12 weeks is permitted only for severe fetal or maternal health conditions. Those not qualifying on medico-legal grounds must continue their pregnancies or travel abroad, with 400–500 Belgian abortion-seekers annually traveling to the Netherlands for abortions post-12 weeks. Using conceptual, doctrinal, and comparative legal analysis combined with empirical data, this research investigates the relationship between abortion timing and the law, focusing on legal restrictions on abortion beyond the first trimester in Belgium. It explores health professionals’ interpretations and experiences of these restrictions and evaluates alternative legal approaches, such as decriminalization and constitutionalizing abortion rights. Findings reveal that substantive, procedural, criminal, and temporal legal restrictions intricately shape the legal status of later-stage abortion. Many restrictions negatively affect abortion-seekers without compelling, evidence-based justifications. Broad criminal provisions on unlawful abortion lack differentiated sanctions and fail to meet the “last resort” threshold for criminalization. This theoretically broad risk of criminalization contrasts with virtually nonexistent prosecutions of abortions. In contrast to “social” abortion, abortion for severe medical conditions is widely available post-12 weeks in Belgium. Obstetricians, complying with legal requirements, primarily value compelling clinical factors when assessing later-stage abortion requests. However, the research finds that secondary factors—such as parental and patient preferences, institutional norms, technical challenges, and patients’ socioeconomic backgrounds—influence professional acceptance of abortion when clinical factors are inconclusive. The law does not acknowledge these secondary factors, revealing a certain disconnect between law and practice. Obstetricians providing “medical” abortion also typically differentiate it from “social” abortion and express ethical and logistical concerns about extending time limits for the latter, primarily citing discomfort and unfamiliarity with second-trimester surgical abortion methods. This research highlights the harms of denying later-stage abortion, addressing abortion-seekers’ autonomy, vulnerability, and reproductive justice. It also recommends ensuring a trained and willing workforce, centralized second-trimester services, and sufficient resources should the 12-week time limit expand. The research also calls for more nuanced perspectives on claims about the effects of (de)criminalizing abortion. It underscores the potential of constitutionalizing reproductive rights, including abortion rights, to address their fundamental nature and existing gaps in protection under European and Belgian fundamental rights law. Regulatory approaches to later-stage abortion should continue to be evaluated based on their alignment with human rights and health principles, robust evidence base, legal clarity, and stakeholders’ needs, particularly of abortion-seekers.",

      "title": "Gestalt Breastfeeding: Helping Mothers and Infants Optimize Positional Stability and Intraoral Breast Tissue Volume for Effective, Pain-Free Milk Transfer",
      "abstract": "In the past decade, biological nurturing and activation of maternal and infant instincts after birth have constituted a major advance in clinical breastfeeding support. Yet, physiologic breastfeeding initiation is not enough to ensure ongoing pain-free and effective breastfeeding for many pairs. Current interventions, including \"hands-off\" mammalian approaches, do not improve breastfeeding outcomes, including in randomized controlled trials. Back-arching, difficulty latching or staying on the breast, and fussing at the breast are common signs of infant positional instability during breastfeeding. These cues are, however, often misdiagnosed as signs of medical conditions or oral connective tissue abnormalities, and underlying positional instability is not addressed. New clinical approaches are urgently required. This article offers a clinical approach to fit and hold (or latch and positioning)- gestalt breastfeeding, which aims to optimize positional stability and intraoral breast tissue volumes for pain-free effective breastfeeding. The word gestalt (pronounced \"ger-shtolt\") means a whole that is more than the sum of its parts. Gestalt breastfeeding builds on the theoretical foundations of complexity science, physiologic breastfeeding initiation, and new understandings of the biomechanics of infant suck elucidated in ultrasound studies. It also integrates simple psychological strategies from applied functional contextualism, popularly known as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, empowering women to attend mindfully to breast sensations and their infant's cues. Gestalt breastfeeding can be reproduced for research purposes, including in comparison studies with oral surgery, and has the potential to improve breastfeeding outcomes.",

The condition is rare, and the underlying mechanisms are not yet fully elucidated. However, pseudocyesis more commonly occurs among women of lower socioeconomic status with a chronic history of subfertility. Disadvantaged socioeconomic circumstances can lead to delayed presentation, with disappointment for the woman when she is eventually informed that she is not pregnant. To contribute to the body of literature regarding pseudocyesis, we present and discuss the case of 44-year-old woman with a history of nine recurrent miscarriages who was referred from the local clinic with elevated blood pressures after late booking at 36 weeks, without prior antenatal care or ultrasound scan. Subsequent clinical examination and ultrasonography revealed an empty uterus, leading to a diagnosis of a pseudocyesis. The patient was appropriately referred to the psychiatrists and physicians for further management.",

      "title": "Fetal Pain",
      "abstract": "Proposed federal legislation would require physicians to inform women seeking abortions at 20 or more weeks after fertilization that the fetus feels pain and to offer anesthesia administered directly to the fetus. This article examines whether a fetus feels pain and if so, whether safe and effective techniques exist for providing direct fetal anesthesia or analgesia in the context of therapeutic procedures or abortion.Systematic search of PubMed for English-language articles focusing on human studies related to fetal pain, anesthesia, and analgesia. Included articles studied fetuses of less than 30 weeks' gestational age or specifically addressed fetal pain perception or nociception. Articles were reviewed for additional references. The search was performed without date limitations and was current as of June 6, 2005.Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus. Neither withdrawal reflexes nor hormonal stress responses to invasive procedures prove the existence of fetal pain, because they can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing. Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks' gestational age, while electroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks. For fetal surgery, women may receive general anesthesia and/or analgesics intended for placental transfer, and parenteral opioids may be administered to the fetus under direct or sonographic visualization. In these circumstances, administration of anesthesia and analgesia serves purposes unrelated to reduction of fetal pain, including inhibition of fetal movement, prevention of fetal hormonal stress responses, and induction of uterine atony.Evidence regarding the capacity for fetal pain is limited but indicates that fetal perception of pain is unlikely before the third trimester. Little or no evidence addresses the effectiveness of direct fetal anesthetic or analgesic techniques. Similarly, limited or no data exist on the safety of such techniques for pregnant women in the context of abortion. Anesthetic techniques currently used during fetal surgery are not directly applicable to abortion procedures.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a physical condition involving biological changes in the brain, hormone levels, and immune system prior and up to the menstrual flow starting. This syndrome has not always been understood and has only received widespread recognition in the last two decades. The alterations in both body and mind that take place in the days preceding menstruation foreshadow its arrival. We now know PMS is biological in nature, and laboratory or neurological tests can record some of these premenstrual events even if they are barely noticed or imperceptible to a woman. Although menstruation is usually felt to be a natural and unavoidable regular occurrence, to which most women accommodate without complaint and with scarcely visible impact on their daily lives, nonetheless most women experience low-level discomfort such as bloating, fatigue, and backaches in the week before their periods. For about 30 to 40 percent of the female population, the symptoms they experience during this time can cause significant discomfort. But for 3 to 7 percent of women premenstrual syndrome means difficult bouts of emotional upheaval including fear, frustration, and rage that can have devastating effects on these women’s daily lives. The most frequent PMS symptoms are fatigue (92 percent), irritability (91 percent), abdominal distention (90 percent), nervous tension (89 percent), breast tenderness (85 percent), mood changes (81 percent), depression (80 percent), and increased appetite (78 percent).",

      "title": "Discovering endometriosis biomarkers with multiplex cytokine arrays",
      "abstract": "Chronic pelvic pain is often overlooked during primary examinations because of the numerous causes of such \"vague\" symptoms. However, this pain can often mask endometriosis, a smoldering disease that is not easily identified as a cause of the problem. As such, endometriosis has been shown to be a potentially long-term and often undiagnosed disease due to its vague symptoms and lack of any non-invasive testing technique. Only after more severe symptoms arise (severe pelvic pain, excessive vaginal bleeding, or infertility) is the disease finally uncovered by the attending physician. Due to the nature and complexity of endometriosis, high throughput approaches for investigating changes in protein levels may be useful for elucidating novel biomarkers of the disease and to provide clues to help understand its development and progression. A large multiplex cytokine array which detects the expression levels of 260 proteins including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, adhesion molecules, angiogenesis factors and other was used to probe biomarkers in plasma samples from endometriosis patients with the intent of detecting and/or understanding the cause of this disease. The protein levels were then analyzed using K-nearest neighbor and split-point score analysis. This technique identified a 14-marker cytokine profile with the area under the curve of 0.874 under a confidence interval of 0.81–0.94. Our training set further validated the panel for significance, specificity, and sensitivity to the disease samples. These findings show the utility and reliability of multiplex arrays in deciphering new biomarker panels for disease detection and may offer clues for understanding this mysterious disease.",

      "abstract": "An ectopic pregnancy (EP) occurs when the blastocyst implants outside the endometrial lining of the uterine cavity. The loss of fertility poses a dilemma in the radical treatment of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. This case report is presented in line with the SCARE criteria. A 36-year-old woman, G3P1 + 1 L1, at 8 weeks of gestation, presented with lower abdominal pain that was localized in the left iliac region. The pain was not associated with per vaginal spotting or bleeding. Pelvic ultrasonography revealed a significant fluid collection in the pouch of Douglas. A left salpingectomy was performed. A history of one ectopic pregnancy increases the risk of a subsequent EP by approximately 10 %, while having more than one previous ectopic pregnancy raises the risk to around 25 %. In communities where reproduction is believed to be an essence of womanhood, the loss of fertility carries serious socio-cultural consequences. These include not only external stigma but also internalized self-stigma that presents a significant dilemma when considering definitive treatment for a recurrent contralateral ruptured EP in a patient with a prior salpingectomy, particularly in low-resource settings, where IVF-ET and egg/embryo freezing are costly or unavailable. Surgical management of recurrent EP does not significantly impact the outcomes of IVF-ET. A patient who refuses salpingectomy after a recurrent ruptured EP faces a dilemma between preserving autonomy and preventing potentially life-threatening complications. A comprehensive approach should include discussions about alternative fertility options, patient education, psychological support, and ensuring that all decisions are fully informed.",

      "abstract": "Pregnancy is a special period in a woman's life characterized by rapid physiological, psychological, and social changes during a relatively short period that may predispose women to anxiety (1).A variety of issues in pregnancy may provoke anxiety in women.Among such issues are worries about childbirth and health of the baby, quality of care during labor, the extent of husbands' support and involvement in maternal health care, and the level of support from relatives and friends (2,3).Pregnancy anxiety is different from general anxiety.It is a relatively distinct syndrome which is provoked by pregnancy-specific fears and worries (4).Women who are anxious, experience both emotional and somatic symptoms such as worry, muscle pain, palpitation, insomnia, and gastrointestinal discomfort (2).It has been suggested that high levels of pregnancy-related anxiety play a role in preterm birth (5-8), postpartum depression, and caesarean (7).In addition, it could affect fetal, infant and child development (7,9).Several studies have highlighted the need for the routine measurement of pregnancy anxiety during pregnancy to enable the design of appropriate interventions (10-13).The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a widely used measure of general anxiety, has also been commonly used in research on pregnancy anxiety (14).The STAI scale is suitable for assessing the general level of anxiety, but it does not measure pregnancy-specific stressors (2).Another critique of the use of STAI scale for measuring pregnancy-related anxiety is that it might not predict maternal and child outcomes (2,15,16).The results of a study showed that whereas childbirth-specific anxiety was an important predictor of childbirth duration, general anxiety as measured by the STAI had no predictive value in this regard (17).It is, therefore, important to design and validate an appropriate instrument for measuring pregnancy anxiety.Since pregnancy-related anxiety involves multiple factors related to infant, mother, and childbirth, it needs to be measured by a specialized multidimensional instrument.Apart from some instruments in a true or false format, few instruments for measuring pregnancy-related anxiety are at present available which can measure the severity of anxiety (2) and which also have a clear factorial structure.Levin examined the factorial structure of the Pregnancy",

      "abstract": "Amenorrhea, also known as absence of menstruation, is a condition where menstrual periods stop unexpectedly or do not begin at the expected age. This article explains the two main types of amenorrhea—primary and secondary—and outlines the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatments. Covering a wide range of contributing factors, the article discusses hormonal imbalances, lifestyle habits like excessive exercise or stress, and medical conditions such as PCOS or thyroid disorders. It also explores common situations like pregnancy, birth control use, and menopause-related changes. Readers will find clear guidance on when amenorrhea is considered normal and when it may require medical attention. The article explains how the absence of menstruation can impact fertility and long-term health, including the risks of low estrogen and bone loss. Diagnostic tools such as blood tests, ultrasounds, and MRIs are reviewed in plain language, along with both medical and natural treatment options. Emotional and mental health aspects are also addressed, helping readers understand the psychological impact of menstrual irregularities. This article is designed for anyone looking to understand why their period is missing, what might be causing it, and what steps to take next. It is presented in simple terms to ensure it is understandable for all readers.",

The Pearl Index for these preparations when properly administered is less than 1. The most common side effect of using these preparations is menstrual irregularities; 71% of MP users and 47% of NET users never experience even 1 normal menstrual cycle per year. 35% of MP users and 9% of NET users do not experience a menstrual bleeding between the injections. Headache, depression, and leg cramps are other side effects of these preparations. Normal menstruation is observed about 8 months after discontinuing MP use and 3-6 months after NET use.

Este período inclui a menopausa, que é definida como a cessação definitiva da menstruação após 12 meses consecutivos de amenorreia. A perceção histórica da menopausa tem variado consideravelmente: no século XIX, era vista como uma doença e sinal de declínio, enquanto atualmente é frequentemente considerada uma fase libertadora. Com o aumento da esperança de vida, tem sido dada mais atenção às consequências do climatério e da menopausa. A Organização Mundial de Saúde enfatiza a necessidade de apoio biopsicossocial durante esta transição, promovendo a sensibilização, o diagnóstico, o tratamento e a educação para a menopausa. A menopausa é causada pelo esgotamento da função ovárica, resultando na diminuição do estrogénio e no fim da ovulação. Durante o climatério, ocorrem diversas alterações hormonais e físicas, incluindo: sintomas vasomotores, perturbações sexuais e cognitivas, perda óssea e problemas urinários. O diagnóstico da menopausa baseia-se na história clínica e nos níveis hormonais. Estratégias como o tratamento hormonal podem aliviar os sintomas e melhorar a qualidade de vida. É essencial reconhecer e abordar a menopausa de forma adequada, superando tabus e garantido um apoio informativo e solidário, para melhorar a experiência das mulheres durante esta fase da vida.",

      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pain during labor is a physiological condition commonly experienced by most maternity mothers. Labor pain is a subjective experience caused by uterine muscle ischemia, withdrawal and traction of uterine ligaments, ovarian traction, fallopian tubes and lower uterine distension, pelvic floor muscles and perineum. The pain in labor arises from psychic responses and physical reflexes. The purpose of this Systematic review is to look at effective methods for reducing pain in the labor process so that it can be used as an alternative method of reducing pain in patients who will give birth. This review systematic review of the published artike through google scholar site with 17 journals reviewed. In an effort to reduce labor pain there are various methods that can be used in providing midwifery care in the process of childbirth. Based on this systematic review it can be concluded that many methods of pain reduction that can be used in reducing labor pain are counter pressure and abdominal lifting, hypnobirthing, religious and murottal music, classical music and local music, relaxation, compress, warm ginger drink, acupressur , TENS, account and aromatherapy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

      "title": "Natural Variation in Testosterone is Associated With Hypoalgesia in Healthy Women",
      "abstract": "Sex differences in pain are well established, with women reporting greater incidence of clinical pain and heightened responsivity to experimental pain stimuli relative to men. Sex hormones (ie, estrogens, progestins, androgens) could contribute to extant differences in pain sensitivity between men and women. Despite this, there has been limited experimental research assessing the relationship between pain and sex hormones. The purpose of this study was to extend previous research and examine the association between sex hormones and nociceptive processing in healthy women.A total of 40 healthy women were tested during the mid-follicular, ovulatory, and late-luteal phases of the menstrual cycle (testing order counterbalanced). Salivary estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone were collected at each testing session and pain was examined from electrocutaneous threshold/tolerance, ischemia threshold/tolerance, and McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form ratings of noxious stimuli. Nociceptive flexion reflex threshold was assessed as a measure of spinal nociception.Overall, there were no significant menstrual phase-related differences in pain outcomes. Nonetheless, variability in testosterone (and to a lesser degree estradiol) was associated with pain; testosterone was antinociceptive, whereas estradiol was pronociceptive. No hormone was associated with nociceptive flexion reflex threshold.Although future research is needed to replicate and extend these findings to clinical populations (ie, chronic pain, premenstrual dysphoric disorder), results from the present study indicate that menstrual phase-related changes in sex hormones have minimal influence on experimental pain. However, individual differences in testosterone may play a protective role against pain in healthy women.",

      "title": "THE GENETICS OF SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "Sexual development is one of the significant stages of the embryogenesis. In this process, the gonadal differentiation taking place on a genetic basis (sex chromosomes) determines the sexual identity of the individual. Initially, the gonads are considered bipotential because the gonadal primordium can turn into a testicle or ovary through the activation of certain genetic elements in the subsequent period. When there is a disruption at any phase of this period, various clinical conditions called disorders of sexual development (DSD) arise. These conditions, often accompanied by various mutations or sex chromosome abnormalities, may include gonadal dysgenesis and result in a male (46, XY) or female (46, XX) sex reversal. DSD with 46,XY usually contains ambiguous condition, or the presence of female external and/or internal genitalia depending on whether Müllerian tissues are present. On the other hand, different enzyme defects, again, on a genetic basis can lead to disorders of sex development in both males (e.g. 5α-reductase) and females (e.g. aromatase). Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a relatively common, autosomal recessive enzyme defect, especially in 46,XX DSD cases. A number of syndromes lead to a certain degree of inadequate sexual development in males or masculinization in females. Patients also have some characteristic physical symptoms accompanied by mental problems. Gonadal dysgenesis can be caused by various mutations, mainly in the SRY gene (e.g. Swyer syndrome) or sex chromosome disorder (Turner syndrome). In cases of 46,XY DSD, mixed gonadal dysgenesis, and some other conditions, prophylactic gonadectomy may be considered because of the malignancy risk.",

      "abstract": "Uterine prolapse refers to the uterus descending into the vaginal canal because of weakened pelvic floor muscles and overstretched ligaments. It can occur at any age, but most often affects post-menopausal women. Common causes of uterine prolapse include childbirth, surgery, menopause, aging, extreme physical activity, and heavy lifting. There is also a genetic component. Uterine prolapse can be categorized as incomplete or complete: Incomplete uterine prolapse refers to partial displacement of the uterus into the vagina without protrusion to the exterior; complete prolapse refers to the uterus protruding from the vaginal opening. The severity of uterine prolapse is graded by how far the uterus descends: Grade I refers to the uterus descending to the upper vagina; Grade II refers to the uterus descending to the introits; Grade III refers to the cervix descending outside of the introitus; in Grade IV, the cervix and uterus have both descended outside the introitus. Symptoms depend on the severity of the prolapse; however, most women have a feeling of fullness or heaviness in the pelvic area that often worsens when coughing, standing, or lifting. Other symptoms include lower back pain, urinary incontinence or retention, bulging in the vagina, and problems with sexual intercourse. Uterine prolapse is generally diagnosed during a pelvic examination. Treatment depends on the severity of the prolapse. Self-care measures include Kegel exercises, avoidance of heavy lifting, managing chronic cough, and treatment of constipation. These can reduce the risk of uterine prolapse and prevent it from worsening. Nevertheless, in severe cases, a vaginal pessary, reduction of the uterus to its normal position, or hysterectomy may be needed. Here, we present a patient with a severe case of uterine prolapse. A vaginal hysterectomy with uterosacral ligament suspension and excision of redundant vaginal tissue was performed.",

      "abstract": "A prospective study of 12 unmedicated pregnant women in the second stage of labor was undertaken to assess the effects of bearing down efforts on brachial and popliteal blood pressure. Inferior vena cava compression, usually detected by reductions in mean and/or pulse pressure in the brachial artery, did not occur at any time, whether or not the uterus was displaced to the left. Abdominal aortic compression, suggested by popliteal pressure fall, was maintained into the second stage of labor, was aggravated when the women bore down, and was alleviated only when bearing down efforts ceased and the uterus was displaced to the left. Bearing down efforts are therefore yet another mechanism by which distal aortic and possibly uteroplacental blood flow can be prejudiced. Their avoidance can be advantageous to the fetus at risk.",

      "title": "The contraceptive benefit of breastfeeding.",
      "abstract": "Breastfeeding has long been a means of fertility regulation in traditional communities but only recently have attempts been made to characterize and quantify this attribute. Breastfeeding encompasses behavioral, geographical, and cultural factors, which account for the differences in the prevalence and practice of breastfeeding in different communities. Ovarian activity is suppressed in the breastfeeding mother. Initially the suppression is complete and the woman is amenorrheic. This is followed by anovulatory menstrual cycles or ovulatory cycles that manifest luteal phase deficiency or normal ovulatory cycles. The duration of ovarian follicular suppression is variable and recent work suggests that lactation suppresses ovarian activity by disturbing the pulsatile pattern of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion. During lactational amenorrhea, prolactin levels are high, LH levels are low to normal. Follicle stimulating hormone concentrations are normal by four weeks postpartum, and estrogen and progesterone levels are low. The degree of ovarian suppression is enhanced by increased frequency of suckling, longer duration of feeds, and more frequent night-time feeds. Introduction of supplementary feeds inhibits ovarian suppression. These and other factors account for variations in the length of lactational amenorrhea in an individual and between populations. The Bellagio Consensus Statement affirms that the risk of pregnancy in a fully breastfeeding, amenorrheic woman in the first six months of lactation is less than 2%. After the sixth month it is increasingly likely that ovulation will precede the first menstruation. The Bellagio Consensus has given scientific validity to birth-spacing in developing countries and the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) as a means of contraception. If breastfeeding ceases to be full, menstruation resumes, or the baby is more than six months old, alternative methods of contraception should be used. Breastfeeding should feature more prominently in fertility regulation programs and counseling, especially in developing countries.",

      "abstract": "Summary Anatomical (congenital or postinflammatory) or functional anomalies of the uroseminal intersection can induce a voiding dysfunction of the deferential ampullae and seminal vesicles, leading to infertility. In case of azoospermia or OAT-syndrome with poor semen volume and decreased vesicular markers, some clinical history and examination data can cause suspect of one of such anomalies. The transrectal ultrasonographic findings of anechoic area(s) inside the prostate and/or seminal vesicle (even after recent ejaculation), the peculiar vasovesiculographic pictures (especially after ejaculation following the contrast medium injection into the vasa deferentia), plus the evaluation of the “deferential-ampullary sperm reserve”, will permit a detailed diagnosis of the voiding dysfunction of the uroseminal crossing. A successful appropriate treatment of these pathologies can be done. Ultrasonically-guided transrectal puncture, or transurethral incision upstream of (or resection of) the ejaculatory duct orifices, or prolonged sexual abstinence, or artificial spermatocele of the vas deferens, or sperm recovering from urine for GIFT or IVF/ET after washing-out of the seminal tract by vas puncture are all methods, which can be selectively used depending on the individual case, to treat these forms of infertility. The authors present some paradigmatic clinical cases, and report that this pathology presumably occurs in up to 9% of non-selected infertile patient population. Zusammenfassung Anatomische (angeborene oder nach Entzündungen) und funktionelle Anomalien der uroseminalen Kreuzung können zu Entleerungsstörungen der Samenleiter-ampullen und der Bläschendrüse führen, die Infertilität bedingen. Bei Azoospermie oder OAT-Syndrom mit geringem Ejakulatvolumina und reduzierten Bläschendrüsen-Indikatoren können klinische Vorgeschichte und Untersuchungsbefunde den Verdacht auf solche Anomalien erregen. Transrektal-ultrasonographische Befunde, wie echoarme Zonen in der Prostata und/oder Bläschendrüse (auch unmittelbar nach Ejakulation), besondere vasove-sikulographische Befunde (vor allem nach Ejakulation, gefolgt von intravasaler Kontrast-mittelinjektion) sowie die Auswertung der “ampullär-deferentialen Spermienreserve” erlauben eine präzise Diagnose der Entleerungsstörungen der uroseminalen Kreuzung. Eine erfolgreiche und angemessene Behandlung dieser Störungen ist möglich. Ultraschall-kontrollierte transrektale Punktion oder transurethral Schlitzung oder Resektion der Öffnung der Spritzkanälchen oder verlängerte sexuelle Abstinenz oder künstliche Spermatozele des Vas deferens, wie auch Spermienanreicherung aus Urin für GIFT oder IVF/ET nach Spülung der Samenwege nach Samenleiterpunktion, sind Methoden, die gezielt je nach Fall ausgewählt werden können, um derartige Infertilitätsfälle zu behandeln. Die Verfasser präsentieren einige paradigmatische Fälle und stellen dar, daß diese Störung vermutlich in 9% aller nicht ausgewählten Fälle von Infertilitätspatienten vorliegt.",

      "abstract": "An ectopic pregnancy is located outside the uterus, mostly found in the fallopian tubes. The main predisposing factors are usually related to anatomical and/or functional disturbances of the fallopian tubes. Typically, an ectopic pregnancy presents with vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain in the first trimester of pregnancy, although it may be asymptomatic. The diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, which is based on transvaginal ultrasound associated with the serum beta fraction of human chorionic gonadotropin values, is of the highest relevance due to the mortality risk involved. We report the case of a 26-year-old woman who presented with a four-week history of amenorrhea and abdominal pain. Initially, the diagnostic hypothesis was a pelvic inflammatory disease, as the patient complained of pain during deep palpation of the lower quadrants of the abdomen, and gynecological observation detected malodorous discharge and cervical tenderness. Antibiotic treatment was initiated. The patient was later diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy, which was discovered during a routine pregnancy ultrasound. She was submitted to urgent laparotomy with intraoperative confirmation of the interstitial location of the gestational sac.",

The repeated injuries and strains on the vaginal outlet not only destroy the supports of the uterus, but dislocate and disarrange the surrounding pelvic structures. This may occur to such an extent that the injury and prolapse of the adjacent structures is of greater practical importance than the descent of the uterus itself. The problems connected with the treatment of severe prolapse are complicated. Not only are the mechanical difficulties great, but often the loss of tone and the atrophic condition of the tissues make them thin, friable, and difficult to operate on. On the other hand, after the menopause, the operator lias a certain advantage in that he is free to manipulate the tissues in any way he sees fit.He is no longer restricted by the need of providing for the possibilities",

      "title": "TWO IS TOO MUCH: THE IMPACT OF A THERAPIST'S SUCCESSIVE PREGNANCIES ON A FEMALE PATIENT",
      "abstract": "This paper explores the consequences of the therapist's two successive pregnancies on a female patient. The second pregnancy was felt to be particularly difficult and disturbing. One of the central reasons was that after the patient's birth, the mother had a disabled child, followed by a stillbirth and soon after that the father left to marry another woman. Using Freud's concept of deferred action I will argue that my second pregnancy revised these earlier traumatic experiences. The patient seemed to have incorporated and identified with a damaged maternal object that at the time of the original trauma was left husbandless, depressed and suffering from panic attacks. Although the therapist's healthy pregnancies seemed to reassure temporarily, it was difficult for the patient to hold onto a view of a helpful and productive therapist, one separate from this damaged internal mother. This was particularly so during and after the second pregnancy, where there was a marked absence of an idea of a third object, a father or a husband, who could help the patient deal with this pregnancy, her only escape was to retreat and act out. The acting out was in part identification with a fleeing father and in part a defence against the absence of such a third object, so that it was used as a way of avoiding claustrophobic feelings of being trapped with the damaged mother. Her feelings of triumph then produced much guilt, and impeded reparation. Another important issue that two successive pregnancies bring, are feelings of guilt in the therapist for exposing the patient to two major disruptions. In this patient's case it exacerbated the internal reality of a damaged maternal figure.",

      "abstract": "HELLP syndrome is a serious obstetrical complication that tends to occur in the second half of pregnancy that complicates six promiles of pregnancies. The term HELLP syndrome is derived from the beginning letters of the English words indicating laboratory changes, which is occurs as a specific illness in pregnancy. There is hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and a decreased platelet count. It can present itself with preeclampsia or without it. The most serious complications are disseminated intravascular coagulation, liver rupture or various organ failures. The pathogenesis at the moment is not completely known. The basic approach to care is delivery at the earliest possible term. HELLP syndrome generally arises in the second or third trimester of pregnancy, but can also occur after delivery. It has typical signs, which can also arise due to other liver diseases, but more frequently in diseases of the gall bladder, which in pregnancy given the physiological changes in the body of the pregnant women is also predisposed. In this context, woman with this problem can seek out other physicians than obstetricians. In our case, we wanted to refer to the needs of early diagnosis of this frequently diagnosed illness, since in the case of late diagnosis and a woman not sent to the obstetrical department can lead to a serious life threatening state for the mother and child.",

      "title": "Menstrual stress",
      "abstract": "Abstract Menstruation and stress are closely related. Stress can cause alterations of menstruation, while alterations of menstruation can result in stress. The normal menstrual pattern shows wide variations in cycle length from 21 to 36 days and the duration of menstrual flow may last from two to eight days, and there are variations both within and between individuals. The effect of the same stress on the menstrual pattern may be different and opposite in individuals, but the same response tends to continue throughout the menstrual lifespan. Menstrual synchrony can occur among those living closely together, while the male may influence the length of the woman's menstrual cycle depending on the frequency of contact. Formerly, many menstrual disorders for which no structural abnormality could be detected were regarded as being of psychological origin. With increasing knowledge of hormonal interactions, neurohormones, receptors and binding mechanisms, and with improved investigative techniques, such as radioimmunoassays, ultrasonic pelvic scan and laparoscopy, today many hormone abnormalities have been uncovered to account for menstrual disorders. Thus premenstrual syndrome is now known to be caused by a deficiency of progesterone, spasmodic dysmenorrhoea by an excess of prostaglandin F2 alpha and menopausal symptoms by oestrogen deficiency. These hormonal abnormalities can be corrected by appropriate therapy and should therefore now be recognized as coming within the ambiance of gynaecological endocrinologists.",

Risks associated with fibroids during pregnancy include potential for pain, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, higher cesarean delivery rate, fetal malpresentation, placenta abruption, and postpartum hemorrhage. Case Presentation This case describes a 26-year-old gravida 1 para 0 who presented at early term for severe abdominal pain and was found to have acute abdomen accompanied by a nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing. With emergent cesarean delivery, it was found that the patient was hemorrhaging from a ruptured vessel of a pedunculated fibroid and myomectomy was subsequently performed. Conclusion While rare, hemorrhage from a uterine fibroid should be considered a part of the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in pregnant patients with fibroids, particularly when accompanied by concurrent indicators such as free fluid, hypotension/tachycardia, or concerning changes in fetal heart rate, especially in a patient without risk factors for uterine rupture.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Many female patients with moyamoya disease are of childbearing years, including those who were diagnosed before entering their childbearing years. However, there have been no extensive reviews of the management of pregnancy and delivery in association with moyamoya disease. The purpose of this report is to describe the case of a patient with moyamoya disease complicated by pregnancy and to review the literature on other such cases. CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: We report a 23-year-old primipara with moyamoya disease who delivered uneventfully by cesarean section under spinal anesthesia at 38 weeks of gestation. In the literature, 30 cases were reported of patients who had been diagnosed with moyamoya disease before pregnancy and delivery, and 23 patients who were symptomatic and were diagnosed for the first time with moyamoya disease in association with pregnancy. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that pregnancy increases the risk of cerebrovascular accident or that bypass surgery decreases its risk. Poor prognosis of the patient or the newborn is mostly caused by cerebral hemorrhage and not by cerebral ischemia. It is important to control blood pressure and especially to avoid toxemia during pregnancy. Either cesarean section or vaginal delivery can be accomplished safely. Any anesthetic method can be used, provided special attention is given to avoiding hypocapnia, hypotension, and hypertension. Oral contraceptives should be avoided.",

Dampak dari proses fisiologis ini dapat timbul pada perilaku sehari-hari, ibu hamil menjadi lebih mudah marah atau tersinggung, gelisah, tidak mampu memusatkan pikiran, ragu-ragu, bahkan ingin lari dari kenyataan hidup, dan pada akhirnya kondisi ini akan menyebabkan kecemasan lebih lanjut (Wulandari, 2006). Sebagian besar wanita merasa sedih dan ambivalen tentang kenyataan bahwa ia hamil, kurang lebih 80% wanita mengalami kekecewaan, penolakan, kecemasan, depresi dan kesedihan (Varney, 2006).\r\nTrimester I sering dianggap sebagai periode penyesuaian yang dilakukan wanita adalah terhadap kenyataan bahwa ia sedang hamil. Penerimaan tehadap kenyataan ini dan arti bagi dirinya merupakan beban psikologis yang paling penting pada trimester I kehamilan. Ibu hamil yang dapat mengatasi permasalahannya sendiri atau dengan bantuan dari suami, keluarga, atau tenaga kesehatan, kehamilan dapat berjalan sesuai dengan yang diharapkan (Irianati, I, 2010). Tujuan dari penelitian adalah mengetahui korelasi antara dukungan keluarga dengan kecemasan ibu hamil trimester I di RSUD Sumedang.\r\nPenelitian analitik yang dilakukan adalah cross sectional. Waktu penelitian dilaksanakan pada bulan Mei 2013 – Juni 2013. Variabel independen yang diteliti adalah dukungan keluarga yang akan dikumpulkan dalam waktu bersamaan dengan variabel dependen yaitu kecemasan ibu hamil trimester 1. A\r\nPengumpulan data dengan menggunakan kuesioner yang sudah diuji validitas dan realibilitas. Besar sampel yang digunakan adalah 47 orang. Teknik pengambilan sampel teknik purposive sampling. Pengujian masalah penelitian dengan uji korelasi dari Spearman Rho\r\nHasil dari penelitian ini adalah sebagian besar dukungan keluarga yang dirasakan oleh ibu hamil trimester I adalah dukungan keluarga sedang yaitu 22 orang (47 %), bahwa ibu hamil trimester I sebagian besar mengalami cemas ringan yaitu 23 orang (49%). Berdasarkan uji statistik menggunakan analisis korelasi Spearman’s Rho maka mendapatkan hasil significancy (p): 0,002 dengan koefisien korelasi Spearman’s Rho (r): 0,449, dan memiliki koefisien korelasi (r) yang sedang.\r\nBila individu dihadapkan pada suatu stresor maka hubungan intim yang muncul karena adanya sistem keluarga dapat menghambat, mengurangi, bahkan mencegah timbulnya efek negatif stresor karena ikatan dalam keluarga dapat menimbulkan efek buffering (penangkal) terhadap dampak stresor. Munculnya efek ini dimungkinkan karena keluarga selalu siap dan bersedia untuk membantu individu ketika dibutuhkan serta hubungan antar anggota keluarga memunculkan perasaan dicintai dan mencintai. Individu dengan tingkat dukungan sosial tinggi memiliki perasaan kuat bahwa individu tersebut dicintai dan dihargai. Individu dengan dukungan sosial tinggi merasa bahwa orang lain peduli dan membutuhkan individu tersebut, sehingga hal ini dapat mengarahkan individu kepada gaya hidup yang sehat. Begitu juga dengan ibu hamil yang merasakan dukungan keluarga yang tinggi akan hidup sehat dengan menjaga kesehatan dan kehamilannya.\r\nPenelitian ini menunjukkan kebutuhan akan perhatian yang lebih besar, keinginan memastikan bahwa bantuan yang dibutuhkan telah tersedia, dan keinginan akan keterlibatan keluarga.",

      "abstract": "The time at which maternal recognition of pregnancy occurs in the rabbit has not been established. To determine the time in gestation when the conceptuses become essential for maintaining corpus luteum function, conceptuses were removed by either flushing the uterus on Days 5 and 6 postcoitum (pc) or by extrusion through incisions in the uterus on Days 10, 14, 18, and 26 pc. Pseudopregnant does were similarly treated on Days 5, 6, 10, and 18 pc. Progesterone profiles were utilized to monitor corpus luteum function. Serum progesterone profiles of does whose conceptuses were removed during the preimplantation period, on Days 5 and 6, or during the early postimplantation period, Day 10 pc, were identical to those of both intact and sham-operated pseudopregnant rabbits. However, conceptus removal on Days 14, 18, or 26 pc resulted in a significant decrease in progesterone levels within 48 h after surgery. These data clearly demonstrate that maternal recognition of pregnancy occurs some time between Days 10 and 18 pc and that the conceptuses provide a continuous, or at least an episodic, signal to maintain continued corpus luteum progesterone secretion.",

      "abstract": "Ever since a gradual but significant reduction in the estrogenic and progestogenic components of oral contraceptives (OCs) was made, there has been a corresponding decrease in adverse effects associated with the pill. The beneficial effects include prevention of pregnancy, reduction in pelvic inflammatory disease, protection against ovarian/endometrial cancer and benign breast tumors and ovarian cysts, reduction in the occurrence of rheumatoid arthritis among OC users, and regulation of the menstrual cycle. The adverse effects include diseases of the circulatory system (myocardial infarction, venous thromboembolism, subarachnoid hemorrhage, hypertension), possible carcinogenicity (breast, cervix, melanoma), pituitary adenomas, liver disorders, glucose metabolix effects (diabetes), vitamin status alteration, delay in return of menstruation and fertility, and a number of minor side effects (nausea, vomiting). Contraindications to OC use include history of malignancy of the breast or genital tract, venous thromboembolism, cerebrovascular accident, undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding, focal migraine, or familial hyperlipidemia. The following situations require medical assessment before OCs are prescribed, and medical supervision if OCs are prescribed: age 40+, smoking and age over 35, mild hypertension or a history of hypertensive disease of pregnancy (toxemia), epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, history of bouts of depression, history of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea in nulliparous women, and gallbladder disease. Problems could occur with OC use in the following situations: 1) lactation (ideally, OCs should be withheld until the child is weaned but if not possible, OCs should not be given until lactation is established); 2) drug interaction (other contraceptive form should be used when the patient is taking antibiotics or anticonvulsants); 3) tropical diseases (studies are still underway); 4) adolescence (very young girls should use other contraceptive method until regular menstruation is established); 5) postcoital contraception (limited use of steroids in emergency situation); and 6) hormonal pregnancy tests (use of oral steroids for pregnancy testing is not recommended). The 3 main types of OCs currently used are the combined estrogen and progestagen, the progestagen-only OC, and the triphasic OC. The lowest effective dose of a compound should be used, and healthy women may continue to use OCs for many years.",

The fourth stage of labor is a physiologic and clinical entity. 3. The physiology of the fourth stage of labor is postulated, the two main physiologic phases being: I.The Contractile Phase A. Stage ofUterine myotamponade (immediate uterine contraction). B. Stage ofuterine thrombotamponade (Secondary relaxation with formation of placental site sinusoidal and intrauterine hematomas). C. Stage ofMyouterine indifference. D. Stage ofFixed myouterine contraction. II.The Hemorrhagic Phase A.Traumatic hemorrhage 1. Uterovaginal tract laceration bleeding. (Component One.) B.Atonic Hemorrhage 1. The clotting hemorrhagic associated with placental separation. (Component Two.) 2. The nonclotting hemorrhagic probably arising from denuded myometrium. 16 (Component Three.) 4. Both the contractile and hemorrhagic phases are simultaneous and interrelated. 5. The official recognition and physiologic appreciation of the fourth stage of labor would result in a reduction of mortality from postpartum hemorrhage, which is assuming first place among the causes of maternal mortality. 6. A questionnaire concerning the fourth stage of labor should be part of every labor record. 7. The normalnonclotting component 16 of postpartum blood may be analogous with the nonclotting of menstrual blood which this author believes also consists of two components, a clotting and a nonclotting. The same uterine enzyme 17 which may be responsible for the failure of one of the postpartum blood components to clot may be responsible for the failure of one of the menstrual components to clot. 8. Postpartum hemorrhage, when not due to uterovaginal tract trauma, may consist of a hemorrhage of (a) one of the clotting components, (b) the nonclotting component, or (c) a combination of any two, or all three. Shock bleeding 18 may be a superimposed late complication.",

      "abstract": "Mootraghata is an Ayurvedic term that refers to a condition marked by difficulties in urination, often manifesting as urinary obstruction or retention. This condition is particularly prevalent in older males due to anatomical and physiological changes associated with aging, such as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). BPH leads to an enlargement of the prostate gland, which can compress the urethra and hinder normal urine flow. Patients may experience a range of symptoms, including weak urinary stream, frequent urges to urinate, and a sensation of incomplete bladder emptying. These symptoms can significantly affect the quality of life, leading to discomfort and anxiety. Karpura Yoga is a traditional Ayurvedic formulation that has garnered attention for its potential therapeutic effects on urinary disorders. The formulation typically includes camphor (Karpura) as a primary ingredient, along with other herbal components known for their diuretic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. Clinical observations and preliminary studies suggest that Karpura Yoga can improve urinary symptoms and overall quality of life for patients suffering from Mootraghata linked to BPH. The integration of Karpura Yoga into the management of Mootraghata offers a promising avenue for holistic treatment, aligning with the principles of Ayurvedic medicine. As interest in alternative therapies grows, further exploration into the clinical effectiveness of Karpura Yoga could enhance the standard of care for patients with BPH-related urinary issues.",

      "abstract": "The oral contraceptive (OC) Stediril acts by inhibiting ovulation, rendering the endometrium inhospitable to implantation, and rendering the cervical mucus impermeable to sperm. The effectiveness of Stediril may be compromised by failure to follow the dosage schedule: 1 pill daily for 21 days followed by a pill-free interval of 7 days when withdrawal bleeding occurs. Stediril should be taken at a regular time each day. If pills are missed for more than 48 hours, efficacy cannot be guaranteed. If vomiting occurs within 4 hours of pill ingestion, the pill should be replaced. Certain drugs, such as Rifadine, may affect the action of Stediril. Stediril should only be prescribed after a complete medical history and examination, including responding to any questions the patient may have. At a 3-month follow-up visit the patient's tolerance to the drug should be assessed by absence of various symptoms: psychological problems such as nervousness and irritibality that resemble those of pregnancy; skin problems such as acne or changes of pigmentation; periods of nausea that diminish in frequency after a few weeks; weight gain; bleeding problems; or signs of thromboembolic risk, such as headaches, unusual visual disturbances, or hypertension, which require immediate cessation of OC use. Because Stediril constitutes a risk to the fetus in case of unplanned pregnancy, the preliminary gynecological examination is mandatory and the pill should only be prescribed to women able to comply with dosage requirements. The pill should be stopped 6 weeks-3 months before pregnancy to allow the endometrium to regenerate. The carcinogenic role of the pill is frequently discussed but not conclusively proven. Follow-up visits should occur 3 and 6 months after beginning use and every year thereafter.",

      "abstract": "Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common male sexual dysfunction worldwide. Characteristic symptoms of PE are unexpected, rapid, complete ejaculation, which negatively impacts the sexual act for both sexual partners. Despite the existence of a definitive PE classification system and various diagnostic tools, diagnosing PE is still challenging due to the limitations associated with the assessment of this condition. Hence, it is necessary to review the diagnostic methods and processes of the physical examination that are currently performed in the medical setting. It is also important to analyze any controversial results of each main PE assessment method and propose novel diagnostic and assessment methods. To date, it is important to verify the accuracy of the PE evaluation method due to the ambiguity of previous definitions and proven invalidity of current examining techniques. Clinical diagnosis is based mainly on the patient history, patient-reported outcome scores, and diagnostic tools. Introduction of intravaginal ejaculatory latency time, penile biothesiometry, and the electrophysiological test provided objective means of evaluating PE. Due to the controversial and inconclusive findings in PE psychogenic and neurogenic etiology, utilizing a single parameter to describe and qualify PE using the aforementioned diagnostic methods provides valuable, but insufficient information for PE diagnosis. There is still a lack of a feasible and plausible means of objective measurement to evaluate the ejaculatory latency and control over ejaculation. Consequently, a comprehensive penile stimulation that simulates sexual intercourse could be useful to record intensity and duration parameters before the ejaculatory threshold, providing a more accurate method of describing and diagnosing PE versus a single chronological observation.",

      "abstract": "STATEMENTA study to assess the effect of lavender oil massage on pain perception during first stage of labour among primi parturients admitted in selected hospital, Lucknow. Introduction: Pain in labor is a nearly universal experience for child bearing women. Labor pain is a challenging issue for nurses designing intervention protocols. Pain during labor is caused primarily by uterine muscle contractions and somewhat by pressure on the cervix. This pain manifests itself as cramping in the abdomen, groin, and back. Other causes of pain during labor include pressure on the bladder and bowels by the babys head and stretching of the birth canal and vagina. Labor events have got great psychological, emotional, and social impact to the women and her family. She experiences stress, physical pain, and fear of dangers. The care giver should be tactful, sensitive and respectful to her. Throughout labor she is given continued encouragement and emotional support and assurance are given to keep up the morale.Lavender oil used for aromatherapy is a very versatile essential oil that can be used throughout labour to promote relaxation. It provides a sedation effect to the central nervous system and relieves headache, nervous tension and balances mood swings. According to the American Pregnancy Association, lavender can help create a tranquil, relaxing atmosphere which can reduce pain and stimulate contraction of uterus Objectives Of The Study: 1. Assess the effect of lavender oil massage on pain perception during first stage of labour among primi parturients of experimental group. 2. Compare the post test level of pain perception between primi parturient of experimental group and control group. 3. Associate the level of pain during first stage of labour among primi parturients of experimental group with selected demographic variables. Research Methodology: This study was conducted using Quantitative approach at Integral Hospital, Lucknow. Quasi experimental research design (post test with control group design) was used in the study. The conceptual framework used in this study was Callista Roys Adaptation Model (1991). The total sample size was 30 (15 in experimental group and 15 in control group) selected by convenience sampling technique. Demographic variables were obtained by structured interview and the level of pain was assessed by modified visual analogue scale Reults: The data obtained are tabulated and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The statistical analysis of the data showed that the mean post test level of pain perception in control group is higher than the mean post test level of pain perception in experimental group. The mean score of experimental group is 2.2(68%) with SD0.41and mean score of control group is 2.8(88%) with SD 0.35 the mean difference is 0.4. The calculated t value is 4.31 at p&lt;0.05 which is more than the table value at 0&lt;0.05. Therefore the null hypothesis H01 is rejected. So the research hypothesis H1 was accepted Conclusion: The findings revealed that there was a significant difference between the level of pain perception among experimental group and control group. It also showed that there was no association of the level of pain during first stage of labour among primi parturients of experimental group with selected demographic variables.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to present reasons for pregnancy loss in dogs. Termination of pregnancy can occur at any stage of gestation, sometimes even before pregnancy is diagnosed. If embryonic death occurs before day 35 of gestation, the embryo is absorbed. Fetal death in the second half of gestation leads to abortion or fetal emphysema, maceration, or mummification. Abnormal embryonic development, competition between placental sites, or genetic abnormalities of the embryo(s) can lead to termination of pregnancy. Maternal factors that alter ovarian function or the environment in the oviducts and uterus, such as cystic endometrial hyperplasia or inflammation, can lead to pregnancy loss. Abnormalities of the placenta, uterine torsion, metrocoele, environmental stress, and malnutrition can have detrimental effects on fetal development. Several drugs or medications can also have embryotoxic/teratogenic effect. Endocrinological disorders such as hypoluteodism, gestational diabetes, and hypothyroidism can be reasons for pregnancy failure. Several bacteria, protozoa, and viruses can cause pregnancy loss in dogs. Etiological diagnoses of pregnancy loss in dogs are challenging as the exact causes are not always obvious; so, a multi-faceted approach is required.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Uterine leiomyomas are common benign smooth muscle tumors that often occur during the reproductive years. Although many cases may not result in significant complications, negative pregnancy outcomes have been associated with the size and location of the fibroids. Degeneration of fibroids can occur as early as the late first trimester when they undergo significant volumetric growth, contributing to pain during pregnancy. While myomectomy is typically avoided during pregnancy, conservative management with anti-inflammatory medications may be effective. Surgical removal or preterm delivery may be necessary if symptoms persist. Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a rare condition characterized by sustained elevated intra-abdominal pressure leading to organ failure. Although ACS resulting from large-volume leiomyomas in the postpartum period has not been previously described, we present a case of a 25-year-old patient with massive uterine fibroids who required indicated preterm delivery via primary cesarean section at 25 weeks gestation. Her postpartum course was complicated by ACS, requiring emergent surgical decompression. When a large fibroid burden is present during pregnancy or in the postpartum period, ACS should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Early diagnosis and timely surgical decompression are necessary to prevent organ dysfunction and worsening maternal outcomes.",

      "title": "Hysterectomy and Tubal Ligation",
      "abstract": "Because of the reproductive organs' identification with sexuality and childbearing, gynecologic surgery can be a stressful experience for women. This article reviews the research on the psychological sequelae of tubal ligation and hysterectomy. Overall, the research suggests that factors such as age, marital problems, parity, previous psychiatric history and personality problems, the timing of surgery, and pathways to surgery can help to identify women who may be at risk for adverse sequelae following tubal ligation. The literature also indicates that the decision to undergo tubal sterilization should be taken only by patients who are well informed about its effect and outcome. Although several studies have found a high incidence of psychological and sexual disorders among women who have undergone hysterectomy, control groups have not been used and often information has not been available on patients' social and sexual functioning before the surgery. A prospective design is needed to provide conclusive evidence of the effects of hysterectomy. It appears that most psychiatric problems occur in women who had such problems prior to the surgery. Other risk factors for a poor outcome after hysterectomy include younger age, lower educational status, absence of any concern preoperatively or excessive anxiety, absence of perceived support in the immediate social network, a poor relationship with one's mother, and negative expectations of the operation. Clinicians can play an important role in determining whether hysterectomy is indicated, adequately preparing the woman and her partner for surgery, and identifying those women who are having problems adapting to the operation and arranging psychotherapeutic intervention.",

The examination is generally directed towards the specific endocrine system, but any endocrine gland mass may be associated with an endocrine syndrome, producing widespread effects on the patient. As with the history and examination, investigations are targeted towards the endocrine gland in question, in order to firm up the diagnosis. Biochemical assays are available to determine the levels of most hormones in the serum as a measure of disease. Provocation tests involve administering an agent that stimulates production of the hormone in question.

The increase of issue of breeding, obtain healthy offspring leads to magnificatition disorders of reproduction function in dogs. Therefore, the development of modern methods for diagnosis of reproductive system diseases and correction of reproductive function in dogs is important. Infertility is a temporary or prolonged loss of reproductive capacity by the female dogs as a result of various factors inborn or acquired in the process of life. Disorders of reproduction function caused by different etiologic factors. The main reasons can be conventionally divided into problems associated with dogs, infertility in females (disorders of estrous cycle) and infertility with physiological estrous cycle. The infertility includes disorders that are characterized by absence of estrous and prolonged proestrous / estrus and decreasing period between estrous. Other causes disorders of reproduction function are: incorrect insemination, stress, disease of uterus, disease of ovaries, infectional disease (Brucella canis, Herpes virus canis, other infectional disease), idiopathic infertility. Gynecological examination in female dogs aimed to identifying the causes of infertility should be carried out according to the established scheme, which includes the collection of anamnesis, examination, and laboratory studies. The main methods of research to determine the causes of infertility are: vaginal secretions, vaginoscopy, vaginal cytology, microbiological studies, radiography, hysteroscopy, hysterography, ultrasound examination of the uterus determination of the concentration of sex hormones in the blood.",

It is a condition with a multifactorial etiology, however, it is closely associated with vaginal delivery in terms of recurrence and multiparity in terms of severity. It mainly affects postmenopausal women, between 70 and 79 years old, however, despite the knowledge of these data, the epidemiology of pelvic organ prolapse is little known since part of the female population is unaware of the physiological changes resulting from body aging and how pathological changes. The symptomatology of POP involves a feeling of heaviness or a “ball in the vagina” sensation, vaginal pain and discomfort, urinary incontinence and, ot so documented, fecal incontinence. There is a range of options in the literature for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse, however, the decision is made based on the patient’s profile, evaluating: age, sex life, presence or absence of comorbidities and interest in undergoing or not undergoing an operation. surgical. The treatment options addressed are: conservative treatment, which mainly involves changes in daily habits, physiological operations depending on the affected vaginal compartment, and physiotherapy based on kinesiotherapy, which allows for the strengthening of the pelvic muscles. It is important to emphasize that even medical treatment has the possibility of relapse.",

OHSS can also occur spontaneously in ovulation cycles linked to polycystic ovarian disease, multiple gestations, molar pregnancy, pituitary adenomas and very rarely, hypothyroidism. It can result in significant morbidity and mortality in severe forms due to thrombosis and organ failure. A 28-year-old non pregnant woman presented to the emergency services with severe abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, constipation and burning micturition. The symptoms began four to five days ago and the pain, which was initially localised to the left iliac fossa, progressed to involve the entire abdomen. Ultrasonography revealed large, bulky, oedematous ovaries with multiple cysts of varying sizes, indicative of OHSS, along with torsion of the left ovary. There was no history of receiving beta-human Chorionic Gonadotropin (β-hCG), clomiphene citrate, estradiol, oral contraceptive pills, or any other ovulation induction therapy. A salpingo oophorectomy was done for the left ovary and cystectomy with ovarian reconstruction was done for the right ovary. Histopatholgical examination confirmed OHSS (Type 3) with ovarian torsion. The patient had a diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism during pregnancy which was three and half years ago and was treated with Thyroxine 75 μg per day. However, stopped thyroxine on her own immediately after delivery. Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels was 110 μg, T3 was 16 ng/mL and T4 was 0.91 μg/dL. Thyroxine 100 μg/day was started and the contralateral ovary returned to the normal size on ultrasonography within a period of three months. Thus, OHSS resulted from primary hypothyroidism and was cured with thyroid hormone replacement. OHSS may also be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients of hypothyroidism patients presenting with abdominal symptoms.",

      "title": "Exploring the Complexities of Postpartum Sexual Health",
      "abstract": "Abstract Purpose of Review This paper explores the complexities of postpartum sexual health. It answers the question on what should be considered normal sexual health after birth and what should be considered abnormal. Recent Findings Many women experience physical sexual health issues in the months after birth, such as dyspareunia, lack of vaginal lubrication and a loss of sexual desire. For some women, these issues can persist 12 and 18 months after birth. Mode of birth is not associated with long-term dyspareunia 6 and 12 months after birth. There is conflict seen in the literature with regard to the association between perineal trauma and short-and long-term sexual health. Breastfeeding and the existence of pre-existing sexual health issues are strongly predictive of sexual health issues at 6 and 12 months after birth. Women have described a discordance in their sexual desire to that of their partner, for some this caused distress but for couples who communicated their feelings of sexual desire, concern over baby’s well-being and adapting to parenthood distress was not experienced. Resuming sexual intercourse after birth was not spontaneous, women considered their mode of birth, the presence of perineal trauma and their physical and emotional recovery from birth. One fifth of women had not resumed sexual intercourse 12 weeks after birth. Summary A discussion is presented on the challenges associated with viewing postpartum sexual health from a physical perspective only, and why prevalence studies alone do not capture the nuances of postpartum sexual health. Future research needs to take account of the psychosocial and relational dimensions of postpartum sexual health as well as physical dimensions.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: In pregnancy, women experience pain for reasons other than labor or delivery. Painful syndromes may occur during pregnancy, or chronic pain may become more acute, and patients should be offered treatment, always bearing in mind maternal and fetal safety. Objective: To conduct a review of the scientific literature on the management of non-obstetric pain during pregnancy and the potential implications of the different pharmacological and interventional therapies available. Materials and methods: Non-systematic review in the following databases: Medline, Pubmed, FDA and Drugs with a search of relevant articles in English. Results: The articles related to the various types of therapies for pain management during pregnancy were selected. Conclusion: The comprehensive approach to the management of conditions that may produce pain during pregnancy requires the use of medications that are not always 100% safe. Treatment must be inter-disciplinary and humanized, and consider the implications for the mother and fetus, optimizing, whenever possible, non-pharmacological therapeutic options. Introducción: La mujer embarazada experimenta dolor por causas diferentes al trabajo de parto o al parto. Durante el embarazo pueden presentarse síndromes dolorosos agudos o se agudizan dolores crónicos que deben ser tratados, asegurándose siempre de mantener la seguridad para la madre y el feto. Objetivo: Realizar una revisión de la literatura científica acerca del manejo del dolor de causas no obstétricas durante el embarazo, y las posibilidades e implicaciones de las diferentes terapias disponibles tanto farmacológicas como intervencionistas. Materiales y métodos: Revisión no sistemática. Se consultaron las siguientes bases de datos: Medline, Pubmed, FDA y Drugs, en búsqueda de artículos en inglés relevantes. Resultados: Se seleccionaron los artículos correspondientes a los diferentes tipos de terapia disponibles en el manejo del dolor durante el embarazo. Conclusión: El manejo integral de las patologías que pudieran generar dolor durante el embarazo requiere del uso de medicamentos que no siempre son 100% seguros.

Although frequently asymptomatic, genital prolapse causes some women significant, distressing and debilitating symptoms. Discomfort and feeling a ‘lump or bulge’ in the vagina or ‘something coming down’ is the most commonly reported symptom. Urinary and bowel dysfunction, including frequency and incontinence can occur and dyspareunia, change in body image and psychological symptoms are common. All of these can have detrimental effects on a woman’s wellbeing, quality of life and relationships. Multiple treatment strategies exist for prolapse, including reassurance, pelvic floor muscle training, pessary use and surgery. These can be discussed to facilitate a shared decision about the right management strategy with the patient. This article aims to give an overview of female genital prolapse and its management, and to increase knowledge and confidence for management of the condition in primary care.",

One of the factors causing childbirthinfection can come from birth canal injury which is a good medium for developing germs.emergence of infection in the perineum can spread to the bladder or in birth canalwhich can result in complications of the birth canal infection so that treatment ofperineal wounds is needed. Perineal rupture occurs almost in all first labor and is not uncommon insubsequent labor. e perineal rupture generally occurs in the midline and may become widespread ifthe fetal head is born too soon, the pubic arch angle is smaller than usual, the fetal head passes through the pelvic door that is larger in size than the subregional subreglysia of bregmatika. Perineal wound is injury to the urogenital diaphragm and the leucator ani muscle, which occurs during normal labor, or labor with the device, can occur without injury to the skin of the perineum or to thevagina, so that it is not visible from the outside.This study aims to determine whether perineal wound care can accelerate perineal wound healing. This research study using the case study method conducted at Tanjung Balai Karimun Health Center in January until February 2023. data collection method is participatory observation, interviews, measurements, documentation.

      "title": "[Contraceptive advice for the postpartum period].",
      "abstract": "The immediate postpartum period and the week of hospitalization is a privileged time for imparting information about the physiology of reproduction and contraception. Contraceptive counseling at this time may be done in groups or in individual sessions. Apart from the usual requirements of efficacy, innocuity, acceptability, and reversibility, postpartum contraception must respect lactation and the return of menstruation. 3/4 of women ovulate before the 1st postpartum mentstrual period, but never before the 25th postpartum day. In the absence of lactation, about 80% ovulate within 9 weeks. If lactation occurs ovulation is delayed and usually 1 or more anovulatory cycles occur, but the rate of conception is difficult to estimate. Methods that are unsuitable for postpartum use include the temperature method because of the absence of the hyperthermic plateau, cervical caps and diaphragms because correct measurements cannot be made until 5-6 months after delivery, and IUDs becuase of the large size of the uterine cavity, the fragility of the walls, the presence of lochia, the large size of the cervix, and the absence of cervical mucus which protects against infection. Local contraception with tablets, spermicidal gels, or condoms is a good choice, especially for breastfeeding women, because of improved success rates, good tolerance, and acceptability. In prescribing oral contraceptives, pathologies of pregnancy such as hypertension and phlebitis must be considered along with the classical contraindicatins. The formulation must not affect the quality or quantity of milk. Standard dosed combined pills and monophasic and biphasic minidose pills increase the thromboembolic risk if they are taken soon after delivery, used by women who smoke, if the estrogen component is large, or if the women's cholesterol level is elevated. Minipills and progestagen-only micropills are interesting choices for postpartum women because of the reduced steroid doses. Micropills should be chosen if lactation is expected to continue for more than 2 months. Injectable medroxyprogesterone acetate can be used for long acting progestagen contraception, but the patient should be warned of possible side efforts including menstrual problems, amenorrhea, delayed reversibility, weight gain, and headaches. Postpartum voluntary sterilization is often requested and may be indicated for a number of medical or socioeconomic conditions. It is preferable to wait a few months before carrying out the procedure because of the risk of psychological problems following loss of fertility.",

      "abstract": "Background:The dosing, schedules, and other aspects of combined oral contraceptive (COC) design have evolved in recent years to address a variety of issues including short- and long-term safety, bleeding profiles, and contraceptive efficacy. In particular, several newer formulations have altered the length of the hormone-free interval (HFI), in order to minimize two key undesired effects that occur during this time: hormone-withdrawal-associated symptoms (HWaS) and follicular development.Objective:This primer reviews our current understanding of the key biological processes that occur during the HFI and how this understanding has led to changes in the dosing and schedule of newer COC formulations.Main message:In brief, HWaS are common, underappreciated, and a likely contributor to COC discontinuation; because of this, shortening the HFI and/or supplementing with estrogen during the progestin-free interval may provide relief from these symptoms and improve adherence. A short HFI (with or without estrogen supplementation) may also help maintain effective follicular suppression and contraceptive efficacy, even when the overall dose of estrogen throughout the cycle is low.Conclusions:Taken together, the available data about HWaS and follicular activity during the HFI support the rationale for recent COC designs that use a low estrogen dose and a short HFI. The availability of a variety of COC regimens gives physicians a range of choices when selecting the most appropriate COC for each woman’s particular priorities and needs.",

A previous history of depression, either preconceptionally or during the interconception period, is the strongest predictor that a woman will suffer from perinatal depression. Perinatal depression can adversely affect not only the woman, but also her fetus or infant, and has been linked with prematurity, difficulties with maternal-infant bonding and infant behavior problems later in life. If a woman has a known history of depression, she can be counseled preconceptionally about her increased risk of experiencing a subsequent episode during the perinatal years and thus take an active role in recognizing signs and symptoms of depression and accessing treatment as early as possible should an episode occur. The earlier treatment is sought for perinatal depression, the greater the chance for improved outcomes.",

It is not a functioning organ, but frequently acts as a trap for infection. 8 Granulomata due to infection are the commonest pathological conditions found in the verumontanum and can be eliminated by fulguration. 9 The rôle of the verumontanum and its relation to the sexual life has been overstated, as the organ contains no erectile tissue and no special nerve endings, being similar in this respect to the surrounding urethra.",

The prevalence of symptoms of urinary incontinence increases during pregnancy and decreases spontaneously in the first three months in the postpartum.

Torsion has been defined as a rotation of more than 45 degrees of the uterus around its long axis and is rare in humans. Clinical diagnosis is difficult since symptoms are either absent or non specific (cervical dystocia, painful uterine contractions, dynamic hypertonia...). Uterine torsion is often associated to pathologies of the uterus such as uterine myomas or congenital deformities, abnormal fetal presentations, pelvic tumours or abnormal pelvis. Maternal prognosis is good after surgical treatment, however, perinatal mortality remains high.",

      "title": "Defibrination in Normal and Abnormal Parturition",
      "abstract": "S ummary Studies of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis in women undergoing uncomplicated single delivery showed a significant fall in plasma fibrinogen and factor VIII. The levels were lowest 1–4 hr postpartum and returned to pre‐existing or higher levels within 24 hr. A significant fall in fibrinogen also occurred in women with twin delivery or caesarean section without labour. Similar changes were noted in factors V and VIII. Fibrinolytic activity was markedly decreased during delivery but increased rapidly thereafter in women with a single birth or caesarean section without labour. In women with twin delivery, it remained low. No consistent changes in the level of fibrinolytic inhibitors or plasminogen were noted. Mean levels of fibrinolytic degradation products (FDP) were in the upper level of the normal range and increased in the first 1–4 hr postpartum. These changes were even more marked in twin delivery. In women with abruptio placentae or prolonged intrauterine death (IUD), levels of fibrinogen, factors V and VIII and blood platelets were markedly reduced and generally dropped even lower during the first 4 hr after delivery, returning within 24 hr to the levels found in nonpregnant women. Levels of plasminogen and factor X were also reduced. High levels of FDP were found during labour, returning within 24 or 48 hr to the range observed in women 24 hr after normal delivery. Immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis of serum in agar gel disclosed abnormal double or split precipitin lines. Sequential changes in these precipitin lines pointed to a continuing process which started before delivery, reached a maximum shortly thereafter, disappearing within the next 10–24 hr. The changes found in early (vs. late) labour, or during uterine surgery not associated with pregnancy, did not uphold the supposition that similar changes observed during normal or abnormal parturition might be due to the stresses of labour or surgery. The findings reported herein suggest that a minor degree of physiological defibrination develops during normal labour which is qualitatively similar to, but of much lesser magnitude than, the pathological defibrination syndrome (with local lysis of fibrin) commonly associated with abruptio placentae or prolonged intrauterine death.",

      "abstract": "Resumo: Este artigo teve o objetivo de identificar os possiveis impactos causados pela incontinencia urinaria na vida da mulher, visto que se trata de um problema mais frequente no sexo feminino. A definicao de incontinencia urinaria e caracterizada como qualquer perda involuntaria de urina, que proporcione desconforto social ou sanitario ao paciente. Esse disturbio e mais comum em mulheres e pode se manifestar em qualquer idade e esta atribuido a diversos fatores, podendo ser relacionado a problemas de modificacoes vesicais primarias ou secundarias, e ocasionadas por disturbios uretrais durante o funcionamento da bexiga. Vale ressaltar que a incontinencia urinaria de esforco, incontinencia urinaria de urgencia e a incontinencia urinaria mista estao entre os principais tipos de incontinencia. Dentre os fatores de risco, que podem desencadear a incontinencia urinaria, a gestacao, o peso do recemnascido, obesidade, cirurgias ginecologicas, tipos de parto, menopausa, constipacao intestinal,doencas cronicas, fatores hereditarios, tabagismo, entre outros, tendem a ocasionar o escape de urina. A perda de urina pode causar uma variedade de efeitos sociais no paciente, como constrangimento, desconforto, uso frequente do banheiro, sensacao de estar com cheiro de urina, problemas durante relacoes sexuais, alem de afetar diretamente a qualidade de vida dasmulheres. Foi realizada uma revisao de literatura, a qual cinco artigos do Google Academico foram selecionados em marco de 2021, por meio de palavras chaves determinadas: “impactos da incontinencia urinaria e mulheres” e discutiu-se os impactos que a perda de urina pode provocar durante a rotina da mulher. A partir dessa revisao, concluiu-se que esse problema pode ser causado por uma variedade de fatores e existe em mulheres de qualquer idade, mas raramente e discutido na sociedade e na literatura, apesar de provocar varios problemas pessoais e sociais durante a vida das mulheres. \r\nPalavras-chave: Incontinencia.

      "abstract": "Primary dysmenorrhea is defined as pain during the menstrual cycle in the absence of an identifiable cause. It is one of the most common causes of pelvic pain in women. Dysmenorrhea can negatively affect a woman's quality of life and interfere with daily activities. The pathophysiology of primary dysmenorrhea is likely a result of the cyclooxygenase pathway producing increased prostanoids, particularly prostaglandins (PGs). The increased PGs cause uterine contractions that restrict blood flow and lead to the production of anaerobic metabolites that stimulate pain receptors. Women with a history typical for primary dysmenorrhea can initiate empiric treatment without additional testing. Shared decision making is key to effective management of dysmenorrhea to maximize patient compliance and satisfaction. After a discussion of their risks and benefits, extremely effective empiric therapies are nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and contraceptive hormonal therapy. Other treatments for primary dysmenorrhea can be employed solely or in combination with other modalities, but the literature supporting their use is not as convincing. The physician should initiate an evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea if the patient does not report improved symptomatology after being compliant with their medical regimen.",

      "abstract": "A number of features of early embryonic development in equids are unusual or unique; these appear to include the critical but poorly understood mechanism(s) responsible for the ‘maternal recognition of pregnancy’. Maternal recognition of pregnancy is the physiological process by which a developing conceptus signals it presence to the maternal organism to prolong the lifespan of the primary corpus luteum (CL) and thereby ensure the continued supply of progesterone that is essential for embryonic survival and development. However, it is not yet clear what the primary conceptus signal to ensure CL prolongation in the horse is, and while a number of potential contributors to maternal recognition and the establishment of pregnancy have been proposed, none have been able to satisfactorily fulfill the criteria required of an intrauterine luteostatic or antiluteolytic factor. On the other hand, it is generally accepted that maternal recognition of pregnancy is of critical importance and that failure to either send or receive the signal appropriately is likely to lead to early embryonic death. Indeed, pregnancy loss at or soon after the expected time of maternal pregnancy recognition (days 10-16 of gestation) is a common, but unpredictable (and therefore difficult to prevent), occurrence in clinical practice and a considerable source of financial loss to the breeding industry.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The physiological changes that occur in menopause alter sexual function and affect well-being. Hormonal changes contribute significantly to reduced sexual function in older women and sexual dysfunction may well be amenable to treatment with exogenous hormones or other agents. Materials and Methods: Relevant clinical studies were identified by a computerised literature search. The collated data were presented to fellow gynaecologists for review, analysis of results and discussion in a series of meetings dedicated to finding the best evidence in menopause management. The evidence was assessed and used to prepare guidelines around the management of women who are affected by sexual dysfunction in menopause. Results: Hormone therapy benefits many women who have dyspareunia related to vaginal atrophy, reduced libido and decreased satisfaction, particularly if these symptoms adversely affect their quality of life. Alternative agents such as tibolone and sildenafil citrate can be useful adjuncts. Conclusions: It is increasingly important to recognise postmenopausal sexual dysfunction. Treatment of this syndrome must be individualised to the specific complaints of each woman. Hormones and other agents are relevant treatment options for properly-selected women.

Menstruasi adalah perdarahan secara periodik dan siklik dari uterus, disertai pelepasan endometrium. Menstruasi merupakan hasil akhir suatu kerja sama yang sangat kompleks antara hipotalamus, hipofisis, ovarium, dan endometrium sehingga kelainan pada salah satu organ tersebut dapat mengganggu menstruasi atau mengganggu fungsi reproduksi seorang wanita. Salah satu gangguan menstruasi yang sering dialami pada masa reproduktif adalah amenore. Amenore adalah keadaan tidak terjadinya menstruasi selama paling sedikit 3 bulan berturut-turut. Amenore sekunder dialami oleh wanita yang sudah pernah mengalami siklus menstruasi. Amenore sekunder tidak selalu disebabkan kelainan organik yang membahayakan. Faktor psikis, perubahan hormon yang dipicu berat badan dan atau status gizi seseorang juga mampu memicu terjadinya amenore sekunder. Pengetahuan mengenai macam penyebab, diagnosis, dan macam terapi bagi penderita amenore sekunder akan memicu tindakan yang tepat bagi seseorang jika mengalami atau menemukan kasus amenore sekunder.

      "abstract": "Contraindications to the use of estroprogestational agents must be critically and completely evaluated before any oral contraceptive (OC) prescription. Antecedents of cholestasis during pregnancy, jaundice, vascular lithiasis, hepato-cellular adenomas, or viral hepatitis are sure contradindications to OC use because of possible hepatic pathology, while antecedents of thromboembolic or cardiovascular accidents are contraindications because of the possible cardiovascular pathology. In the adolescent and premenopausal women any irregularities in the menstrual cycle would advise against OC prescription, just as any form of benign or malignant gynecological tumor would be a contraindication at any age. Prescription of OC is contraindicated in patients under treatment with several kinds of analgesics, anticoagulants, anticonvulsants, barbiturates, and tranquilizers, since such drugs usually interfere with the contraceptive action of OCs. Another absolute contraindication to OC treatment is pregnancy, even if it is not proven that OC treatment immediately before or during pregnancy can increase the risk of teratogenic effects. OCs can diminish the volume and duration of lactation in breastfeeding women; it is also possible that steroids and their metabolites can pass into maternal milk in minimal doses. The most important factors of risk are smoking, especially in women over 40, hypertension, hyperlipemia and diabetes, whether latent or real. It must be remembered, however, that risk of maternal mortality in Western Europe is 5-35/100,000 births, while risk of mortality because of OC treatment is only 3/100,000.",

Consequently, both pregnancy and the postpartum period may influence the course of pre-existing pituitary disorders and lead to the development of those that are found exclusively or almost exclusively during these periods. Overlapping clinical and biochemical features of pregnancy sometimes cause that the diagnosis of pituitary disorders during pregnancy may be missed. Moreover, their clinical picture may range from non-specific symptoms to even life-threatening conditions, and the manifestation of the same pituitary disease often change from one patient to another. If not evaluated and managed appropriately, these disorders may negatively affect both mother and fetus. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the pathophysiology, clinical picture, diagnosis and treatment of different pituitary disorders during pregnancy and after delivery. The reader is also provided with some practical recommendations on dealing with pregnant and nursing women suffering from these disorders.",

In the absence of bleeding immediately after the procedure, a careful gynecological examination should be conducted to determine the size, consistency, and sensitivity of the uterus and the suppleness and vacuity of the lateral cul-de-sacs. A sonogram should be obtained if the results are abnormal, and a plasma dose of human chorionic gonadotropin should be administered after 12 days in case of doubt. If the sonogram suggests retained uterine contents a 2nd uterine evacuation should be carried out and appropriate antibiotic treatment should be initiated. The possibility of unsuccessful abortion must be considered, as must that of placental retention, hematoma, or ectopic pregnancy. A 2nd intervention should be carried out without hesitation if necessary. In the case of secondary amenorrhea more than 4 weeks after the intervention, a complete gynecological examination should be conducted, a serum human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test should be administered, incipient adhesions should be sought through X-ray or laparoscopy and perhaps removed, and symptoms appearing after the abortion, such as insomnia, irritability, weight loss, or consumption of drugs should be investigated. The possibility of another pregnancy should be investigated, adhesions should not be allowed to develop, and the possibility of psychogenic amenorrhea resulting from ambivalence about the abortion should be considered.",

      "abstract": "The term \"reproductive disorders\" covers a range of problems affecting the sow at the different steps in the reproduction cycle. The term \"environment\" relates to a number of conditions that \"envelop\" the sow during her life. During the reproduction cycle, the urogenital tract of the sow is subjected to successive and diverse challenges. Parturition is one of them. Trauma and/or infections can take place at this moment and have detrimental consequences at the onset of the subsequent oestrus cycle and the next pregnancy. This is of particular importance when lactation is short, and leaves little time for the uterus to recover. The oestrus period and insemination are most critical stages. Reproductive efficiency is mainly determined by the healthiness of the uterus at the moment and the conditions of insemination. The environment offered to the breeding sow plays a pivotal role in that the various environmental components converge to either maintain or alter the integrity and good functioning of the uterus. Hence poor hygiene, especially if combined with poor housing, will generate discomfort, even pain and stressful conditions that negatively interfere with reproductive function. The probability that the sow's uterus will become infected increases considerably under such conditions. Nutrition also plays a role. Both excessive and poor body condition may have a negative impact. Whereas the problem is expressed by the sow (e.g. regular return in oestrus) the cause, can also be the inadequate quality of the semen. Careful hygiene must be ensured at the time of semen collection and preparation, and during insemination. This latter should be performed during standing oestrus and delayed inseminations should be avoided. Most of the above-cited requirements to prevent reproductive disorders concern the farmer's ability to consider and take action with regard to combinations of potential risk factors rather than to single ones in isolation.",

      "title": "Sleep-Disordered Breathing in Pregnancy",
      "abstract": "Complaints of sleep disturbance are common during pregnancy, and there are many factors that are likely contributors. Hormonal and biochemical changes and the physical effect of the enlarging uterus are all probable mechanisms. Emerging evidence suggests that sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is particularly prevalent during pregnancy, chiefly late pregnancy, and this may be a significant factor contributing to sleep disruption. Both the prevalence and severity of snoring increase progressively throughout pregnancy, with reported snoring being as high as 46% during the last trimester of pregnancy, and estimated prevalence of clinically significant SDB greater than 10%. Both epidemiological data and case reports of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) suggest that SDB in pregnancy has adverse effects on maternal health and fetal development. Upper airway flow limitation, which is the characteristic pattern of SDB in women with preeclampsia, leads to marked vascular reactivity, with associated increments in peripheral vascular resistance and systemic arterial blood pressure and suppression of maternal cardiac output. Sleep-induced maternal hemodynamic compromise in preeclampsia is associated with adverse fetal consequences.The use of low levels of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nasal CPAP) during maternal sleep in preeclampsia effectively reverses the sleep-induced maternal hemodynamic consequences and may also improve fetal outcome.",

      "title": "What are the signs of menopause?",
      "abstract": "Abstract At some point in a woman’s life she will experience bodily changes that herald the onset of the menopause. Hot flashes, sleeplessness, night sweats, and mood swings are the most familiar signs, but there are many other significant changes as a woman enters a new phase of life. This period of life is frequently called “perimenopause.” It is usually defined as the years leading up to menopause and includes up to one year after the final menses. The complaint that usually prompts the first perimenopausal visit to the doctor’s office is a change in the pattern of menstrual bleeding. Women expect this change and can tell when it is happening. Except for the pathological condition of premature menopause, I cannot recall an instance of a patient registering surprise when I confirmed that the symptoms that brought her to my office were the first signs of menopause. Many women are aware of subtle changes in body composition. They are particularly concerned about a tendency to gain weight because of fat deposition around the hips and abdomen. With just a glance in a full-length mirror, a perimenopausal woman is aware that her body shape is changing. The changes a woman feels at this time of life are the result of increasing deviations from the pattern of hormonal changes characteristic of the normal menstrual cycle. Diminishing ovarian function is the main reason for this alteration.",

      "abstract": "Pyelonephritis in pregnancy presents for explanation the questions as to when the organism gained entrance into the urinary tract before or during pregnancy or after delivery; identification of the organism; its source; the pathway of transmission to the kidney; why and how a particular pathway presented itself; the reason for the clinical degree of the disease; treatment and prognosis with their rationale based on the answer to the foregoing questions; and, of still greater importance, the possible utilization of these answers in the prevention of the disease. Antepartum residual urine is rarely found in primiparas with normal nervous systems, excepting the occasional case of psychic retention or retention due to position in bed. In multiparas, an occasional small residual before delivery might be accounted for by a cystocele. The bladder in the pregnant woman is distinctive, the bladder wall being markedly resistant to the inflowing water whether or not an",

      "abstract": "Most surgical conditions that occur in the nonpregnant patient also occur in pregnancy. For a surgical problem that arises during pregnancy, the urgency of surgical treatment must be balanced against the risk that such treatment poses to the mother and the fetus. Current obstetric literature and legal case reports reveal that obstetric forceps and the vacuum extractor are coming back into the mainstream of obstetric practice. Cesarean delivery has been a major tool to assist the obstetrician in improving pregnancy outcome. Urologic injuries occurring during the course of pregnancy or more commonly during surgical or instrumental delivery, can result in serious and potentially life-threatening complications to both the mother and the unborn infant. Most urologic injuries from vaginal or abdominal surgical procedures on pregnant women involve some form of direct mechanical injury or compromise to the bladder or ureters.",
