Typically, unilateral onset of tremor, rigidity, or bradykinesia, the cardinal motor features, is followed by contralateral spread of disease signs.

      "abstract": "Diverse neuromuscular disorders can complicate the course of a severely ill patient. Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is the most precisely defined neuromuscular complication in this context. It is characterized by a primary axonal degeneration of the motor and sensory nerve fibers with degeneration of the skeletal muscles as a result of their denervation. The precise etiology of CIP remains elusive. Electrophysiology must be used to confirm the diagnosis of CIP because clinical evaluation is clearly insufficient and testing can also exclude other entities such as a Guillain-Barré syndrome or a primary disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Nerve biopsy studies are not required for a diagnosis of CIP. Other disorders can explain neurophysiological abnormalities in critically ill patients after the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, such as persistent neuromuscular junction blockade, pure axonal neuropathy, and necrotizing myopathy. The incidence of myopathies in critically ill patients is not well characterized, although the incidence most likely is high in critically ill patients with prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). The clinical picture of a primary myopathy is indistinguishable from other ICU-acquired causes of neuromuscular disease. Three main forms of myopathies in the ICU have been described: critical illness myopathy, thick filament myopathy, and necrotizing myopathy. Myopathies are difficult to detect because the neurophysiological studies are neither sensitive nor specific and a muscle biopsy is required.",

Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related discomfort (motor immobility, social and familial impairment, depression, drugs). Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation. Agrypnia excitata is the term that aptly defines this generalized overactivation syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy though a common neurological illness has complex aetiology and several different presentations. The term peripheral neuropathy includes symmetric polyneuropathy, single and multiple mononeuropathy, and radiculopathy. Further classication depends on a mixture of phenomenological, pathological, and genetic or other aetiological features. It is heterogeneous in aetiology, diverse in pathology, and varied in severity. Managing a case of perpipheral neuropathy brings along numerous challenges include identifying a case of peripheral neurophy and differentiating it from mimicks, working up for etiology and treatment based on aetiology. Patients can present with either positive or negative symptoms (or both) linked to motor and sensory systems or with autonomic disturbances in some neuropathies. A detailed history and physical examination provides information regarding onset, course and progression of the disease and the type of involvement like generalized, distal or proximal, symmetric or asymmetric, also the type of bre involvement like large myelinated or small unmyelinated and may give clues to neuro anatomic localization of the disease. The diagnosis can be conrmed through a appropriate investigation for the neuropathic pattern like blood tests, Cerebrospinal uid (CSF) analysis, MRI Brain, Ultrasound (USg). These test along with Electro diagnostic investigations like Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS), needle electromyography (EMG) can narrow down differentials and possible aetiologies, However in signicant cases etiology remain undiagnosed. Genetic testing is most diagnostic in carefully selected cases. Sometimes nerve biopsy and skin biopsy may be needed to conrm the etiologies.",

Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

However, in our day-to-day clinical practice we tend to see several other symptoms which may be motor or non-motor. Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are quite common and debilitating. The pathological hallmarks of PD are loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPc) and accumulation of unfolded or misfolded alpha-synuclein. Diagnosis of PD is difficult in the pre-motor stage. Late diagnosis renders a substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons in SNPc and spread of disease in other parts of the brain. This may manifest as either full blown symptoms requiring multiple medications or may even lead to life threatening condition due to lack of early diagnostic tools and techniques. Biomarkers are required to diagnose PD at a very early stage when prevention is possible. Hence, we see a lot of interest among researchers involved in finding a biomarker specific to the disease. Biomarkers may be clinical, image based, genetic, and biochemical. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum markers which may correlate with disease pathophysiology are of great significance. One such molecule which recently gained a lot of attention is neuron-specific enolase (NSE). The main aim of this paper is to highlight the role of NSE in predicting neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation ultimately reflecting damage of brain cells in PD.",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

It is also not unusual for other neurological problems, such as epilepsy, to complicate the picture. The question is always whether the intellectual problems are due to a static defect, or are part of a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Many conditions declare themselves with the passage of years. However, a small but significant group of conditions are sufficiently indolent in their progress to cause no obvious deterioration until late adolescence or adulthood. In this situation, a parent or carer may ask the adult neurologist to assess whether the perceived decline in functioning is real, and if so, what the cause is. This situation is often far from clear-cut, and so I will try and provide some guidance for when this difficult diagnostic problem arises.

      "title": "Non‐motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Although still considered a paradigmatic movement disorder, Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with a broad spectrum of non‐motor symptoms. These include disorders of mood and affect with apathy, anhedonia and depression, cognitive dysfunction and hallucinosis, as well as complex behavioural disorders. Sensory dysfunction with hyposmia or pain is almost universal, as are disturbances of sleep–wake cycle regulation. Autonomic dysfunction including orthostatic hypotension, urogenital dysfunction and constipation is also present to some degree in a majority of patients. Whilst overall non‐motor symptoms become increasingly prevalent with advancing disease, many of them can also antedate the first occurrence of motor signs – most notably depression, hyposmia or rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). Although exact clinicopathological correlations for most of these non‐motor features are still poorly understood, the occurrence of constipation, RBD or hyposmia prior to the onset of clinically overt motor dysfunction would appear consistent with the ascending hypothesis of PD pathology proposed by Braak and colleagues. Screening these early non‐motor features might, therefore, be one approach towards early ‘preclinical’ diagnosis of PD. This review article provides an overview of the clinical spectrum of non‐motor symptoms in PD together with a brief review of treatment options.",

Apart from the required motor symptoms, psychopathological symptoms are very common and include mood disorders, anxiety disorders, hallucinations, psychosis, cognitive deterioration and dementia. The underlying pathophysiological process in PD is mainly due to the loss of dopaminergic neural cells and thereby causes the shortage of nigrostriatal dopamine content in them. In addition, it may involve other neurotransmitter systems such as the noradrenergic, serotonergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic systems as well. Depression can result from any unhealthy conditions making the diagnosis a challenging task. The manifestation of depression associated with or without PD is inadequate. The co-occurrence of depression and PD often leads to the conceptual discussion on whether depressive symptoms appear before or after PD develops. This paper will discuss the conceptual mechanism of PD and depression. Keep in mind both conditions belong to two separate entities but share some similar aspects in their pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/abstract&gt;",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Children suffering with brain injury or epilepsy run an appreciably increased risk of developing a psychiatric disorder. The reasons for this are not clear, however. There have been few relevant follow‐up or treatment studies and it is still not known whether the associated presence of brain injury or epilepsy influences the natural history or treatability of a given type of psychiatric disorder. Abnormalities of gestational length, complications of delivery or infection of the nervous system do not appear to increase the risk of psychiatric disorder unless followed by manifest signs of brain injury. Children with structural damage and fits, and children with temporal lobe epilepsy seem to be those who are most likely to develop a behaviour disturbance. Brain‐damaged children may suffer from any type of psychiatric condition. There is no particular disorder that occurs with disproportionate frequency in the neuro‐epileptic population, and by implication there do not seem to be any specific behavioural syndromes which are themselves pathognomonic of central nervous system damage or dysfunction. RÉSUMÉ Aspects psychiatriques des lésions cérébrales dans l'enfance Les enfants souffrant d'une lésion cérébrale ou d'une épilepsie ont un risque nettement accru de présenter un trouble psychiatrique. Les raisons n'en sont cependant pas très claires. Peu d'études longitudinales ou thérapeutiques ont été entreprises et il n'est toujours pas établi que la présence associée d'un traumatisme cérébral ou d'une épilepsie marque l'histoire naturelle ou la curabilité d'un type donné de trouble psychiatrique. Les anomalies du temps de gestation, les complications de l'accouchement ou les infections du système nerveux ne semblent pas accroitre le risque de troubles psychiatriques s'il n'y a pas eu de signes manifestes de lésion cérébrale. Les enfants présentant des troubles structurés ou des crises et les enfants avec épilepsie du lobe temporal sont ceux qui ont le plus de chances de développer un trouble du comportement. Une lésion cérébrale chez l'enfant peut évoluer vers n'importe quel type de condition psychiatrique. II n'y a pas de désordres particuliers survenant avec une fréquence disproportionnée dans une population neuroépileptique; par voie de conséquences, il ne semble y avoir aucun syndrome comportemental spécifique qui soit pathognomonique d'un dommage ou d'une dysfonction du système nerveux central. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Psychiatrische Aspekte der Hirnverletzungen im Kindesalter Kinder, die an einer Hirnverletzung oder einer Epilepsie leiden, haben ein bedeutend höheres Risiko eine psychische Störung zu entwickeln. Die Gründe dafür sind jedoch nicht ganz klar. Es sind nur wenig relevante Langzeit‐ oder Behandlungsstudien gemacht worden und es ist noch nicht bekannt, ob eine Hirnverletzung oder Epilepsie den normalen Verlauf einer bestimmten psychischen Erkrankung, oder die Ansprechbarkeit auf die Therapie beeinflussen. Abnorme Gestationsperioden, Komplikationen bei der Geburt oder Infektionen des Nervensystems scheinen das Risiko für die Entstehung einer psychischen Erkrankung nicht zu erhöhen, es sei denn es treten danach deutliche Zeichen eines Hirnschadens auf. Kinder mit Fehlbildungen, Krämpfen und Temporallappenepilepsie entwickeln offenbar am ehesten Verhaltensstörungen. Hirngeschädigte Kinder können jegliche Art eines psychiatrischen Zustandbildes bieten. Es gibt keine spezielle Erkrankung, die mit übermäßiger Häufigkeit bei dem neuro‐epilepti‐schen Krankengut vorkommt und damit scheint es keine spezifischen Verhaltenssyndrome zu geben, die selbst pathognomonisch für eine Schädigung oder Dysfunktion des Zentralnervensystems sind. RESUMEN Aspectos psiquiàtricos de la lesión cerebral en la infancia Los niños que sufren de lesión cerebral o de epilepsia corren un riesgo apreciablemente aumentado de padecer una alteración psiquiátrica. Sin embargo las razones de ello no están claras. Se han realizado pocos estudios seriados o estudios de tratamiento y todavía no se sabe si la presencia asociada de una lesión cerebral o de epilepsia influencia la evolución o la posibilidad de tratamiento de un determinado tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. Las anomalías en la duración gestacional, complicaciones del parto o infección del sistema nervioso, no parece que aumenten el riesgo de una alteración psiquiátrica, salvo que vayan seguidos de signos manifiestos de lesión cerebral. Los niños con alteración estructural y convulsiones y niños con epilepsia del lóbulo temporal parece que son los que tienen más tendencia a desarrollar una alteración en el comportamiento. Los niños con lesión cerebral pueden sufrir cualquier tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. No hay ninguna alteración en particular que aparezca en la población neuro‐epiléptica con una frecuencia desproporcionada y por implicación no parece que haya ningún síndrome especifico del comportamiento que sea por sí mismo patogmónico de una lesión o disfunción del sistema nervioso central.",

      "abstract": "Inherited metabolic disorders can cause onset of epilepsy in the first year of life. Epilepsy rarely dominates the clinical presentation, which is more frequently associated with other neurologic symptoms, such as mental retardation, hypotonia and/or dystonia, or vigilance disturbances. The pathogenesis of seizures is multifaceted; inherited metabolic disorder can affect the balance between excitatory and inhibitory chemical mediators, eliminate an energetic substrate at the cerebral level, cause in utero brain malformation, or provoke acute brain lesions. Some clinical disorders that strongly suggest particular metabolic etiologies can be identified. For example, specific clinical signs and findings on electroencephalogram (EEG) are characteristic of pyridoxine-dependent seizures, and inherited metabolic disorders associated with early myoclonic encephalopathy are well defined. In most cases, however, epilepsy secondary to inherited metabolic disorders presents with polymorphic clinical and EEG features that are difficult to classify into precise epileptic syndromes. Common characteristics of these seizures include onset in the first months of life; usually partial, multifocal; simple partial motor semiology; successive appearance of tonic seizures, spasms, and massive myoclonus; and resistance to antiepilepsy drugs. Inherited metabolic disorders must be considered in patients presenting with epilepsy and progressive neurologic worsening.",

      "abstract": "Les crises psychogènes non épileptiques (CPNE) sont définies comme des changements brutaux et paroxystiques du comportement moteur, des sensations ou de la conscience qui ressemblent à des crises épileptiques. Ces crises sont en rapport avec des processus psychogènes complexes et non avec une décharge neuronale excessive. Les CPNE sont une pathologie fréquente, coûteuse et grave dont l’incidence équivaut à celle de la sclérose en plaques. Pourtant, cette pathologie reste peu et mal connue des psychiatres. Beaucoup d’entre nous pensent que ces crises ont disparu après Charcot. En effet, actuellement, ces patients sont adressés aux neurologues. Un quart des patients vus par un épileptologue souffrent de CPNE. L’étiopathogénie est multifactorielle, comprenant des facteurs pédisposants, des facteurs déclenchants et des facteurs de maintien. Deux mécanismes principaux apparaissent : une prédisposition neurobiologique et des facteurs traumatiques inducteurs de processus dissociatif. Les modèles récents placent la dysrégulation émotionnelle au centre de la problématique. L’imagerie fonctionnelle a mis en évidence des anomalies fonctionnelles entre les aires cérébrales impliquées dans les émotions et les aires motrices. Il existe aussi des perturbations des 3 composantes émotionnelles : sur le plan cognitif avec une alexithymie chez 85 % des patients et des biais attentionnels pour les stimuli négatifs ; sur le plan comportemental avec une réponse d’évitement et sur le plan physiologique avec des taux de cortisol basal augmentés et une diminution de l’arythmie sinusale. Nous exposerons les résultats de notre étude comparative prospective inédite qui compare la réponse électrodermale à des stimuli visuels entre un groupe de patientes CPNE et de témoins sains appariés. Nous avons mis en évidence des perturbations de la réponse neuro-végétative avec une hyporéceptivité aux stimuli plaisants et une corrélation négative entre la propension à la dissociation et l’amplitude de la réponse électrodermale. Ces résultats ouvrent des perspectives en termes de compréhension des mécanismes mais aussi en termes diagnostique et thérapeutique pour développer des outils psychothérapiques de rééducation émotionnelle chez les patients souffrant de CPNE.",

      "title": "Degenerative Central Nervous System (CNS) Disease",
      "abstract": "The hallmark of degenerative disorders of the CNS is the progressive loss of previously acquired abilities. In infants and young children, a deceleration in the rate of development is often the first presentation: the child falls progressively behind other children and only subsequently loses previously acquired milestones. When the declining developmental quotient is not due to an extrinsic agent or event or to secondary involvement of the CNS by a generalized systemic disease, neurodegenerative disease becomes a consideration.The acquisition of new developmental milestones does not exclude the existence of a degenerative disorder. In healthy infants, strides in development occur sporadically, with a child often appearing to have reached a plateau for several weeks. Initially, it may be only the prolongation of one of these plateaus that leads to suspicion of a progressive neurodegenerative diseaseMost degenerative CNS disorders can be divided clinically into three groups: gray-matter diseases, white-matter diseases, and system diseases. The gray-matter diseases, which primarily involve the neurons, occur with or without histologic evidence of storage of abnormal metabolic products. They lead to neuronal death and secondary degeneration of axons. In the white-matter diseases, myelin is disrupted, either by the destruction of normal myelin or by the production of biochemically abnormal myelin. The system diseases are a heterogeneous group of conditions involving progressive degeneration of anatomically defined systems, such as the dorsal columns,pyramidal tracts, or cerebellar nuclei. Typically, both neurons and myelin are destroyed in these disorders.The first clinical task in evaluating a child for any neurodegenerative disorder is to document that he or she has lost previously acquired milestones or has a decelerating developmental quotient. In either instance, the most important diagnostic tool is repeated developmental evaluations.The major clinical features that differentiate gray-matter from white-matter diseases are related directly to the functional roles of the neurons and myelin. Neuronal involvement in gray-matter disease leads to the early onset of dementia, the progressive loss of cognitive abilities, and seizures that frequently are myoclonic. The basal ganglia and cerebellar nuclei are collections of neurons, so extrapyramidal and cerebellar signs, such as ataxia, are common. Ganglion cells of the retina are affected in many of the gray-matter disorders, producing pigmentary degeneration of the retina. Abnormal storage of lipid in retinal ganglion cells (eg, in Tay-Sachs disease) makes the perifoveal area look gray and opaque. The fovea, which contains no ganglion cells,appears red by contrast, producing the clinically detected \"cherry red spot.\"The majority of degenerative diseases of white matter stem from biochemical defects resulting in abnormal myelin that breaks down rapidly. These\"dysmyelinating\" disorders are called leukodystrophies. Clinically, the earliest sign of most white-matter degenerations is spasticity. Dementia and seizures can occur, but usually later in the clinical course. Extrapyramidal signs are rare, but involvement of cerebellar pathways can cause ataxia. Rather than the cherry-red spot of gray-matter disease,optic atrophy is the most characteristic ocular change seen in white-matter disease. Some patients even have cortical blindness from demyelination of the optic pathways in the cerebral hemispheres.Each of the so-called system diseases has its own signs and symptoms,depending on the particular neural pathways involved. One such disease is Rett syndrome (RS), which is characterized by a period of normal development followed by the loss of developmental milestones and the onset of stereotypic hand movements akin to those seen with autism, followed by seizures and dementia. RS affects girls, probably exclusively, and occurs worldwide. Although most cases are sporadic, the disease has long been suspected of having a genetic basis. Recent genetic advances suggest that the gene for RS is located on the distal arm of the X chromosome.Clinical criteria alone can point to a diagnosis of RS. Usually the antenatal and birth histories are normal, but most girls affected with RS pass through four predictable stages:Stage 1 (birth to ∼18 mo):Deceleration of head growth, beginning between 2 and 4 months of age, results in an acquired microcephaly. This insidious failure of brain growth can be missed if head circumference is not meticulously measured and plotted at health supervision visits. Early in the disease, babies show decreased interest in their environment and become markedly hypotonic.Stage 2 (∼1 to 2 y): The loss of both expressive language and gross motor milestones, and the onset of abnormal hand movements, seizures, irritability,and insomnia are typical of progressing RS.Stage 3 (2 to 10 y): Severe mental retardation, seizures, and persistent stereotypic hand wringing movements characterize the childhood phase of RS. Most patients develop ataxic and wide-based gaits, but many affected girls never walk. Tremulousness is a common finding, as are breath-holding spells. Many children who have RS are misdiagnosed as having Angelman syndrome or ataxic cerebral palsy.Stage 4 (older than 10 y): As girls who have RS approach adolescence,they develop progressive scoliosis,muscle wasting, and can become wheelchair-bound. By the early teenage years, they reach a plateau in their neurologic regression, but death usually occurs during late adolescence from infection or cardiac arrhythmia.Many disorders that have different etiologies may resemble neurodegenerative diseases in clinical presentation:hydrocephalus, hypothyroidism, mass and structural lesions of the brain,chromosomal defects, poorly controlled seizures, environmental deprivation,subdural hematomas, and congenital and chronic infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus. Neurodegenerative disorders, unlike these others,are predominantly hereditary. Although the biochemical basis of many neurodegenerative disorders is not fully understood, a precise biochemical diagnosis always should be sought to make possible an accurate discussion of prognosis, to provide counseling, and sometimes to administer specific treatment.Over the past decade, the availability of molecular genetic testing has improved the accuracy of diagnosis in symptomatic patients, prenatally when genetic risk has been identified, and for carrier testing. Many neurodegenerative disorders can be diagnosed by biochemical testing of blood or urine without invasive procedures to obtain tissue for direct examination. Even so, a diagnosis of an altered enzyme disease should be confirmed histologically.In general, treatment is available for only a few of the neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, most remain invariably fatal by late childhood. Dietary therapy, restriction of a substrate or substrate precursor, modification of enzyme activity with cofactor vitamin therapy, and enzyme replacement all have been attempted with only limited success. Hope for more effective treatment comes from developments in molecular genetics that may allow the repair of specific point mutations in the human genome.In 1966, Rett described a syndrome of cerebral atrophy and hyperammonemia that appeared to affect girls exclusively. Experience has shown that elevated ammonia levels are an exception rather than the rule, and no other laboratory or imaging test provides diagnostic confirmation. Once again, we are thrown back on our clinical skills. Girls who have RS develop normally through the first few months of life, until their brains begin to atrophy, leading to acquired microcephaly. They progress to gait apraxia and truncal ataxia, autistic-like behavior, loss of cognitive function, rather typical\"hand-washing\" movements, seizures,and pyramidal tract signs. The dementia is devastating.We usually think of X-linked disorders, which RS appears to be, as primarily affecting boys: factor VIII deficiency,glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Whereas these disorders are recessive, RS may well be inherited dominantly and be lethal to boys because they have only one X chromosome. Hopefully,as Dr Rich remarks, advances in our understanding of the molecular genetics of neurodegenerative disorders like RS will lead to effective treatment.",

On the other hand, organic disease is constantly giving rise to emotional or mental reactions. On whichever basis they may arise, much of the mental symptomatology commonly encountered can be interpreted by the general medical practitioner. The general physician often hesitates to deal with mental conditions, although he attacks with confidence problems of equally obscure organic, serologic or bacterial origin.

Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

In several of these diseases, the degeneration of neurons is associated with marked accumulation of neurofilaments in neuronal cell bodies or processes, mainly axons. Motor neuron diseases with accumulation of neurofilaments have been described in a variety of animals, including Brittany spaniels, 5 a cat I9 rabbits",

      "abstract": "The origin of degenerative diseases of the central nervous system lies in genetic and acquired disorders. Analysis of the clinical characteristics of diseases affecting specific neuronal systems may help us to understand their pathogenesis. The stereotyped symptomatology characteristic of most degenerative diseases results from neuronal death in specific pathways: pyramidal tract and motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, nigrostriatal dopamine system in Parkinson's disease, posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord in Friedreich's ataxia, etc. This suggests that these neurons are sensitive to pathological processes that are still unknown. Progression of the disease, whether linear or not, is slow, but it is more rapid than similar effects due to ageing. This indicates either that the environmental cause of degeneration (if it exists) is continuously present or that a vital process has been once and for all disrupted, perhaps at the level of the genome, causing insufficient production of essential proteins, or accumulation of eventually toxic metabolites. Symptoms generally appear during adulthood, i.e. after normal differentiation has taken place, and after a considerable number of neurons have already been damaged. The initiation of neuronal death precedes the appearance of the first symptoms.",

      "abstract": "En el Sistema Nervioso Central existen diferentes tipos de neuronas. Una de ellas son las células motoras o motoneuronas. Estas células son de gran importancia ya que llevan la información a los músculos del cuerpo. Debido a la degeneración de neuronas motoras piramidales en la corteza motora, neuronas del tallo cerebral y neuronas del asta anterior en la médula espinal inducen la aparición de enfermedades motoras que producen atrofia progresiva de los músculos. Así, cuando se dañan estas células nerviosas, se presentan diferentes enfermedades motoras “raras” como: la esclerosis lateral amiotrófica, la esclerosis lateral primaria, la atrofia muscular espinal, síndrome de Guillain-Barré, la atrofia muscular espinal-bulbar y el síndrome pospoliomielítico, entre otros. Las patologías motoras pueden tener un origen congénito, genético o ambiental (viral, por fármacos o esporádico). Aunque estas enfermedades motoras se consideran poco comunes, son de gran importancia ya que los pacientes no logran recuperarse por la progresión de la enfermedad, lo que conlleva al fallecimiento. Esta revisión, analiza una serie de estudios clínicos de los últimos 20 años en estas patologías motoras para comprender mejor su etiología, diagnóstico y tratamientos, como el uso de células madre en la producción de oligodendrocitos que producen mielina, el cual es un factor clave en las enfermedades motoras y la utilización de antioxidantes que pueden ser la clave para obtener resultados prometedores que tiene como objetivo mantener la esperanza de vida en los sujetos que las padecen.",

They can emerge due to genetic factors or abnormalities in the brain or body acquired after birth, or because of faulty or incomplete physical experiences when learning more complex behavior. Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

According to pathological and neuroimaging studies, the traditional view of Parkinson's disease that begins with the development of motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, has begun to change. It is now understood that there would be a \"premotor\" or \"preclinical\" period in which the alphasynuclein pathology begins outside of the substantia nigra in the lower brainstem and autonomic nervous system. Although the pathophysiology of this phase is still unclear, it is currently thought that its symptoms would correspond to the so-called \"non-motor symptoms\". Hyposmia, depression, constipation and REM sleep disorders are one of the most relevant non-motor symptoms at this \"premotor\" stage. The spectrum of non-motor symptoms is very broad and covers the domains of neuropsychiatric, dysautonomic, gastrointestinal and sensory symptoms as well as sleep disorders. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, impulse control disorder, psychosis and dementia, are a major cause of disability as they are directly related to quality of life.",

      "title": "Integrated pathophysiology of schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder as monoamine axon disorder",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide evidence that similar to early-stage Parkinson’s disease, depression is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of monoamine axons. The major difference between the two disorders is that the symptoms of depression become evident without loss of monoamine neurons, while the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease appear after loss of the cell body. Given that the axonal degeneration of monoamine neurons underlies the pathophysiology of neurological (Parkinson’s disease) and neuropsychiatric (depression) diseases, axonal impairment of monoamine neurons is thought to also occur in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and play a significant role in the pathophysiology of these mental illnesses. The positive symptoms of schizophrenia and manic symptoms of bipolar disorder are known to occur in hyper-monoaminergic states, opposite to depressive symptoms, negative/cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, and motor disorders of Parkinson’s disease, all occurring in hypo-monoaminergic states. Since monoamine axons have the capacity to spontaneously regenerate or sprout in response to damage in the adult brain and sometimes show hyperinnervation due to excessive regeneration/sprouting beyond normal levels, it is possible that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are disorders that include excessive regeneration/sprouting of monoamine axons leading to hyper-monoaminergic states. Together, based on accumulating data from animal and human studies, the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder is summarized as follows: The degeneration of monoamine axons is associated with the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, major and bipolar depression, while hyper-regeneration/sprouting of monoamine axons underlies the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar mania. The integrated understanding of schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder as monoamine axon disorder will open the door to the development of new diagnosis and treatment methods for major mental illnesses as well as early-stage Parkinson’s disease.",

      "abstract": "The term 'stereotypies' encompasses a diverse range of movements, behaviours, and/or vocalizations that are repetitive, lack clear function, and sometimes appear to have a negative impact upon an individual's life. This review aims to describe motor stereotypies.This study reviewed the current literature on the nature, aetiology, and treatment of motor stereotypies.Motor stereotypies occur commonly but not exclusively in autistic spectrum disorders. Similar movements are also found in otherwise healthy children and those suffering sensory impairment, social isolation, or severe intellectual disabilities; they may be persistent over time. Although often difficult, it is possible to define and differentiate stereotypies from other movement disorders such as tics through features of the history, such as earlier onset and examination, together with the presence or absence of associated neurological impairment or developmental difficulties. Co-occurrence with other disorders affecting frontostriatal brain systems, including attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and tic disorders, is common.The underlying function of motor stereotypies remains unclear but may include the maintenance of arousal levels. A neurogenetic aetiology is proposed but requires further study. When treatment is sought, there are both pharmacological and behavioural options. Behavioural treatments for motor stereotypies may in time be shown to be most effective; however, they are difficult to implement in children younger than 7 years old.",

Revisar las caracteristicas clinicas y neurofisiologicas de las mioclonias y hacer un repaso actualizado de su etiologia y tratamiento. Desarrollo. Existen distintos criterios para clasificar las mioclonias. Segun el mecanismo fisiologico subyacente, pueden clasificarse en: corticales, subcorticales, espinales o perifericas. Las mioclonias estan presentes en un gran espectro de enfermedades neurologicas. Se denominan mioclonias sintomaticas aquellas secundarias a un trastorno identificable; se suelen acompanar de otros signos neurologicos y son las mas frecuentes. Las mioclonias epilepticas son aquellas que forman parte de un sindrome epileptico de causa genetica, idiopatica o por encefalopatia estatica. Las mioclonias esenciales son las menos frecuentes e incluyen el mioclono palatino y el sindrome mioclono-distonia. El principal objetivo terapeutico consiste en tratar la causa subyacente a las mioclonias si es posible y, si no es asi, emplear un tratamiento sintomatico. Los antiepilepticos que potencian el efecto del acido gamma-aminobutirico continuan siendo los farmacos mas eficaces. Dentro de los farmacos no antiepilepticos, destaca el piracetam y el 5-hidroxitriptofano. La toxina botulinica se ha demostrado eficaz en el mioclono palatino. En el sindrome mioclono-distonia, se ha investigado la eficacia de la estimulacion cerebral profunda en el palido interno. En las formas mas graves de mioclonias, la monoterapia no suele ser eficaz. Conclusiones. Se ha avanzado en el conocimiento sobre la neurofisiologia de las mioclonias, aunque no se han descubierto tratamientos altamente eficaces para este trastorno motor, que puede ser muy invalidante.",

Pain generally accompanies the visual loss in cases of inflammatory optic neuritis. Compressive or infiltrative lesions that affect the optic nerve, such as optic glioma or optic nerve sheath meningioma, may present with painless unilateral visual loss. Neoplastic and non-neoplastic causes of compression of the intracranial optic nerve and optic chiasm frequently present with visual field defects. Slowly progressive, symmetric, central visual loss suggests a possible toxic or nutritional cause. Hereditary optic neuropathies generally are classified by their mode of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or mitochondrial (maternal) inheritance. Symptoms may be confined to the visual system or be accompanied by other neurologic or systemic signs and symptoms. Optic neuropathy can also be a manifestation of inherited metabolic and degenerative diseases.",

Neurophysiological investigations are essential to diagnose NM and to distinguish it from other motor disorders, such as tremor or positive myoclonus.

      "title": "Psychogenic Neurologic Diseases",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many neurologic symptoms may appear without organic lesions of the nervous system. Based on the underlying mechanisms, psychogenic (or functional) neurologic diseases are classified into three categories: conversion disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering. Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

      "abstract": "The neuropathology of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), like Parkinson's disease (PD), is heterogeneous, but most cases have Lewy-related pathology as the major pathologic substrate of parkinsonism. Less common causes of the PDD clinical syndrome include progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Most cases of PDD have diffuse cortical Lewy bodies, medial temporal neurofibrillary degeneration, and neocortical diffuse amyloid deposits. In most cases, Alzheimer-type pathology is not sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A subset of cases have concurrent AD, multiple cerebrovascular lesions consistent with vascular dementia, or severe pathology of the isodendritic core of cortically projecting subcortical nuclei with Lewy-related pathology that is relatively restricted to brainstem or limbic areas. Comparable degrees of Lewy-related and Alzheimer-type pathology are sometimes detected in subjects with PD without dementia, which suggests that there are other, yet to be determined, factors that are more proximal causes of cognitive impairment in PDD, such as synaptic loss, deficiencies of neurotransmitters, or the presence of soluble toxic oligomers of Aβ, tau or α-synuclein that lead to neuronal dysfunction.",

The first, more traditionally biomedical is that the paralysis originates from some demonstrable pathology of the peripheral or central nervous system; the second does not fulfil this criterion and the paralysis can be broadly considered as an ‘unexplained medical symptom’ or, more specifically, as an ‘unexplained neurological symptom’ (Brown and Ron 2002). Inclusion within this second group, however, could occur for a number of different reasons-none of which is mutually exclusive. It may be that an underlying pathological agent does in fact exist but has yet to be identified. In this case, it may just be a matter of time, test sensitivity and technical breakthrough before a proven physiological abnormality and a relevant causal link will be established.

Some involve genetic or metabolic disturbances affecting the muscle directly, some are caused by interruptions to the transmission of impulses at the neuromuscular junction, still others by abnormalities in the muscle nerve supply. Disuse atrophy with profound weakness may be seen in advanced arthritis or in any other condition where chronic pain enforces immobility. There are numerous uncommon syndromes in which muscle weakness is an important component; many of these will come to a specialist neurologist for elucidation. Some weakness is temporary, recovery of strength often occurs in stroke or very commonly in Guillain-Barré syndrome. Cranial motor and peripheral muscular dysfunction in myasthenia gravis may respond to steroids, immuno-suppressants and either plasma exchange or immunoglobulin infusions as well as thymectomy and the use of pyridostigmine. There are presentations of ‘functional’ weakness (often unilateral and sometimes accompanied by sensory symptoms) commonly of prolonged duration, that are little altered by treatment of any kind, but are not readily assigned to any recognizable neurological diagnosis. This group of disorders reminds us that weakness is a subjective as well an objective and measurable symptom.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neurometabolic diseases are a group of disorders that lead to a disruption in the normal metabolism within the body and nervous system. Abnormalities of metabolic processes at any level can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical features and pathologies. The nervous system is particularly susceptible to metabolic derangements, either inborn or acquired. Early diagnosis can prevent or delay damage to the nervous system through appropriate treatment when possible. Many neurometabolic disorders have poor prognoses, and patients often present and succumb within months to the early years of life; however, some disorders can present later in life with varying levels of severity. In many later onset cases, the diagnosis is preceded by nonspecific symptoms including psychiatric manifestations. In addition to psychiatric manifestations, various neurological features often occur at some point in the course of the disease. Of these features, movement disorders are particularly common. In fact, many neurometabolic diseases will present with subtle movement disorders that are often missed or overlooked. Many congenital metabolic diseases are rapidly neurodegenerative and, due to the nature of such diseases, result in early demise or severe cognitive decline. While by no means exhaustive, this chapter aims to outline and discuss some of the neurometabolic diseases that present with both psychiatric and movement disorders as prominent features.",

Pathological apoptosis contributes to a wide variety of diseases including PD. Various insults and/or cellular phenotypes have been shown to trigger distinct signaling events leading to cell death in neurons affected by PD. The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway, inflammatory or oxidative stress-induced extrinsic pathways are the main events associated with apoptosis in PD-related neuronal loss. Although SN is the main brain area studied so far, other brain nuclei are also affected by the disease leading to non-classical motor symptoms as well as non-motor symptoms.

Symptom relief for acutely ill neurologic patients requires medication orders. Treatment of these symptoms is not without adverse effects, and regular use of opioids to treat severe headaches may very often lead to opioid-induced constipation, which may progress to adynamic ileus. This chapter focuses on, nausea and vomiting, hiccups, secretion control, constipation, fever and shivering, and rhabdomyolysis. Large volumes of emesis or secretions can easily cause aspiration and mucus plugging of large bronchial branches. Drug regimens are discussed in detail.",

Movement disorders represent a prominent feature of prion diseases and include cerebellar and extrapyramidal symptoms. Myoclonus is by far the most common involuntary movement in prion diseases. An awareness of the diagnosis is important to avoid the risk of iatrogenic transmission and to allow a discussion about prognosis with family and relatives.",

A primeira fase da biossíntese do grupo heme ocorre na mitocôndria, as fases intermediárias ocorrem no citosol e as fases finais ocorrem novamente na mitocôndria. Existem diversos fatores que participam do desencadeamento dessa doença, como fármacos, bebidas alcoólicas, hormônios, dietas, estresse, exposição aos raios solares, entre outros. A classificação das Porfirias é feita de acordo com a origem dos precursores em excesso, sendo, então, Porfirias Eritropoéticas ou Hepáticas. Também podem ser classificadas em Agudas e Crônicas, de acordo com as manifestações clínicas. Assim, sintomas neuropsiquiátricos, dores abdominais, vômitos, neuropatia aguda, convulsões e distúrbios mentais como alucinações, depressão, paranoia e ansiedades são referentes ao aspecto agudo. Já em casos crônicos, a manifestação clínica se dá sob a forma de fotossensibilidade cutânea. O tratamento é realizado após a descoberta dos sintomas. Sendo a Porfiria uma doença considerada rara e com poucos estudos relacionados a ela, este trabalho abrange suas principais características, diferenciando-a segundo sua classificação.",

Its symptoms are not specific and often the patients are mistaken as Parkinson s disease patients, or even Alzheimer s ones.Initial features in progressive supranuclear paralysis are typically a gait disorder with frequent falls, behavioral disorder and often dysarthria. The gaze disorder, showing voluntary conjugate gase paralysis is characteristic, but it can appear late in the course of disease. Other motor signs are axial rigidity, bradykinesia, stiffness, and rarely chorea, ataxia, muscle weakness or myoclonus. Pseudobulbar paralysis is the more remarkable clinical finding. These motor symptoms are accompanied by cognitive disturbances, the typical ones of subcortical dementia, with mind slowness, apathy, depression, and, more often that in other primary dementias, psychotic features and relatively early behavioral disorders. A useful feature to distinguish the mental changes of progressive supranuclear paralysis with other primary subcortical dementias is a more remarkable impairment in visuospatial function, because of the need of a good gaze function to accomplish it. Progressive supranuclear paralysis patients work better in verbal tests that in visuospatial test. We try to describe clinical data and evolutive profile of this entity, whose cognitive disturbances as described by Albert in 1974 strongly stabilized the concept of subcortical dementia.",

      "abstract": "Cerebralna paraliza najcesci je uzrok težih neuromotornih odstupanja u djece. Cerebralna paraliza je klinicki entitet kojim se oznacuje skupina neprogresivnih, ali cesto promjenjivih motorickih poremecaja uzrokovanih razvojnim poremecajem ili ostecenjem mozga u ranom stadiju razvoja. Prevalencija se krece oko 2-3/1000 živorođene djece. Zbog nespecificne etiologije i velike varijabilnosti klinicke slike, važno je primijeniti kriterije ukljucivanja i iskljucivanja motorickih poremecaja u ovaj entitet, kako bi se mogli jednoznacno voditi registri oboljelih od cerebralne paralize, uspoređivati i pratiti prevalencija i provoditi preventivne mjere. Iz cerebralne paralize iskljucuje se sve veci broj definiranih neurogenetickih sindroma kao i progresivnih poremecaja, nasljednih metabolickih i heredodegenerativnih bolesti, bolesti kraljesnicke moždine te hipotonije kao zasebnog simptoma. Cerebralna paraliza je klinicka dijagnoza koja se temelji na anamnezi, klinickoj slici i tijeku bolesti, a ocituje se neuromotornim poremecajem kontrole položaja i pokreta tijela, tonusa i refleksa vec od dojenacke dobi (neuroloski sindromi), cesto promjenjivim simptomima, ali uvijek je prisutan usporen razvoj motorike. Da bi se omogucila ujednacenija klasifikacija tipova cerebralne paralize, uzimajuci u obzir promjenjivost simptoma motorickog poremecaja tijekom vremena, Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe (SCPE) predlaže pojednostavljenu klasifikaciju na temelju neuroloskih simptoma u jedan od triju osnovnih tipova (spasticni, diskinetski, atakticni ) te podtipova (bilateralni i unilateralni spasticni te distoni i koreo-atetotski diskinetski ) cerebralne paralize. Konacnu dijagnozu te klasificiranje tipa cerebralne paralize nije dopusteno obaviti prije 4. godine (najranije u dobi od tri, a optimalno od pet godina). Djeca sa cerebralnom paralizom cesto imaju pridružena blaža ili teža neurorazvojna odstupanja: poremecaj vida, sluha, epilepsiju, intelektualni deficit, poremecaj govora, komunikacije, osjeta i percepcije. Umjesto topografske klasifikacije primjenjuje se funkcionalno stupnjevanje grubih motorickih funkcija za donje ekstremitete, tj. GMFCS (Gross Motor Function Classification System) i za finu motoriku sake, tj. BFMF (Bimanual Fine Motor Function) te MACS (Manual Ability Classification System). Osim neurorazvojnog klinickog pregleda u dijagnostici cerebralne paralize i pridruženih neurorazvojnih odstupanja primjenjuju se metode slikovnog prikaza. Intrakranijska ultrasonografija je metoda izbora u novorođenackoj i dojenackoj dobi za dijagnostiku i pracenje ishoda strukturnih promjena nakon perinatalnog ostecenja mozga s pouzdanim prikazom vrste, lokalizacije i opsega ostecenja, kako hipoksicno-ishemicnog tako i peri-intraventrikularnog krvarenja. Zahvaljujuci ovoj metodi, moguce je dijagnosticirati cisticnu periventrikularnu leukomalaciju (PVL), koja je u 70-96% slucajeva povezana s razvojem cerebralne paralize u nedonoscadi. Magnetska rezonancija mozga omogucuje vrlo dobar i pregledan prikaz strukture parenhima mozga kao i ostecenja, napose blažih stupnjeva hipoksicno-ishemicnih ostecenja, razvojnih poremecaja mozga te ishodnih strukturnih promjena. Uz lokalizaciju omogucuje i procjenu približnog vremena nastanka ostecenja mozga. Neurofizioloske tehnike omogucuju uvid u funkcionalnu procjenu sredisnjeg živcanog sustava, a u dijagnostici djece s perinatalnim ostecenjem sve se sire rabe elektroencefalografija i evocirani potencijali: vidni (VEP), slusni (AEP) te somatosenzorni (SSEP).",

Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are often the first manifestations of the disease before diagnosis is made. These symptoms are diverse: psychic manifestations such as anxiety, depression or behavioral disorders, dysautonomia, pain, alteration of smell or vision, and sleep disturbances. These symptoms can be dramatic and confounding such as those seen in nonmotor fluctuations. Altogether, non-motor symptoms contribute to the impairment of the quality of life of the patients. Therefore, they must be systematically analyzed, and, when possible corrected.Les troubles non moteurs de la maladie de parkinson et leur prise en charge.

      "title": "Les hallucinations dans la maladie de Parkinson",
      "abstract": "Les hallucinations dans la maladie de Parkinson sont une complication relativement fréquente au stade des complications cognitives de la maladie. Étant généralement peu inquiétantes, le sujet ne les rapportera pas toujours spontanément. Pourtant, elles peuvent en effet signer l’entrée dans une psychose ou une démence parkinsonienne. Elles grèvent la qualité de vie du patient, de son entourage et parfois mettent en péril le maintien à domicile des sujets. Elles ne doivent donc pas êtres négligées. Classiquement les hallucinations dans la maladie de Parkinson sont d’abord visuelles, parfois mineures (simples de passage à la périphérie du champ visuel) ou au contraire très élaborées. Leur physiopathologie demeure imparfaitement connue. L’atteinte visuelle centrale, et notamment au niveau de l’intégration des données visuelles semble jour un rôle majeur. Cependant, d’autres systèmes dont le fonctionnement est perturbé dans la maladie de Parkinson sont impliqués dans la survenue des hallucinations : système visuel périphérique (rétine), voies régulatrices du cycle veille sommeil et notamment du sommeil paradoxal et enfin le système frontal et notamment exécutif. La prise en charge des hallucinations dans la maladie de Parkinson est relativement stéréotypée. Il faut tout d’abord dépister pour les éliminer les facteurs favorisants, notamment de type médicamenteux ou métabolique. Si les hallucinations persistent, le traitement antiparkinsonien doit être revu rapidement avec en priorité la diminution ou l’arrêt des anticholinergiques, des agonistes dopaminergiques et de l’amantadine, puis des inhibiteurs de la catéchol-O-méthyltransférase (COMT) et de la monoaminoxydase B (MAO B). Au besoin, les doses de dopamine peuvent être diminuées. Ces adaptations thérapeutiques permettent en général de contrôler les hallucinations, parfois au détriment de l’état moteur. Malgré tout, si les hallucinations persistent, un traitement neuroleptique par petites doses de clozapine peut être indiqué avec en générale une excellente efficacité.",

      "title": "Neurology and the kidney",
      "abstract": "Renal failure is relatively common, but except in association with spina bifida or paraplegia it is unlikely to occur as a result of disease of the CNS. Renal failure, however, commonly affects the nervous system. The effects of kidney failure on the nervous system are more pronounced when failure is acute. In addition to the important problems related to renal failure there are both acquired and genetically determined diseases which may affect the kidney and the brain. Those acquired diseases include the vasculitides, the paraproteinaemias, and various granulomatous conditions (considered in other chapters of <i>Neurology and Medicine</i>). In two of the most commonly encountered genetically determined diseases, Von Hippel-Lindau disease and polycystic kidney disease, location of pathogenic mutations will provide improved screening programmes and, possibly, allow therapeutic intervention. Uraemia may affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Whereas the clinical features of uraemia are well documented, the pathophysiology is less well understood and probably multifactorial. Uraemic encephalopathy, which classically fluctuates, is associated with problems in cognition and memory and may progress to delirium, convulsions, and coma. The encephalopathy may initially worsen with periods of dialysis and almost certainly relates to altered metabolic states in association with ionic changes and possibly impaired synaptic function. Renal failure may affect the peripheral nervous system, resulting in a neuropathy which shows a predilection for large diameter axons. This may be reversed by dialysis and transplantation. The myopathy seen in renal failure, often associated with bone pain and tenderness, is similar to that encountered in primary hyperparathyroidism and osteomalacia. Dialysis itself is associated with neurological syndromes including the dysequilibrium syndrome, subdural haematoma, and Wernicke's encephalopathy. Dialysis dementia, which was prevalent during the 1970s, has reduced in frequency with the use of aluminium free dialysate. With the introduction of transplantation and the concomitant use of powerful immunosuppressive drugs, the pattern of neurological problems encountered in renal replacement therapy has shifted. Five per cent of patients develop nerve injuries during renal transplantation, and up to 40% of patients experience neurological side effects from cyclosporine. Furthermore, CNS infections, often fungal in type, have been reported in up to 45% of transplant patients coming to postmortem. The nature of the involvement of neurologists with their nephrology colleagues is therefore evolving.",

Symptoms and signs such as neuropathic pain and tinnitus and hyperactive disorders such as muscle spasm and synkinesis may result from such changes in function. Plastic changes that cause symptoms of diseases can be initiated by novel stimulations, overstimulation, or deprivation of input and the induced changes in the function of central nervous system structures may persist and aggravate after these events have ceased if the condition is not reversed. Disorders that are caused by neural plasticity are potentially reversible with treatment. However, the absence of morphologic abnormalities makes diagnosis of these conditions difficult and their treatment has been hampered by lack of understanding of their pathophysiology. Here the role of neural plasticity in the pathophysiology of several disorders is reviewed. [Neurol Res 2001; 23: 565-572] Keywords: NEURAL PLASTICITYNEUROPATHIC PAINMUSCLE SPASMSYNKINESISTINNITUS",

      "title": "Gut Hormones Restrict Neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and the second most common neurological disorder behind Alzheimer's disease in today's society.It is a progressive disorder that affects more than 1% of people older than 60.Cardinal features of Parkinson's disease include motor dysfunction such as rigidity, resting tremor, postural instability and bradykinesia.These debilitating symptoms manifest due to the massive loss of dopamine in the striatum, the nerve terminal region of dopamine neurons are located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc).This anatomical circuit is known as the nigrostriatal pathway and plays a critical role in fine tuning motor functions.At present there are only a few known monogenic mutations accelerating the onset of Parkinson's disease, therefore most cases are considered sporadic and develop as a complex polygenic interaction with age and environment.Although the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is largely unknown, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, intracellular protein accumulation (Lewy Bodies containing α-synuclein) and abnormal protein degradation all play a key role in disease progression.Because loss of dopamine in the striatum causes motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease, dopamine supplementation can be used to alleviate motor symptoms but this is only a temporary solution as the efficacy diminishes with age and as the disease progresses.There are no known therapies that halt or reduce the progression of the disease, largely because the cause of Parkinson's disease remains enigmatic.Parkinson's disease also causes symptoms in other parts of the nervous system.Constipation and gastrointestinal (GI) problems are often some of the earliest symptoms, well before the presence of dopamine dysfunction, and post mortem studies in Parkinson's disease patients identified protein accumulation in the enteric nervous system of the GI tract [1].This 'Braak's hypothesis' suggests protein accumulation in enteric neurons spreads in a retrograde manner to the brain through the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and triggers Parkinson's disease.Braak observed in post mortem tissue that patients with presymptomatic Parkinson's disease had protein aggregation in the peripheral nervous system but not the central nervous system [1].Protein aggregation ascended into the central nervous system and correlated with the development of motor dysfunction.This observation shows that the topographic ascending lesion pattern resembles a falling row of www.intechopen.comAdvanced Understanding of Neurodegenerative Diseases 270 dominos and prompts the question; does Parkinson's disease originate outside the central nervous system?Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that GI abnormalities, which precede central nervous system changes, trigger Parkinson's disease.For example, mice expressing mutant α-synuclein in gut enteric neurons exhibited extensive GI dysfunction followed by motor abnormalities [2].Moreover, low doses of rotenone, a compound found in pesticides that causes Parkinson's-like conditions, produced GI disturbances and enteric neuronal αsynuclein aggregates in rats before neuronal protein aggregation [3,4].These studies, taken together with the early GI disturbances in humans, clearly implicate the GI system in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.The stomach and intestines comprise the GI 'digestive' system, which produces a number of hormones to aid energy metabolism, digestion and nutrient uptake into the circulation.Despite the fact that evidence suggests GI dysfunction triggers Parkinson's disease, little is known about gastrointestinal hormones in Parkinson's disease.This chapter examines how gut hormones influence the nigrostriatal dopamine system.www.intechopen.",

      "abstract": "The clinical diagnosis of neurological disease requires a particularly detailed analysis of patients' symptoms. This is partly because the nervous system is a communications system with direct access to consciousness, so that the patient is in a unique position to monitor his own disorder. Clinical diagnosis becomes very difficult in the presence of dysphasia, confusion or dementia. Another reason is that useful biochemical and histological information about the function of neurons is rarely available, in contrast to the wealth of data used in the assessment of diseases of other organs, such as the lungs, liver or kidneys. The failure of neurons in the CNS to regenerate means that delay in making a precise diagnosis can worsen the eventual outcome; the clinician often cannot afford to watch how an illness progresses before intervening.",

Physiological ('benign') fasciculations often begin suddenly and persist for years without development of muscular wasting or weakness. Fasciculations may be a sign of degeneration of lower motor neurons in which case they may be associated with muscle cramps and neuromyotonia. Both sensory and motor axons are overactive in neuromyotonia, the symptoms of which are relieved by administration of anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine. Spinal muscular atrophy is a feature in some cases of progressive myoclonic epilepsy of the systems degeneration type that may be overlooked because muscular wasting is overshadowed by the dramatic appearance of action myoclonus.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), also known as Parkinsonism, is a neurological condition that mostly, but not solely, impairs movement control. It is distinguished by an increased deterioration and loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra area of the brain. The exact aetiology of PD is complicated and multifaceted. It is considered to comprise a blend of genetic vulnerability and environmental variables that contribute to the development of the condition. Some of the important reasons include heredity, the pile-up of abnormal alpha-synuclein proteins in the brain and enteric nervous systems, heavy metal neurotoxicity, head trauma, and so on. Over the years, the diagnosis of PD has mostly hinged on the clinical triad of its movement-related symptoms: tremor, rigidity, and bradycardia. Though these symptoms are not prodromal of PD, they are often detected in the extremely severe phase of the illness when therapies and treatments are no longer highly effective. Therefore, this review focuses on the need for understanding the prodromal biomarkers associated with PD, such as non-motor biomarkers, biochemical biomarkers, and inflammatory biomarkers, as well as advances in neuroimaging biomarkers, in order to facilitate new diagnostic methods other than the normal motor symptoms to aid early diagnosis and responsive therapies and treatments of the disease. Some new discoveries, such as that of distinct neural networks and pathways of the illness, combination biomarkers, and salivary gland biopsy, are promising and could assist to quickly detect the condition.",

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

CP is neither a specific disease nor a pathological or aetiological entity, and importantly the term CP does not—and should not—necessarily imply or identify a specific cause. The prevalence of CP ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 per 1000 live births, with the risk highest among very preterm and low birthweight babies. However, the majority of children with CP are born at or near term gestation. Causes of CP include perinatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, intra- or periventricular haemorrhage, cerebral dysgenesis, and intracranial infection. The CP syndromes may be classified by the predominant type of motor disturbance, including, for example, diplegia, tetraplegia, hemiplegia, dyskinesia, and ataxia, although frequently the overall clinical picture is not always pure. Finally, the aetiologies for these different syndromes tend to be quite distinct.\n\nOnce a diagnosis of CP has been made on the basis of the child's symptoms and signs, each child should undergo appropriate evaluation and investigation to try and establish a cause and specifically to determine whether it is of prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal origin. Investigation is indicated even when there has been evidence of a preceding neurological event during the perinatal period or infancy, because some of these children may have an underlying neurological or metabolic disorder which may have made them more vulnerable to the stresses of delivery and extrauterine life. Finally, it is important that all children with a diagnosis of CP should be followed up, and when no obvious cause has been identified or there …",

Se manifiesta en general como un trastorno motor agudo de curso progresivo o rapidamente progresivo. La debilidad muscular aguda es una urgencia neuromuscular en especial si afecta a la musculatura respiratoria u orofaringea. La localizacion de la debilidad, las senales y los sintomas asociados suelen permitir la ubicacion de la lesion. La instalacion, la velocidad de la evolucion y otros datos de la historia sugieren un diagnostico fisiopatologico diferencial. El exito en el tratamiento depende de saber establecer un diagnostico diferencial rapido y correcto. En este articulo, se presenta el diagnostico diferencial de las principales patologias neuromusculares que causan la debilidad muscular aguda en la infancia.",

      "abstract": "Objective Neurometabolic disorders are an important group of diseases that mostly are presented in newborns and infants. Neurological manifestations are the prominent signs and symptoms in this group of diseases. Seizures are a common sign and are often refractory to antiepileptic drugs in untreated neurometabolic patients. The onset of symptoms for neurometabolic disorders appears after an interval of normal or near normal growth and development.Additionally, affected children may fare well until a catabolic crisis occurs. Patients with neurometabolic disorders during metabolic decompensation have severe clinical presentation, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This symptom is often fatal but severe neurological insult and regression in neurodevelopmental milestones can result as a prominent sign in patients who survived. Acute symptoms should be immediately treated regardless of the cause. A number of patients with neurometabolic disorders respond favorably and, in some instances, dramatically respond to treatment. Early detection and early intervention is invaluable in some patients to prevent catabolism and normal or near normal neurodevelopmental milestones. This paper discusses neurometabolic disorders, approaches to this group of diseases (from the view of a pediatric neurologist), clinical and neurological manifestations, neuroimaging and electroencephalography findings, early detection, and early treatment.",

The pathological changes affect either the muscle fibre directly and/or indirectly by impairing its nervous control. Lower motor neuron disorders in cats with neuromuscular disorders that are ambulatory are characterized by paresis in which there is a reduction in the ability to support weight resulting in a shortened stride. Additionally, the presenting signs of severe systemic disease and some orthopaedic and cardiorespiratory disorders may mimic those of neuromuscular disease. Diagnosis of a neuromuscular disorder is made on the basis of signalment, physical and neurological examination, laboratory testing, electrodiagnostic testing and biopsy. Brachial plexus neuritis is a rare multiple mononeuropathy that presents as acute bilateral lower motor neuron paresis or plegia of the forelimbs.

      "abstract": "Sjogren's syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by xerophthalmia and xerostomia; it is associated with widespread systemic visceral involvement. A wide variety of neurological complications are characteristic features of Sjogren's syndrome, of which peripheral neuropathy is a major neurological manifestation. Based on the predominant neuropathic symptoms, patients can be considered to have several forms of neuropathies, including sensory ataxic neuropathy, painful sensory neuropathy without sensory ataxia, multiple mononeuropathy, multiple cranial neuropathy, trigeminal neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and radiculoneuropathy. Acute or subacute onset is observed more frequently in multiple mononeuropathy and multiple cranial neuropathies, whereas disease progression is usually chronic in other forms of neuropathies. Sensory symptoms without substantial motor involvement are observed predominantly in sensory ataxic, painful sensory, trigeminal, and autonomic neuropathies. In contrast, motor impairment is apparent in multiple mononeuropathy, multiple cranial neuropathy, and radiculoneuropathy. Autonomic symptoms such as abnormal pupils and orthostatic hypotension are particularly noted in patients with sensory ataxic, painful, trigeminal, and autonomic neuropathies. Sural nerve biopsy specimens reveal predominantly large fiber loss in sensory ataxic neuropathy and predominantly small fiber loss in painful sensory neuropathy. Vasculitis is observed most frequently in multiple mononeuropathy. The autopsy findings of patients with sensory ataxic and painful neuropathies demonstrate neuronal loss in the dorsal root ganglia and sympathetic ganglia with CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Differential therapeutic responses to corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin can be seen among the various neuropathic forms. In conclusion, the clinicopathological features of neuropathies associated with Sjogren's syndrome are highly variable. The neuropathy classification is important from a therapeutic point of view.",

      "title": "Peripheral Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Peripheral neuropathy describes the clinical syndrome of weakness, sensory loss, diminished tendon reflexes, or some combination of these findings caused by lesions of peripheral nerves. It may symmetrically involve the distal extremities, usually lower extremity greater than upper extremity (distal sensory, motor, or sensorimotor polyneuropathy), or may involve one or more named nerves (mononeuritis or mononeuritis multiplex). Peripheral neuropathy can also involve nerve roots (polyradiculopathy). From a pathophysiologic perspective, peripheral neuropathies are commonly divided into axonal and demyelinating types. Axonal neuropathy primarily destroys the axon, with secondary loss of the myelin sheath. Nerve conduction velocities are commonly normal with axonal neuropathy, but the sensory or motor amplitudes are low. Demyelinating neuropathy is associated with loss of the myelin sheath but preservation of the axon. Nerve conduction velocities are slowed, but the amplitudes are normal with this type of neuropathy. From a clinical standpoint, four main types of peripheral neuropathy occur among HIV-infected persons: (1) distal sensory polyneuropathy (DSPN), (2) acute and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP and CIDP), (3) mononeuritis or mononeuritis multiplex (MM), and (4) lumbosacral polyradiculopathy (LSPR). With HIV-infected patients, the type of neuropathy depends in part on the degree of their immunodeficiency. Patients with AIDP and CIDP more often have early stage HIV disease. Distal sensory neuropathy, the most common form of neuropathy, generally develops in patients with more advanced, or late stage HIV disease. Similarly, LSPR predominantly occurs in patients who have progressed to AIDS. Mononeuritis or limited MM can develop in early stage HIV disease; extensive neuritis is seen in late stage HIV disease and may resemble CIDP.",

It may present with an obvious diagnosis of 'classical migraine' or it may mimic acute neurological disease.

      "abstract": "Mental disorders accompanying digestive system diseases constitute interdisciplinary yet scarcely acknowledged both diagnostic and therapeutic problem. One of the mostly recognized examples is coeliac disease where patients endure the large spectrum of psychopathological symptoms, starting with attention deficit all the way down to the intellectual disability in extreme cases. It has not been fully explained how the pathomechanism of digestive system diseases affects patient's mental health, however one of the hypothesis suggests that it is due to serotonergic or opioid neurotransmission imbalance caused by gluten and gluten metabolites effect on central nervous system. Behavioral changes can also be invoked by liver or pancreatic diseases, which causes life-threatening abnormalities within a brain. It occurs that these abnormalities reflexively exacerbate the symptoms of primary somatic disease and aggravate its course, which worsens prognosis. The dominant mental disease mentioned in this article is depression which because of its effect on a hypothalamuspituitary- adrenal axis and on an autonomic nervous system, not only aggravates the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases but may accelerate their onset in genetically predisposed patients. Depression is known to negatively affects patients' ability to function in a society and a quality of their lives. Moreover, as far as children are concerned, the occurrence of digestive system diseases accompanied by mental disorders, may adversely affect their further physical and psychological development, which merely results in worse school performance. All those aspects of mental disorders indicate the desirability of the psychological care for patients with recognized digestive system disease. The psychological assistance should be provided immediately after diagnosis of a primary disease and be continued throughout the whole course of treatment.",

      "abstract": "Myoclonus is een frequent voorkomende hyperkinetische bewegingsstoornis die wordt gekenmerkt door spierschokken (positieve myoclonus) en/of het kortdurend wegvallen van de spiertonus (negatieve myoclonus). De klinische presentatie van myoclonus is heel divers. De schokken kunnen in een of meerdere lichaamsdelen optreden of gegeneraliseerd zijn. Myoclonus kan optreden in het gelaat, de nek, romp en de ledematen. Het kan in rust of juist bij actie optreden en wel of niet stimulusgevoelig zijn. Over het algemeen belemmert myoclonus patienten ernstig in hun dagelijks functioneren, zoals bij eten/drinken, schrijven en lopen. Myoclonus heeft vele oorzaken, zowel verworden als genetisch. Voor het vaststellen van de onderliggende oorzaak en het bepalen van de juiste behandeling is het belangrijk myoclonus te herkennen en te onderscheiden van andere bewegingsstoornissen zoals bijvoorbeeld tremor en chorea. Na het herkennen kan myoclonus op basis van een anatomische classificatie worden ingedeeld in subtypes, i.e. naar de plaats in het zenuwstelsel waar de schokken ontstaan. Dit zijn corticale (hersenschors), subcorticale (diepe hersenkernen/hersenstam), spinale (ruggenmerg) en perifere (zenuwen/spieren) myoclonus. Daarnaast kunnen schokken ook een uiting zijn van een functionele (psychogene) stoornis. Door myoclonus naar anatomische classificatie te groeperen kan diagnostiek gericht ingezet worden. Dit proefschrift biedt een nieuw diagnostische aanpak voor patienten met myoclonus. Het beschrijft de uitdagingen en het belang van het nauwkeurig klinisch fenotyperen van zowel motorische als niet-motorische symptomen en de classificatie van het anatomisch myoclonus subtype. Het klinisch neurofysiologisch onderzoek heeft een belangrijke toegevoegde waarde naast de klinische beoordeling in de (sub)classificatie van myoclonus.",

Besides, decline of cognition is common in severely ill patients. While the pathogenesis of PD has not been fully studied, genetic and environmental factors are generally thought to play a role. There are a lot of potential mechanisms like mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation and abnormal metabolism. Drugs therapy is the major treatment for PD.

      "abstract": "Unexpected death in neonates and infants has no explanation in a larger percentage of cases than is true for adults. Sudden death in neonates/infants secondary to central nervous system (CNS) causes is relatively uncommon. Birth injury is typically but not always recognized. Even with a history of CNS injury, the death may still be unexpected. CNS pathology is fairly common at postmortem examination, but is often not causal. One of the most common critical neuropathologies is hypoxic-ischemic and may be hemorrhagic. In both the acute and chronic phases, the differentiation from nonaccidental trauma needs to be evaluated. Evaluation is best achieved in a well-fixed brain. Some pathology cannot be seen macroscopically and requires microscopic sections.",

Chronic insomnia can be caused by neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders starting or persisting during sleep that hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity. Three specific neurological conditions, Fatal familial insomnia, a human prion disease, Morvan's chorea, an autoimmune limbic encephalopathy, and Delirium tremens, the well-known alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, share a common clinical phenotype characterized by an inability to sleep associated with motor and autonomic activation.

They can develop in association with various immunological responses against onconeuronal proteins (e.g. anti-Hu, anti-Ri, anti-Yo, anti-Ma, anti-Ta and anti-Tr) or with immunological mechanisms against unknown antigens. The eye movement abnormalities may have a supranuclear, nuclear or internuclear origin. There is no ocular movement abnormality which can be considered pathognomonic of a paraneoplastic disorder, but opsoclonus-myoclonus of infancy is often associated with neuroblastoma. The association of hearing loss and paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy suggests that in some patients the neurosensory deafness result from involvement of the ganglia of Corti and/or the cochlear nuclei in the brain stem. The management of these syndromes depends on their rapid identification as paraneoplastic disorders and on the early diagnosis and treatment of the cancer. Patients with anti-Ta (or anti Ma-2) antibodies may improve with treatment of the cancer, usually a germ-cell tumor of the testis. Paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus of infancy usually improves with treatment that combines chemotherapy, steroids, and intravenous immunoglobulins, although neurological sequelae (psychomotor and language retardation) are frequent.There are several paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes that may present with otoneurophthalmologic symptoms. Detection of antineuronal antibodies facilitates the early identification of some of these syndromes and associated tumors. In general, the management of these syndromes is based on treatment of the associated cancer.",

Chronic encephalopathies may be non-progressive, occurring, for example, as a consequence of brain trauma or cerebral hypoxia, or progressive, arising as a result of an intrinsic, extrinsic or metabolic cerebral disorder. The primary focus of this article is the dementia syndromes that result from progressive degenerative disease. However, vascular disease will also briefly be addressed, because vascular dementia is relatively common and is an important cause of dementia. The traditional view of dementia as a global loss of intellect is inaccurate. Cerebral diseases do not affect the brain uniformly, but preferentially affect certain brain regions and spare others. Moreover, psychological processes themselves are regionally organized in specific brain regions. Different cerebral diseases therefore are associated with distinctive and characteristic neuropsychological syndromes, whose identification can",

      "abstract": "References 316Many of the distinctions among the illnesses that cause the syndrome of dementia become blurred or disappear in advanced or late stage dementia for several reasons. First, neuropathological abnormalities become so widespread that almost all brain systems that subserve cognition and function become impaired. A second and related issue is that the widespread involvement of subcortical or 'downstream' structures and systems results in widespread and near total dysfunction of 'upstream' cognitive and motor systems that are not directly involved by neuropathology. Thus, this chapter will approach late stage or advanced dementia as a single or common end point of all the dementias even though some distinctions, for example the frequency of myoclonus and seizures, do persist. Thus, while knowledge of the unique aspects of specific diseases plays a prominent role in the care of people with dementia in the earlier stages of the dementia, this is usually not the case in late-stage dementia (Robinson et al., 2006).",

These disorders are a heterogenous group of disorders and may represent an underlying genetic disorder, a metabolic disorder or a hypoxic–ischemic insult during the perinatal period. Hyperkinetic movement disorders are more common as compared to hypokinetic disorders. This is unlike the situation in adult movement disorders where hypokinetic disorders are more often seen. A child's nervous system is more prone to hypoxic-ischemic insults due to its higher metabolic demands and the presence of an immature blood-brain barrier. The commonest movement disorders seen are tics, dystonia and chorea. Myoclonus is commonly associated with epilepsy syndromes. The aetiology of paediatric movement disorders depends on their course, their static or progressive nature, and whether an isolated symptom or an association with other neurological symptoms is present. The clue to the diagnosis is the proper recognition of the movement prevalent in the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathy may be difficult to distinguish from neuronopathy, on both motor and sensory sides. A number of disorders that present with characteristic electro-clinical features are readily recognized. Except for those, distinction of the lesions that concern the peripheral nerve cell or the axon may require support of clinical, electrophysiological and other ancillary tests. Distinction between motor neuropathy and neuronopathy can be based on the abnormalities of nerve conduction and on the signs that relate to the reinnervation process. Signs of terminal axonal reinnervation, such as motor axon reflex, may be observed in axonal neuronopathies, whereas only collateral reinnervation occurs in motor neuronopathies. Sensory axonopathies are usually characterized by clinical and electrophysiological findings that are axon length-dependent, by the course of the disorder that is most often chronic, and by possible reversibility. Sensory neuronopathies are usually subacute and induce clinical deficits that are more or less widespread to the whole body surface rather than distal. Follow-up studies disclose limited or absent recovery. A better knowledge of the structural differences of motor and sensory neurons and axons will improve our understanding and lead to the development of specific tests. Meanwhile, although some parameters and techniques should still be improved, electrophysiological and additional tests are useful to detect and to distinguish the peripheral nerve disorders that affect the nerve cell bodies and their axons.",

We review the main NPNS paying particular attention to those with ophthalmological and otological features.Certain neuro-ophthalmological findings may constitute, at least partly, some paraneoplastic syndromes. There are alterations of vision in paraneoplastic retinopathy and in optic neuritis of paraneoplastic origin. The latter, unlike the retinopathy, usually coexists with involvement of other structures of the nervous system. Oculomotor function is affected in the opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome. Diplopia and/or ophthalmoplegia may be a predominant or initial symptom, in patients with paraneoplastic neurological degeneration or brainstem encephalitis. In the Lambert-Eaton syndrome and in paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, may have blurred vision and alterations of the pupil. Cases of paraneoplastic uveitis have also been described. Paraneoplastic otological involvement is less frequent. Patients with sensorineural deafness in the context of a paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis have been reported. In the NPNS vertigo is caused by cerebellar or brainstem lesions and not by lesions of peripheral organs. When nystagmus occurs in a NPNS it may be of various types and is due to involvement of structures in the brain stem or cerebellum.The diagnosis of NPNS in patients with no known cancer is important because it may lead to the detection of an occult cancer which is localized or scarcely extended, and therefore is still potentially treatable. Oto-neuro-ophthalmological manifestations may be the first or only symptom of presentation of a paraneoplastic neurological clinical picture.",

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is a common neurodegenerative disease diagnosed by well established clinical motor symptoms. However, the disease also encompasses many nonmotor issues that can impact a myriad of processes such as cardiovascular status, gastrointestinal function, autonomic function, mood and sleep. These issues can be more debilitating and impactful on health status in part because of a lack of effective treatments. The pathophysiology of the disease process is under active investigation with postulated mechanisms involving both the central nervous system and the periphery. More in depth examination of the many nonmotor symptoms may aid in the discovery of the overarching pathological origin and progression of Parkinson’s disease. Examining the disease process from the perspective of nonmotor symptoms may also provide additional target pathways and potential drug development options not considered previously. Keywords: Anxiety, autonomic failure, cognitive disorders, depression, nonmotor symptoms, Parkinson’s disease, sleep.",

      "title": "Hetrogeneous pathologies associated with dementia in Parkinsonism share a prion-like spreading mechanism",
      "abstract": "Cognitive alterations accompany or follow motor disorders in subjects with Parkinsonism. The canonical phenotype of the Parkinson’s disease Dementia (PD-D) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) includes deficit of attention, executive and visuospatial functions, and presents often with apathy, hallucinations, delusions, excessive daytime sleepiness, or sleep disorders. However, the clinical expression may overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive disorders. Thus, while clinicians rely on phenomenological patterns to infer the disease causing the cognitive impairment, the inference is weakened by the heterogeneous clinical expression of the disease. In addition, recent post-mortem studies seem to undermine the supposed pathology-phenotype coherence, making it more and more unreliable the diagnosis based on symptoms. The lack of coherence between phenotype and pathology may support the speculation about a common mechanism underlying the progression of the disease. While it is very likely that a distinct, specific causal event determines the disease itself, the progression might well follow common patterns. A number of observations suggest that progressive diseases, which cause cognitive impairment, share a prion-like mechanism. A seeding process is supposed to account for the spreading of the lesion.",

Parkinsonisme umumnya bersifat idiopatik yang dikenal sebagai Penyakit Parkinson selain itu juga dapat disebabkan karena mekanisme lain seperti akibat proses infeksi, proses imunulogi, dan sindroma paraneoplastik, penggunaan obat tertentu, paparan toksin, proses vaskular, proses trauma, dan lain-lain. Proses ini yang dikenal sebagai parkinsonism sekunder. Beberapa penelitian epidemiologi memang telah membuktikan adanya keterkaitan ini tetapi terdapat beberapa penelitian lain yang justru menolak adanya keterkaitan antara trauma kepala dengan kejadian parkinsonism. Kriteria sebuah trauma kepala berpotensi menimbulkan parkinsonism menurut Crouzon harus memenuhi kriteria antara lain trauma cukup bermakna untuk menyebabkan terjadinya kerusakan pada jaringan otak, waktu proses trauma dengan mulai munculnya gejala parkinson harus jelas, progresivitas gejala neurologis yang nyata, dan derajat keparahan cedera kepala memenuhi kriteria commotio cerebri. Tinjauan pustaka ini bertujuan mengkaji literatur lebih dalam tentang aspek patofisiologi dari kondisi parkinsonism pasca trauma kepala.

      "title": "Obstetric antecedents of cerebral palsy",
      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy has been defined as a group of non-progressive disorders of movement or posture due to a defect or lesion of the immature brain. 1 Cerebral palsy is defined by clinical description only; there is no definitive test. It is not informative about aetiolgy, pathology or prognosis. The definition of cerebral palsy also lacks precision in that neither the age at which the brain is mature nor the severity of the disorder required are specified. Brain development is most rapid in utero and early childhood but continues at a diminished rate throughout life. There is therefore no biological rationale for choosing any particular age to define brain maturity. The defining age below whcih cerebral palsy may be recognised therefore varies between centres for pragmatic reasons usually associated with assertainment. For example, in Western Australia the criterion is set at 5 years, 2 since by this age any central motor impairments of congenital or neonatal origin will be apparent and can usually be differentiated from progressive disorders or isolated motor delay. Thus the definition includes a group of children with post-neonatally acquired brain damage resulting in movement disorder. Post-neonatally acquired cerebral palsy differs from presumed congenital or perinatal cerebral palsy in that there is usually no doubt that it was caused by a specific post-neonatal event such as meningitis or head trauma. Although there is an excess of perinatal morbidity amoung children acquiring cerebral palsy post-neonatally, 3 suggesting a prior vulnerability in some cases, post neonatally acquired cerebral palsy will not be considred further in this review.",

      "title": "Study of pathogenetic mechanisms of Parkinson's disease in neuronal cellular models",
      "abstract": "Η νόσος του Πάρκινσον (ΝΠ) είναι μια πολύπλοκη νευροεκφυλιστική διαταραχή που επηρεάζει το 2% του παγκόσμιου πληθυσμού άνω των 65 ετών. Η ΝΠ χαρακτηρίζεται από κινητικές διαταραχές που σχετίζονται με την προοδευτική απώλεια των ντοπαμινεργικών νευρώνων της συµπαγούς µοίρας της µέλαινας ουσίας, ενώ ένα ευρύ φάσμα μη κινητικών συμπτωμάτων είναι επίσης παρόντα, όπως ψυχιατρικές διαταραχές και νοητική δυσλειτουργία. Το νευροπαθολογικό χαρακτηριστικό της ΝΠ είναι η ανώμαλη εναποθέση πρωτεϊνών σε νευρικά κύτταρα και νευρίτες, που ονομάζονται αντιστοίχως σωμάτια και νευρίτες Lewy. Αυτά είναι πρωτεϊνικά συσσωματώματα που αποτελούνται κυρίως από την πρωτεΐνη α-συνουκλεΐνη, που είναι η κύρια πρωτεΐνη που συνδέεται με την σποραδική μορφή της νόσου. Η α-συνουκλεΐνη ανήκει στην κατηγορία αμυλοειδών πρωτεϊνών που σχηματίζουν ειδικές ολιγομερείς μορφές και συσσωματωμάτα με αποτέλεσμα να οδηγεί σε νευροτοξικότητα μέσω διαφόρων μοριακών οδών. Αρκετές σημειακές μεταλλάξεις (A30P, E46K, A53T, G51D) και διπλασιασμοί/τριπλασιασμοί του γονιδίου της α-συνουκλεΐνης ( SNCA) οδηγούν σε οικογενείς μορφές της νόσου. Μεταξύ των διαφόρων μεταλλάξεων, η μετάλλαξη Α53Τ παρουσιάζει μειωμένη διαλυτότητα, ύστερα από επώαση σε υδατικό διάλυμα, σε φυσιολογική θερμοκρασία και αυτό οδηγεί στην δημιουργία ινιδίων με αποτέλεσμα την εκτεταμένη συσσώρευση αδιάλυτων αποθέσεων στον ανθρώπινο εγκέφαλο.Παρά τις εκτεταμένες προσπάθειες για την κατανόηση της παθογένεσης της ΝΠ, δεν υπάρχουν φάρμακα για την θεραπεία της νόσου. Επί του παρόντος, διατίθενται μόνο συμπτωματικές ή ανακουφιστικές θεραπείες χωρίς καμία να είναι ικανή να αποτρέψει ή να επιβραδύνει την πρόοδο της νόσου. Η λεβοντόπα (σε συνδυασμό με καρβιντόπα/βενζεραζίδη) αποτελεί την πιο αποτελεσματική φαρμακευτική θεραπεία, η οποία εντοπίστηκε πριν από 55 χρόνια. Ωστόσο, η χρόνια χορήγηση της οδηγεί σε σοβαρές παρενέργειες. Ως εκ τούτου, η ανάπτυξη νέων φαρμάκων που να τροποποιούν την πορεία της νόσου είναι μια επείγουσα ανάγκη. Οι περισσότερες σύγχρονες προσπάθειες για τον εντοπισμό νέων θεραπειών στοχεύουν τη συσσώρευση της α-συνουκλεΐνης ως τον κύριο παθογόνο παράγοντα που προκαλεί κυτταρική τοξικότητα. Οι εναλλακτικές στρατηγικές για την αντιμετώπιση των πρώιμων σταδίων του νευροεκφυλισμού, ιδιαίτερα με αμερόληπτο τρόπο, έχουν προχωρήσει με σχετικά αργό ρυθμό. Οι πρόσφατες εξελίξεις στα μοντέλα της ασθένειας που βασίζονται στα επαγόμενα πολυδύναμα βλαστοκύτταρα (iPSCs) που προέρχονται από ασθενείς, επιτρέπουν τον εντοπισμό πρώιμων παθολογικών φαινοτύπων και παρέχουν συστήματα για την ανακάλυψη νέων φαρμάκων. Σε συνδυασμό με τεχνολογίες ελέγχου υψηλής απόδοσης, αυτές οι προσεγγίσεις ανοίγουν νέες προοπτικές για την ανακάλυψη εν δυνάμει θεραπευτικών μορίων.Οι κινάσες έχουν αναδειχθεί ως ένας από τους πιο εντατικά διερευνώμενους φαρμακευτικούς στόχους στην τρέχουσα φαρμακολογική έρευνα, λόγω του κομβικού τους ρόλου στη διαμόρφωση ενός ευρέος φάσματος κυτταρικών διεργασιών. Μεγάλη προσπάθεια έχει καταβληθεί για την ανάπτυξη μορίων που στοχεύουν ειδικά το ανθρώπινο κίνωμα (human kinome). Μέχρι σήμερα, η πλειονότητα των μορίων παρουσιάζει ένα φάσμα αναστολέων των κινασών, με &gt;250 να βρίσκονται σήμερα σε κλινικές δοκιμές και 48 να έχουν εγκριθεί από τον FDA των ΗΠΑ, κυρίως για τη θεραπεία κακοηθειών. Ενώ αρχικά η χρήση των αναστολέων κινασών επικεντρώθηκε στη θεραπεία του καρκίνου, πλέον συμπεριλαμβάνει ένα διευρυμένο φάσμα θεραπευτικών περιοχών, όπως οι αυτοάνοσες και φλεγμονώδεις νόσοι, καθώς και νευροεκφυλιστικές διαταραχές, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της ΝΠ.Καθώς το κύριο χαρακτηριστικό της ΝΠ είναι ο θάνατος των ντοπαμινεργικών νευρώνων της μέλανας ουσίας, στην παρούσα μελέτη εστιάζουμε στον εντοπισμό μορίων που ενισχύουν τη διαφοροποίηση και την επιβίωση αυτών των νευρώνων χρησιμοποιώντας ως πειραματικό μοντέλο τα επαγόμενα βλαστικά κύτταρα (iPS) από υγιή άτομα και από ασθενείς με ΝΠ που φέρουν την A53T μετάλλαξη στην α-συνουκλεΐνη (G209A στο γονίδιο SNCA).Χρησιμοποιήσαμε μια βιβλιοθήκη μικρών μορίων αναστολέων κινασών για να πραγματοποιήσουμε διαλογή υψηλού περιεχομένου προκειμένου να ανιχνεύσουμε μόρια που επάγουν τη διαφοροποίηση ή/και την επιβίωση των ντοπαμινεργικών νευρώνων και αναστρέφουν τη νευροεκφύλιση.Προηγούμενη μελέτη του εργαστηρίου οδήγησε στην δημιουργία ενός μοντέλου νευρώνων που προέρχονται από επαγόμενα πολυδύναμα βλαστοκύτταρα ασθενών με οικογενή ΝΠ που φέρουν τη μετάλλαξη A53T της α-συνουκλεΐνης. Στο μοντέλο αυτό οι νευρώνες εμφανίζουν φαινοτύπους σχετικούς με τη νόσο, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της συσσώρευσης πρωτεϊνών, της μειωμένης νευριτικής ανάπτυξης και των παραμορφωμένων ή κατακερματισμένων νευραξόνων που περιέχουν α-συνουκλεΐνη και tau. Στην παρούσα μελέτη, προσαρμόσαμε επιτυχώς αυτό το κυτταρικό σύστημα σε πλάκες 384 φρεατίων για να πραγματοποιήσουμε την πρώτη σάρωση μικρών μορίων σε ανθρώπινους νευρώνες με την μετάλλαξη A53T. Δεδομένου ότι πολλές κινάσες έχουν εμπλακεί στην παθολογία της ΝΠ, εξετάσαμε μια συλλογή 273 αναστολέων κινασών για να ανακαλύψουμε ενώσεις με εν δυνάμει νευροπροστατευτικές ιδιότητες.Ανακαλύψαμε ότι ο αναστολέας πολλαπλών κινασών BX795 αναστρέφει σημαντικά τους φαινότυπους που σχετίζονται με τη νόσο. Μια μεμονωμένη δόση με BX795 παρέχει νευροπροστασία στους A53T νευρώνες βελτιώνοντας τη νευριτική ανάπτυξη, περιορίζοντας τα επίπεδα της παθολογικής α-συνουκλεΐνης και περιορίζοντας τον σχηματισμό συσσωματωμάτων, διατηρώντας παράλληλα την αξονική ακεραιότητα. Η νευροπροστασία επιβεβαιώθηκε επίσης σε ανθρώπινους νευρώνες που προέρχονται από iPSC στους οποίους η μετάλλαξη εισήχθη με επεξεργασία γονιδιώματος. Για τον εντοπισμό των κυτταρικών μονοπατιών που επηρεάζονται από το BX795, χρησιμοποιήσαμε μια αμερόληπτη προσέγγιση που βασίζεται στη συγκριτική πρωτεϊνική. Η αρχική σύγκριση μεταξύ A53T και νευρώνων ελέγχου απουσία BX795, αποκάλυψε διαφορική έκφραση 640 πρωτεϊνών από τις οποίες μόνο 67 εμφάνισαν μείωση, ενώ οι υπόλοιπες 573 αύξηση. Αυτή η μεγάλη αύξηση στην έκφραση πρωτεϊνών συνδέθηκε κυρίως με τις βιολογικές διεργασίες του μεταβολισμού του RNA, τη σύνθεση πρωτεϊνών, την τροποποίηση και μεταφορά, την αποικοδόμηση των πρωτεϊνών και την απόκριση στο στρες. Είναι ενδιαφέρον, ότι τα επίπεδα 118 πρωτεϊνών που βρίσκονται κυρίως εντός αυτών των βιολογικών διεργασιών και αντιπροσωπεύουν περίπου το 20% των συνολικών απορυθμισμένων πρωτεϊνών στους A53T νευρώνες, αποκαταστάθηκαν κατά τη θεραπεία με BX795. Η παρούσα μελέτη αποτελεί την πρώτη, καθόσον γνωρίζουμε, σάρωση υψηλού περιεχομένου και πρωτεϊνικής ανάλυσης που πραγματοποιήθηκε σε ανθρώπινους νευρώνες που προέρχονται από iPSC με την μετάλλαξη A53T για τον εντοπισμό νέων θεραπευτικών ουσιών για την ΝΠ.Αυτή η μελέτη αποτελεί την πρώτη μελέτη υψηλού περιεχομένου για την ανακάλυψη φαρμάκων που πραγματοποιείται σε ανθρώπινους νευρώνες που προέρχονται από A53T iPSC για τον εντοπισμό υποψήφιων θεραπευτικών ουσιών για την ΝΠ. Παρόλο που οι πρώτοι iPSC που προήλθαν από ασθενείς με ΝΠ δημιουργήθηκαν το 2009, παραδόξως μόνο δύο φαινοτυπικές σαρώσεις έχουν αναφερθεί μέχρι σήμερα σε νευρώνες που προήλθαν από iPSC για την ΝΠ. Για τον εντοπισμό τροποποιητικών παραγόντων της νόσου, οι Yamaguchi et al. καθιέρωσαν μια βασισμένη στην απεικόνιση, ημιαυτόματη, υψηλής απόδοσης δοκιμασία για την ποσοτική ανίχνευση της μιτοχονδριακής κάθαρσης και της κυτταρικής βιωσιμότητας σε ντοπαμινεργικούς νευρώνες από ασθενείς με οικογενή ΝΠ που έχουν μεταλλάξεις Parkin ή PINK1. Μετά από έλεγχο 320 φαρμακολογικά δραστικών ενώσεων αναστολέων οι ερευνητές εντόπισαν 4 ουσίες, την MRS1220, την τρανυλκυπρομίνη, τη φλουναριζίνη και τη βρωμοκρυπτίνη, οι οποίες βελτίωσαν την παθολογική κάθαρση των μιτοχονδρίων πιθανώς προωθώντας τη μιτοχονδριακή αποικοδόμηση μέσω του λυσοσωματικού συστήματος, χωρίς να διερευνήσουν περαιτέρω τον υποκείμενο μηχανισμό. Σε μια άλλη μελέτη οι Tabata κ.ά. πραγματοποίησαν φαινοτυπική διαλογή σε ντοπαμινεργικούς νευρώνες που προέρχονται από ασθενείς με Parkin (PARK2) και εμφανίζουν αυξημένη ευαισθησία στο μιτοχονδριακό στρες που προκαλείται από τη ροτενόνη, για τον εντοπισμό νευροπροστατευτικών ενώσεων. Από τη φαινοτυπική διαλογή μιας εγκεκριμένης από τον FDA βιβλιοθήκης φαρμάκων, βρέθηκε ότι ένας ανταγωνιστής των διαύλων ασβεστίου, η βενιδιπίνη, καταστέλλει την απόπτωση που προκαλείται από τη ροτενόνη. Η μελέτη μας είναι η τρίτη φαινοτυπική διαλογή που πραγματοποιείται σε ανθρώπινους νευρώνες που προέρχονται από iPSC στον τομέα της ΝΠ και η μόνη που σχετίζεται με την A53T παθολογία.Τα μονοπάτια που επηρεάζονται από τη μεταλλαγμένη α-συνουκλεΐνη στη μελέτη μας έχουν μεγάλη ομοιότητα με το συνάπτωμα που αναφέρθηκε από τους Chung et al για νευρώνες ποντικών και τις προβλέψεις του in silico \"ανθρωποποιημένου\" χάρτη της πρωτεοτοξικότητας που αναφέρθηκε στη συνοδευτική μελέτη των Khurana et al.Αναλύοντας περαιτέρω τις οδούς που επηρεάζονται από το BX795, αποδείξαμε ότι το BX795 ρυθμίζει την οδό mTORC1 για τον περιορισμό της υπερβολικής πρωτεϊνοσύνθεσης και τη διευκόλυνση της αυτοφαγίας. Επιπλέον, τα αποτελέσματά μας δείχνουν ότι η αποκατάσταση της πρωτεόστασης που ακολουθεί την σηματοδότηση mTOR μπορεί να έχει μακροπρόθεσμες ευεργετικές συνέπειες στην κυτταρική υγεία, υποκινώντας μόνιμες βασικές αλλαγές.Η κινάση mTOR είναι ένας κύριος ρυθμιστής του κυτταρικού μεταβολισμού που λειτουργεί σε δύο διακριτά σύμπλοκα: mTORC1 και mTORC2 με το πρώτο να εμπλέκεται στη βιοσύνθεση πρωτεϊνών και λιπιδίων μέσω ενός καταρράκτη σηματοδότησης που περιλαμβάνει τις πρωτεΐνες SK6 και 4E-BP1 . Σε αντίθεση με τα πολλαπλασιαζόμενα κύτταρα όπου το μονοπάτι αυτό χρησιμοποιείται για την ανάπτυξη και τη διαίρεση, στους νευρώνες δρα ως ρυθμιστής του υγιούς μεταβολισμού και της γήρανσης με τον περιορισμό του να σχετίζεται με την παράταση της διάρκειας ζωής και την καθυστέρηση των παθολογιών που σχετίζονται με την ηλικία. Οι A53T νευρώνες έχουν αυξημένες RPS6, IQGAP1 και RAG-GTPases, συστατικά του μονοπατιού mTORC1 και αυτό φαίνεται να σχετίζεται με αυξημένη μετάφραση ενός υποσυνόλου mRNAs που σχετίζονται με τον μεταβολισμό του RNA και την απόκριση στο στρες. Ομοίως, μια μελέτη ποσοτικής πρωτεομικής σε ένα προ-συμπτωματικό μοντέλο A53T Drosophila δείχνει σημαντική ρύθμιση των ριβοσωμικών πρωτεϊνών στις A53T μύγες. Παρόλο που η μηχανιστική σύνδεση μεταξύ της A53T α-συνουκλεΐνης και του mTORC1 δεν έχει ακόμη τεκμηριωθεί, πρόσφατα στοιχεία δείχνουν ότι η γενετική ποικιλομορφία στο μονοπάτι mTOR συμβάλλει στις επιδράσεις του γονιδίου SNCA στην παθογένεια της νόσου.Ταυτόχρονα με την προώθηση της πρωτεϊνοσύνθεσης ο mTORC1 δρα για την καταστολή της αυτοφαγίας μέσω της φωσφορυλίωσης του ULK1. Η αυτοφαγία έχει κεντρικό ρόλο στην προαγωγή της υγείας και της μακροζωίας, ενώ η διαδικασία αυτή διαταράσσεται στις νευροεκφυλιστικές νόσους και στην παθολογία αSyn. Το A53T-πρωτέωμα δείχνει ότι οι νευρώνες βρίσκονται υπό στρες, καθώς οι πρωτεΐνες που εμπλέκονται στην UPR ή στην απόκριση στρες λόγω θερμικού σοκ, στη συναρμολόγηση και ρύθμιση του πρωτεασώματος, που είναι γνωστό ότι ενορχηστρώνεται από το mTORC1 στους νευρώνες, είναι σημαντικά ρυθμισμένες. Η αποκατάσταση πολυάριθμων συστατικών του μεταβολισμού του RNA και των καταρρακτών πρωτεϊνικής μετάφρασης από το BX795 σχετίζεται άμεσα με τη μειωμένη απόκριση στο στρες που προκύπτει από τα χαμηλότερα επίπεδα των πρωτεϊνών που σχετίζονται με την UPR και το θερμικό σοκ που επίσης προσδίδονται από αυτό το μόριο. Παράλληλα, ένας σημαντικός αριθμός πρωτεϊνών που σχετίζονται με την ουβικουιτίνη/πρωτεάσωμα επανήλθε σε επίπεδα σχεδόν ελέγχου. Λαμβάνοντας υπόψη ότι τόσο το σύστημα ουβικουιτίνης/πρωτεασώματος όσο και η αυτοφαγία μοιράζονται πολλαπλούς μοριακούς καθοριστικούς παράγοντες, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των ULK1, ATG5, ATG8 και p62, οι οποίοι μπορούν να επηρεαστούν ταυτόχρονα και αμοιβαία στις νευροεκφυλιστικές νόσους, καθίσταται προφανές ότι το BX795 βοηθά στην εκκαθάριση των κακώς διπλωμένων πρωτεϊνών περιορίζοντας την πρωτεϊνοσύνθεση. Αυτό συμφωνεί με την αποδεδειγμένη ικανότητά του να μειώνει τα συσσωματώματα πρωτεϊνών σε p.A53T-νευρώνες, όπως φάνηκε στην παρούσα μελέτη, μαζί με τη διευκόλυνση της αυτοφαγίας τόσο σε κύτταρα SYSH-5Y που εκφράζουν την A53T α-συνουκλεΐνη όσο και σε νευρώνες που προέρχονται από ασθενείς.Το BX795 είναι ένας αναστολέας πολλαπλών κινασών που στοχεύει πολυάριθμες οδούς, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των κινασών TBK1 και PDK1. Παρόλο που στο σύστημά μας δεν παρατηρήθηκαν διαφορές στα συνολικά ή φωσφορυλιωμένα επίπεδα αυτών των δύο κινασών παρουσία του BX795 (τα δεδομένα δεν παρουσιάζονται), δεν μπορούμε να αποκλείσουμε ότι οι επιδράσεις του διαμεσολαβούνται μέσω αυτών των δύο κινασών, καθώς και οι δύο εμπλέκονται στη νευροεκφύλιση, τη σηματοδότηση mTOR και την αυτοφαγία. Ωστόσο, τέσσερις άλλοι αναστολείς της PDK1 που περιλαμβάνονταν στη βιβλιοθήκη Selleck δεν αναδείχθηκαν κατά τη διάρκεια της διαλογής. Η TBK1 προτάθηκε πρόσφατα ως ένας νέος παράγοντας που συνδέει την αυτοφαγία και τη νευροφλεγμονή στην ALS και έχει αποδειχθεί ότι ενεργοποιεί άμεσα το mTOR σε απόκριση σε αυξητικούς παράγοντες. Είναι ενδιαφέρον ότι διαπιστώσαμε ότι το BX795 μπορούσε να αναστείλει την καθαρισμένη ανασυνδυασμένη p70 S6K, τη σημαντικότερη κινάση που φωσφορυλιώνει την RPS6 in vivo, υποδεικνύοντας ότι η οξεία επίδραση της ένωσης στην RPS6 σε κύτταρα που εκφράζουν p.A53T θα μπορούσε να μεσολαβείται μέσω της αναστολής της p70 S6K. Είναι αξιοσημείωτο ότι πολλαπλοί άλλοι αναστολείς της φωσφορυλίωσης του mTOR που υπάρχουν στη βιβλιοθήκη αναστολέων κινάσης που εξετάστηκε (26 συνολικά, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της ραπαμυκίνης), απέτυχαν να επιδείξουν προστατευτικές επιδράσεις στο σύστημά μας. Λαμβάνοντας υπόψη ότι το BX795 έχει προταθεί να δρα μέσω διαφορετικών μηχανισμών σε διαφορετικές παθολογίες, μελλοντικές μηχανιστικές μελέτες θα πρέπει να αποκαλύψουν τους άμεσους στόχους του στους A53T νευρώνες. Το κατά πόσον αυτοί βρίσκονται εντός ή εκτός του κινώματος είναι ένα θέμα προς διερεύνηση, καθώς τα αναδυόμενα στοιχεία υποδεικνύουν ότι οι αναστολείς κινάσης μπορεί ακούσια να ασκούν τη θεραπευτική τους δράση μέσω μη κινάσης στόχων. Συλλογικά, η εργασία που παρουσιάζεται εδώ προσδιορίζει το BX795 ως μια πολλά υποσχόμενη ένωση με θεραπευτικό δυναμικό για ασθενείς με ΝΠ και άλλες διαταραχές διαμόρφωσης πρωτεϊνών. Περαιτέρω, η πειραματική μας προσέγγιση έριξε φως στα μοριακά και κυτταρικά μονοπάτια της πρωτεοτοξικότητας αποκαλύπτοντας νέους στόχους νόσου για την ανάπτυξη συνδυασμένων θεραπευτικών ουσιών.Οι πραγματικές μεταφραστικές δυνατότητες των πλατφορμών iPSC που προέρχονται από ασθενείς μόλις αναδύονται, καθώς πραγματοποιούνται περισσότερες αμερόληπτες σαρώσεις φαρμάκων μεγάλης κλίμακας. Οι εργασίες που πραγματοποιήθηκαν στο πλαίσιο της παρούσας διατριβής καταδεικνύουν ότι οι ανθρώπινοι νευρώνες με φαινοτυπικά χαρακτηριστικά που σχετίζονται με ασθένειες μπορούν να προσαρμοστούν αποτελεσματικά για χρήση σε σαρώσεις φαρμάκων υψηλής απόδοσης. Οι τρέχουσες εξελίξεις στον τομέα της τεχνολογίας iPSC, συμπεριλαμβανομένων βελτιωμένων πρωτοκόλλων για τη διαφοροποίηση των νευρώνων, της ανάπτυξης συστημάτων συν-καλλιέργειας και τρισδιάστατων (3D) συστημάτων ή της χρήσης μικρορρευστονικής ή τσιπ συσκευών brain-on-chip, θα μπορούσαν να συνδυαστούν με το τρέχον κυτταρικό σύστημα που περιγράφεται εδώ, ώστε να αυξηθεί η αξία του σε προσεγγίσεις διαλογής υψηλής απόδοσης. Μια σημαντική προσθήκη στον έλεγχο βιβλιοθηκών ενώσεων θα ήταν να συμπεριληφθούν ενδείξεις ανάγνωσης της λειτουργικότητας των νευρώνων, όπως για παράδειγμα η αξιολόγηση ηλεκτροφυσιολογικών παραμέτρων με συστήματα συστοιχιών πολλαπλών ηλεκτροδίων υψηλής απόδοσης. Σε συνδυασμό με βιβλιοθήκες siRNA σε όλο το γονιδίωμα, μηχανική μάθηση και καλύτερα εργαλεία πρόβλεψης in silico, τέτοιες πλατφόρμες μπορούν να αξιοποιηθούν περαιτέρω για την επιλογή νέων, αποτελεσματικότερων και ασφαλέστερων φαρμάκων που θα εισέλθουν με εμπιστοσύνη στις κλινικές δοκιμές.Είναι σημαντικό ότι η μελέτη μας υποστηρίζει ότι οι πλατφόρμες που βασίζονται σε ανθρώπινα iPSC και χρησιμοποιούνται στην πρώιμη ανακάλυψη φαρμάκων μπορούν επίσης να συμβάλουν στην αποκάλυψη μηχανισμών ασθενειών. Θα μπορούσαμε έτσι να εντοπίσουμε ένα νευροπροστατευτικό μόριο που διασώζει βασικές μεταβολικές οδούς, απαραίτητες για τη νευρωνική λειτουργία. Περαιτέρω μελέτες in vitro και in vivo σε μοντέλα ΝΠ, θα πρέπει να παράσχουν πρόσθετη εικόνα του μηχανισμού δράσης και της αποτελεσματικότητας του BX795 για να αποκαλύψουν πλήρως το μεταφραστικό δυναμικό του ως κορυφαίο θεραπευτικό φάρμακο για την ΝΠ.Συμπερασματικά, πολλές σειρές hiPSC έχουν παραχθεί από ασθενείς με οικογενή ή σποραδική ΝΠ αποκαλύπτοντας γνωστούς ή προηγουμένως μη αναγνωρισμένους φαινότυπους σχετικούς με τη νόσο, οι οποίοι, σε πολλές περιπτώσεις, θα μπορούσαν να αποκατασταθούν αποτελεσματικά με τη χρήση μικρών μορίων. Αυτές οι έρευνες έχουν θέσει το υπόβαθρο για την ανάπτυξη βιοδοκιμών για τον έλεγχο μικρών ή μεγαλύτερων χημικών βιβλιοθηκών σε αναζήτηση κύριων ενώσεων που μπορεί να εξελιχθούν σε θεραπευτικά προϊόντα που τροποποιούν τη ΝΠ. Ωστόσο, πρέπει ακόμη να καθιερωθούν ισχυρές δοκιμασίες προτού τα συστήματα που βασίζονται σε iPSC γίνουν πιο εύκολα προσιτά σε τεχνολογίες υψηλής απόδοσης. Εν τω μεταξύ, αναπτύσσονται πιο προηγμένα συστήματα συν-καλλιέργειας που περιλαμβάνουν νευρώνες και γλοιακά κύτταρα ή τρισδιάστατα εγκεφαλικά οργανοειδή που μιμούνται περισσότερο την in vivo ανθρώπινη κατάσταση, για να βοηθήσουν στις μελέτες της ΝΠ και στην ανακάλυψη φαρμάκων. Σημαντική είναι επίσης η ανάγκη για λειτουργικές δοκιμασίες για την πρόβλεψη της αποτελεσματικότητας των φαρμάκων, ενώ οι τεχνολογικές εξελίξεις καθιστούν πιο εφικτές τις πολύπλοκες σαρώσεις μορίων. Τέλος, η εμφάνιση της τεχνητής νοημοσύνης τα τελευταία χρόνια μπορεί να αποδειχθεί μια τεχνολογία που θα αλλάξει τα δεδομένα στην ανακάλυψη φαρμάκων. Παρ' όλα αυτά, οι ευκαιρίες και οι προκλήσεις παραμένουν ακόμη μπροστά μας προτού αυτές οι νέες τεχνολογίες καρποφορήσουν για την κατανόηση και τη θεραπεία του νευροεκφυλισμού στη ΝΠ.",

      "title": "Action myoclonus, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and other cerebellar myoclonic syndromes.",
      "abstract": "Action myoclonus, reviewed in this chapter, is the term applied to arrhythmic muscular jerking induced by voluntary movement. It is made worse by attempts at precise or coordinated movement (intention myoclonus) and may also be provoked by certain sensory stimuli. The effective stimuli for action myoclonus is probably feedback from muscle afferents, although it may be initiated by corollary discharge from motor cortex to reticular formation before or at the onset of voluntary movement. The condition is usually associated with diffuse neuronal disease such as post-hypoxic encephalopathy, uremia, and the various forms of PME, although action myoclonus may be limited to one limb in some cases of focal cerebral damage. It is caused by hyperexcitability of the sensorimotor cortex (cortical reflex myoclonus) or reticular formation (reticular reflex myoclonus), or both. No consistent pathological change has been reported in autopsied cases of action myoclonus. The underlying disorder appears to be a loss of inhibitory mechanisms involving serotonin and possibly GABA as transmitter agents. The term PME is used for the association of myoclonus with degenerative changes in the nervous system which are commonly diffuse but may predominate in certain systems. There may or may not be associated tonic-clonic seizures, other manifestations of epilepsy, or dementia. Those cases of PME associated with Lafora inclusion bodies and cerebral storage diseases can be distinguished from the system degenerations. Systems which may be involved in the latter group include cerebellodentatorubral, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, optic, auditory, posterior columns and gracile and cuneate nuclei, spinocerebellar pathways, motor neurons of cranial nerves and anterior horns, and muscle fibers. Confronted with this diversity of pathological change, it seems unnecessary to make any clinical distinction between Ramsay Hunt syndrome and Unverricht-Lundborg syndrome (Baltic myoclonus) because cerebellar signs are found in patients described under both headings. Additional systems may be involved in individuals or families who are otherwise typical. All three names could well be joined in an eponymous title (Unverricht-Lundborg-Hunt disease) or the condition simply known as the systems degeneration type of PME, as Halliday (43) suggested. The cause of the condition (or spectrum of conditions) is at present unknown. Action myoclonus usually responds to sodium valproate or clonazepam, and some individuals, particularly those with posthypoxic myoclonus, improve with the administration of serotonin precursors.",

      "title": "When Does Parkinson Disease Start?",
      "abstract": "There is convincing evidence that the Parkinson disease neurodegenerative process begins many years before the onset of motor manifestations. Initial estimates based on nigral neuropathological findings or striatal dopamine imaging suggested a 5- to 6-year preclinical period. However, more recent evidence of Lewy body pathology in other neuronal populations preceding nigral involvement suggests that the preclinical phase may be much longer. Epidemiologic studies of nonmotor manifestations, such as constipation, anxiety disorders, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and anemia, suggest that the preclinical period extends at least 20 years before the motor manifestations. Olfactory impairment and depression may also precede the onset of motor manifestations; however, the lag time may be shorter. Recognition of a nonmotor preclinical phase spanning 20 or more years should guide the search for predictive biomarkers and the identification of risk or protective factors for Parkinson disease.",

      "title": "Alteraciones cognitivas y lingüísticas en la enfermedad de Parkison",
      "abstract": "La Enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es una enfermedad neurodegenerativa caracterizada principalmente por sintomas motores (rigidez, bradicinesia, temblor en reposo) que aparece por una perdida de dopamina en el circuito que conecta los ganglios basales con la corteza cerebral y por la aparicion de depositos de Lewy en diferentes regiones cerebrales. Aunque el origen de la EP es parcialmente desconocido, han sido descubiertos algunos genes que estan involucrados en su aparicion, pero que explican solamente un pequeno porcentaje de los casos. En las ultimas decadas, el interes por los sintomas no motores (SNM) de la enfermedad ha ido creciendo progresivamente. El deterioro cognitivo leve (DCL) es uno de estos sintomas que puede aparecer incluso desde los inicios de la enfermedad y en algunos casos, evolucionar hasta la demencia. El perfil cognitivo de estos pacientes suele caracterizarse por dificultades ejecutivas, aunque tambien es frecuente encontrar deficits de memoria, de habilidades visuoespaciales, de procesamiento emocional y del lenguaje.En el caso del lenguaje, las alteraciones pueden afectar tanto al procesamiento de mas alto nivel como la pragmatica o la comprension de oraciones, hasta el procesamiento lexico-semantico. Sin embargo, aun hay controversia acerca del origen de estos deficits. Diferentes estudios han tratado de conocer si el deficit es puramente linguistico o si por el contrario es secundario a las alteraciones cognitivas presentes en los pacientes, o incluso si existe relacion con el trastorno motor y/o los niveles de dopamina cerebral.El objetivo principal de esta Tesis es conocer el perfil cognitivo de un grupo de pacientes con EP sin demencia asi como las alteraciones linguisticas que pueden presentar, principalmente de los verbos.La hipotesis de partida es que los pacientes con EP muestran deficits cognitivos y en el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales en ausencia de demencia objetivados con pruebas neuropsicologicas. En cuanto a los trastornos del lenguaje, la hipotesis principal de este trabajo es que los pacientes con EP sin demencia presentan deficits linguisticos en el procesamiento de los verbos que aumentan con la retirada de la medicacion dopaminergica. Para poner a prueba estas hipotesis, llevamos a cabo 5 estudios distintos. En el primer trabajo participaron 50 pacientes con EP y 42 controles sanos. En el segundo, 40 pacientes con EP y 19 controles, en ambos, los pacientes fueron evaluados con una extensa bateria neuropsicologica y en el segundo se incluyeron mas tareas linguisticas y una de reconocimiento de expresiones faciales. En el tercer estudio, una muestra de 49 pacientes con EP y 19 controles realizaron una tarea de denominacion de acciones en la que se controlo el contenido motor de los dibujos que tenian que denominar. En los experimentos cuatro y cinco, 20 pacientes fueron evaluados con la misma tarea de denominacion de acciones (estudio cuatro) y con cuatro tareas de fluidez verbal (estudio cinco), mientras estaban con y sin los efectos de la medicacion dopaminergica.Los resultados encontrados han sido publicados en cinco articulos y pueden resumirse de la siguiente manera:En el primer articulo (Rodriguez-Ferreiro, Cuetos, Herrera, Menendez & Ribacoba, 2010) se encontro que la muestra con EP sin demencia presentaba dificultades en tareas que evaluaban funciones ejecutivas, atencion, orientacion temporal, memoria inmediata, fluidez semantica, denominacion de personajes famosos y denominacion de acciones. En el segundo articulo (Herrera, Cuetos & Rodriguez-Ferreiro, 2011), encontramos diferencias significativas en la fluidez semantica, la fluidez de acciones, la denominacion de acciones, la denominacion de personajes famosos, la atencion y el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales. Los analisis de regresion mostraron que la tarea de reconocimiento de expresiones era la que mejor diferenciaba entre el grupo de EP y el grupo control. Ademas la distribucion de este deficit era similar tanto para los pacientes con DCL como para los pacientes con funciones cognitivas normales. Centrandonos en las alteraciones del lenguaje, en el tercer articulo (Herrera, Rodriguez-Ferreiro & Cuetos, 2012) se observo que los pacientes cometen mas errores a la hora de denominar dibujos que tienen un alto contenido motor en comparacion con aquellos de bajo contenido motor, mientras que los controles tenian un rendimiento similar en ambas categorias. Los resultados del cuarto articulo con pacientes con y sin medicacion (Herrera & Cuetos, 2012), mostraron que mientras en los pacientes con medicacion, los tiempos de reaccion (TR) eran similares para ambos tipos de dibujos, en los EP off, los TR eran significativamente mas lentos para los dibujos con un alto contenido motor. Por ultimo, los resultados obtenidos en el quinto estudio (Herrera, Cuetos & Ribacoba, 2012) muestran que los pacientes off medicacion generan significativamente menos palabras en las tareas que dependen de las zonas frontales (fluidez fonologica y de acciones). Y lo mas interesante es que en el caso de la fluidez de acciones, los pacientes off medicacion generaron verbos significativamente mas frecuentes que en on o que los generados por el grupo control.Los resultados sugieren que es posible encontrar deficits cognitivos en pacientes con EP sin demencia o quejas subjetivas de deterioro en los estadios iniciales de la enfermedad. Ademas estas dificultades no solo se relacionan con las tareas ejecutivas, sino que tambien aparecen problemas semanticos. Aparte de los deficits cognitivos, es posible encontrar problemas relacionados con el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales, independientes a la presencia de DCL.En cuanto a los trastornos linguisticos, los EP muestran un deficit especifico en el procesamiento de los verbos evaluado tanto con tareas de denominacion de acciones como de fluidez verbal. En el caso de la denominacion de acciones, el deficit parece tener un origen semantico, pues las dificultades aumentan al denominar acciones con mayor contenido motor que es mas acusado en los pacientes en los que el trastorno motor es mas severo (cuando estan sin medicacion). Estos datos sugieren que las mismas areas encargadas de planificar y ejecutar los movimientos estan implicadas, al menos en parte, en el procesamiento de los verbos de accion. Ademas la dopamina tambien parece jugar un papel importante en la activacion del sistema lexico-semantico de los verbos, pues cuando los pacientes se encuentran sin los efectos de la medicacion, solo pueden acceder a aquellos verbos que tienen mayor frecuencia lexica y por tanto estan mas accesibles.En definitiva, los resultados presentados muestran que los pacientes con EP sin demencia, presentan deficits cognitivos, de reconocimiento de expresiones faciales y dificultades relacionadas con el procesamiento de los verbos.",

      "abstract": "Movement disorders consist of a diverse and heterogeneous group of neurological impairments, frequently accompanied by abnormalities in ocular motility and visual perception. Parkinson’s disease is one of the more common and is caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain with loss of dopamine terminals in the basal ganglia. It is regarded primarily as a disorder of the motor system with bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor as its main features. However, autonomic, cognitive, and sensory symptoms frequently occur as well.\n\nVisual disturbance is not considered to be one of the cardinal clinical symptoms of Parkinson’s disease even though blurred vision, photophobia, asthenopia (weakness or fatigue of the eyes, usually accompanied by headache and dimming of vision), or trouble reading are common, often significantly interfering with the patient’s quality of life.1,2 Visual problems have particular significance because of the Parkinson patient’s impaired mobility and the implications for driving safety. In most cases, however, gross eye examination appears normal. Nonetheless, several papers have been published describing ophthalmological abnormalities, including problems with visual function, ocular movements, and visual hallucinations, as well as complications of drug therapy or neurosurgical interventions. We will review these in this article.\n\nThe most common ocular complaints are the result of ocular surface irritation, including blepharitis and xerophthalmia (dry eyes). Blepharitis is often responsible for ocular pain;3 dry eyes can cause itching, burning, irritation, and blurred vision that may improve with blinking. Unfortunately, spontaneous blinking is impaired, leading to discomfort, particularly after periods of reading, watching TV, or computer use. Blepharitis can cause excessive tearing, but most studies show decreased lacrimal flow in Parkinson patients, reflecting autonomic dysfunction.2,4\n\nThe decreased blink rate, a classical manifestation of Parkinson’s disease,5 is likely to worsen any discomfort from dry eyes, …",

      "abstract": "Parkinson hastalığı (PH) sonuçları itibarı ile birçok insanın yaşam standardını düşüren, ölümle sonuçlanabilen, ekonomik olarak tedavisi maliyetli ve yaşlı nufus arttıkça görülme sıklığı artan bir sinir sistemi hastalığıdır. Beynin substantia nigra pars kompakta bölgesinde dopamin üreten ve hareketlerin kontrolünden sorumlu olan motor nöronların zaman içerisinde ölmesi sonucu ortaya çıkar. PH teşhisinde kullanılan klasik semtomlar arasında titreme, kaslarda sertlik, hareketlerde yavaşlama ve postural bozukluklar sayılabilir. Tüm bu belirtiler ortaya çıksa bile, iyi bir nörolog dahi hastalık teşhisini yüzde yüz doğrulukta ortaya koyamayabilir çünkü PH çoklu sistem atrofisi ve Lewy cisimli demans gibi diğer bazı nörolojik hastalıklarla karıştılmaktadır. Bunlara ilaveten, hastalığın belirtileri ortaya çıkmadan erken teşhisi şu an için mümkün olmayıp, varlığı motor nöronların %70'den fazlası kaybedildikten ve fiziksel belirtiler ortaya çıktıktan sonra anlaşılmaktadır. Bu nedenle fiziksel belirtiler ortaya çıkmadan, PH'nın erken teşhisinde kullanılabilecek bir biyobelirteç veya biyobelirteç grubunun bulunması oldukça önemlidir. Proteomiks yaklaşımlar biyobelirteç keşfi amaçlı yapılan çalışmalarda sıklıkla kullanılırlar. Proteomiks kısaca hücre veya biyolojik sıvılardaki proteinlerin varlıklarının gösterilmesi, ortam veya biyolojik şartlara bağlı olarak organizmada oluşan değişikliklerin protein seviyesinde incelenmesi diye tarif edilebilir. Genom araştırmaları sonrası çağı olarak da görülen bu alan, hücrede asıl görev yapıcı moleküller olan proteinlerin tanımlanmasından fonksiyonlarına kadar çok geniş bir yelpazede araştırma yapma olanağı sağlamaktadır. Bu makalemizde Parkinson hastalığının teşhisinde kullanılabilecek biyobelirteçlerin keşfi amaçlı yapılan proteomiks çalışmalarını gözden geçirerek, önemli noktaları vurgulamaya çalıştık. Henüz belirlenmiş bir biyobelirteç olmamasına rağmen, aday biyobelirteçlerin bulunması yakın gelecek adına ümit vermektedir.",

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in movement, motivation, memory, and other functions; its level is decreased in the PD brain due to dopaminergic cell death. Lack of this vital substrate in the parkinsonian brain is a motor impairment abnormality and possibly a reason for the cognitive deficit seen in parkinsonian patients. Biomarkers are measurable and reproducible parameters that make it possible to identify physiological and pathological processes. They must be specific, easy to obtain, and reproducible. Some are capable of diagnosing Parkinson's disease whose symptoms have not yet been described.

      "abstract": "Gedächtnisstörungen können verschiedene Ursachen haben und werden häufig bei Patienten mit Hirnschädigungen festgestellt. Dabei können sowohl Läsionen in sehr spezifischen Strukturen des Gehirns als auch weitflächige Schäden für Gedächtnisdefizite verantwortlich sein. Auch bei Patienten mit psychischen Traumata oder anhaltendem massiven Stress können Gedächtniseinbußen auftreten, ohne dass sich hierfür ein strukturelles Korrelat finden lässt. So können auch funktionelle Änderungen des Gehirns, beispielsweise ein reduzierter Glukosemetabolismus, mit Gedächtnisstörungen einhergehen. In diesem Beitrag werden nach einer kurzen Einführung in gängige Gedächtnisklassifikationen mögliche amnestische Symptome bei verschiedenen hirngeschädigten oder traumatisierten Patienten beschrieben.",

These diseases usually present with a slow onset and a chronic progression. Various regions of the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves may be affected, leading to functional impairment and neuron loss. Neurodegenerative diseases are often categorized by symptoms that may include impairment in cognition, movement, strength, coordination, sensation, or autonomic control. However, the diagnosis of a specific neurodegenerative disease may be misleading, as there is both clinical and neuropathologic overlap among diseases and existing diagnostic tools are not always accurate. For most neurodegenerative diseases, neuronal dysfunction, such as synaptic loss, may occur long before neuronal death takes place (Soto, 2003;Shastry, 2003;Aguzzi and O'Connor, 2010).",

Viele PK-Patienten leiden schon vor dem Zeitpunkt der neurologischen Diagnosestellung unter nichtmotorischen Symptomen. Diese Prodromalphase kann unterschiedlich lang sein. Nach bisherigen Studien erreicht als prodromale Marker die höchste Sensitivität die Hyposmie gefolgt von autonomer Dysfunk­tion (Obstipation), eine hohe Spezifität wird durch die REM-Schlaf-Verhaltensstörung erreicht. Mit dieser Ausnahme sind die Spezifitäten aller bisherigen klinischen prodromalen Marker gering. Sogenannte Biomarker, die das Auftreten der motorischer PK-Symptome voraussagen, sind in der klinischen Routine bisher nicht etabliert. Neue Marker oder die Kombination von verschiedenen Markern könnten möglicherweise eine bessere prognostische Aussage ermöglichen, und insbesondere bei der Identifizierung von geeigneten Patienten für krankheitsmodifizierende Therapiestudien hilfreich sein.",

Acute Painful Neuropathies are transient neuropathic syndromes characterized by an acute onset of pain in the lower limbs. There are two distinct syndromes, the first of which occurs within the context of poor glycaemic control, and the second with rapid improvements in metabolic control. Asymmetrical or focal neuropathies are well recognized complications of diabetes. They have a relatively rapid onset, and complete recovery is usual. The syndrome of progressive asymmetrical proximal leg weakness and atrophy was first known as 'diabetic amyotrophy'. There is mounting evidence of central nervous system involvement in diabetic neuropathy challenging the tradition view that it is a disease of the peripheral nervous system. There is now little doubt that chronic hyperglycaemia is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy.",

Evidence of cerebral dysfunction may show up in one or more areas, such as sensory or motor function, intellectual functioning, emotional control, manifestation of seizure phenomena, and others.

Myopathies are rare in all age ranges. They may be inherited or acquired. Onset of inherited myopathies in the elderly, not surprisingly, is uncommon, but some of these diseases are asymptomatic or cause such minor symptoms that their significance is not appreciated by the patient, and thus they may not be recognized until late on in life.

Although there is growing evidence that neuropsychiatric symptoms may precede the prodromal stages of dementia, these manifestations have received less attention than traditional clinical hallmarks such as cognitive and functional deterioration. Depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, agitation, sleep disorders, among other symptoms, have been hypothesized to represent a prodromal stage of dementia or, at least, they increase the risk for conversion from minor neurocognitive disorder to major neurocognitive disorder. Longitudinal investigations have provided increased evidence of progression to dementia in individuals with minor neurocognitive disorder when neuropsychiatric symptoms also were present.Although neuropsychiatric symptoms are strongly associated with a higher risk of cognitive and functional deterioration, frequently the clinician does not acknowledge these conditions as increasing the risk of dementia. When the clinician accurately diagnoses neuropsychiatric symptoms in the prodromal stage of dementia, he could early establish appropriate treatment and, may be, delay the beginning of clinical and functional deterioration.",

However, the clinical expression may overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases associatedwith cognitive disorders. Thus, while clinicians rely on phenomenological patterns to infer the disease causing thecognitive impairment, the inference is weakened by the heterogeneous clinical expression of the disease. In addition,recent post-mortem studies seem to undermine the supposed pathology-phenotype coherence, making it moreand more unreliable the diagnosis based on symptoms. The lack of coherence between phenotype and pathologymay support the speculation about a common mechanism underlying the progression of the disease. While it is verylikely that a distinct, specific causal event determines the disease itself, the progression might well follow commonpatterns. A number of observations suggest that progressive diseases, which cause cognitive impairment, share aprion-like mechanism. A seeding process is supposed to account for the spreading of the lesion.",

These hormones primarily regulate the transcription of specific target genes. They increase the cortical serotonergic neurotransmission, and play an important role in regulating central noradrenergic and GABA function. Thyroid deficiency during the perinatal period results in mental retardation. Hypothyroidism of the adults causes most frequently dementia and depression. Other less common clinical pictures include myxoedema coma, dysfunction of cerebellum and cranial nerves. Hypothyroidism also increases predisposition of stroke.

      "abstract": "There are a number of diseases of the central nervous system in which even typical clinical manifestations, such as hemiplegia or paraplegia, cannot adequately be interpreted by the established etiologic factors—infection, trauma, neoplasms or vascular disturbances. Intoxication, popularly accepted as an etiologic agent in some disturbances of peripheral nerves, is, with the exception of that due to lead, seldom considered at the bedside as the cause of a disease of the brain or the spinal cord. Yet toxic factors, intoxications, undoubtedly cause acute or subacute nervous disorders, which always exhibit definite histopathologic features but only occasionally possess a suggestive clinical picture. For this reason many disorders of the central nervous system remain undiagnosed and consequently improperly treated. The histopathologic features in cases of such disturbances are typical of what has been described<sup>1</sup>as multiple degenerative softening, which is a combination of parenchymatous and inflammatory changes; their clinical features may",

It occurs most often as a paraneoplastic syndrome when a cancer remote to the brain induces cerebellar dysfunction that is unrelated to metastases. Half of all cases occur in children with a neuroblastoma. Most adults with opsoclonus myoclonus have neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, or idiopathic etiologies. Signs of cerebellar dysfunction noted at presentation include opsoclonus, myoclonus and ataxia, hence the name \"dancing eyes, dancing feet syndrome.\" Opsoclonus is characterized by rapid, involuntary eye movements that are dysrhythmic and uncoordinated.Neuronal damage is induced by antibodies usually related to the primary pathology. Treatment targets the etiology and also employs steroids, plasmapheresis, immunosuppressive agents, or other anti-inflammatory therapies. Children with opsoclonus myoclonus resulting from a neuroblastoma often retain neurological sequelae. Adult cases of opsoclonus myoclonus with idiopathic or infectious etiologies have a more favorable prognosis than those with neoplastic origins.",

      "abstract": "The neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a group of genetically inherited lysosomal neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the intracellular accumulation of autofluorescent lipopigment storage material that causes progressive neurologic degeneration in all age groups. They belong to the group of lysosomal storage disorders. The clinical course includes progressive dementia, seizures, progressive visual failure (except in the adult-onset forms), and often movement abnormalities. Collectively, these disorders are the most common cause of an inherited childhood neurodegenerative disease and are increasingly recognized in late-onset or adult-onset forms. Classic infantile CLN1 disease is caused by an alteration in the PPT1 gene. It is a genetic disorder with an onset of symptoms between 6 and 24 months of age, with recorded later presented CNL1 diseases, juvenile and early adult. Symptoms may include signs of intellectual and motor decline including delays in reaching developmental milestones (development delays), twitching or jerking of muscles (myoclonic jerks), and seizures.\r\n Early diagnosis of CLN1 (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses type 1) disease is crucial to ensure optimum care for patients and their families. CLN1 disease is diagnosed by measuring the activity of the enzyme PPT1. This enzyme is necessary for the proper functioning of lysosomes. The function of this lysosomal thioesterase is to remove the fatty acids bound by thioester bonds to cysteine residues in proteins.\r\n In this study, the aim is to introduce a method for measuring the activity of an enzyme palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 in a sample of leukocytes isolated from whole blood. An in house fluorimetric method was used to determine the activity of an enzyme palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 in leukocytes isolated from EDTA whole blood. This method has proven to be sufficiently reliable for use in selective laboratory diagnostics after clinical suspicion of CLN1 has been established. However, as the fluorimetric method itself has many limitations and drawbacks, it is recommended that the first method of screening is the method of measuring PPT 1 activity from a dry drop of blood sample on filter paper.",

Revisar aquellos trastornos neurologicos caracterizados principalmente por un patron de afectacion paroxistico, y en los cuales se ha identificado una etiologia genetica o metabolica clara. Desarrollo. El termino `paroxistico´ hace referencia al inicio repentino de las manifestaciones clinicas de una manera relativamente estereotipada, normalmente tras la exposicion a unos factores desencadenantes especificos con la resolucion casi total de estos signos entre los episodios. Tipicamente no se asocian a una evolucion incesante ni a un deterioro gradual, y la mayoria no conducen al desarrollo de anomalias neuropatologicas importantes. Aunque por la heterogeneidad de las manifestaciones clinicas y deficiencias subyacentes resultan dificiles de clasificar, por motivos practicos se propone una aproximacion basada en el eje cerebroespinal que permite organizarlas, por ejemplo, desde las patologias que afectan de modo predominante a la sustancia gris de la corteza cerebral (manifestadas principalmente en forma de crisis) hasta las que tienen un patron de afectacion casi exclusivamente muscular y/o neuromuscular. La mayoria esta causada por anomalias geneticas en los transportadores o en los canales neuronales, que pueden ser iones o neurotransmisores. En los ultimos anos, el concepto de `canalopatias´ ha tenido mayor aceptacion en el ambito medico, aunque no todos los trastornos descritos son causados por defectos en los canales moleculares.

      "title": "Basal Ganglia Disease And Depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases of the basal ganglia are quintessential neuropsychiatric disorders, characterized by abnormal movements, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms and signs. Depression is common in these illnesses and may occur at presentation or during the course of the illness. Individuals may present to the psychiatrist before seeing a neurologist. Depression is an important target for research, as it affords a unique perspective on the pathophysiology of basal ganglia diseases as well as an alternative method of understanding the biology of mood disorders. Traditionally, basal ganglia diseases are diagnosed and treated by neurologists, who define their onset by specific motor manifestations. Psychiatric symptomatology has been considered peripheral to the understanding of the motor disorders that define basal ganglia diseases. There is growing evidence for the contrary view that mood and affect are integrally related to the evolution of these diseases. For example, in diseases such as Huntington’s disease or Wilson’s disease, where the genetic mutation has been identified, it is possible to identify presymptomatic individuals, prior to the development of motor signs, who are unaware of their genetic status, and determine whether cognitive or psychiatric manifestations occur more often in gene-positive than in genenegative individuals. Another way to examine the role of psychiatric impairment is to study individuals in the general population who have undergone psychiatric assessments and to determine if individuals with a history of affective disorder are more likely to develop specific basal ganglia diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) than individuals without mood disorders. This chapter includes a review of the epidemiology, prevalence, and correlates of depression in basal ganglia diseases and their treatment.",

      "title": "Usp14 down-regulation corrects sleep and circadian dysfunction of a Drosophila model of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "PD is a complex, multifactorial neurodegenerative disease, which occurs sporadically in aged population, with some genetically linked cases. Patients develop a very obvious locomotor phenotype, with symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, muscular rigidity, and postural instability. At the cellular level, PD pathology is characterized by the presence of intracytoplasmic neurotoxic aggregates of misfolded proteins and dysfunctional organelles, resulting from failure in mechanisms of proteostasis. Nonmotor symptoms, such as constipation and olfactory deficits, are also very common in PD. They include alteration in the circadian clock, and defects in the sleep-wake cycle, which is controlled by the clock. These non-motor symptoms precede the onset of the motor symptoms by many years, offering a window of therapeutic intervention that could delay-or even prevent-the progression of the disease. The mechanistic link between aberrant circadian rhythms and neurodegeneration in PD is not fully understood, although proposed underlying mechanisms include alterations in protein homeostasis (proteostasis), which can impact protein levels of core components of the clock. Loss of proteostasis depends on the progressive pathological decline in the proteolytic activity of two major degradative systems, the ubiquitin-proteasome and the lysosome-autophagy systems, which is exacerbated in age-dependent neurodegenerative conditions like PD. Accordingly, it is known that promoting proteasome or autophagy activity increases lifespan, and rescues the pathological phenotype of animal models of neurodegeneration, presumably by enhancing the degradation of misfolded proteins and dysfunctional organelles, which are known to accumulate in these models, and to induce intracellular damage. We can enhance proteostasis by pharmacologically inhibiting or down-regulating Usp14, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB). In a previous work, we showed that inhibition of Usp14 enhances the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), autophagy and mitophagy, and abolishes motor symptoms of two well-established fly models of PD that accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria. In this work we extended the evidence on the protective effect of Usp14 down-regulation, and investigated the beneficial effect of down-regulating Usp14 in a Pink1 Drosophila model of PD that develop circadian and sleep dysfunction. We show that down-regulation of Usp14 ameliorates sleep disturbances and circadian defects that are associated to Pink1 KO flies.",

The neuropsychiatric symptoms include apathy; agitation and depression. As the disorder progresses, the patient gradually becomes dependent on theirs to perform routine daily activities. Various underlying diseases or disorders are the root cause of the syndrome of dementia. Each of these disorder or disease is characterized by a specific signs and symptoms in combination with a presumed underlying neuropathology. Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent cause of dementia. The second most prevalent cause in vascular dementia.

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental diseases (NDDs), such as autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and schizophrenia, are characterized by diverse facets of neurological and psychiatric symptoms, differing in etiology, onset and severity. Such symptoms include mental delay, cognitive and language impairments, or restrictions to adaptive and social behavior. Nevertheless, all have in common that critical milestones of brain development are disrupted, leading to functional deficits of the central nervous system and clinical manifestation in child- or adulthood. To approach how the different development-associated neuropathologies can occur and which risk factors or critical processes are involved in provoking higher susceptibility for such diseases, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying proper brain formation is required. NDDs rely on deficits in neuronal identity, proportion or function, whereby a defective development of the cerebral cortex, the seat of higher cognitive functions, is implicated in numerous disorders. Such deficits can be provoked by genetic and environmental factors during corticogenesis. Thereby, epigenetic mechanisms can act as an interface between external stimuli and the genome, since they are known to be responsive to external stimuli also in cortical neurons. In line with that, DNA methylation, histone modifications/variants, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, as well as regulatory non-coding RNAs regulate diverse aspects of neuronal development, and alterations in epigenomic marks have been associated with NDDs of varying phenotypes. Here, we provide an overview of essential steps of mammalian corticogenesis, and discuss the role of epigenetic mechanisms assumed to contribute to pathophysiological aspects of NDDs, when being disrupted.",

They may also be divided into motor, vocal, or visual stereotypies. Biological mechanisms of stereotypies are unknown but they seem to be related to the basal ganglia or the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits. Stereotypies are frequently found in patients with autistic disorders, intellectual disability, and sensorial deficit disorders. Some neurodevelopmental disorders show specific motor stereotypies, which reinforce the notion of a genetic or neurobiological basis. When necessary, treatment may include behavioral or drug-based approaches.",

However, advances in histology have led to the recognition of pathological changes in regions far more widespread than recognized even a decade ago, and there is every reason to believe that more surprises are in store in the near future. The correlations between pathology and clinical phenomena have yet to be made for most brain regions, leaving our understanding of the mechanisms of the clinical features of the disease incomplete. The behavioral and nonmotor aspects of PD are particularly difficult to understand because of the major overlap among problems due to neuronal degeneration, psychological responses to progressive disability, iatrogenic complications, and the secondary effects of primary disorders, such as excessive daytime somnolence due to sleep disorder.",

Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

      "title": "Parkinson's disease: drug-induced psychiatric states.",
      "abstract": "Drug-induced psychiatric states occur frequently in PD. In the prelevodopa era, depression and other psychiatric disorders were described in PD, but in untreated patients psychosis was rare. Since the development of levodopa and other pharmacological treatments for PD, however, psychotic symptoms have become much more common (10-50%). In some individuals these problems can be more disabling than the motor features of PD and, as a result, pose a serious threat to the patient's ability to maintain independence. The drug-induced psychoses consist of several distinct psychiatric syndromes that can be divided broadly into those occurring on a background of a clear sensorium and those which are accompanied by confusion and clouding of consciousness. Benign organic hallucinosis is the most common of these syndromes (30%). It usually occurs on a background of a clear sensorium and may not be a particularly troublesome problem if the patient is able to retain insight into the nature of these symptoms. More disabling syndromes usually include delusional thinking that is frequently paranoid, confusion and even frank delirium. Although all these psychotic syndromes can occur in isolation, there is a tendency for mild symptoms to progress to more disabling ones if adequate and timely treatment is not instituted. Abnormal dreaming and sleep disruption often precede these difficulties by weeks to months and may provide an important early clue to their onset. The mechanisms responsible for drug-induced psychotic symptoms in PD are unknown, but dopaminergic (especially mesolimbic) and serotoninergic systems are likely to be involved. The treatment of the drug-induced psychoses in PD should be undertaken in a stepwise manner. A detailed discussion of this approach, including the use of anti-PD medication adjustment, clozapine, and other medications (neuroleptic and nonneuroleptic) and ECT is provided (see Fig. 1). Although drug-induced psychoses are the most important of the drug-induced psychiatric states, mania, anxiety, and hypersexuality may also occur. Depression is also common in PD, but it is unlikely to occur as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medications.",

      "abstract": "Key-words Disease name and synonyms Definition/Diagnosis criteria Excluded diseases Differential diagnosis Etiology Clinical description Genetics Diagnostic methods Frequency Genetic counseling Antenatal diagnosis Management including treatment Unresolved questions References Abstract Microcephaly is defined by an occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) below -2 standard deviation (SD) for age and sex. Severe microcephaly refers to an OFC < -3SD. Microcephalia vera (MV) and microcephaly with simplified gyral pattern (MSG) are genetic forms of isolated congenital microcephaly (< -3 SD at birth), with no extracerebral malformation. Their incidence has been estimated between 1/25 000 and 1/50 000 births. In MV, the brain is abnormally small because of a reduced number of neurons, but is keeping (sub) normal gyral pattern and has no other gross pathological abnormality. Mental retardation is usually moderate and in most cases, patients have no systematized neurological defects or seizures. Brain weight typically is < 500 g (1/3 normal) and OFC is between 24 and 29 cm at birth (normal OFC being higher than 32 cm). MSG has been misdiagnosed as MV or lissencephalies in the past. This disorder is defined by congenital severe microcephaly, reduced number and shallow appearance of gyri, and normal to thin cortex. Five types of MSG have been delineated on the basis of MRI and neurodevelopmental findings, but MV and MSG are likely to represent a continuous phenotype. Mental retardation ranges from mild and moderate (type 1) to severe (types 2 to 5). Pyramidal signs may be observed. Some forms (types 2 to 5) are associated with early-onset seizures and a poor prognosis. MV and MSG are due to abnormal neuronal and glial proliferation. In both types, the cortex is of normal (2.5 mm to 4 mm) or reduced thickness and has normal cytoarchitectonic appearance, with 6 layers of neurons, which contrasts with microlissencephalies or lissencephalies with microcephalies, characterized by an abnormal cortical thickness and an anarchic cytoarchitectony. MV and MSG are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. To date, no locus has been associated with MSG.

Il s’agit d’une pathologie neuropsychiatrique et, a ce titre, elle regroupe un ensemble de symptomes psychiques et comportementaux. Il existe egalement des effets secondaires psychiatriques suite au traitement medicamenteux, comme les troubles du controle des impulsions. L’impulsivite apparait etre une caracteristique commune et centrale a ces troubles. Le traitement neurochirurgical par stimulation cerebrale profonde, en particulier des noyaux sous-thalamiques, constitue une methode de choix pour le traitement des formes severes et avancees de la pathologie, mais peut etre egalement pourvoyeur de troubles psychiatriques.

The symptoms in melancholia being of a negative character due to a lowering or suspension of brain activity, we do not look for all those diversities, endless varieties and aspects which we may find in mania, be it simple, acute, or chronic. Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view. If this increased activity does not rapidly terminate in resolution, one of two things must occur—either exhaustion or atrophy, resulting in death or dementia, will supervene, or abnormal tissue will invade or replace healthy nerve paths or areas, and chronic aberration of mind ensue.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Although the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) dominate the clinical picture, the nonmotor complaints are often more disabling for the Parkinson patient. REVIEW SUMMARY Behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive changes occur commonly and are frequent causes for concern. Depression affects up to half of Parkinson patients and can worsen their motor function. Drug-induced psychoses can range from benign visual hallucinations to paranoid delusions. Dementia, classically described as subcortical, usually occurs in the elderly PD patient and is often clinically distinct from the cortical dementia of Alzheimer's disease although pathological descriptions overlap. A parkinsonian personality has been noted by psychoanalysts and movement disorder experts characterized as rigid and compulsive yet cautious and apprehensive with a subordinate behavior. Sleep disturbances associated with PD include insomnia, sleep fragmentation, daytime somnolence, vivid dreams, rapid eye movement behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome. Sensory symptoms, including pain, may occur, as do symptoms of autonomic dysfunction including postural syncope. Problems with bladder and bowel control and sexual dysfunction are common and often distressing to both the patients and their partners. Fatigue, akathisia, seborrheic dermatitis, and scoliosis are conditions intrinsic to or aggravated by PD. Most of these problems are amenable to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. CONCLUSION Helping patients with PD cope with these difficulties is just as important as manipulating therapy to provide control of their motor symptoms. (THE NEUROLOGIST 6:18-27, 2000)",

      "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) is composed of cellular components organized in a complex structure that is unlike other organ systems. At the macroscopic level, the parenchyma of the CNS can be categorized into two structurally and functionally unique components: gray and white matter. The CNS can be divided into a number of anatomic regions, each with specific neurologic or cognitive functions. Disease or damage to these regions produces neurologic or cognitive deficits that correlate with the anatomic location and extent of disease. There are several ways to divide these structures. The main divisions are the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Developmental neuropathology encompasses a broad variety of cerebral malformations and functional impairments caused by disturbances of brain development, manifesting during ages from the embryonic period through adolescence and young adulthood. The neurologic and psychiatric manifestations of neurodevelopmental disorders range widely depending on the affected neural systems and include such diverse manifestations as epilepsy, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, breathing disorders, ataxia, autism, and schizophrenia. In terms of morbidity and mortality, the spectrum is extremely broad: the mildest neurodevelopmental disorders can be asymptomatic, whereas the worst malformations often lead to intrauterine or neonatal demise. This chapter focuses on the genetic disorders of brain development, caused by mutations of gene loci or chromosomal regions with important neurodevelopmental functions.",

The current pathogenic hypothesis is that the CNS lesions are immune mediated. The CSF may reveal no cells or pleocytosis and increased levels of proteins, and may exclude neoplastic cells and infections. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PCD is usually normal or shows global cerebellar atrophy. Pathological studies show a diffuse loss of Purkinje cells throughout the cerebellar cortex. We describe a case of PCD with unusual findings.\n\nA 51 year old woman was referred with a 1 month history of gait instability, personality and mood changes.

This type of condition can be classified into several subtypes, and the aforementioned ischemic optic neuropathy (NOI) is just one specific example. Optic neuritis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the optic nerve, which can lead to temporary or permanent vision loss. This condition can affect one or both optic nerves and comes in several forms, two of which are the most common: retrobulbar optic neuritis and papillary optic neuritis.

      "abstract": "Abstract Confusion is a non-specific, non-diagnostic term to describe a patient with disorientation, impaired memory, or abnormal thought process. Agitation describes an increased level of psychomotor activity, and anxious or aggressive behaviour. Many agitated patients may also be delirious, yet they only represent a minority of all delirious patients. ICU delirium is an acute cognitive disorder of both consciousness and content of thought. The hallmark of ICU delirium is a fluctuating mental status, inattention, and an altered level of consciousness. Delirium is the end product of a sequence of insults and injury that lead to a common measurable manifestation of end-organ brain injury. It does not have a single aetiology, but often has multiple different and potentially interacting aetiologies. Both non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors play important roles in the development of delirium. Importantly, the new onset of delirium should prompt the physician to investigate the underlying cause. Cognitive impairment and age are among the most important non-modifiable risk factors, whereas administration of benzodiazepines is the greatest. The alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine shows promise as a sedative reducing the risk for delirium when compared with benzodiazepines.",

      "title": "Enhancing Parkinson’s Disease Diagnosis Using Machine Learning: A Comparative Study",
      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurological illness in the world, exactly after Alzheimer's disease. It is the long-term degenerative condition of a human being's central nervous system that primarily affects people over the age of sixty. Parkinson's disease is one of the many neurological conditions that progress over time. Problems with movement are the first symptoms. Initial indicators of the disease could also include vocal dysfunction. Humans diagnosed with Parkinson's have vocal abnormalities that impair their voice's loudness and cause difficulty in pronunciation. As a result, Parkinson's disease can be diagnosed using vocal measures. People may notice issues with common movements, tremors, stiffness in the limbs or trunk, or even decreased balance as neurons (nerve cells) in areas of the brain are weakened, get injured, or die. Patients may struggle with walking, talking, or accomplishing other simple tasks as these symptoms become more noticeable. However, like many other diseases and disorders, these symptoms also appear in other conditions. Thus, it is not necessary for everyone with one or more of these symptoms to have Parkinson's disease. This paper intends to implement 4 base machine learning classifiers and 4 proposed ensemble classifiers to compare and select the best possible model through a dataset of 23 attributes and around 177 records. It is concluded that the ensembles perform far better and are the best interchange between the XG Boost and Random Forest classifier.",

Firstly, it may be distinguished from other causes of peripheral motor involvement such as muscle diseases and disorders of the neuromuscular junction. Secondly, it may be discussed in two different forms: acute and chronic. Acute chronic neuropathies are mainly observed in Guillain‐Barré syndrome, in which electrophysiological studies allow us to recognize the classical demyelinating form and the axonal form. The other causes of acute motor neuropathy are mainly poliomyelitis and porphyrias. Chronic motor neuropathies are mainly observed in motor neuron diseases, mainly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but also Kennedy’s disease and other lower motor neuron diseases which may be inherited or acquired. The other causes are multifocal motor neuropathy and the predominantly motor forms of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The characterization of these different types of chronic neuropathy is of major importance because of the therapeutic consequences which may lead to the proposal of specific treatments.",

An aura is a transient, stereotypical, visual or neurological episode usually lasting 4 to 60 minutes in duration. Migraine is usually, but not always, associated with headache and can be accompanied by systemic and autonomic symptoms. Diagnosis is dependent on International Headache Society criteria. The pathophysiology is believed to involve neurovascular mechanisms. There is a hereditary component to migraine. When migraine auras occur in the absence of headache they are termed acephalgic migraines. Late onset migraine accompaniment is an acephalgic migraine that presents in middle-aged and older adults. It is usually benign. Migraines can be mimicked by other more serious conditions. Most patients with a stable migraine pattern and normal neurological evaluation do not require further testing. Some patients with atypical presentation, older age, or suspected secondary causes need further investigation.",

      "abstract": "Diseases of the peripheral nervous system are ranking a leading position among other neurological nosologies. And polyneuropathy is known as more prevalent and severe disease. Numerous scientific reports highlight issues on different pathological conditions in relation to polyneuropathy, and in particular intoxications, hypovitaminosis (isolated or as complications of certain pathological processes), infectious and hereditary diseases, paraneoplastic syndromes, metabolic disorders, allergic reactions. These diseases when uncontrolled or untreated may result in the development of complications, among which is polyneuropathy. The diagnosis of polyneuropathy is relatively not difficult, because the disease is manifested as distal symmetrical sensory and/or motor impairments with transient disorders of autonomic nervous system. Diabetic polyneuropathy, in particular, is a late complication of diabetes mellitus, which determines the prognosis of the disease. Alcoholic polyneuropathy in a form of acute, subacute or chronic current variants is caused by the combined effects of thiamine toxicity and vitamin deficiency. At the same time, dysmetabolic polyneuropathies differ by variability of clinical manifestations and the general developmental patterns of the nerve conduction block that is determined by the peculiarities of degenerative and regenerative processes under different pathogenetic factors. Differential diagnosis of polyneuropathies is mainly based on the detection of somatic pathology and the comparison of the dynamic changes in the course of the diseases and clinical manifestations. The study has demonstrated diabetic and alcoholic polyneuropathies have clear distinct clinical-neurophysiological patterns. The article also highlights the treatment outcomes of combination therapy with pregabalin for diabetic and alcoholic polyneuropathies.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN) comprises a continuum of three phenotypes with overlapping clinical and radiologic features: Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) Atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy (atypical NAD) PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism INAD usually begins between ages six months and three years with psychomotor regression or delay, hypotonia, and progressive spastic tetraparesis. Many affected children never learn to walk or lose the ability shortly after attaining it. Strabismus, nystagmus, and optic atrophy are common. Disease progression is rapid, resulting in severe spasticity, progressive cognitive decline, and visual impairment. Many affected children do not survive beyond their first decade. Atypical NAD shows more phenotypic variability than INAD. In general, onset is in early childhood but can be as late as the end of the second decade. The presenting signs may be gait instability, ataxia, or speech delay and autistic features, which are sometimes the only evidence of disease for a year or more. Strabismus, nystagmus, and optic atrophy are common. Neuropsychiatric disturbances including impulsivity, poor attention span, hyperactivity, and emotional lability are also common. The course is fairly stable during early childhood and resembles static encephalopathy but is followed by neurologic deterioration between ages seven and 12 years. PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism has a variable age of onset, but most individuals present in early adulthood with gait disturbance or neuropsychiatric changes. Affected individuals consistently develop dystonia and parkinsonism (which may be accompanied by rapid cognitive decline) in their late teens to early twenties. Dystonia is most common in the hands and feet but may be more generalized. The most common features of parkinsonism in these individuals are bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in PLA2G6 on molecular genetic testing. The diagnosis of INAD or atypical NAD can be established in a proband with no identified PLA2G6 pathogenic variants by electron microscopic examination of nerve biopsies for dystrophic axons (axonal spheroids). Management Treatment of manifestations: Individuals with INAD and atypical NAD. Routine pharmacologic treatment of spasticity and seizures; trial of oral or intrathecal baclofen for dystonia associated with atypical INAD; treatment by a psychiatrist for those with later-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms; fiber supplements and/or stool softener treatment for constipation; control of secretions with transdermal scopolamine patch as needed; feeding modifications as needed to prevent aspiration pneumonia and achieve adequate nutrition. Individuals with PLA2G6-related dystonia-parkinsonism. Consider treatment with dopaminergic agents; treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms by a psychiatrist; evaluation by physical therapy for management of postural instability and gait difficulties; occupational therapy to assist with activities of daily living; feeding modifications as needed to prevent aspiration pneumonia and achieve adequate nutrition. Prevention of secondary complications: Early physical therapy and orthopedic management to prevent contractures as the disease progresses; body temperature monitors may be required for individuals with progressive autonomic involvement to identify dangerous fluctuations in core body temperature. Surveillance: Periodic assessment of vision and hearing of nonverbal children is indicated as needed to determine the level of sensory deficits. Genetic counseling PLA2G6-associated neurodegeneration is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family are known.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a major form atypical parkinsonism that should be differentiated from Parkinson's disease. Individuals with PSP typically present with an akinetic rigid syndrome with early postural instability, axial rigidity, and supranuclear gaze palsy.1, 2 Cognitive disorder in PSP is milder than Alzheimer's disease,3 featuring frontal executive dysfunction,4, 5 and appears with motor signs.1, 2 In contrast, it is rare that cognitive disorder occurs without motor disorder in PSP.2, 3 Such a patient was recently seen. A 73-year-old, previously healthy woman began to have memory problems (e.g., forgetful, forgetting to turn lights off, forgetting neighbors’ names) and infrequent delusional episodes (e.g., thinking that someone had stolen her wallet) for which she saw a general physician, who referred her to a memory clinic. She was taking no drugs that might affect cognitive or motor function. She was alert but slightly nervous and irritable. Her speech was fluent, and cranial nerve examinations, including extraocular muscle movement and eyelids, produced normal results. Her posture, including her neck, was normal. She had no tremor, rigidity, or akinesia of the neck, hands, or feet. Her gait was slightly slow for her age. Sensory examinations were unremarkable. She scored 20 out of 30 (normal > 24) on the Mini-Mental state Examination (MMSE) and 8 out of 18 (normal > 16) on the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Laboratory data were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1A) and brain 99mTc- L,L-ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography showed no remarkable changes. Metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy results were normal (heart to mediastinum ratio on delayed images 3.35, normal > 2.0).6 Although hippocampal atrophy was not remarkable, she was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due possibly to Alzheimer's disease. She was referred back to the local clinic, where 5 mg/d donepezil hydrochloride was started. Two years later, she was referred to the memory clinic again because of slow, short-stepped gait with assistance that had begun 1 year before. On examination, her cognitive function had deteriorated: MMSE score 14, FAB score 5. Delusions were not significant. Cranial nerve examination showed supranuclear vertical gaze palsy and dysarthria. She had no retropulsion. She had rigidity in her neck and upper extremities and marked akinesia bilaterally. She had no signs of aphasia, apraxia, limb dystonia, or alien hands. Brain MRI showed atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum (humming-bird sign or emperor penguin sign)7 (Figure 1B), and she was diagnosed with PSP1, 2 and referred back to the local clinic with instructions that she needed 300 mg/d of levodopa/carbidopa for gait difficulty. At the first visit, she had MCI alone without motor disorder. At the second visit, 2 years later, she had vertical gaze palsy and axial rigidity and akinesia. She did not have classical corticobasal syndrome during the course of the disease. Repeated brain MRI revealed midbrain atrophy and neurological signs. No similar cases had been previously reported to the knowledge of the authors except for a schizophrenia-like case8 and two cases of behavioral changes.9, 10 At the first memory screening, The woman described herein had marked frontal executive dysfunction as assessed according to the FAB. Prominent frontal dysfunction is a feature of PSP but not of Alzheimer's disease.3 A pathological lesion might have started in the frontal cortex and caused her frontal executive dysfunction. In conclusion, an elderly woman with PSP who presented with MCI without motor disorder is reported. MCI can be listed as a premotor feature of PSP.

Motor symptoms manifest when there is already an extensive dopamine denervation. There is therefore an urgent need for early biomarkers to apply disease-modifying therapeutic strategies. Visual defects and retinal abnormalities, including decreased visual acuity, abnormal spatial contrast sensitivity, color vision defects, or deficits in more complex visual tasks are present in the majority of PD patients. They are being considered for early diagnosis together with retinal imaging techniques are being considered as non-invasive biomarkers for PD. Dopaminergic cells can be found in the retina in a subpopulation of amacrine cells; however, the molecular mechanisms leading to visual deficits observed in PD patients are still largely unknown. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of the retinal abnormalities observed in PD patients and animal models and of the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in parkinsonian eyes. We will review the role of α-synuclein aggregates in the retina pathology and/or in the onset of visual symptoms in PD suggesting that α-synuclein aggregates are harmful for the retina as well as for the brain. Moreover, we will summarize experimental evidence suggesting that the optic nerve pathology observed in PD resembles that seen in mitochondrial optic neuropathies highlighting the possible involvement of mitochondrial abnormalities in the development of PD visual defects. We finally propose that the eye may be considered as a complementary experimental model to identify possible novel disease' pathways or to test novel therapeutic approaches for PD.",

PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorders include PURA syndrome, caused by a heterozygous pathogenic sequence variant in PURA, and 5q31.3 deletion syndrome, caused by a genomic 5q31.3 deletion encompassing all or part of PURA. PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by moderate to severe neurodevelopmental delay with absence of speech in most and lack of independent ambulation in many. Early-onset problems can include hypotonia, hypothermia, hypersomnolence, feeding difficulties, excessive hiccups, recurrent central and obstructive apneas, epileptic seizures, abnormal non-epileptic movements (dystonia, dyskinesia, and dysconjugate eye movements), and abnormal vision. Congenital heart defects, urogenital malformations, skeletal abnormalities, and endocrine disorders occur, but are less common. Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of a PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorder is established in a proband with either a heterozygous PURA pathogenic sequence variant (90% of affected individuals) or a non-recurrent deletion of 5q31.3 that encompasses all or part of PURA (10%). Management. Treatment of manifestations: Ongoing routine care by a multidisciplinary team. Treatment and/or therapy for developmental delays; neurologic findings (hypotonia, seizures, abnormal movements); feeding difficulties; apnea; visual impairment; and malformations of the heart, urogenital tract, and skeleton. Surveillance: Long-term follow up to assess psychomotor development, seizures or suspected seizures, vision, feeding for dysphagia, and musculoskeletal complications (hip dysplasia and scoliosis). Genetic counseling. PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorders, caused by either a heterozygous PURA pathogenic sequence variant or a 5q31.3 deletion encompassing all or part of PURA are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In almost all probands with a PURA pathogenic sequence variant the sequence variant is de novo; to date, all reported 5q31.3 deletions have been de novo. For parents of an affected child, the risk to future pregnancies is presumed to be low, as a de novo genetic alteration involving PURA is most likely in the proband. However, parents of an affected child may wish to consider prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis as risk may be greater than in the general population owing to the possibility of parental germline mosaicism (estimated empirically at",

Patients may have toxic metabolite accumulation, inadequate energy supply, or neurotransmitter deficiency, resulting in a variety of clinical manifestations and severity with enzyme activity or transporter function defects. Multiple organ involvement is frequently seen, among which neurological symptoms and signs are one of the most encountered problems. Ocular motor problems deserve special attention for it occurs in some inborn error of metabolism. Furthermore, some are early signs or characteristic findings of certain diseases, such as the gaze palsy in Niemann-Pick disease type C and Gaucher disease or oculogyric crisis in neurotransmitter diseases. Early recognition and intervention are important for better prognosis in treatable neurometabolic disorders. In addition, ways to evaluate and describe eye movement problems also help to demonstrate the severity or clinical progression for those diagnosed with certain neurometabolic diseases. However, the complexity of eye movement and ocular motor control renders our clinical observation, recording and even anatomic localization of abnormal eye movements. Clinicians are more likely to detect early signs and unravel problems by gaining awareness of abnormal eye movement.

      "abstract": "The management of a patient with epilepsy requires the physician to address himself to two basic tasks: (1) an accurate diagnosis must be made with special attention to the possibility of progressive intracranial disease; and (2) an effective regimen for control of the seizures must be devised. DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGE Seizures beginning in infancy are accompanied, in about half of cases, by other evidence of cerebral damage, especially mental subnormality. The precise pathology often cannot be determined during life, although a cerebral developmental defect or birth injury is usually responsible. In a small proportion of cases a metabolic error, subdural hematoma, neuronal degenerative disease, or some other progressive process will be revealed by a history of deterioration in skills previously acquired. The diagnosis can then be established by other characteristic signs of the condition under consideration and appropriate laboratory studies. Grand mal, focal seizures and minor motor seizures are the types usually encountered in infancy. The same factors which commonly cause seizures in infancy continue to initiate seizures in childhood and early adolescence, but to a steadily decreasing extent. Thus, seizures due to a birth injury, like most post-traumatic seizures, usually begin within 24 months after the traumatic incident1; however, they may be delayed until late childhood or adolescence. Seizures appearing as a sequela of meningitis or other infections are sometimes similarly delayed. After the second year of life, seizures of unknown cause rapidly increase in incidence, including cases of so-called genetic epilepsy. In the latter, centrencephalic seizure bursts (3/sec wave and spike discharges) appear diffusely in the EEG, not only in patients, but in 45% of their asymptomatic siblings (aged 4 to 16 years), as well.",

      "title": "Mitochondrial DNA-Associated Leigh Syndrome and NARP",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP (neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa) are part of a continuum of progressive neurodegenerative disorders caused by abnormalities of mitochondrial energy generation. Leigh syndrome (or subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy) is characterized by onset of symptoms typically between ages three and 12 months, often following a viral infection. Decompensation (often with elevated lactate levels in blood and/or CSF) during an intercurrent illness is typically associated with psychomotor retardation or regression. Neurologic features include hypotonia, spasticity, movement disorders (including chorea), cerebellar ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy. Extraneurologic manifestations may include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. About 50% of affected individuals die by age three years, most often as a result of respiratory or cardiac failure. NARP is characterized by proximal neurogenic muscle weakness with sensory neuropathy, ataxia, and pigmentary retinopathy. Onset of symptoms, particularly ataxia and learning difficulties, is often in early childhood. Individuals with NARP can be relatively stable for many years, but may suffer episodic deterioration, often in association with viral illnesses. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome is established clinically in a proband with progressive neurologic disease with motor and intellectual developmental delay, signs and symptoms of brain stem and/or basal ganglia disease, raised lactate concentration in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid, and any one of the following: Characteristic features on brain imaging Typical neuropathologic changes Typical neuropathology in a similarly affected sib Identification of a pathogenic variant in one of the 14 mitochondrial genes known to be involved in mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome confirms the diagnosis. The diagnosis of NARP is established in a proband with suggestive clinical features and identification of a heteroplasmic pathogenic variant in one of the three mitochondrial genes known to be involved in NARP. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive treatment includes use of sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate for acute exacerbations of acidosis and anti-seizure medication for seizures. Dystonia is treated with benzhexol, baclofen, tetrabenazine, and gabapentin alone or in combination, or by injections of botulinum toxin. Anticongestive therapy may be required for cardiomyopathy. Regular nutritional assessment of daily caloric intake and adequacy of diet and psychological support for the affected individual and family are essential. Surveillance: Neurologic, ophthalmologic, and cardiologic evaluations at regular intervals to monitor progression and appearance of new symptoms. Care is frequently coordinated by a biochemical geneticist in North America, and by a metabolic physician/pediatrician elsewhere in the world. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Sodium valproate and barbiturates, anesthesia, and dichloroacetate. Genetic counseling Mitochondrial DNA-associated Leigh syndrome and NARP are transmitted by maternal inheritance. The father of a proband is not at risk of having the mtDNA pathogenic variant. The mother of a proband usually has the mtDNA pathogenic variant and may or may not have symptoms. In most cases, the mother has a much lower proportion of abnormal mtDNA than the proband and usually remains asymptomatic or develops only mild symptoms. Occasionally the mother has a substantial proportion of abnormal mtDNA and develops severe symptoms in adulthood. Offspring of males with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are not at risk; all offspring of females with a mtDNA pathogenic variant are at risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. The risk to offspring of a female proband of developing symptoms depends on the tissue distribution and proportion of abnormal mtDNA. Prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic testing for couples at increased risk of having children with mtDNA-associated Leigh syndrome or NARP are possible by analysis of mtDNA extracted from non-cultured fetal cells or from single blastomeres, respectively. However, long-term outcome cannot be reliably predicted on the basis of molecular genetic test results.",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders and the epilepsies share common etiologies and pathologies. The severity of impairment and the variety of symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders or with particular epilepsy syndromes reflect focal or global, structural or functional dysfunction of neuronal networks. The complex relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy is secondary to common factors that include genetics, cognition, motor and language function. The epileptic encephalopathies are associated with regression or slowing of cognitive, language or behavior and the accepted working hypothesis is that this is a direct consequence of the seizures or of the interictal epileptiform activity, as opposed to the associated medical condition. The evidence that recurrent seizures or abnormal electrical activity can cause specific cognitive, language or behavioral abnormalities even in accepted epileptic encephalopathies is still controversial. Data from animal studies and the clinical experience from epileptic encephalopathies of early life imply that there are developmental time windows crucial to the type of epilepsy syndrome and to cognitive and behavioral outcome.The management of children in whom a neurodevelopmental disorder coexists with epilepsy is a difficult problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both the epilepsy and the specific cognitive or behavioral problem and is tailored to the needs of the individual child.",

Autonomic insufficiency commonly precedes neurological involvement which produces Parkinsonian features, cerebellar dysfunction and other signs of impaired central nervous system function. The disease generally begins in the sixth decade and leads to premature death about 8 years after the onset. Pharmacological and physiological investigations reveal defective baroreflex modulation of blood pressure. Peripheral sympathetic noradrenergic neurons are not appropriately activated. Several central nervous system neurotransmitter pathways are affected by the degenerative process. Neuronal loss and gliosis characterize the primary neuronal degeneration in numerous brain regions.

New psychogenic syndromes in old age are either acute reactions to life stress or character developments which accentuate former personality features. The acute psychogenic reactions are manifested as depressive or hypochondriac syndromes, clearly related regarding time and content to the situational burden. Psychiatrists seldom see new psychoneuroses and neurotic reactions in the elderly and such patients are seldom admitted to psychiatric institutions.

Alcohol itself is unlikely to be the responsible toxin, for improvement of the neuropathy can occur by restoration of normal diet despite continued drinking. Fits are a symptom of an abnormal cerebral cortex, so can be caused by many of the consequences of alcoholism. A small proportion of alcoholics develop bilateral progressive visual impairment, associated with characteristic central or centro-caecal scotoma and optic atrophy.

      "title": "Poor insight in psychosis and meta-representation models",
      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

      "abstract": "Introduction 1.1 Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease Idiopathic Parkinson`s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by basal ganglia dysfunction frequently being associated with frontostriatal dysfunction and cognitive impairment.The prevalence of PD increases with age and is estimated at 100-200/100000 people (Chen et al., 2001;Schrag et al., 2000) worldwide.The clinical hallmarks of PD are akinesia, rigidity and tremor (Douglas et al., 1999;Hughes et al., 1992).In the past PD has been considered as a pure movement disorder, but in recent years the presence of non-motor symptoms in PD has been recognized.Non-motor symptoms include a variety of autonomic dysfunctions such as orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia, bladder dysfunction, sleep disturbances, psychiatric symptoms, i.e. depression, hallucinations or psychosis and cognitive impairment.Non-motor symptoms such as pain, depression or sleep disturbances might precede the onset of motor symptoms in PD and are sometimes even more disabling than motor deficits.For many years cognitive impairment and the occurrence of dementia have been considered as not typical for IPD.James Parkinson (Parkinson, 1817) wrote in his essay on the shaking palsy \" the senses are not disturbed\".However, there is now enough evidence in the literature that dementia might occur in up to 40% of PD-patients (Emre et al., 2004).PD dementia is the third most common reason for dementia.Dementia in PD has been associated with reduced quality of life, greater sensitivity to medication, higher risk of developing psychosis, shortened survival (Levy, 2002), increased caregivers stress and frequent transfer to nursing homes (Aarsland et al., 2000) compared to PD-patients without dementia.In contrast to dementia mild cognitive impairment might occur early in the course of the disease.Approximately, a quarter of PDpatients without dementia have mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and 20% might have MCI at the time of diagnosis (Aarsland et al., 2011).The cognitive deficits in PD are specific and include executive dysfunction, attentional and visuospatial deficits.Executive functions include control, manipulation, and cognitive flexibility (",

Physiological causes of sexual dysfunction in neurological disease include disruption of regions of the cerebral cortex mediating sexual behavior and response; neuroendocrine or neurochemical dysfunction; and motor, sensory, or autonomic neuropathy Sexual dysfunction may be a consequence of the neurological disease or the pharmacologic therapy.

Such association may be further strengthened during the progression of continuous neuronal loss and disease. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the association between depression and PD are not clearly understood, and it is hypothesised that changes in brain pathology, neurotransmitter signalling pathways and, particularly, abnormalities of dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotoninergic projections may substantially contribute to its development.1 Psychological factors, life stresses and internal perception of PD as a devastating neurodegenerative condition with no effective cure may also contribute to the development of depression in patients with PD.

While the atrophic type of cerebral palsy, which is of fairly rare occurrence, has been parenthetically noted by various writers, it has not generally been allotted its place in the classification of cerebral palsies. The special pathology of this atrophic form is dependent on a lower cortical involvement than the ordinary type.

There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment.

The seasonal acute syndromes of cranial neuritis or radiculoneuritis are generally quite distinctive, but may cause diagnostic difficulty when one syndrome occurs without the other, when erythema migrans is absent or missed, and when meningeal signs are minimal or absent. The chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathies are less severe, and less distinctive. Their recognition depends on eliciting a history of earlier classical manifestations of Lyme disease and by laboratory testing. In both acute and chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathy, electrophysiologic testing often proves the presence of a sensorimotor, axon loss polyradiculoneuropathy. Both acute and chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathy have similar pathologic features and can be classified as a nonvasculitic mononeuritis multiplex. The pathogenesis is uncertain; both direct infection as well as parainfectious mechanisms may play a role. The treatment with which we have the most experience is intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g/day for 2 to 4 weeks. Improvement occurs rapidly over days to weeks in early Lyme neuroborreliosis, but slowly over many months in chronic neuroborreliosis.",

      "title": "Introduction to psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is the branch of medicine which specializes in the treatment of those brain disorders which pri­marily cause disturbance of thought, behaviour, and emotion. These are often referred to as mental, or psy­chiatric, disorders. The boundary with the specialty of neurology, which also deals with disorders of the cen­tral nervous system, is therefore indistinct. Neurology mainly focuses on brain disease with clear physical pathology and/ or obvious peripheral effects on, for ex­ample, motor function. Mental disorders such as depressive disorder and psychoses have been recognized since antiquity. Modern epidemiological studies have demonstrated that they are both highly prevalent and widely dis­tributed across all societies. Overall, mental disorders account for a very high proportion of the disability experienced by the human race (see Chapter 2). Unfortunately, in most societies mental disorders still do not receive the recognition or a level of health ser­vice commensurate with their public health import­ance. There are several reasons for this. Probably most importantly, the brain is a vastly complex organ and the neural systems underlying mental disorders re­main poorly characterized. This inevitably means that our understanding of the pathophysiology is rela­tively poor compared to disorders such as diabetes or heart disease. The absence of a clear body of reliable scientific evidence means that competing unscien­tific views— and stigma— can flourish. Recently, how­ever, our neurobiological techniques have improved in sophistication and sensitivity to the extent that mental disorders have become tractable problems. Phenomena such as mood symptoms, anxiety, and even psychosis seem to exist on a continuum in the population, and the absence of reliable neurobiological measures creates difficulties in determining where the thresholds lie in the gradual change from normality to illness. In clinical practice, the use of diagnostic cri­teria can increase the reliability of diagnoses and re­duce the variations between clinicians. However, small changes in diagnostic criteria can have large effects on the resulting estimates of the prevalence of disorders. Unfortunately, the criteria themselves are based on very imperfect knowledge about the natural history or boundaries of the disorders.",

Many cognitive functions may be concerned and can be explained by fronto-striatal brain circuits and hippocampus dysfunctions partly through abnormalities related to cerebrovascular diseases. It seems important to distinguish between early and late onset depression whose cognitive characterisation and etiopathogenia differ in some aspects. Cognitive impairment may represent markers of depression but it is still unclear whether one should consider potential biomarkers of disease state or trait or risk factor. These disorders may precede depression and persist despite symptomatic remission. Moreover, the interest of specifying these disorders is multiple because they can have pejorative consequences such as the modification of emotional content, promote suicidal act, limit the effectiveness of psychotherapy, be a risk factor for poor response to antidepressants. or be a potential risk factor for progression to a minor or major neurocognitive disorder, especially Alzheimer's disease.",

In these cases, the initial symptoms became manifest either during or immediately subsequent to some severe emotional disturbance or psychic trauma and the objective neurologic signs were at first minimal. As a result, the symptoms were attributed to emotional causes and only later after the objective neurologic signs had progressed was the correct diagnosis established. The possible role of the emotional disturbances as an etiological factor in the production of the structural changes is discussed. It is suggested that the emotional trauma precipitates both physiologic and psychologic alterations which lead to the appearance of objective neurologic signs.",

Common to most of these disorders are symptoms of weakness and dyspnea. Many patients with occult neuromuscular disorders will be evaluated for underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease by primary care and subspecialty providers and can experience delays in diagnosis due to challenges in attaining early neurological testing and recognizing vague symptoms as potentially arising from the neuromuscular apparatus. Additionally, many adults who develop neuromuscular disorders have concomitant cardiac or pulmonary disease and the presence of dyspnea or limitations in mobility are often attributed to these without pursuing further workup. We outline a review of neuromuscular diseases in adults and an approach to evaluation.",

Describimos el caso de un nino con ptosis como manifestacion de un trastorno conversivo. Metodo y resultados: Varon de 9 anos en estudio por ptosis unilateral izquierda de inicio brusco, sin antecedentes medicos relevantes. En la exploracion se aprecia ptosis de ceja y palpebral izquierda, sin alteraciones de la motilidad ocular intrinseca ni extrinseca. Dado que la exploracion no se justifica por patologia de ningun par craneal, se sospecha ptosis miogenica y se solicita estudio. Las pruebas complementarias, tales como analitica autoinmune, test de estimulacion repetitiva, etc. fueron negativas. Tras descartar patologia organica y conocer situacion emocional inestable por separacion de sus padres, es valorado por el servicio de psiquiatria con diagnostico de trastorno conversivo. Conclusion: La ptosis es una rara manifestacion del trastorno conversivo, y aun mas en la infancia. Solo hemos encontrado dos casos descritos en la literatura. Es importante descartar patologia organica, diferenciar esta patologia de la simulacion y conocerla para incluirla en el diagnostico diferencial de la ptosis.

Therefore, except for dementia and epilepsy, there are no objective biomarkers for diagnosis. A set of examinations is performed to rule out physical diseases, but there is no diagnostic evaluation tool for depression that corresponds to, for example, blood pressure, blood glucose, x-rays, or echocardiography. The reasons for the poor understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders include the difficulty in sampling the human brain and CNS, and there are no pure animal models for depression or bipolar disorder because the human and animal brains are very different.

The typical clinical features of PD reflect well-known pathology in the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, while extra-nigral pathology accounts for many of the non-motor features of PD. As will be subsequently discussed, the most characteristic pathologic feature of PD is neurodegeneration with Lewy body (LB) formation, but it must be acknowledged that occasionally other pathologic processes cause clinical features typical of PD. In particular, some cases of multiple system atrophy (MSA) or even progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) may be clinically mistaken for PD (Bower et al., 2002). More problematic are cases of PD with juvenile onset or those associated with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, such as cases with Parkin and DJ-1 mutations (see below), in which LBs may not be present. Other early onset familial cases present with atypical clinical features such as early dementia and psychosis, which are not characteristic of typical PD (Gwinn-Hardy et al. 2000). Another diagnostic challenge is the relationship of cognitive dysfunction in PD to concurrent Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (McKeith et al. 1996).",

The most common findings in patients with spinal emergencies are pain, motor deficits, sensory deficits, abnormal reflexes, and urinary dysfunction. Acute back pain is the only symptom of catastrophic spinal emergencies such as spinal hemorrhage or infection. Sudden paralysis can result from trauma, cord infarction, or hemorrhage. Even though a thorough sensory examination in the emergency department is often difficult and unreliable, complexes of sensory and motor abnormalities are helpful. As a result of the anatomical distribution of upper and lower motor neurons, acute spinal cord lesions almost always present with hyperreflexia. The mechanism of urinary incontinence depends on the type of lesion. Spinal cord emergencies frequently go unrecognized initially or are misdiagnosed even with such obvious symptoms as the inability to walk or bladder function failure.",

Among them, depression and anxiety complicate PD and are present at high rates in PD patients. Organic depression is generally known to affect a patient's recovery from the sequelae of the primary disease; thus early detection and appropriate treatment are essential. Depression in PD is thought to result from different factors such as disappearance of neurons in the dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin as well as from psychogenic reactions associated with the onset of the disease. Moreover, anxiety may also be a side effect of PD treatment. As morbid states of depression and anxiety are complicated, these symptoms are often difficult to diagnose. Moreover, the validity of these diagnostic methods has not been established. Therefore, accurate diagnoses of morbid states in the early stage of the disease and corresponding appropriate treatments are vital.",

Most of the time it is cardiac standstill, and the event—using simple clinical criteria—is determined by no consciousness, no breathing, no circulation, and no capacity of resuscitation. To diagnose absent brain function—some call it death by neurologic criteria—is a more detailed examination best done by a neurologist or neurosurgeon. Of course, in principle, any clinically experienced physician is qualified to determine death by neurologic criteria, but in our hospitals we noticed an increase in consulted neurointensivists, and perhaps this can be attributed to a poor comfort level of physicians less familiar with disorders of the nervous system. The diagnosis of brain death is neurocritical care territory because it gets to the fundamentals of pathophysiologic processes associated with acute brain injury.",

La ceguera, diplopia o paralisis de la mirada son los signos neuroftalmologicos mas frecuentes en el trastorno conversivo. Describimos el caso de un nino con ptosis como manifestacion de un trastorno conversivo. Metodo y resultados: Varon de 9 anos en estudio por ptosis unilateral izquierda de inicio brusco, sin antecedentes medicos relevantes. En la exploracion se aprecia ptosis de ceja y palpebral izquierda, sin alteraciones de la motilidad ocular intrinseca ni extrinseca. Dado que la exploracion no se justifica por patologia de ningun par craneal, se sospecha ptosis miogenica y se solicita estudio. Las pruebas complementarias, tales como analitica autoinmune, test de estimulacion repetitiva, etc. fueron negativas. Tras descartar patologia organica y conocer situacion emocional inestable por separacion de sus padres, es valorado por el servicio de psiquiatria con diagnostico de trastorno conversivo. Conclusion: La ptosis es una rara manifestacion del trastorno conversivo, y aun mas en la infancia. Solo hemos encontrado dos casos descritos en la literatura. Es importante descartar patologia organica, diferenciar esta patologia de la simulacion y conocerla para incluirla en el diagnostico diferencial de la ptosis. EnglishPurpose: Conversion disorder is defined by DSM-IV as a deficit of sensory or motor function that cannot be explained by a medical condition and where psychological factors are judged to be associated with the deficit because symptoms are preceded by conflicts or other stressors. Blindness, diplopia or paralysis of the gaze are the most frequent neurophthalmological signs in the conversion disorder. We describe the case of a child with ptosis as a manifestation of a conversion disorder. Method and results: A 9-year-old male with abrupt left unilateral ptosis, without relevant medical history. On exploration, present left eyebrow and palpebral ptosis, without intrinsic or extrinsic ocular motility alterations. Since the examination is not justified by pathology of any cranial nerve pair, myogenic ptosis is suspected and study. Complementary tests were negative (autoimmune analytics, repetitive stimulation test, etc.). After ruling out organic pathology and knowing unstable emotional situation by separation from their parents, it is valued by the psychiatry service with a diagnosis of conversion disorder. Conclusion: Ptosis is a rare manifestation of the conversion disorder, and even more so in childhood. We have only found two cases in the literature. It is important to rule out organic pathology, differentiate this pathology from the simulation and know it to include in the differential diagnosis of ptosis.",

      "abstract": "Background: There is a group of optic neuropathies of either genetic or acquired origin characterized by similar clinical manifestations with preferential involvement of the papillomacular bundle (PMB). PMB fibers are most susceptible to injury as they are small, unmyelinated, and have high-energy demands. These optic neuropathies share a presumed common pathophysiology of mitochondrial dysfunction. Evidence Acquisition: A variety of medications cause optic neuropathy by interfering with mitochondrial function. The evidence linking these therapeutic agents as a cause of mitochondrial optic neuropathy (MON) is well established in some and less certain in others. The differential diagnosis includes other optic nerve disorders producing bilateral, symmetric visual loss, including certain nutritional deficiencies, toxins, and genetic diseases. Results: Ethambutol, chloramphenicol, linezolid, erythromycin, streptomycin, and antiretroviral drugs can cause drug-related MON. In many cases, drug toxicity is dose and duration dependent, and discontinuation of the drug in a timely manner can lead to significant visual recovery. Conclusions: Mitochondrial optic neuropathies are increasingly recognized as a spectrum of conditions that reach a similar end point by compromising a common pathway of mitochondrial dysfunction. Clinicians should be aware of drugs that can cause a MON. Prompt recognition of this association is critical in preventing irreversible, profound visual loss.",

      "title": "Does the Patient Have Abnormal Movements at Night?",
      "abstract": "Sleep-related movement disorders are generally characterized by simple movements that disturb sleep or the ability to fall asleep. These disorders manifest symptoms of nocturnal sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness or tiredness. In order to make an accurate diagnosis, an all-night video recording is desired to differentiate these disorders from parasomnias. Sleep-related movement disorders or congenital simple movements can cause disturbed sleep. All-night recordings are recommended to differentiate the sleep-related movement disorder from parasomnias. Patients are usually unaware of movements or sleep disturbance. Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders are repetitive and stereotyped with rhythmic motor behaviors. These movements occur during drowsiness or early sleep and involve large muscle groups and include body rocking, head rolling, or head banging. They are more common in children and infants. In most situations, they do not have any significant consequences. Many sleep-related movement disorders are a result of a medical condition due to side effects or withdrawal from medication or a substance, or they could be an isolated symptom or normal variant. Many of these disorders of movement tend to overlap with other sleep conditions including parasomnias. In general, parasomnias are undesirable physical events that occur when falling asleep, during sleep, or while waking up. They include abnormal sleep-related complex movements, behaviors, and autonomic nervous system activity. They significantly contrast with sleep-related movement disorders. Parasomnias tend to result in injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Sometimes they affect the patient, the bed partner, or both. Non-REM-related parasomnias include confused arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Patients tend to have a partial or complete amnesia for episodes. REM-related parasomnias include a REM behavior disorder also known as RBD. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged to elderly males. However, it is often associated with an underlying neurologic disorder such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, narcolepsy, cerebrovascular accident, or Lewy body dementia. Nightmare disorder is apparent during rapid eye movement sleep and often leads to awakening with a bowel movement. While prevalent in the general population, this is common in children. Nightmares are frequently associated with psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder. The patient remembers the dreams and can describe the nightmare, which usually involves threats to survival, security, or physical activity. Nightmares can have a negative impact on family functioning and lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or low energy. It can also impair occupational or educational functions.",

Cognitive decline may also result from hypopituitary dysfunction, undermanaged post-concussive symptoms, other mental health symptoms and disorders, medical conditions, and a genetic predisposition to neurodegeneration. Cognitive decline may be static or progressive. Any individual who presents with cognitive decline following a history of concussion should undergo a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation, and this should be coupled with a detailed medical and neurological exam to assess for all possible causes of impaired cognition. Neurodegeneration should not be assumed as a result of prior brain injury.",

      "title": "When does Parkinson's disease begin?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Pathological and neuroimaging studies have shown that in Parkinson's disease (PD) there is a “subclinical” or “premotor” period during which dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) degenerate but typical motor symptoms have not yet developed. Post‐mortem studies based on nigral cell counts and evaluating dopamine levels in the striata, and imaging studies assessing the nigrostriatal pathway in vivo, have estimated that this time period could last 3 to 6 years. In addition, emerging evidence indicates that the neuropathological process of PD does not start in the SN but more likely elsewhere in the nervous system: in the lower brainstem and the olfactory bulb, or even more distant from the SN, such as in the peripheral autonomic nervous system. Patients with PD frequently can present non‐motor symptoms, such as hyposmia or constipation, years before the development of classical motor signs. The physiopathology of these “premotor” symptoms, though still unclear, is currently thought to be related to early involvement by the pathological process underlying PD of non‐dopaminergic lower brainstem structures or autonomic plexuses. However, the answer to the question “when does PD start” remains uncertain. Here, we review clinical, pathological, and neuroimaging data related to the onset of the pathological process of PD, and propose that its onset is non‐motor and that non‐motor symptoms could begin in many instances 10 and 20 years before onset of motor symptoms. The variable course of the disorder once the motor symptoms develop, suggests that the start and progression of premotor PD is also highly variable andgiven the heterogeneous nature of PD, may differ depending on the cause/s of the syndrome. When and where the neuropathological process develops in PD remains uncertain. © 2009 Movement Disorder Society",

When these signaling pathways are deficient or interrupted (e.g., by a hypoxic-ischemic event), the neurons do not migrate to the proper areas of the brain. This failure of normal signaling results in structurally abnormal or completely absent brain regions, including in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, or hippocampus.

Imbalance of neurotransmitters, particularly of the dopaminergic system, accounting for the often dramatic clinical features, has been uncovered and is successfully repressed by dopamine antagonists [5, 26]. Other neurotransmitter systems are affected as well [5, 26]. Imbalance is caused by profound neuronal dysfunction due to neurodevelopmental/neurodegenerative dysregulation and is also detectable in less spectacular and therefore initially often ignored symptoms [36, 38]. In fact, a remarkable worsening of cognitive/mental performance can be observed during early episodes of the psychosis [20, 36], supporting the concept of a major neuronal damage occurring at that time.",

It is unclear whether children that develop the syndrome had entirely normal cognitive skills before seizure onset, since subtle impairment easily escapes recognition in small infants. It is also difficult to demonstrate whether a recognisable profile of cognitive impairment or a definite behavioural phenotype exists. No clear‐cut imaging or neuropathological marker or substrate has been recognised for cognitive impairment in this syndrome. However, there are different potentially causative factors, including the specific effects on the Nav1.1 channels caused by the underlying genic or genomic defect; frequent and prolonged convulsive and non‐convulsive seizures or status epilepticus; recurrent subtle ictal phenomena, such as that accompanying pronounced visual sensitivity; the use of antiepileptic drugs with cognitive side effects, especially in heavy multiple‐drug therapy; and the restrictions that children with severe epilepsy inevitably undergo.",

This may occur when a myelopathy has yet to evolve fully, or is highly asymmetrical, as in Brown-Séquard syndrome. Other potential distractions include fluctuating symptoms, as may accompany spinal cord demyelination, and pseudoneuropathic features, as seen acutely in spinal shock and in the chronic setting with some high cervical cord lesions. A second pathology, such as a polyneuropathy or polyradiculopathy, can mask the presence of a myelopathy. The converse situation, of non-myelopathic disease mimicking a cord lesion, arises typically when symptoms and/or signs approximate bilateral symmetry. This may happen with certain diseases of the brain, or of the peripheral nerves, with functional disorders and even occasionally with non-neurological disease. These sources of diagnostic difficulty assume clinical importance when they delay the recognition of conditions that require urgent treatment.",

The association of demyelinating PN with severely decreased nerve conduction velocities and an IgM-kappa paraprotein usually suggests the diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), but less often of clinically manifest macroglobulinemia. Demyelinating PN with IgG-lambda- or IgA-lambda paraproteinemia occurs often in the uncommon but readily treatable osteosclerotic myeloma. A monoclonal protein combined with peripheral neuropathy involving predominant pain, temperature and autonomic loss (small fibre neuropathy) is by and large pathognomonic for primary systemic amyloidosis or amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma or Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. Mild sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy is an unspecific syndrome found in all gammopathies. It is important to differentiate between paraproteinemia with clinically pure chronic sensory PN and paraneoplastic sensory polyneuropathy. Unlike amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), paraproteinemias associated with a motor neuron disease-like syndrome sometimes evolve unusually slowly and exhibit neurophysiologically subclinical lesions of sensory nerve fibers. Mononeuropathy or multifocal neuropathy with a monoclonal protein is typical of cryoglobulinemia. Demyelinating PN of osteosclerotic myelomas presenting with one or a small number of bone lesions usually regress after excision or irradiation of the plasma cell proliferations. Immunosuppressants and plasmapheresis in the treatment of the demyelinating IgM-kappa neuropathies, of paraproteinemia with the motor neuron disease-like syndrome, and of mononeuropathy or multifocal neuropathy with cryoglobulinemia, are of doubtful value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Molecular Pathology: Neuropathology",
      "abstract": "The Central Nervous System (CNS) is composed of cellular components organized in a complex structure that is unlike other organ systems. At the macroscopic level, the parenchyma of the CNS can be categorized into two structurally and functionally unique components: gray and white matter. The CNS can be divided into a number of anatomic regions, each with specific neurologic or cognitive functions. Disease or damage to these regions produces neurologic or cognitive deficits that correlate with the anatomic location and extent of disease. There are several ways to divide these structures. The main divisions are the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Developmental neuropathology encompasses a broad variety of cerebral malformations and functional impairments caused by disturbances of brain development, manifesting during ages from the embryonic period through adolescence and young adulthood. The neurologic and psychiatric manifestations of neurodevelopmental disorders range widely depending on the affected neural systems and include such diverse manifestations as epilepsy, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, breathing disorders, ataxia, autism, and schizophrenia. In terms of morbidity and mortality, the spectrum is extremely broad: the mildest neurodevelopmental disorders can be asymptomatic, while the worst malformations often lead to intrauterine or neonatal demise. This chapter focuses on the genetic disorders of brain development, caused by mutations of gene loci or chromosomal regions with important neurodevelopmental functions.",

In addition, some patients remain disabled after the acute infection because of persistent symptoms in the absence of any demonstrable physical abnormalities and are commonly said to have chronic brucellosis. The present study was done to investigate the role of psychologic factors in the pathogenesis of this delayed convalescence. Chronic brucellosis is clinically similar to neurosis in that nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, nervousness, and depression, occur in the absence of abnormal physical findings. This similarity could be attributed to factors discussed below, which may be important determinants in delayed convalescence from any illness. Although similar to emotional illness, chronic brucellosis might be unrelated to psychologic factors and be attributed to enduring infection. The coexistence of neurosis and chronic brucellosis then would be no more than expected from chance alone. It",

      "abstract": "The peripheral nerves consist of bundles of long neuronal axons as they exit the central nervous system (CNS). Some peripheral nerves are wrapped in a myelin sheath generated by Schwann cells, whereas others are unmyelinated. Peripheral nerves serve different motor, sensory, and autonomic functions. The term peripheral neuropathy is usually used to describe symmetric and universal damage to adjacent nerves. The damage and clinical manifestations are usually located distally with a proximal progression. Several disorders can damage peripheral nerves and cause peripheral neuropathy; it is important to differentiate actual neuropathy from other disorders that can have a similar clinical presentation [1]. The diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy necessitates a thorough workup of possible etiologies to identify immune-mediated causes that are amenable to immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. Importantly, patients may occasionally suffer from more than one disease-causing their peripheral neuropathy. Clinically relevant co-comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, chronic alcohol abuse, etc. need to be considered. Evidence-based guidelines and diagnostic algorithms for the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy have been published for specific neuropathic phenotypes such as distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy, small fiber neuropathy, or inflammatory neuropathies. However, they are only applicable for specific neuropathic conditions or when a specific diagnosis is already suspected on clinical grounds. By focusing on the initial steps of the diagnostic workup, this standard operating procedure provides a practical guideline including clinical and additional diagnostic parameters that help to identify the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy [2].",

      "title": "Investigation of the Effects of SIRT1 and SIRT2 Modulators in Neuroinflammatory Models of Depression",
      "abstract": "Depression is regarded as a manifestation of mood disorder and a complex phenomenon. The etiology can be primary and/or secondary to organic diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis are often accompanied by the development of depression. A high prevalence of depression in populations with neurodegenerative diseases also indicates a close relationship between depression and neurodegeneration. There are several hypotheses of the pathogenesis of depression, including monoamine hypothesis, neurotrophic and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) hypothesis, HPA axis theory and circadian rhythm theory. There are apparently no infectious insults in the initiation of depression. However, depressed patients without apparent physical diseases showed an increased level of inflammatory markers. Evidence has indicated that neuroinflammation participates in the genesis and development of depression and interacts with other factors involved in depression. Excessive inflammatory cytokines can reduce the production of serotonin, fuel glutamate excitotoxicity, disturb neural plasticity, reduce the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and eventually prime the brain for neurodegeneration by facilitating inflammation and synaptic damage.\nThe target of current commercially available antidepressants is to increase levels of neurotransmitters including serotonin, noradrenaline and/or dopamine via different therapeutic mechanisms. However, the overall remission rate for the present medication options is under 30% according to the result of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-funded sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression (STAR*D) study. Additionally, they are frequently accompanied by undesirable side-effects and toxic effects in overdoses that limit their application. Therefore, there is an ongoing need to investigate the potential for novel medications that target neuroinflammation to address this underlying feature of depression.\nSirtuins are a unique class of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylases that can affect multiple downstream targets by deacetylation activity. The sirtuin family consists of SIRT1-7 enzymes that differ in subcellular localization, enzymatic activities, physiological functions and pathological roles. Among these seven members, SIRT1 has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects in aging, oxidative stress, neuronal survival, neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. SIRT2 also participates in numerous aging-related cellular activities including DNA repair, oxidative stress and autophagy. Based on these important roles, the pharmacological effects of SIRT1 and SIRT2 modulators have been investigated in numerous neurodegeneration studies where different models were conducted, and contradictory results were generated. Therefore, this thesis proposed a systematic investigation of the effects of SIRT1 and SIRT2 modulators in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration models of depression including in vitro and in vivo studies. The pharmacological agents assessed in this study include: SIRT1 activator resveratrol; selective SIRT1 inhibitor EX527; dual SIRT1/SIRT2 inhibitor sirtinol; SIRT2 inhibitor AGK2; and positive controls for depression and inflammation, fluoxetine and ibuprofen, respectively.\nMicroglia are the resident macrophages that are regarded as the prime components of the intrinsic immune system in CNS parenchyma. Therefore, microglia play a dominant role in neuroinflammation. Injury or other pathological insults can result in the activation of microglia which are able to release inflammatory mediators and chemokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, PGE2 and reactive oxidative species. Thus the overall experimental design was to collect the supernatant from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia (HAPI cell line) and transfer it onto neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y cell line). Microglia were pre-treated with SIRT drugs to affect their biological performance under LPS stimulation and investigate the alteration of the subsequent outcome on neuronal cells.\nTo achieve this goal, methodology development was conducted to optimize the cell culture condition and differentiation method for SH-SY5Y cell line, which is key to achieve accurate results for this study. The glucose level in culture media needed to be correctly selected for the cell culture of SH-SY5Y cells in this supernatant transfer-based co-culture model. High glucose in culture media is considered a pre-diabetic condition for neurons. Data has shown that the cell viability of high-glucose cultured SH-SY5Y cells was reduced by treatment of HAPI cells-conditioned supernatant, which indicated the existence of low-glucose shock. Whereas, application of low-glucose media can effectively prevent SH-SY5Y cells from low-glucose shock after the treatment of the supernatant collected from HAPI cells. Moreover, the differentiation method for SH-SY5Y was also optimized. The combination induction treatment of retinoic acid and BDNF can successfully differentiate the SH-SY5Y cells morphologically and genetically. The RNA expression of neuronal gene marker synaptophysin (SYP) and enolase 2 (ENO2) have shown to significantly increase after combination treatment of retinoic acid and BDNF.\nIn the in vitro pharmacological study, the effects of these SIRT1 and SIRT2 drugs on the production of inflammatory mediators including PGE2, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 on LPS (0.005 μg/L) -stimulated microglia were assessed. Resveratrol and sirtinol significantly reduced the TNF-α production in HAPI cells by up to 95% and 93% respectively. This result showed their potent inhibiting effects on TNF-α which can initiate cell death pathways by binding TNF receptors. Resveratrol, sirtinol, EX527 and AGK2 also significantly reduced PGE2 production by up to 97%, 100%, 65% and 69% respectively in microglia under LPS stimulation. These results are significant given that prostaglandins contribute to prolonged acute inflammatory responses.\nThe supernatant from LPS-stimulated HAPI cells was transferred to SH-SY5Y cells. All SIRT drugs pre-treated of HAPI cells were shown to significantly increase the survival of undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells, following the transfer of the supernatant. Their inhibiting effects on the production of inflammatory mediators including TNF-α and PGE2 might contribute to this protection on SH-SY5Y cells. The SIRT1 activator resveratrol and dual SIRT1/SIRT2 inhibitor sirtinol demonstrated the most potent effect compared to others. Additionally, in undifferentiated cells, resveratrol was protective against apoptosis, as indicated by a reduction in Caspase 3/7 activity. However, in contrast, in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, only sirtinol and AGK2 pre-treated supernatant were found to exert neuroprotective effects. Moreover, no increase in Caspase 3 activity was observed following treatment with supernatant indicating that protection against apoptosis is not the reason for increased cell survival.\nIn the animal study, the two most effective agents, SIRT1 activator resveratrol and dual SIRT1/2 inhibitor sirtinol, from the in vitro study were assessed in the acute phase of the LPS-induced depression mouse model and compared with fluoxetine. The behavioral parameters including locomotor activity and immobility time in the open field test, forced swim test and tail suspension test were significantly improved by resveratrol, sirtinol and fluoxetine in the acute sickness phase of the depression model.\nIn conclusion, this research has emphasized the necessity of increasing the understanding of the roles that neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration playing in the pathophysiology of depression and the importance of investigating SIRT drugs as a novel class of drugs targeting neuroinflammation. This research has shown the effectiveness of SIRT modulators in inhibiting neuroinflammation and subsequent neurodegeneration through in vitro and in vivo studies. Further studies, including combining SIRT modulators and current antidepressant medications are warranted.",

It is characterized by central neurotransmitter imbalance. The syndrome is thought to be caused by Dopaminergic block. Pooled data suggests the incidence of NMS is between 0.2%-3.20%. The mortality rate is very high at 55%, but may be reduced significantly by early recognition and improved management. We present this case as an example of the difficulty in diagnosing NMS.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a general medical term describing diseases affecting peripheral nerves. It may affect sensory nerves causing sensory neuropathy or motor nerves causing motor neuropathy. There are several ways to classify neuropathies. They can be classified according to the number and distribution of nerves affected or may be categorized based on their causative mechanism. Neuropathy affecting one nerve is called mononeuropathy whereas neuropathy affecting multiple nerves is called polyneuropathy. The term mononeuritis multiplex is applied when one or more separate nerves in disparate areas are affected. In this chapter, we classify the neuropathies based on the underlying pathology. Neuropathies are subcategorized into axonal type (associated with axonal degeneration) or demyelinating type (associated with segmental demyelination).",

A vasculitic mononeuropathy multiplex is often seen in patients initially presenting with polyarteritis nodosa or developing arteritis as a complication of rheumatoid arthritis. However, vasculitic neuropathy may become confluent and present as as distal symmetrical polyneuropathy or occur without systemic necrotizing vasculitis. Distal symmetrical polyneuropathies without associated vasculitis are also common in many connective tissue diseases. Compression neuropathies, especially carpal tunnel syndrome, occur with increased frequency in rheumatoid arthritis. Finally, certain neuropathies may be the major presenting feature of particular connective tissue diseases. For example, trigeminal neuropathy often heralds the onset of systemic sclerosis or mixed connective tissue disease, and sensory neuronopathy may be the initial presenting feature of Sjögren's syndrome.",

      "title": "Bipolar Disorders",
      "abstract": "Pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) is a recurring complex psychopathological mood disorder causing significant impairment in children. PBD spectrum includes bipolar I (full manic episode), bipolar II (depression with hypomania) and bipolar not otherwise specified (NOS) (“others” in mid-spectrum who may be exhibiting prodromal PBD states but do not fit criteria clearly).The clinical presentation of PBD often does not meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for bipolar disorder (BD), which was developed in adults and not adapted for children. The diagnosis becomes difficult because symptom presentation is variable and largely dependent on developmental age. Although discrete episodes of mania and depression that define BD in adults may match the presentation of some patients who have BD in adolescence, patients who have BD of childhood and prepubertal onset may or may not manifest these clear-cut episodes. The duration of episodes in children may be as short as 1 to 2 days. Mood symptoms can be chronic, can present as predominantly mixed episodes, or can continuously cycle rapidly, with severe irritability or aggression as the usual presenting symptoms. Disruptive behavior, hyperarousal, racing thoughts, elation, and grandiosity also may characterize the moods. A major depressive presentation is associated with a significant risk for developing subsequent BD. Poor psychosocial skills as well as cognitive and attention deficits may manifest along with mood and behavior changes. The chronic relapsing mode of PBD may extend into early adulthood. Longitudinal studies abound on PBD; yet, there is no firm agreement on exactly what constitutes the diagnosis of PBD.Complicating the diagnosis of PBD is the high rate of comorbidity with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, conduct, substance abuse, and oppositional defiant disorders. Children who have both PBD and ADHD tend to manifest a more severe course of illness, presenting with psychosis and comorbid depression often requiring hospitalization. Although both PBD and ADHD include symptoms of distractibility and hyperactivity, the distinguishing symptoms of mania, flight of ideas, decreased need for sleep, and exhibition of sexual tendencies are present in PBD but usually not in ADHD.PBD is thought to result from an interaction among genetic and environmental risk factors in which family environment is important. The genetic endowment of parents might contribute to the family dysfunction, predisposing already genetically affected offspring to evolution of the disorder. PBD is a highly heritable disorder having a documented genetic determinant, although its basis is not yet fully elucidated. Family history is the most significant risk factor for developing the illness. Studies show an increased risk of psychopathology in the offspring of parents who have BD. Early depression, anxieties, and dysregulated behavior may be useful markers for later development of BD in high-risk children. Those symptoms may be episodic. Some researchers suggest that PBD markers may be detectable almost a decade before the onset of the clinical disorder.Ongoing research is searching to identify PBD prodromes and early risk markers for the later developments of PBD. Clinical staging is proposed in identifying the PBD evolution among at-risk children. Early symptoms in the evolution include abnormalities in temperament, anxiety, sleep disruption, minor mood disturbance, difficulties with emotion regulation, and adjustment problems, progressing into mixed mood episodes, followed by frank bipolarity later in adolescence and adulthood. Heritable biomarkers in the areas of attention, executive function, and affect processing are subjects of ongoing research. There may be structural, functional, and biochemical alterations in the brain predisposing the child to mood instability.Research has suggested that physical, sexual, and emotional childhood traumas that occur at a time of sensitivity of the maturing central nervous system may predispose to and modulate the clinical expression and course of the PBD. Traumas cause organic changes in the brain that lead to mood dysregulation. These changes may result in a rapid cycling course, psychotic features, suicidal behavior, and an earlier age of onset, all of which induce a more severe clinical PBD profile. Traumas can result from any stressful event. Examples include behavioral, educational, family related, or substance abuse induced episodes; negative life events, such as low socioeconomic status, ongoing family conflicts, or low quality of life; or any disappointing life events such as school failure or termination of relationships.As many as two thirds of adults given a diagnosis of BP had symptoms beginning in childhood. This finding underscores the importance of risk and prodrome recognition, along with early and accurate diagnosis that allows intervention before full development of the highly impairing disorder. Expert agreements on what constitute key features and valid biomarkers for PBD diagnosis are needed.Comments: When reviewing community-based studies, the diagnosis of PBD has increased dramatically over the past decade. In retrospective studies in adults, 10% to 20% revealed the onset of symptoms when they were younger than 10 years of age, and 60% when younger than 20 years, with most self-reporting a delay of 10 years in making the diagnosis. Although unfortunate, this finding may not be surprising, because there are less clear diagnostic criteria for children and because pediatricians have not been trained to consider this diagnosis. Early diagnosis is important in order to initiate appropriate treatment and minimize morbidity and mortality, such as through suicide. As pediatricians, we need to consider the diagnosis in children who exhibit irritability and aggression, and a family history of bipolar disease is important to determine. Future research is needed to better examine treatment options in children and whether earlier treatment will result in better outcomes. The challenge of managing PBD is yet another example of the importance of mental health training for pediatricians and for collaboration with mental health providers to provide the best possible care to our patients.Janet Serwint, MDConsulting Editor, In Brief",

      "abstract": "Neuroses are a group of neuropsychiatric disorders that are based on reversible disorders of the nervous system, which arise as a result of acute or chronic psychological overstrain. Neuroses are one of the most widespread neuropsychiatric diseases in the world. At the present stage, they are also distinguished as an occupational disease in accordance with the resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The etiological factor in the development of neuroses is a single or prolonged exposure to mental traumas that carry negative or problematic information. The strength of the impact on the psyche is determined not by the physical intensity of the signal, but by the significance of the information. The main factor contributing to the development of the disease is the individual psychophysical characteristics of a particular person. The symptoms of neuroses are divided into two main groups: somatic and psychopathic. Symptoms of neurosis are always present for a long time. They are often painfully perceived not only by the patient, but also their environment, thereby impairing the quality of life of many people both in everyday life and in production conditions. The main clinical forms of neuroses are neurasthenia, hysterical neurosis and obsessional neurosis. The diagnosis of neuroses is based on data from the clinical picture, occupational history, professional journey and additional examination methods that allow you to exclude somatic pathology. Neuroses are easier to prevent than to treat, so their prevention is of great importance. The main areas of neuroses treatment are psychotherapy and other non-drug and drug therapies. Working capacity in neuroses largely depends on the patient’s interest in continuing their work. Determining the degree of disability also depends on the severity of the pathological process.",

There exists great variety in presentation, history, and associated symptoms within the bipolar spectrum. A symptom-based approach to treatment can help guide therapeutic decisions when dealing with complex mood disorders. In order to optimize treatment, it is necessary to understand the neurobiological basis of symptoms and the pharmacologic mechanisms of action involved in correcting that abnormal neurobiology.",

Cognitive manifestations in osmotic myelinolysis may have been underestimated due to the prominent brain stem symptoms and movement disorders. We report a case of EPM without CPM and describe the neuropsychological findings of EPM. The absence of CPM in this case made it possible to test neuropsychological function in the acute stage. Neuropsychological testing showed severe impairment of attention, verbal and visual memory, visuospatial function, and frontal/executive function.

Initially thought to represent a unitary phenomenon, often attributed to psychiatric disease, it is now clear that parasomnias are not a unitary phenomenon but rather are the manifestation of a wide variety of completely different conditions, most of which are diagnosable and treatable. The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

Of the various terms used to refer to this behavioral change, \"apathy\" is now the most widely used. Global hypoactivity with apathy is easy to diagnose in patients without other obvious neuropsychiatric impairments. In other clinical contexts, the diagnosis of global hypoactivity with apathy requires the physician to first establish that hypoactivity and loss of motivation cannot be more readily explained by sensorimotor impairments (e.g., as observed in patients with stroke or Parkinson's disease) or cognitive impairments (e.g., as observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease). Many criteria and behavioral scales have been used to diagnose hypoactivity with apathy. The main differential diagnosis is depression and depressive symptoms, and distinguishing between these conditions and apathy may be particularly challenging. The mechanisms of hypoactivity with apathy remain uncertain and probably involve several dysfunctions, including the inability to attach motivational values to stimuli. We reviewed the frequency, characteristics, and determinants of hypoactivity with apathy in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson's disease, and stroke, across the different stages of cognitive compromise. The diagnosis of this condition is an important step in identifying the source of difficulties in patients' activities of daily living.",

      "title": "Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness",
      "abstract": "Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a common cause of dizziness and vertigo. This term was first described fairly recently by the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders in 2017. The symptoms include unsteadiness, vertigo or dizziness, lasting at least 15 days per month for 3 months or longer. The symptoms are exacerbated by upright posture, standing, walking or in the presence of various visual stimuli. The cause of this disorder is still unknown, although it is believed that it is related with the discoordination of the peripheral sensory and the central nervous systems. The onset of dizziness has been explained as the result of failure of integrating visual, vestibular and proprioreceptive signals into the central nervous system. The symptoms are often succeeding a previous vestibular disorder, e.g. vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière’s disease or other disorders. Psychological factors also play a part in the onset of PPPD – patients quite frequently present a history of anxiety, neurotic tendencies and depression. PPPD diagnosis is clinical, a thorough anamnesis and clinical examination are crucial. In order to diagnose PPPD correctly, a set of all five criteria, established by the Bárány society, should be met. The treatment is usually multimodal, consisting of vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive behaviour therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI).This review describes the term of PPPD, the symptoms of the disease, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, comorbidities, also the diagnostic criteria and treatment of PPPD. The purpose of this article is to educate about this disease and to encourage more research, as well to seek better care for patients, accomplished by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.",

      "abstract": "The central pontine myelinolysis is a strange neurological alteration of unknown etiology which is not related to genetic factors. Its more significant characteristic is its invariable association with other serious illnesses. In more than half of the cases it is seen in chronic alcoholic patients or in chronic illnesses accompanied by malnutrition or hydroelectrolytic disturbances. It is not related to sex or the age group. The most frequent cause is the treatment of hyponatremia, when there is a too rapid increase of the sodium levels. The basic lesion is the destruction of the myelin sheaths, with relatively unharmed axon; and it affects part or the whole base of the protuberance in a symmetrical form (pontine demyelination). The patients suffering from this illness usually present subacute progressive tetraparesis accompanied by pseudobulbar paralysis with dysarthria and the impossibility of protruding the tongue, together with partial or total paralysis of the ocular horizontal movements. Some patients present mutism and a state of paralysis with preservation of understanding and the sensory ways (pseudocoma or locked-in syndrome). The diagnosis of certainty of this entity is anatomopathologic. Nevertheless, the capacity of the computerized axial tomography (CAT), and especially that of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), to visualize the pontine lesions have largely increased the frequency of the pre-mortem diagnosis. There is not a specific treatment for this illness. It should be prevented avoiding the sharp changes in plasma sodium level in patients with hyponatremia. We present a 58 year-old patient with disorientation and quadriparesis who was diagnosed in life a central pontine myelinolysis.",

Progressive loss of nigral neurons with Lewy bodies is considered an essential neuropathological feature. Recent studies, however, indicate that nigral degeneration is only a part of this synucleinopathy, and clinical symptoms go far beyond motor parkinsonism. Olfactory disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, pain, sleep fragmentation, depression, and dementia with or without psychosis are frequently seen. The variability in the expression of these signs and symptoms suggests multiple causes and/or pathogeneses within the present diagnostic disease entity. In this article, a recently proposed staging of PD-related brain pathology will be correlated with the various clinical expressions. It will be argued that the specific topographical sequence of the pathology, depending on the extent and progression of the degenerative process at defined sites, may explain the individually variable expression of this disease.",

      "title": "SCN3A- Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder (SCN3A-ND) encompasses a spectrum of clinical severity associated with epilepsy and/or brain malformation. Affected individuals may have (a) developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) (i.e., intractable seizures with global developmental delays associated with ongoing epileptiform EEG activity) with or without malformations of cortical development; or (b) malformations of cortical development with or without mild focal epilepsy. Some degree of early childhood developmental delay is seen in all affected individuals; the severity varies widely, ranging from isolated speech delay to severe global developmental delay. Infantile hypotonia is common but may be mild or absent in those without DEE. In those with DEE, seizure onset is typically in the first six to 12 months of life. A variety of seizure types have been described. Seizures remain intractable to multiple anti-seizure medications in approximately 50% of individuals with DEE without malformations of cortical development (MCD) and in 90% of individuals with DEE and MCD. Seizures may be absent or infrequent in those without DEE. Brain MRI findings range from normal to showing thinning or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, to various malformations of cortical development. Autonomic dysregulation, oromotor dysfunction leading to the need for gastrostomy tube placement, progressive microcephaly, hyperkinetic movement disorder, and cortical visual impairment can also be seen in those with DEE. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of SCN3A-related neurodevelopmental disorder is established in a proband with suggestive findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in SCN3A identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Empiric treatment of seizures with standard anti-seizure medications (no specific anti-seizure medication has been shown to be more efficacious than another); feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube placement in those with dysphagia; standard treatment for developmental delay / intellectual disability, spasticity, hyperkinetic movements, autonomic dysfunction, and central visual impairment. Surveillance: At each visit: measurement of growth parameters; evaluation for signs/symptoms of a movement disorder or autonomic dysfunction; monitor for new seizures or changes in seizures; assessment of developmental progress, educational needs, behavioral issues, mobility and self-help skills; annual ophthalmology evaluation to assess for visual impairment. Agents/circumstances to avoid: There is no evidence that specific anti-seizure medications can worsen seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. There is no evidence that sleep deprivation or fever exacerbate seizures associated with SCN3A-ND. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic younger at-risk relatives of an affected individual in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early treatment. Pregnancy management: Use of anti-seizure medication during pregnancy reduces the risk for mortality during pregnancy, but exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk for adverse fetal outcome (depending on the drug used, the dose, and the stage of pregnancy at which medication is taken). The risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from anti-seizure medication exposure is often less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception. Transitioning to a lower-risk medication prior to pregnancy may be possible. Genetic counseling SCN3A-ND is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of probands diagnosed with SCN3A-ND have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the SCN3A pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the pathogenic variant is 50%. Once the SCN3A pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

La gravedad del deterioro y la variedad de sintomas asociados a los trastornos del neurodesarrollo o a sindromes epilepticos especificos reflejan disfunciones focales o globales, estructurales o funcionales de las redes neuronales. La compleja relacion entre los trastornos del neurodesarrollo y la epilepsia es de menor importancia que los factores comunes que incluyen la genetica, la cognicion, la funcion motora y del lenguaje. Las encefalopatias epilepticas estan asociadas a una regresion o una ralentizacion del funcionamiento cognitivo, del lenguaje o de la conducta, y la hipotesis de trabajo aceptada es que esta es una consecuencia directa de las crisis o de la actividad epileptiforme interictal, y no de la enfermedad asociada. Los datos que apoyan la idea de que las crisis recurrentes o la actividad electrica anomala pueden provocar alteraciones especificas cognitivas, del lenguaje o de la conducta, incluso en las encefalopatias epilepticas aceptadas, todavia son objeto de debate. Los datos procedentes de los estudios en animales y la experiencia clinica de las encefalopatias epilepticas de la juventud dan a entender que hay ventanas temporales del desarrollo que son cruciales para el tipo de sindrome epileptico y para el desenlace conductual y cognitivo.

PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer disease. Motor symptoms include resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, extreme slowness of movement, shuffling gait, and impaired balance. Swallowing and speaking difficulties also are common. Nonmotor symptoms include depression, hallucinations, and sleep disturbances that seriously affect quality of life. There is no cure for PD but management of motor and nonmotor symptoms can improve quality of life. Carbidopa-levodopa is an effective initial treatment for motor symptoms of rigidity and resting tremors. Treatments for nonmotor symptoms include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and drugs for dementia. (This is an off-label use of some antidepressants, antipsychotics, and drugs for dementia.) A multidisciplinary approach to optimizing care can include physical and occupational therapy, speech therapy, and psychological therapy.",

The hepatic porphyrias are genetically transmitted as autosomal-dominant disorders with variable expression that produce a particularly severe form of neuropathy. Most medical students readily recognize acute attacks of porphyria when the classic triad of abdominal pain, psychosis, and neuropathy is present. Yet, porphyric neuropathy is a source of confusion in practice, and patients with porphyria rarely receive the correct diagnosis early in the course of the illness. Porphyric neuropathy is manifest by symptoms, signs, and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities resembling acute Guillain-Barré syndrome. However, accompanying psychological features, a proximal predilection of asymmetric weakness, and electrodiagnostic findings indicative of an axonal polyradiculopathy or neuronopathy all suggest the diagnosis of porphyria. Confirmation of the diagnosis depends on use of appropriate laboratory studies. The underlying pathophysiology of porphyric neuropathy has not been established, but it may be related to direct neurotoxicity of elevated levels of delta-aminolevulinic acid. The severity of the neuropathy and the availability of potential treatments, including avoidance of provocative factors, make identification important.",

More critical types of headaches include a subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, vascular malformations, brain tumors, cerebral spinal fluid leak, or central nervous system infection. Serious causes need to be recognized quickly.

      "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) can be considered a complex multi-organ disorder with highly variable extra-intestinal, including neurological, involvement. Cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, headache, cognitive impairment, and neuropsychiatric diseases are complications frequently reported. These manifestations may be present at the onset of the typical disease or become clinically evident during its course. However, CD subjects with subclinical neurological involvement have also been described, as well as patients with clear central and/or peripheral nervous system and intestinal histopathological disease features in the absence of typical CD manifestations. Based on these considerations, a sensitive and specific diagnostic method that is able to detect early disease process, progression, and complications is desirable. In this context, neurophysiological techniques play a crucial role in the non-invasive assessment of central nervous system excitability and conductivity. Moreover, some of these tools are known for their valuable role in early diagnosis and follow-up of several neurological diseases or systemic disorders such as CD with nervous system involvement, even at the subclinical level. This review provides an up-to-date summary of the neurophysiological basis of CD using electroencephalography, multimodal evoked potentials, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. The evidence examined here seems to converge on an overall profile of \"hyperexcitable celiac brain\", which partially recovers after institution of a gluten-free diet. The main translational correlate is that in case of subclinical neurological involvement or overt unexplained symptoms, neurophysiology could contribute to the diagnosis, assessment, and monitoring of a potentially underlying CD.",

      "title": "Neurochemical Alterations in Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common idiopathic neurodegenerative disorder, and millions of people around the world have been diagnosed with it. PD is characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, impaired gait, and posture. The trademark pathology of PD includes dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta and depletion of dopamine levels in the striatum. This leads to a perplexing array of clinical features whose identification and management can be challenging for even the most perceptive clinician. The core clinical complex of PD constitutes the four cardinal signs of tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes. A variety of additional motor features develop in PD, in addition to these cardinal signs. In recent times, it has been recognized that a number of non-motor features also describe PD. The occurrence of these non-motor features may actually precede the development of the classic motor features. Our understanding of PD has expanded at all levels since its description two centuries ago, from the explanation of its clinical phenotype to the identification of its neuropathological features, neurochemical processes and genetic factors. PD pathophysiology can be abstracted at many levels, including molecular pathogenesis, cellular abnormalities, neurochemical variations, site and circuit dysfunction, and dysfunction of the network. With the tremendous advancements in our understanding of these processes it is evident that an ever-expanding wealth of information will continue to emerge and contribute to the development of better treatment approaches for the management of PD. This chapter aims to discuss primarily the neurochemical changes occurring in PD, highlighting the various neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of the disease, along with their receptors and actions. The chapter also covers the dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic pathways involved and how their imbalance contributes to the occurrence of the disease symptoms. Furthermore, the chapter gives an insight into the latest developments and challenges in the treatment of PD.",

The comorbidity of medical conditions and bipolar affective disorders is a topic that warrants systematic research. Rapid cycling has been reported in various other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as head injury, stroke, learning disability, or rarer illnesses, such as cerebral sarcoidosis or tuberous sclerosis. Rapid-cycling bipolar affective disorders may concur with higher rates of substance-abuse disorders, but such an idea is mainly based on clinical observation or preliminary data. There is an overall tendency that mixed states and rapid-cycling forms of bipolar affective disorder constitute more unfavorable forms of the underlying illness. Mixed affective episodes have a link with anxiety disorders and anxious-dependent personality disorders. Rapid cycling may have a link with substance abuse and with certain neuropsychiatric disorders, or, perhaps, these neuropsychiatric disorders may mimic rapid cycling.",

Zu den wichtigsten Symptomen einer Demenz gehören die Gedächtnisstörung, die Einbuße im Denk- und Urteilsvermögen, in der Konzentrationsfähigkeit und der Informationsverarbeitung. Störungen des Sozialverhaltens, des Antriebs oder der Stimmung treten in der Regel hinzu. Die Symptomatik ist so ausgeprägt, dass die übliche Alltagsbewältigung beeinträchtigt wird. Weniger schwere Symptomkonstellationen werden als leichte kognitive Störung vom Demenzsyndrom abgegrenzt. Sie äußern sich meist in Einbußen der Merkfähigkeit (Abrufstörung), intervenieren hingegen nicht mit der Bewältigung der gewohnten Alltagsaufgaben. Die mit Abstand häufigste Form einer Demenz ist die Alzheimer-Krankheit, gefolgt von der vaskulären Demenz. Weitere, irreversibel verlaufende Demenzursachen sind etwa die Parkinson-Demenz, die Demenz mit Lewy-Körperchen und die frontotemporalen Degenerationen. Potenziell behebbare Ursachen für eine Demenz sind besonders zu beachten, z.B. Depression, kommunizierender Hydrozephalus oder Hypothyreose. Für die Therapie ist zudem die Erhebung der noch vorhandenen Fertigkeiten des Patienten wichtig. Eine verständliche Aufklärung des Patienten über seine Erkrankung sollte die Regel für den Arzt sein, Ausnahmen hiervon muss er begründen.",

PD is known mainly by its cardinal motor symptoms which are believed to be associated with dopamine deficiency in the nigrostriatal pathway as a result of DAergic neurons degeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. However, other brain structures degenerate (non-dopaminergic abnormalities) in PD resulting in other symptoms known as non-motor symptoms (NMS). NMS and non-DAergic abnormalities are sometimes present before diagnosis and almost inevitably emerge with the disease progression. Hence, they might play a tremendously important role in the management and sometimes even the diagnosis of PD. This chapter will provide an overview on the neuropathobiology of NMS in PD.",

At an early stage of most neurodegenerative diseases, including the Frontotemporal Dementias, it can be very difficult to determine whether a person has symptoms of a progressive illness or is suffering from a condition less likely to progress, or even exhibiting symptoms consistent with normal aging. It is critical to identify individuals with MCI, since people with this clinical syndrome are at elevated risk of progressive cognitive decline. In the case of Primary Progressive Aphasia, a neurodegenerative disease in which speech and/or language abilities are gradually lost, a speech-language pathologist (SLP) may be one of the initial clinical providers in the MCI stage. The SLP is therefore critical in helping to determine whether a change in language abilities is a result of normal aging, a neurodegenerative process, or other etiologies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neurodegenerative diseases are often classified based on the abnormal accumulation of synuclein or tau. Traditionally, these disorders have been viewed as distinct clinical and pathological entities. However, advances in molecular genetics and protein biochemistry have shown intriguing overlaps. The most common synucleinopathy, Parkinson's disease, is characterized by extrapyramidal motor dysfunction, whereas the most common tauopathy, Alzheimer's disease, is defined by dementia. Yet there is overlap of clinical features; Parkinson's disease patients frequently have dementia, and Alzheimer's disease patients often manifest parkinsonism. Dementia with Lewy bodies exemplifies the existence of a continuum among these diseases. This overlap extends to the neuropathological findings; the pathognomonic hallmark for one set of disorders, Lewy bodies or neurofibrillary tangles, is present more often than expected in the other set. Moreover, mutations in LRRK2 known to cause parkinsonism are associated not only with dopaminergic neuronal degeneration, but also with the accumulation of synuclein, tau, neither, or both proteins. Other shared genetic features between tauopathies and synucleinopathies also exist. Finally, the known protein interactions between tau and synuclein further highlight the interface. Evidence for the intersection of tauopathies and synucleinopathies indicates the need for an updated disease classification scheme and may have important implications for therapeutic development.

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons in the central nervous system. The disorders are clinically well-defined as a disease-related dementia, Alzheimer's disease the most typical case, or as a movement disorder, Parkinson's disease (PD). The risk of developing these diseases increases significantly with age: Parkinson's disease affects 1% of the population over 65 years of age, rising to 2% for those over 80 years. Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder that often impairs motor skills and speech of the patient. PD is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia) and in extreme cases, loss of physical movement (akinesia). In particular, PD is due to a loss of dopaminergic neurons (related to the neurotransmitter dopamine), and subcortical neurons in the brain. Replacement therapy with dopaminergic drugs (levodopa, pramipexole) effectively reverses all the symptoms and signs of the disease. After a changeable period of time, however, this excellent initial response to dopaminergic treatment is complicated by the appearance of disorders known as motor response complications (MRC). These complications are divided into two main categories: (i) fluctuations in motor response and (ii) the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements known as levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) (Konitsiotis, 2005). Generally, motor fluctuations appear first as a shortening of the initially soft and lasting dopaminergic response. For patients with advanced PD, a few hours after the administration of medication the patient begins to notice the reappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease. This is known as end of dose deterioration or This may happen several times a day, so the patient can actually spend several hours per day in an state. During the short visit with the neurologist, the patient may appear to be well and thus the neurologist misses the symptoms related to wearing off. As a result, changes in the recent drug treatment availability do not take place in time. It is now well known that early treatment of wearing-off fluctuations delay the onset of more severe complications in the future, as well as the appearance of LID. Therefore any strategy that can detect early changes associated with wearing off would provide a valuable clinical tool that would allow early treatment interventions.",

This could be partly explained by the complexity and heterogeneity of human diseases as well as the associated co-morbidities which may render neuroprotective drugs less efficacious in clinical practice. One aspect of crucial importance in the physiopathology of stroke which is not completely understood is neuroinflammation. At the present time, it is becoming evident that subtle, but continuous neuroinflammation can provide the ground for disorders such as cerebral small vessel disease. Moreover, advanced aging and a number of highly prevalent risk factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis could act as silent contributors promoting a chronic proinflammatory state. This could aggravate the outcome of various pathological entities and can contribute to a number of subsequent post-stroke complications such as dementia, depression and neurodegeneration creating a pathological vicious cycle. Moreover, recent data suggests that the inflammatory process might be closely linked with multiple neurodegenerative pathways related to depression. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines could play a central role in the pathophysiology of both depression and dementia.",

      "abstract": "Mieloencefalite Equina por Protozoário (MEP) é uma patologia neurológica causada pela migração do protozoário Sarcocystis neurona (falcatula) no Sistema Nervoso Central (SNC). A MEP é frequentemente uma doença progressivamente debilitante que afeta o SNC dos cavalos. Sinais clínicos variam de agudos a crônicos, com início insidioso de sinais focais ou multifocais de doença neurológica envolvendo o cérebro e/ou medula espinhal, resultando em um envolvimento difuso e assimétrico do SNC. Os primeiros sinais da doença, como tropeços e batidas frequentes entre os membros podem ser facilmente confundidos com claudicação. Os cavalos afetados com MEP geralmente experimentam uma progressão gradual na gravidade e variedade de sinais clínicos, incluindo ataxia. O tratamento inclui a administração de trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ou sulfadiazine e pyrimethamine (TMS-Pyr). Na criação equina evidências empíricas sugerem a possibilidade de efeitos adversos dos medicamentos TMS-Pyr na qualidade do sêmen, comportamento sexual e função ejaculatória.

Usually the underlying disease process is benign and self-limited in nature. In the absence of hearing loss or additional neurologic findings, a common initial diagnosis is vestibular neuritis. The patient is treated symptomatically and observed for spontaneous resolution. However, other more serious disease processes may mimic the presentation of vestibular neuritis and be misdiagnosed. Five cases of serious central nervous system disorders that were similar to vestibular neuritis in their initial presentation are reviewed to illustrate this point. Each patient presented with the acute onset of continuous vertigo without associated hearing loss. The correct diagnosis was established only after further evaluation was pursued. Recommendations for the initial and subsequent evaluation of these patients are discussed.",

      "title": "Fatigue is part of the burden of neuromuscular diseases",
      "abstract": "Patients with neuromuscular diseases ask relatively simple questions. They want a timely diagnosis, and information about prognosis and effects of disease on their personal functional status. With respect to treatment, patients long for a cure but most understand that they will have to reconcile to rehabilitation or even palliative treatment.\r\n\r\nWith respect to diagnosis, neurologists are trained to detect impairments, neurological signs and symptoms such as motor weakness using the MRC scale, or a Babinski sign. Also, though usually not in a structured way neurologists try to evaluate disability, such as not being able to go up the stairs or cycling. Functional status may be measured with the sickness impact profile (SIP) or the modified Rankin scale. Finally effects of disease on participation, for example not being able to work or taking part in sports, and on perceived health will be estimated. Measures of disability, participation and perceived health are increasingly being used as outcome measures in clinical trials [1].\r\n\r\nFatigue may be another underestimated symptom of neuromuscular disease [2]. That can be explained by ignorance as most patients with the exception of patients with myasthenia gravis or myotonic dystrophy do not spontaneously complain of fatigue. Many severely handicapped neuromuscular patients keep trying to participate in social life and work. In contrast, patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome have no or little objective signs and maximal decrease of participation and perceived health [2]. Yet, if fatigue would be a common additional feature of neuromuscular diseases, neurologists must be aware in order to better comprehend their patients and to develop new treatment strategies.\r\n\r\nThis issue of the Journal of Neurology contains two papers on fatigue in hereditary neuromuscular diseases. Dr. Hagemans did a cross-sectional study using a questionnaire with the Fatigue Severity Scale in 225 patients with late-onset Pompe disease [3]. About 67% had severe fatigue. Possible confounding factors were wheelchair dependency and respiratory support in about half of the patients, but 59% of patients without these aids also had severe fatigue. Previously this group investigated quality of life in lateonset Pompe patients using the SF-36 [4]. Interestingly, they found that these patients score only slightly lower than the general population on the mental health domains, making depression or decreased vitality as explanations for fatigue unlikely [3, 4]. The second paper shows that fatigue and pain can be relevant symptoms in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) [5]. Both groups suggest that fatigue is probably underreported in these slowly progressive neuromuscular diseases.\r\n\r\nSome caution with the role of confounding factors seems justified. The question whether patients with late onset Pompe disease and no respiratory aid have respiratory insufficiency that explains fatigue, can only be answered by actually measuring pulmonary function. In FSHD impaired shoulder function that is difficult to quantify, will affect quality of life and could explain fatigue.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the notion that fatigue may be part of the phenotype of neuromuscular disease is important. To my opinion, the wear and tear from having to live a life long with the consequences of a neuromuscular disease may be one explanation for fatigue. Severe fatigue will affect participation and perceived health. Neurologists must learn to measure fatigue during history taking. Neurologists can also develop interventions. For instance, it has recently been demonstrated that simple bicycle exercise training may help to decrease fatigue in patients following Guillain-Barre syndrome [6].",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes is gaining increased clinical significance. The neurochemical and neuropathological basis in the various parkinsonian forms and even in an individual patient are not fully elucidated yet and could be heterogeneous. Loss of dopaminergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic innervation has been suggested to be the underlying neurochemical deficits for cognitive impairment and dementia in PD, but the onset of cognitive impairment and the progression to dementia may not share the same underlying neurochemical basis. Similarly, pathological evidence is also heterogeneous, ranging from subcortical pathology, limbic or cortical Lewy body type degeneration, and Alzheimer's type pathology that can be found even in the same patient with PD dementia (PDD). Typically, the prototype of early cognitive deficit in PD is a dysexecutive syndrome, but other cognitive domains are more involved when dementia develops, mainly including visuospatial, language and memory dysfunction. Functional radionuclide neuroimaging, by means of single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography, are contributing to characterize the topographic cortical pattern of cognitive impairment, as well as to define the underlying neurochemical deficit. Lastly, the advent of amyloid PET may help clarifying the meaning of amyloid load in diffuse Lewy body disease and PDD. Knowing the neurochemical and pathophysiological substrate of cognitive deficit in patients with PD or other degenerative Parkinsonisms may help the clinician in understanding the clinical condition of an individual patient in order to plan pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention. The introduction of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for therapy of PDD is an example of information integration between clinical-neuropsychological and pathophysiological-neurochemical aspects obtained also with the key contribution of functional neuroimaging.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neurodegenerative disorders predominantly affect the neurons in the human brain. Neurons are highly specialized cells and are responsible for communicating information in both chemical and electrical forms. Unlike other cells, nerve cells normally do not divide and multiply; thus the body does not replace dead or damaged neurons. Neurodegenerative disorders result in progressive degeneration and/or death of nerve cells and can be defined as hereditary and sporadic conditions characterized by progressive nervous system dysfunction. Most of these disorders are associated with degeneration of the affected central or peripheral structures of the nervous system. Neurodegenerative disorders include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease), prion diseases, brain cancer, epilepsy, encephalitis, hydrocephalus, genetic brain disorders, and others. Most of them are incurable and burdensome conditions that cause complications with movement (ataxias), or mental functioning (dementias).",

      "title": "Deterioration",
      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "title": "P3‐174: Mild cognitive impairment: A new hope",
      "abstract": "Various studies have suggested that Alzeimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic process that begins well before clinical expression of dementia. Moreover, works showed that weak cognitive performances can precede by a few years the diagnosis of AD. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) describes a state of abnormal cognitive functioning that is insufficient to warrant a diagnosis of dementia. The concept of MCI nominates old persons afflicted with light cognitive disorders which could present certain signs of AD several years before this one is not diagnosed. MCI does not significantly impact basic daily activities and is not accompanied by declines in overall cognitive function. People with MCI are three to four times more likely to develop Alzheimer's than those without such impairment. Amnestic MCI (significantly affects memory) has been linked to Alzheimer's disease, while nonamnestic MCI may progress to other types of syndromes (such as frontotemporal dementia, primary progressive aphasia or dementia with Lewy bodies). But some people with MCI don't go on to develop any type of dementia. Some remain stable, while others even revert to normal.The conversion rate from MCI to AD is 12% per year. After a brief presentation of the concept of MCI, this communication will emphasize on different subjects like cognitive area. This deficits will be link with neuroimmaging that demonstrate atrophic hippocampal formations, atrophic enthorinal cortices, greater total brain atrophy, enlarge ventricles. We demonstrated deficits in : – memory: episodic memory, visuopsatial and spatial short terme memory -executive function: flexibility and planification -attention : focus attention, visual search, ability to desengaged attention and to use visual cue to produce an alerting effect. MCI is a concept based on criteria of Petersen. This criteria help us to know if MCI is a transition state between cognitive decline on normal aging and clinical presentation of dementia. More over, this cognitive deficits help us to make the link between cognitive area and activity of daily living. MCI is a new hope for our generation and the prevention of dementia.",

      "abstract": "Muskelschmerzen und Krämpfe sind sehr häufige klinische Entitäten neuromuskulärer Störungen und ggf. spezifischer Erkrankungen. Der sog. Muskelkater entsteht durch Mikrotraumata des Sarkolemms und der Sarkomere, und Myalgien u. a. durch Ischämie, lokale Protonenkonzentrations-, Sympathikustonusänderungen oder spezifische metabolische Änderungen der musklären Homöostase. Krampi wiederum werden zumeist neurogen proximal in den Motorneuronanteilen oder in den terminalen intramuskulären Anteilen der efferenten Axone ausgelöst. Oft bleibt die Pathogenese bei diesen neuromuskulären Störungen unentdeckt. Im Kontrast dazu steht die sog. Dekontraktionshemmung oder Relaxationsstörung des myotonen Syndroms. Alle klassischen myotonen Syndrome konnten in den letzten 2 Dekaden molekulargenetisch den Ionenkanalerkrankungen zugeordnet werden. Zum Teil ist jetzt der pathophysiologische Mechanismus spezifischer Genmutationen z. B. im muskulären Chlorid- oder Natriumkanal bekannt. Nichtsdestotrotz gibt es bis dato keine spezifische medikamentöse Behandlung dieser genannten Störungen und Erkrankungen. Moderne Doppelblind- und placebokontrollierte Studien zur Wirksamkeit der heute eingesetzten Pharmaka fehlen. Im klinischen Alltag haben sich kurzfristig nichtsteroidale Antiphlogistika und Kanalblocker bewährt. Hierzu erfolgt in diesem Artikel eine aktualisierte Übersicht. Generell scheint prophylaktisch nur gezieltes aerobes Ausdauertraining unter kontinuierlicher, rhythmischer Nutzung großer Muskelgruppen, wie z. B. beim Joggen, Radfahren, Schwimmen geeignet zu sein, um neuromuskulären Störungen auf Dauer vorzubeugen. Ebenso sollte heute jeder Patient mit einer Muskelerkrankung ein individuell adaptiertes Ausdauertraining absolvieren.",

Bulbar muscles are first affected in some patients, and upper- or lower-limb muscles are initially involved in others; the manifestations are focal and discrete at clinical onset and then progress contiguously outward over time to become diffuse and complex.1 2\n\nIn other common neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, the molecular pathogenesis is characterised by the misfolding of proteins that assemble into ordered aggregates in affected neurons.

However, a chronic form occurs often in a combined fashion with anteroposterior flexion (camptocormia), improves only partially, remains stable, or even worsens over time. The acute/subacute phenotype is the condition originally named as Pisa syndrome (PS). The pathophysiology of PS remains poorly understood, and a cholinergic-dopaminergic imbalance has been suggested as being involved in the cause of this disorder. The role of other neurotransmitters and how they become dysfunctional in PS remains to be elucidated. Specific treatments, other than discontinuing the medications responsible for the disorder, whenever possible, are undeveloped because of the unknown etiology.",

In addition, with increasing age such disturbances may accompany mild cognitive changes that are symptomatic of a range of neurodegenerative conditions.

      "abstract": "Abstract We present a case of an 80‐year‐old man who developed a seizure disorder at age 66 and was treated with chronic phenytoin. In the last 3 years of his life, he developed multiple neurological deficits, including bilateral chorea, ataxic gait, sensory neuropathy, and progressive dementia. After death from pneumonia, autopsy examination of the patient's brain was most remarkable for a selective loss of neurons from both subthalamic nuclei and Purkinje cell loss in the cerebellum. This pattern of injury is consistent with a toxic process and does not fit previously characterized pathological syndromes known to be associated with movement disorders or dementia or both. Phenytoin has been shown to cause choreiform movements, peripheral neuropathy, and cognitive decline in some patients, but the pathological basis for these changes has not been elucidated. The patient's chorea was very likely the result of neuronal loss in the subthalamic nuclei, but causes for his dementia and neuropathy were not found. The pathological findings may represent either an unusual form of chronic phenytoin toxicity or a previously undescribed primary degenerative brain syndrome.",

Patients suffering from chronic pain of neuropathic origin experience worsened health and greater disability than those not suffering from this type of pain. Disorders of the peripheral nervous system, including sensory disturbance, are commonly seen in adults. Peripheral neuropathy has a prevalence of 2.4% in the general population and increases with age to an estimated 8% in those over 55 years of age. Nerve fibers affected by peripheral neuropathy may serve motor, sensory, or autonomic functions; the fibers may be large or small; the distribution of neuropathic involvement may be proximal, distal, or multifocal; and the onset of symptoms may be acute (less than 3 weeks), subacute (3 weeks to 3 months), or chronic (over 3 months). Peripheral neuropathy may occur as a result of several common and many rare diseases, but the most common cause is diabetes. Diseases of the peripheral nervous system may involve muscles (myopathies), nerves (neuropathies, with axons and myelin being affected), and neuromuscular junctions. The subject of peripheral neuropathy; its anatomy; and physiology, classification, evaluation, treatment, and prognosis is an extremely broad topic, and the intent of this chapter is to present a summary review, not an exhaustive analysis of the subject.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.",

Nonmotor features of PD, such as dementia, may be an intrinsic feature of the disorder and persist regardless of the medication on or off state ; some of the nonmotor features, such as psychotic symptoms, may be difficult complications of pharmacologic intervention for the treatment of the motor manifestations of PD. Difficult complications, such as psychosis and impulse control disorders, may respond to modify of the PD treatment regimen at the risk of worsening motor symptoms. Thus, a balance must be required between controlling nonmotor manifestations and motor features of the disease . although the definition of Parkinson disease (PD) is based on the presence of motor features .Nonmotor manifestations are nearly related in PD, with behavior problems often being the most malignant. Almost all patients with PD have nonmotor and neuropsychiatric features, including sleep disturbances, compulsive and impulsive behaviors, autonomic dysfunction, and psychosis. The neuropsychiatric and behavioral features of PD can be classified as intrinsic features, which occur as part of PD, and iatrogenic features, which are complications that arise from treatments used to manage the motor symptoms of PD.",

Ces alterations peuvent trouver leurs origines dans des atteintes primaires de la fonction neuromusculaire et/ou des atteintes secondaires causees par exemple, par une diminution de l'activite spontanee favorisee par une pathologie chronique. Ainsi, la faiblesse et la fatigabilite musculaire sont des symptomes tres frequemment rapportes dans les maladies neuromusculaires (myopathies/neuropathies d'origine genetique ou acquise), les pathologies impliquant le systeme cardiovasculaire (insuffisance cardiaque) et/ou respiratoire (broncho-pneumopathie chronique obstructive (BPCO)).

Experimental or diagnostic evidence of fatigue is available only in disorders of the peripheral motor neuron, the neuromuscular junction and the muscle fibers, but not in CNS disorders. Fatigue, as a fluctuating symptomatology may be misdiagnosed as simulation or malingering not only by lay persons, but also by doctors.",

      "abstract": "Immediately after the introduction of arsphenamine there was recognized a type of precocious neurosyphilis to which was given the name neurorecurrence (Neurorezidive). As usually accepted, this term is limited to a syndrome consisting of the sudden appearance of symptoms and signs of involvement of the central nervous system in a patient with early (primary or secondary) syphilis, who has received an amount of treatment insufficient to eradicate the infection, and has then lapsed from treatment. The clinical manifestations are varied, but usually consist of an acute or subacute syphilitic meningitis, commonly with, but sometimes without, focal lesions of the cranial nerves. The early literature on this subject was filled with a controversy as to whether these lesions were caused by the harmful effects of arsenicals or by syphilis. The controversy has long since been settled. Neurorecurrences are due, not to arsphenamine, but to too little arsphenamine; the symptoms usually disappear",

It is an attempt that often proves difficulty by lack of access to specific investigations and the lack of neuroophthalmology specialists. In most cases, the sudden decrease of vision occurs in the stroke of the eye by occlusion of central retinal artery or one of its branch, occlusion of vein, occlusion of optic nerve vessels or by demyelinating processes of the optic nerve. Rapid diagnosis of eye disease by appropriate clinical or paraclinical investigations, leads to prompt treatment with decreased risk of complications, but in many cases it requires preventive measures.",

Neuralgic amyotrophy is a clinical diagnosis, however, further diagnostic studies can confirm clinical suspicion and help exclude other causes. The treatment consists predominantly in pain control and rehabilitation. Patients with neuralgic amyotrophy, can be evaluated by a wide range of clinical specialists in the early stage of disease before a correct diagnosis be made. This is a result of different phenotypes that this disorder exhibits, that complicate the diagnosis. It is important for clinicians to beware of the classic clinical manifestations that usually follow a characteristic clinical course of abrupt onset of shoulder girdle pain followed by progressive neurologic deficits as muscle weakness, amyotrophy and sensory abnormalities.

Some NMS may antedate the diagnosis of PD. Examples of NMS include cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, visual dysfunction, sleep abnormalities, and psychiatric disorders. NMS are associated with wide-ranging abnormalities in extranigral dopaminergic systems and non-dopaminergic (e.g. cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic) systems. The type and severity of NMS vary based on age, disease severity, and predominant motor symptoms. NMS can be disabling and reduce quality of life. Treatment of NMS can be challenging. Some NMS are helped by dopaminergic treatment, whereas others can be induced or exacerbated by treatments that help the motor dysfunction. Physicians should probe their PD patients about their NMS and address them for better care. Clinical trials should incorporate NMS as outcomes for more meaningful conclusions on the effect of treatments under investigation.",

Although the first sign in Parkinson disease (PD) at an early stage varies, the diagnosis of PD is often the correct one, simply by taking account of its prevalence. However, confirmation of that diagnosis takes time and serial examinations, and it is increasingly recognized that a fraction of those diagnosed with PD actually have another movement disorder and will therefore have a different neurodegenerative disease at autopsy.1 In particular, the atypical parkinsonism disorders (APDs), such as multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal syndrome, as well as vascular parkinsonism, can mimic PD at early stages of the clinical disease. These misdiagnoses are not isolated to the general neurology practice; in fact, when the presentation is unusual or early enough, even movement disorder specialists cannot discriminate between PD and APD. As a result of these diagnostic challenges, individuals can walk away thinking they have PD, when in reality a typically more aggressive condition looms in their near future.",

      "abstract": "There are no standardized diagnostic criteria for psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease (PDPsy). As part of an NIH sponsored workshop, we reviewed the existing literature on PDPsy to provide criteria that distinguish PDPsy from other causes of psychosis. Based on these data, we propose provisional criteria for PDPsy in the style of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV-TR. PDPsy has a well-characterized temporal and clinical profile of hallucinations and delusions, which is different than the pattern seen in other psychotic disorders such as substance induced psychosis or schizophrenia. PDPsy is associated with a poor prognosis of chronic psychosis, nursing home placement, and death. Medications used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) contribute to PDPsy but may not be sufficient or necessary contributors to PDPsy. PDPsy is associated with Lewy bodies pathology, imbalances of monoaminergic neurotransmitters, and visuospatial processing deficits. These findings suggest that PDPsy may result from progression of the disease process underlying PD, rather than a comorbid psychiatric disorder or drug intoxication. PDPsy is not adequately described by existing criteria for psychotic disorders. We established provisional diagnostic criteria that define a constellation of clinical features not shared by other psychotic syndromes. The criteria are inclusive and contain descriptions of the full range of characteristic symptoms, chronology of onset, duration of symptoms, exclusionary diagnoses, and associated features such as dementia. These criteria require validation and may be refined, but form a starting point for studies of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of PDPsy, and are a potential indication for therapy development.",

Much of what clinicians call apraxia is a failure of gesture production to command, due to problems of transcoding language into motor action, without motor deficit in ordinary life. However, damage to premotor regions and superior parietal lobules provokes devastating spontaneous higher-order motor deficits, including limb-kinetic apraxia, diagnostic apraxia, visuomotor apraxia and ideational apraxia.",

Such disorder is not as clearly indicated in the electroencephalogram as nondestructive, nonlethal, irritative injuries. Certain nonparoxysmal forms of electroencephalographic abnormality, for example, focal slowing, asymmetry, and altered sleep patterns, correlate fairly well with the structural damage and with the specific motor defects of cerebral palsy. The electroencephalogram is a sensitive indicator of less than lethal injury in damaged but surviving neurons, whose function is not abolished but is unstabilized. Such disorder commonly manifests itself in epileptic seizures. Although cerebral dysrhythmia and epilepsy are not the main problems in cerebral palsy, they should not be overlooked. They are related to the motor and intellectual manifestations and they are part of the total problem. Electroencephalography adds another dimension to our view of cerebral palsy. In combination with other parameters of evaluation is useful for diagnosis and prognosis and as a guide to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive age-related neurodegenerative disease affecting up to 3% of the global population over 65 years of age. Currently, the underlying physiological aetiology of PD is unknown. However, the diagnosed disorder shares many common non-motor symptoms associated with ageing-related neurodegenerative disease progression, such as neuroinflammation, microglial activation, neuronal mitochondrial impairment, and chronic autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Clinical PD has been linked to many interrelated biological and molecular processes, such as escalating proinflammatory immune responses, mitochondrial impairment, lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP) availability, increasing release of neurotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired blood brain barrier integrity, chronic activation of microglia, and damage to dopaminergic neurons consistently associated with motor and cognitive decline. Prodromal PD has also been associated with orthostatic hypotension and many other age-related impairments, such as sleep disruption, impaired gut microbiome, and constipation. Thus, this review aimed to present evidence linking mitochondrial dysfunction, including elevated oxidative stress, ROS, and impaired cellular energy production, with the overactivation and escalation of a microglial-mediated proinflammatory immune response as naturally occurring and damaging interlinked bidirectional and self-perpetuating cycles that share common pathological processes in ageing and PD. We propose that both chronic inflammation, microglial activation, and neuronal mitochondrial impairment should be considered as concurrently influencing each other along a continuum rather than as separate and isolated linear metabolic events that affect specific aspects of neural processing and brain function.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (PNH) syndromes can be subclassified as primary and secondary. The main primary PNH syndromes are neuromyotonia, cramp-fasciculation syndrome (CFS), and Morvan’s syndrome, which cause widespread symptoms and signs without the association of an evident peripheral nerve disease. Their major symptoms are muscle twitching and stiffness, which differ only in severity between neuromyotonia and CFS. Cramps, pseudomyotonia, hyperhidrosis, and some other autonomic abnormalities, as well as mild positive sensory phenomena, can be seen in several patients. Symptoms reflecting the involvement of the central nervous system occur in Morvan’s syndrome. Secondary PNH syndromes are generally seen in patients with focal or diffuse diseases affecting the peripheral nervous system. The PNH-related symptoms and signs are generally found incidentally during clinical or electrodiagnostic examinations. The electrophysiological findings that are very useful in the diagnosis of PNH are myokymic and neuromyotonic discharges in needle electromyography along with some additional indicators of increased nerve fiber excitability. Based on clinicopathological and etiological associations, PNH syndromes can also be classified as immune mediated, genetic, and those caused by other miscellaneous factors. There has been an increasing awareness on the role of voltage-gated potassium channel complex autoimmunity in primary PNH pathogenesis. Then again, a long list of toxic compounds and genetic factors has also been implicated in development of PNH. The management of primary PNH syndromes comprises symptomatic treatment with anticonvulsant drugs, immune modulation if necessary, and treatment of possible associated dysimmune and/or malignant conditions.",

      "abstract": "Neuromotorne poteskoce se definiraju kao skupina poremecaja koje ukljucuju neki od oblika ostecenja mozga i njegovog razvijanja. One mogu utjecati na motoricki, kognitivni, bihevioralni razvoj, te na razvoj govora i ucenja, sa dugorocnim posljedicama. Rana identifikacija djece sa rizikom razvijanja neuromotornih poteskoca neophodna je za rani fizioterapijski pristup. Fizioterapijska intervencija, koja ima za cilj pozitivno modificirati prirodni tijek ovih poremecaja, osigurava pocetak svoje primjene vec u prvim tjednima i/ili mjesecima života. Genetske anomalije ili kongenitalne lezije mozga, ne moraju nužno biti odgovorni za pojavu neuromotornih poteskoca kod dojencadi. Stovise, okolina i iskustvo mogu modificirati razvoj mozga i poboljsati ishod u dojencadi koja su u riziku od nastanka neuromotornih poteskoca. Ova definicija svrstava u jednu grupu sirok spektar neuroloskih problema kao sto su: autizam, poremecaj pozornosti s hiperaktivnoscu (ADHD), epilepsija i cerebralna paraliza. Cerebralna paraliza je poremecaj pokreta i položaja uzrokovan neprogresivnim ostecenjem nezrelog mozga. Posljedice ostecenja utjecu na motoricku funkciju, misicno-kostani i kognitivni razvoj. Imajuci uvid u stanje problema, trebamo uzeti u obzir da cerebralna paraliza ne predstavlja samo medicinski problem, vec i socijalni i psiholoski problem. Habilitacija djece sa neuromotornim poteskocama veoma je bitna jer ona olaksava razvoj djeteta i pridonosi boljem rezultatu terapije i kvaliteti života. U habilitaciji djeteta sa cerebralnom paralizom neizostavna je suradnja strucnjaka razlicitih profesionalnih disciplina. Djeca sa cerebralnom paralizom i drugim neuromotornim poteskocama, edukacijom roditelja i dobivanjem uputa za provođenje terapijskih programa kod kuce dobivaju vježbe kako bi im pomogle u ostvarivanju fizioterapijskih ciljeva. Primjena kucnih programa može povoljno utjecati na daljnji razvoj djeteta s poteskocama. Veoma je bitno pridržavati se programa vježbanja jer je to neophodno za postizanje razine vježbi potrebne za postizanje ciljeva. Ukoliko se kucni programi pravilno primjenjuju, mogu poboljsati grube motoricke funkcije, pokrete ruku i sake, kao i brigu o sebi, komunikaciju i ponasanje djece sa cerebralnom paralizom.",

Niemann–Pick disease is divided into types A–C. Of interest to neurologists is Niemann–Pick type C because of the association with neurological manifestations that are not confined to childhood. The clinical presentation of Niemann–Pick type C is variable, depending on age at onset. Neurological symptoms vary with age: hypotonia, delay in developmental motor milestones, falls, seizures, learning difficulties, ataxia with cognitive deficits and psychosis. The definitive diagnosis of Niemann–Pick type C requires demonstration of abnormal intracellular cholesterol trafficking using the filipin test. Therapeutic interventions are few but one that is of interest is miglustat, which has been approved for specific treatment of the neurological manifestations. It showed improvement in horizontal saccadic eye movement and a trend towards improvement or stabilisation in swallowing, hearing and walking. Niemann–Pick type C should be considered in patients with early-onset ataxia associated with progressive learning/cognitive difficulties even in the absence of vertical gaze palsy.",

      "title": "Insight in bipolar disorder",
      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Insight in bipolar disorder While the relationship between lack of insight in psychiatric disorders and anosognosia in neurological disorders has not been extensively studied, interest in examining psychiatric lack of insight has roots in advances in the understanding of the anosognosia. It is possible that both conditions share a common etiology in parietal and/or frontal lobe dysfunction, or they may represent two distinct entities with different etiologies, i.e., with predominance of brain dysfunction in anosognosia as opposed to the possible prominence of psychosocial factors in psychiatric lack of insight. While it has long been recognized that insight is impaired in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, the topic of insight in bipolar disorder has been relatively neglected. In mania, impairment of insight is about as severe as in schizophrenia and probably is associated with poor prognosis. The neuropsychological and/or psychosocial roots of lack of insight in mania remain unclear even if we recently reported that lack of insight might predict impaired decision-making in manic patients. In bipolar depression, impairment of insight is less severe than in mania; however, psychotic depression is associated with less insight than non-psychotic depression. There is some evidence that insight in depression may be less impaired when depressive symptoms are more severe, possibly supporting the depressive realism hypothesis. In remission, bipolar patients seem to recover insight. Thus, lack of insight in bipolar disorder appears to be a state-related phenomenon, unlike schizophrenia. Interest in studying clinical, neuropsychological and biological roots of insight in bipolar disorder, and their changes across different phases of illness, may improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying awareness of well-being in human.

      "abstract": "Involuntary movements become increasingly common with age and often lead to considerable disability, handicap and social embarrassment. Many causes of involuntary movements can be readily treated once the correct diagnosis is established. Getting the diagnosis right in older people is often challenging even for specialists. Even the identification of conditions thought easy to classify in younger people, such as Parkinson's disease, can be very difficult in older adults. This burden of movement disorder in older people reflects the increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative and vascular disease with age as well as the growing exposure to medication and the natural history of conditions such as essential tremor, which tend to worsen with age and precipitate medical presentation later in life. A complex and poorly understood relationship exists between motor control, disorders of mood and cognitive function. In older subjects involuntary movements are often associated with gait abnormalities and poor mobility and falls may be the presenting feature.",

      "abstract": "Progressive Myoclonus Epilepsies (PMEs) are a group of uncommon clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders characterised by myoclonus, generalized epilepsy, and neurological deterioration, including dementia and ataxia. PMEs may have infancy, childhood, juvenile or adult onset, but usually present in late childhood or adolescence, at variance from epileptic encephalopathies, which start with polymorphic seizures in early infancy. Neurophysiologic recordings are suited to describe faithfully the time course of the shock-like muscle contractions which characterize myoclonus. A combination of positive and negative myoclonus is typical of PMEs. The gene defects for most PMEs (Unverricht-Lundborg disease, Lafora disease, several forms of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, myoclonus epilepsy with ragged-red fibers [MERRF], and type 1 and 2 sialidoses) have been identified. PMEs are uncommon disorders, difficult to diagnose in the absence of extensive experience. Thus, aetiology is undetermined in many patients, despite the advance in molecular medicine. Treatment of PMEs remains essentially symptomaticof seizures and myoclonus, together with palliative, supportive, and rehabilitative measures. The response to therapy may initially be relatively favourable, afterwards however, seizures may become more frequent, and progressive neurologic decline occurs. The prognosis of a PME depends on the specific disease. The history of PMEs revealed that the international collaboration and sharing experience is the right way to proceed. This emerging picture and biological insights will allow us to find ways to provide the patients with meaningful treatment.",

Agents capable of precipitating dissociative-like states include alcohol, barbiturates and similarly acting hypnotics, benzodiazepines, scopolamine, clioquinol, β-adrenergic blockers, marijuana and certain psychedelic drugs, general anesthetics, and others. The presentations of substance-induced dissociative states may resemble those of functional dissociative disorders, or organic and psychogenic dissociative factors may coexist and be intertwined or indistinguishable. Organic dissociative states are distinct from intoxication, amnestic disorder, frank delirium, or other organic mental disorders as specified in DSM-III and DSM-III-R, yet these diagnostic manuals have no inclusive category or coherent nosological approach to dissociative states not strictly psychogenic in etiology. Substance-induced and other organic dissociative disorders can have clinical, medicolegal, and neuropsychological significance. They provide a unique opportunity for the study of mind-brain relationships and should be included in psychiatric nosology.",

      "title": "300 - Increasing Complexity Awareness of Parkinson Disease Psychosis: Risk Factors, Symptoms, Diagnosing &amp; Management",
      "abstract": "Background: After Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’ disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder globally. Approximately 1 million individuals in the United States (US) have PD; every year 60,000 more Americans are diagnosed. PD is a movement disorder caused by dopamine insufficiency in the substantia nigra. The disease process is complicated by falls, constipation, dysphagia, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and behavioral/cognitive disorders. Upon diagnosis, evidence-based symptom management should include individualized nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions along with lifestyle changes that will promote positive outcomes. More than 50% of persons diagnosed with PD develop psychotic symptoms. Parkinson’s disease psychosis (PDP) is a non-motor symptom and consists primarily of hallucinations and delusions. PDP is caused by neurotransmitter changes in the brain, some related to long-term use of parkinsonian medications. In many cases, PDP symptoms are mis-diagnosed as a chronic co-morbid condition, such as mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Symptoms run from benign to aggressive. Undiagnosed and untreated symptoms can accelerate. Delirium caused by medications or infections may contribute to psychosis. Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (REMS) Disorder associated with PD results in daytime sleepiness and acting out dreams. All symptoms profoundly impact formal and informal care partners. When underlying causes are identified by expert clinicians, symptoms may be reversible. There are many evidence-based paths to follow such as managing polypharmacy, appropriate prescribing patterns, and the effective use of nonpharmacologic interventions. Conclusion: During this symposium the complexities of the disease are addressed including the toll PDP can have on the person living with PD, their care partner(s) and the interdisciplinary health care team. It is imperative clinicians can simultaneously manage the overlapping motor symptoms and PDP to prevent physical and mental disabilities and improve quality of life. After attending this session, clinicians will be able to provide quality care to individuals living with PDP and their care partners.",

The most significant abnormality is that which is termed posthypoxic and/or postresuscitation encephalopathies whose nature has not been elucidated particularly at the cellular and molecular levels. It is emphasized that this involves brain abnormalities, which is a sequela of hypoxia or ischemia of systemic origin, rather than primary brain damages. In some patients who have sustained a severe hypoxic episode of any nature and recovered their psychoneurological status ever rapidly and rather fully, there may be an abrupt progressive deterioration of their neurological status in some days or months, which results in death or grave irreversible disability. It is concluded that not only do reparative and compensatory processes occur, but also there are phenomena of progressive degenerative changes in a primarily successfully resuscitated person or experimental animal in the central nervous system in the postresuscitation period. A classification of psychoneurological disorders in patients in the early postresuscitation period has been made and ways of their prevention or alleviation have been indicated.",

      "abstract": "The nervous system is crucial for coordinating body activities and cognitive functions. Disorders like epilepsy and Parkinson's disease significantly affect neurological health. Epilepsy is a chronic condition characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The pathophysiology involves various factors, including genetic mutations, structural brain abnormalities, and neurotransmitter imbalances. Epidemiologically, epilepsy affects about 50 million people worldwide. Symptoms range from brief lapses in attention to severe convulsions. Diagnosis is primarily through clinical history, EEG, and neuroimaging. Treatment includes antiepileptic drugs, lifestyle modifications, and in some cases, surgery. Complications can include injury during seizures, cognitive impairment, and social stigma. Prevention involves managing risk factors like head injuries and infections. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The pathophysiology involves the accumulation of Lewy bodies and a decrease in dopamine production, leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. Epidemiologically, Parkinson’s disease affects about 1% of the population over 60. Symptoms include tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Non-motor symptoms can include depression, sleep disturbances, and cognitive decline. Diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation, with imaging and response to dopaminergic therapy aiding in confirmation. Treatment focuses on symptomatic relief through medications like levodopa, dopamine agonists, and MAO-B inhibitors. Advanced cases may benefit from deep brain stimulation. Complications include worsening motor function, cognitive decline, and increased risk of falls. Prevention strategies are limited but may include lifestyle factors like regular exercise and a healthy diet to support overall brain health.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease affecting 1-2% of the population over 60. Although diagnosed by its characteristic motor manifestations, PD may be preceded, and is frequently accompanied, by a wide range of psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. These symptoms are often more debilitating than its motor complications and it is nowadays appreciated that they can be an important cause of excess disability in PD, frequently necessitating hospitalization and institutionalization. Despite their frequent occurrence, most PD-related neuropsychiatric symptoms remain under-recognized and undertreated in clinical practice and their diagnosis is challenging because of the overlap of the somatic features of the psychiatric disorders and the motor symptoms of PD. Even when identified, there is a common perception that many of these symptoms are untreatable. Their recognition is essential not only for ascertaining the functional status of patients but also for better appreciating the nature of the neurodegenerative process in PD. These symptoms may precede the onset of motor symptoms and can be used as screening tools allowing for very early disease identification and for trials of possible diseasemodifying interventions. The pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD involves complex and multifactorial mechanisms, including disease-related and psychological factors. Alterations in neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, involving subcortical projections and synaptic and neuronal changes involving limbic and cortical structures combine to result in these nonmotor symptoms. Potentially earlier evaluation and treatment of comorbid psychiatric and cognitive disorders in PD could improve quality of life and patient productivity, reduce morbidity and caregiver burden, and minimize healthcare costs. Management strategies include adjustment of dopaminergic medication, use of psychotropic treatments and behavioral and psychological interventions. Dopaminergic medication may precipitate neuropsychiatric conditions, such as the dopamine dysregulation syndrome. The choice of psychotropic medication for the neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD is determined by a balance between potential benefit versus side effects, mostly in terms of worsening motor symptoms. Furthermore, treatments used in general psychiatry services may not be as effective in PD. This article provides an overview and focuses on the neuropsychiatric manifestations in PD including depression, anxiety, psychosis, apathy and fatigue, personality, sexual dysfunction, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment and dementia, impulse control disorders and related behaviours. The epidemiology, pathophysiology and risk factors, clinical presentation and management of the most common neuropsychiatric complications in PD are discussed.",

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a stage where people have the early neuropathology of dementia, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD), but do not have sufficient symptoms to fulfil current clinical criteria. Transition to dementia is frequent, raising questions as to whether this is a new nosology or the earliest diagnosable point of the more common neurodegenerative disorders.",

      "abstract": "This review focuses on the differentiation of schizophrenia in the setting of adult psychiatry from neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD's) and psychosis due to other medical conditions (PDMC). Psychotic disorders in early adulthood are most frequently diagnosed with the schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders. However, they may be the manifestation of neurologic, endocrine or immunologic disease. Individuals with NDD's such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) may also present initially in adulthood. Therefore it is not uncommon that the psychiatrist is the first physician to assess a psychotic patient with underlying medical illness or a NDD. Failure to identify the underlying cause will delay appropriate management. Overdiagnosis of primary psychiatric disorders may be misleading in planning the treatment, as evidence-based treatment algorithms relevant to psychosis are intended for primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, and symptomatic treatment may result in unnecessary exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Exclusion of other medical conditions and NDD's is essential before establishing a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

The immunological etiology is assumed. In diagnostics estimation of level of the antionconeuronal antibodies may be helpful. Mental disorders in the course of paraneoplastic syndrome may coexist with neoplasm, but also may precede it (combined with neurological signs or without them). Such mental disorders have diverse clinical pictures and often are characterized by atypical and heavy course. Observed psychopathological symptoms do not form any specific diagnostic profile delineated in ICD 10 and encompass disturbances of consciousness, perception and thinking, as well as affective states. Although psychiatric intervention in paraneoplastic syndromes with psychopathological symptoms is merely symptomatic, one can still expect atypical response. Suspected paraneoplastic syndrome in patients not yet diagnosed as having neoplasm should persuade one to initiate a screening for potential focal change and to introduce targeted treatment should tumor growth be confirmed.",

Clinically cutaneous, osseous, and arthropathic symptoms prevail, often for years. The process underlying the sensory neuropathies, however, obviously is a primary neurologic one. Preliminarily we discriminate true hereditary forms of the types I and II, so-called sporadic forms (presumably hidden hereditary = ,,idiopathic\"), and well-defined symptomatic forms, e.g. sequelae of alcohol abuse or malabsorption, diabetes, certain intoxications or leprosy. The variable clinical picture frequently and typically begins with dissociated sensible losses at one extremity taking an altogether torpid course that easily escapes attention. Rarely specific associated symptoms and combinations with Friedreich's ataxia, peroneal muscular atrophy, and kindred disorders are diagnosed. The progressing disease first involves non-myelinated and small-calibrated myelinated fibres which explains part of the clinical symptomatology. Microscopically in typical cases primary axonal changes beginning distally and ascending in non-myelinated fibres are striking. The neuropathologic parameters in the spinal animal ganglia, the dorsal root entrance zone or inside the myelon are scarcely studied in more detail and therefore little known up to now. Authoritative investigations of the sympathetic chain or of vegetative spinal elements are lacking. Demonstrable is among others a raised shunt blood flow which apparently is responsible for the worsening of nutrition.",

      "abstract": "Early infantile autism is the most severe of a group of neurodevelopmental syndromes called the pervasive developmental disorders. The clinical features of autism vary greatly, but, by definition, include deficits in social relatedness, communication, and interests or routines. The onset of autistic signs and behaviors typ ically occurs in infancy, and the syndrome is usually fully present by the fourth year. The presence of mental retardation affects the clinical picture greatly. Severely autistic children may be retarded and mute and are often preoccupied with repetitive activities; they often exhibit motor stereotypes, such as rocking or hand flapping. They can be profoundly withdrawn and may show extreme aversion to social or physical contact. More mildly affected children may have normal or even superior intelligence, with well-developed language skills. Their deficits in social relatedness and preoccupation with rituals and routines may set them apart as very odd, but not necessarily as autistic. Autism occurs in 1 of 2000 live births; boys outnumber girls about 3 or 4:1. Although there are no localizing neurological signs in autism, mild or \"soft\" neurological signs are common and grand mal seizures are frequently present after puberty (Lotspeich LJ, Ciaranello RD.

It differs also in increased numbers of PrP positive plaques being present in brain tissue, and not having a characteristic EEG. Multi-system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, dentatopallido-luysian atrophy, Huntington's disease, olivopontocerebellar atrophy, and motor neurone disease, are slowly progressive degenerations that have focal neurological features of either autonomic failure, failure of voluntary gaze, chorea, cerebellar features, or progressive muscular atrophy with spasticity related to the primary area of involvement. All but the latter tend to have features of parkinsonism in addition. The dementia that accompanies these disorders tends to be of the sub-cortical type. No reliable test allows the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus to be made with certainty, and treatment usually involves a CSF shunt. Spinocerebellar degeneration and familial spastic paraparesis are rare hereditary disorders that may also show a dementia in addition to the more obvious focal neurological signs. Cortico-basal degeneration is somewhat unique in having a presentation with dyspraxia that is often unilateral. Parkinsonism and a subcortical dementia eventually occur. Progressive subcortical gliosis and dementia lacking specific histological features produce a subcortical or frontal dementia respectively.",

En la enfermedad de Parkinson hay pacientes con deficit cognitivo aislado y multiple y el rendimiento cognitivo forma un abanico que va desde la normalidad hasta un avanzado grado de demencia. La mayoria de los enfermos presenta un deficit ejecutivo, aislado o combinado con otras alteraciones cognitivas, que se considera lo mas caracteristico de la enfermedad, y un 30-40% de afectados acabara presentando una demencia clinicamente definida. Desarrollo. La presencia de alteracion cognitiva leve en los enfermos parkinsonianos significa la existencia de un riesgo elevado de aparicion de demencia en el transcurso de la enfermedad. La demencia asociada con enfermedad de Parkinson esta especificamente relacionada con sintomatologia neuropsiquiatrica, que puede tener tres posibles explicaciones: alteracion de vias mesolimbicas, alteracion cortical y limbica difusa, o fenomenologia de tipo Alzheimer asociada. Los episodios psicoticos se presentan preferentemente en los pacientes con tratamiento dopaminergico y el espectro clinico de la psicosis parkinsoniana abarca: ilusiones visuales, alucinaciones visuoaudioolfatorias, delirio y psicosis alucinatoria paranoide grave. Todos los farmacos antiparkinsonianos pueden provocar alucinaciones y psicosis, pero los agonistas dopaminergicos detentan la mayor capacidad. Conclusiones. En el manejo de esta problematica es muy importante la prevencion y el diagnostico y tratamiento tan pronto hagan aparicion. Han de disminuirse las dosis de antiparkinsonianos, aunque ello no suele ser suficiente, por lo que habra que asociar antipsicoticos atipicos, que actuen preferentemente sobre receptores 5-HT y no produzcan bloqueo D2, la mayoria de las veces.",

      "title": "Classification of Immune-Mediated Neuropathies",
      "abstract": "Neuropathies of peripheral nerves may be classified according to various criteria. The most important classification is the one according to the etiology, which differentiates between acquired or inherited forms. Among the acquired and hereditary neuropathies further subdivision has been proposed. Acquired and hereditary neuropathies are classified according to the course as acute or chronic. Acquired and hereditary neuropathies may be accompanied by involvement of other systems/organs/tissues or not. The latter are further classified according to the degree of co-affection of other organs or tissues as dominant or non-dominant. In non-dominant cases, neuropathy is overshadowed by manifestations of other organs. The course may be chronic progressive or relapsing remitting (Tangier's disease, porphyrias). Progressive neuropathies may be slowly or rapidly progressive. According to the number of affected nerves, mononeuropathies and polyneuropathies (PNPs) are distinguished. Among PNPs those with uniform affection of all nerves and those with predominant affection of several single nerves (multiplex neuropathy) are differentiated. PNPs are further classified according to the distribution as symmetric or asymmetric and as proximal or distal. Furthermore, neuropathies of the cranial nerves and the peripheral nerves are delineated. According to the direction of progression neuropathies can be ascending or descending. According to the types of nerve fibers affected they may be classified as motor, sensory, autonomic, or mixed neuropathies. According to the size of affected fibers, large- and small-fiber neuropathies (LFNs, SFNs) are delineated. Upon electrophysiological findings, axonal, demyelinating (with or without conduction block), or mixed neuropathies are differentiated. According to the prevalence, they may be classified as frequent or infrequent (rare). Neuropathies can be painful or painless. Neuropathies can be length-dependent (i.e. distal, the longer the more severe, dying-back), which is the case for most of the neuropathies, or length-independent. Lastly, neuropathies may have an infantile/childhood onset or may have an onset in adolescence/adulthood. Some neuropathies may be accessible to treatment, others may not.",

However, although it is relatively rare to see cases of peripheral neuropathy that have dramatic signs, such as tetraplegia, a large number of animals are presented at small animal practices with a variety of other clinical signs caused by disease of the peripheral nervous system. In common with other neurological disorders, a systematic approach is required to categorise each case of peripheral neuropathy so that appropriate tests or treatment can be carried out. A complete aetiological diagnosis is not always possible because the cause of some of the most common peripheral neuropathies is not known. Furthermore, treatment options are limited. Nevertheless, for many animals affected by this group of diseases the prognosis is good.",

Neither does the claim that all mental disorders are brain disorders follow from a materialist world-view. The only plausible way of understanding mental disorders as brain disorders is a fairly modest one, where we label brain differences we find in mental illness as pathological based on their link to mental dysfunction. How many mental disorders will turn out to be brain disorders on this understanding is an empirical question.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease has been described by James Parkinson and is called shaking palsy. Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder with features of a disease that destroys specific neurons responsible for the release of dopamine, an important substance in the brain. It is a progressive and disabling disease in which there is a loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra with decreased dopamine. Acetylcholine has an excitatory effect, whereas dopamine is inhibitory. Both are found richly in the striated body. Parkinsonism, on the other hand, has its symptoms resulting from the imbalance between these two systems. It is a neurodegenerative disease that mainly affects the basal ganglia, specifically the dopaminergic system. Although clinically characterized by the motor symptoms of resting tremor, bradykinesia and asymmetric stiffness, Parkinson's disease today also includes non-motor symptoms caused by dysfunction of multiple neuronal populations. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, after Alzheimer's dementia, affecting 1-2% of the population over 60/65 years in different countries. Although no risk factors are clearly identified except for age, the etiology of the disease remains unknown. With the use of bodybuilding activity after 12 months, a significant improvement in gait of the individual in question was observed. Gait that has compromised the sinister side and generates a “circumference” to achieve foot elevation at the beginning of the gait, lost this circumference and generated significant knee extension, which contributed to the improvement of gait. Therefore, it is concluded that lower limb weight training exercises contribute to the improvement of gait in individuals with Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "Neurologists frequently see patients with symptoms or inconsistent signs that are not explicable in terms of any recognized neurological disease process. Often it is clear that such symptoms and signs are being manufactured psychologically, either consciously or, more often, by an unconscious process. Such patients are frequently polysymptomatic, and may have a long history of consulting other specialists, particularly abdominal, dental, gynaecological, and otorhinological surgeons. They run the risk of developing secondary abnormalities induced by surgical and other invasive procedures. Psychologically determined symptoms are a very common cause of neurological out-patient referral. Of those with psychogenic disorders, pain is the commonest symptom, followed by motor symptoms, gait disturbances, dizziness, blackouts, sensory symptoms, and visual dysfunction (Lempert et al. 1990). Depressive and anxiety disorders are twice as common in those with psychologically determined disorders and those with emotional disorders have a greater number of somatic symptoms but are unenthusiastic about psychiatric treatment. Clinical syndromes including Briquet’s syndrome, hypochondriasis, conversion disorder, body dysmorphic disorder and pain disorders are explained and described. The presentation and characteristics of malingering (a process of deliberate deceit, in which symptoms are fabricated) is described, including Munchausen’s syndrome. In addition, associated psychiatric states and the symptoms and physical signs of psychologically determined disorders are discussed. Finally, the management and prognosis of psychologically determined states are outlined.",

      "title": "Substance P and its tachykinin NK1 receptor: a novel neuroprotective target for Parkinson′s disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common motor neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 4 million people worldwide. Although PD presents primarily with motor dysfunction, non-motor symptoms including cognitive decline, mood disorders, reduced olfaction and constipation are also often present, with some of these non-motor symptoms even presenting prior to the onset of motor symptoms. It is well known that PD is largely caused by the gradual degeneration of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), along with the presence of protein aggregates called Lewy bodies, which consist primarily of α-synuclein and are found in the cytoplasm of surviving neurons. This ongoing cell loss and Lewy body pathology is not confined to the SNc, but is also seen in other brain regions implicated in PD pathogenesis such as the locus ceruleus. Nonetheless, the cause of cell death in PD still remains somewhat elusive. Numerous secondary cell injury cascades have been linked to this progressive dopaminergic cell death, including inflammation, blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Despite this, current PD treatment does not protect dopaminergic neurons but rather provides symptomatic benefit by replacing lost striatal dopamine (DA) either directly or by preventing its breakdown. The “gold-standard” treatment for PD is L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), the precursor to DA, combined with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor such as benseraside. Since its inception as a PD therapeutic over 50 years ago, L-DOPA has primarily been administered in a pulsatile manner. This type of L-DOPA delivery results in maladaptive changes to brain signaling pathways and expression of L-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID), or involuntary abnormal movements. Unfortunately, all patients will develop LID at some stage throughout their treatment, which they often find much more debilitating than the motor symptoms they presented with at diagnosis. Current research is thus focused on developing novel neuroprotective therapies that aim to treat the underlying cause of the disease, as well discovering possible adjunct therapies to L-DOPA that inhibit the expression of LID without interfering with L-DOPA motor improvement. Our recent studies have identified the neuropeptide substance P (SP) and its tachykinin NK1 receptor (NK1-R) as novel neuroprotective targets for both ongoing dopaminergic degeneration and mild to moderate LID. Thus treatment with an NK1-R antagonist may provide a new PD therapeutic that shows particular efficacy in the early stages of PD and LID (Thornton and Vink, 2012; Thornton et al., 2014). Substance P and NK1-R are widely expressed throughout the peripheral and central nervous systems in primary sensory neurons or C-fibers, as well as on endothelial cells and inflammatory cells. They are expressed in particularly high levels within the SNc where SP-containing striatal projection neurons synapse with dopaminergic neurons to potentiate the release of striatal DA, normal levels of which are required for proper motor function. It is the death of dopaminergic neurons and the subsequent loss of dopaminergic drive in this system that results in the loss of nigral SP expression seen post-mortem, and in experimental models of PD where near total degeneration of dopaminergic neurons occurs. This contrasts to early PD where remaining dopamine neurons can maintain striatal DA levels. At this time, nigral SP expression is unaffected or even increased. Indeed in our studies, SP expression was elevated following treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in vitro, with a significant correlation between SP levels and cell death (Thornton et al., 2010). Similarly, SP expression was increased in rodents following intratstriatal injections of 6-OHDA as early as day 3 in the striatum and substantia nigra, which was prior to the onset of dopaminergic degeneration that began around day 7 post-lesion (Thornton and Vink, 2012). Moreover when intrastriatal 6-OHDA injections were combined with endogenous SP treatment, significantly greater dopaminergic degeneration and further loss of motor function was seen compared to vehicle treated animals. In contrast, combination treatment of an NK1-R antagonist with 6-OHDA prevented the increase in SP seen at day 21 post-6-OHDA, and protected dopaminergic neurons and improved motor function. These results suggest that SP may be important in the early stages of PD pathogenesis. This early increase of SP expression in PD may not only be due to a greater release from striatal projection neurons to maintain striatal DA levels, but may also be due to dopaminergic degeneration initiating neurogenic inflammation, a neurally elicited local inflammatory response. Neurogenic inflammation occurs in the setting of injury or inflammation, both of which are present in PD, and results in the release of SP and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from C-fibers surrounding blood vessels. Calcitonin gene-related peptide, a potent vasodilator, facilitates recruitment of inflammatory mediators, whereas SP binds to NK1-R on endothelial cells of cerebral microvasculature to increase BBB permeability. Normally, the structure of the BBB confers low paracellular permeability because of specialized endothelial cells with low pinocytotic activity, and expression of interendothelial adheren and tight junctional proteins such as cadherins, claudins, occludin and junctional adhesion molecules. This structural arrangement ensures that the passage of substances through the cerebral microvasculature is highly controlled, which is vital to maintain neuronal homeostasis (Hawkins and Davis, 2005). Consequently, dysfunction of the BBB stimulates an unfavorable neuronal environment due to the presence of normally excluded proteins, ions, toxins, metals and cells. Increased permeability of the BBB has been observed in clinical and animal models of PD with decreased expression of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein and increased extravasation of the serum protein albumin being reported (Kortekaas et al., 2005; Pisani et al., 2012). Whether these changes are due to increased protein transport or loss of structural proteins like claudin-5 or occludin remains to be elucidated. Of interest for PD pathogenesis is that the barrier is particularly weak surrounding the cerebral microvasculature of the substantia nigra, with dopaminergic neurons seeming to be more vulnerable to experimentally induced barrier dysfunction than other neuronal populations (Rite et al., 2007). This may be due to the increased basal level of oxidative stress in the SNc from the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during normal DA metabolism, as oxidative stress can in itself induce BBB dysfunction and has been strongly linked to dopaminergic cell death. It is this abnormally high level of oxidative stress in the substantia nigra that has been attributed to the increased albumin to cerebrospinal fluid ratio seen in the healthy elderly compared to the young and healthy population. Therefore in PD, where age is the greatest risk factor, the BBB may, in part, already to be functioning incorrectly. This means that only minor changes to the cerebral environment are required to induce further impairment of the barrier and subsequent dopaminergic cell loss. BBB dysfunction is also thought to contribute to LID by facilitating the uncontrolled entry of L-DOPA from the blood into the brain parenchyma resulting in fluctuating endogenous DA levels. Interestingly, administration of L-DOPA re-instates the dopaminergic drive in the SP-DA positive feedback regulation, increasing nigral SP expression back to normal levels. In doing so, endogenous SP is once again available to induce barrier breakdown. Indeed, L-DOPA treatment has been observed to increase barrier permeability to albumin (Westin et al., 2006). Apart from a direct ability to increase BBB permeability through neurogenic inflammation, SP is also involved in angiogenesis. Formation of new blood vessels with immature BBB properties has been observed in experimental LID (Westin et al., 2006). Due to the lack of an effective barrier on these vessels, L-DOPA delivery to the brain is unregulated causing fluctuating endogenous DA levels and LID. Confirmation that SP may be involved in the onset of LID was first reported in our studies where NK-1R antagonist treatment prevented the onset of mild to moderate LID (Thornton et al., 2014). Although the exact mechanism of this protection was not studied, the reduced FosB levels suggested regulation of the D1-mediated basal ganglia signaling pathway and prevention of the maladaptive changes. This could have been partially due to the NK1-R antagonist stabilizing the barrier, resulting in regulated delivery of DA to striatal projections neurons (Thornton et al., 2014). This role for SP in the onset of LID was recently confirmed by Yang et al. (2015), who showed treatment with an NK1-R antagonist reduced LID in 6-OHDA lesioned rodents by preventing DA efflux and the subsequent increase in secondary messenger systems, Arc and Penk (Yang et al., 2015). Importantly, both studies confirmed that administration of the NK1-R antagonist did not interfere with L-DOPA induced improvement in motor function. This augurs well for the use of NK1-R antagonists as a novel adjunct therapy to L-DOPA in the treatment of PD. Along with its effects on endothelial cells and BBB permeability, SP can also directly interact with inflammatory cells by binding to NK1-R expressed on microglia, astrocytes and leukocytes resulting in mast cell degranulation and cytokine production. Interestingly, histamine, which is released during mast cell degranulation, has been associated with BBB breakdown and the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (Liu et al., 2007). Inflammatory processes in PD are unfortunately self-perpetuating with dying neurons activating the resident immune cells, including microglia. In turn, microglia produce high levels of ROS including superoxide, reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in further degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. This results in a vicious cycle of ongoing cell death and chronic inflammation. Indeed chronic activation of microglia has been visualized using positron emission tomography in the midbrain of PD patients and is a consistent feature in animal models of PD. Inflammatory processes are exacerbated in PD by the infiltration of peripheral immune cells such as T-lymphocytes, which are able to enter through the dysfunctional barrier and release pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby further activating resident immune cells. Indeed, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells have been observed within the SN in both the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD and at postmortem, with CD4+ T cells linked to MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration (Brochard et al., 2009). The release of pro-inflammatory factors from either resident or peripheral immune cells may also directly increase BBB permeability by changing the expression of tight junction proteins (as reviewed by Hawkins and Davis, 2005) thereby allowing further infiltration of unwanted substances that could influence neurodegeneration. These results suggest that BBB dysfunction and inflammation work in concert to exacerbate ongoing dopaminergic cell death. Our own studies examining the relationship between BBB dysfunction and inflammatory processes in the 6-OHDA intrastriatal model of PD have confirmed their association with dopaminergic cell death (Thornton and Vink, 2012). In these studies, progressive dopaminergic degeneration was associated with both albumin extravasation and increased numbers of resident inflammatory cells, with both barrier disruption and activated microglia peaking at day 14 post-lesion coincident with significant dopaminergic degeneration. Treatment with an NK1-R antagonist prevented the albumin extravasation, and was accompanied by a reduction in inflammation. Although peripheral immune cell infiltration was not directly measured in this study, ED-1, a marker of phagocytotic cells including activated microglia and peripheral blood-borne macrophages, was assessed. NK1-R antagonist treatment did cause a reduction in the number of nigral ED-1 positive cells, which could represent a reduction in the direct activation of microglia and/or prevention of peripheral blood-borne macrophage recruitment due to restoration of BBB integrity. In summary, SP-induced neurogenic inflammation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD, including LID, by increasing BBB permeability and subsequent peripheral immune cell infiltration, as well as activation of resident immune cells (Figure 1). These injury cascades not only directly contribute to the ongoing neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD but can also exacerbate other secondary injury mechanisms such as oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment with an NK1-R antagonist attenuated the progression of PD and significantly reduced the onset of LID, presumably by inhibiting multifactorial injury mechanisms involving SP and NK1-R. Blocking the effects of SP with a NK1-R antagonist therefore presents a potentially promising new avenue for neuroprotection in PD.Figure 1: Mechanisms by which SP-induced neurogenic inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.SP is released from C-fibers surrounding substantia nigra cerebral microvasculature and from striatal projection neurons. SP binds to NK1-R on endothelial cells to increase BBB permeability, or to microglia causing a release of pro-inflammtory cytokines and ROS/RNS. This is turn can further increase BBB permeability, but also directly causes dopaminergic degeneration. The increase in BBB permeability allows T-lymphocyte infiltration, which promotes further activation of microglia and cytokine release.

Najcesca stanja koja pogađaju stariju dobnu skupinu su povezana sa srcem i krvožilnim sustavom: hipertenzija i ateroskleroza, u gorim slucajevima infarkt; zatim, veliki je problem dijabetes, promjene u lokomotornom sustavu i sklonost padovima i frakturama.

U europskim zemljama zdravstveni pregled je obavezan za starije vozace (Spanjolska, Velika Britanija, Svedska, Norveska), a jedino u Njemackoj je odgovornost o zdravstvenoj sposobnosti povjerena odabranom lijecniku vozaca.

Underneath the umbrella of these common symptoms many invisible, unpredictable and erratic symptoms persists which complicates both the clinical presentation and the treatment. As majority of these symptoms are subjective so their true assessment on objective ground is difficult. It is important to consider that patients with MS and their care-takers should have reasonable knowledge about these symptoms because if these symptoms go unidentified or untreated then they may lead to a difficult diagnostic dilemma hence complicates further management. The frequency and severity of these unusual symptoms at times raise a suspicion of other neurological diseases. The occurrence of any of these symptoms at times may be a sign of active disease.",

All of the clinical studies show poor cognitive performance during migraine attacks, though, the interictal data are conflicting. Migraineurs show impaired cognitive function interictally in most of the clinic-based studies. Population-based studies did not reveal a difference in cognitive functions between migraineurs and controls. The specific cognitive domains involved are information processing speed, basic attention, executive functions, verbal and non-verbal memory and verbal skills. Neurophysiological, imaging and pharmacological studies support clinical symptoms of cognitive impairment in migraine. Longitudinal studies do not suggest progressive cognitive decline over time in migraine patients. Preventive medications and comorbid disorders such as depression and anxiety can impact cognitive function, but cannot fully explain the cognitive impairment in migraine. In contrast to migraine, tension type or cluster headache are not associated with cognitive impairment, at least during headache-free periods.",

Medications, neurosurgical procedures, and non-phamiacologic interventions are quite effective in controlling symptoms. While electrophysiology has a limited role at present in the diagnosis of PD, certain abnormalities are revealed on testing. These include mild background slowing of the EEG, delayed movement-related mu dropout, low amplitude sensory and motor event-related cortical potentials, and subtle autonomic impairments.

      "abstract": "Purpose of review To critically discuss the neuropsychiatric symptoms in the prodromal stages of dementia in order to improve the early clinical diagnosis of cognitive and functional deterioration. Recent findings Current criteria for cognitive syndrome, including Alzheimer’s disease, comprise the neuropsychiatric symptoms in addition to cognitive and functional decline. Although there is growing evidence that neuropsychiatric symptoms may precede the prodromal stages of dementia, these manifestations have received less attention than traditional clinical hallmarks such as cognitive and functional deterioration. Depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, agitation, sleep disorders, among other symptoms, have been hypothesized to represent a prodromal stage of dementia or, at least, they increase the risk for conversion from minor neurocognitive disorder to major neurocognitive disorder. Longitudinal investigations have provided increased evidence of progression to dementia in individuals with minor neurocognitive disorder when neuropsychiatric symptoms also were present. Summary Although neuropsychiatric symptoms are strongly associated with a higher risk of cognitive and functional deterioration, frequently the clinician does not acknowledge these conditions as increasing the risk of dementia. When the clinician accurately diagnoses neuropsychiatric symptoms in the prodromal stage of dementia, he could early establish appropriate treatment and, may be, delay the beginning of clinical and functional deterioration.",

      "title": "Psychosis in Dementia",
      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, are rather common at all stages of dementia. The concept of psychosis in dementia (PiD) is elusive, and the symptomatology may overlap with cognitive symptoms, delirium and other neuropsychiatric symptoms such as agitation and depression. Even though associations between biological markers and the occurrence of PiD exist, no clear causal factor has been identified. Also psychosocial and environmental factors may play a role in increasing the risk of PiD. Rather few treatment trials have focused specifically on PiD. As for other types of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia, non-pharmacological options should be the first-line treatment strategy. The evidence for the effects of psychotropic drugs in the treatment of PiD is weak. The best available evidence is for the short-term use of antipsychotic drugs. However, these drugs are associated with a number of serious adverse events, so the treatment needs to be monitored carefully. There is reason to believe that PiD defines a more severe phenotype of dementia, in terms of more rapid disease progression and greater dependency. Efforts to prevent or diminish these symptoms may benefit the patients and their caregivers considerably.",

      "title": "Atypical forms of motor neuron disease: a review of the problem and clinical cases",
      "abstract": "Atypical forms of motor neuron disease represent a rare and diverse group of neurodegenerative disorders that differ from classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in terms of clinical presentation, genetic background, neuroimaging features, progression rate, and distribution of motor involvement. Diagnostic criteria of these variants include onset at a young or middle age, restriction to a specific anatomical region (bulbar or spinal), exclusive involvement of either the upper or lower motor neuron, the degree of motor neuron degeneration, absence of specific neuroimaging phenomena in certain subtypes, frequent association with other neurological symptoms (e.g., dystonia, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment), and slow progression. Depending on the predominant site of involvement, this pathology can be divided into two major categories: affecting the upper and lower motor neuron. The first group includes primary lateral sclerosis and Mills syndrome. The lower motor neuron group comprises a broader and more heterogeneous spectrum, including progressive bulbar palsy, progressive muscular atrophy, facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy syndrome, flail arm syndrome, Hirayama disease (monomelic amyotrophy), O’Sullivan-McLeod syndrome, flail leg syndrome, and finger extension weakness and downbeat nystagmus motor neuron disease. A concise clinical characterization of each variant is provided. This article describes original clinical cases of two atypical motor neuron disease variants, i.e. O’Sullivan-McLeod syndrome and flail leg syndrome, analyzed in the context of a comprehensive literature review. Both cases, characterized by lower (peripheral) motor neuron involvement, underscore the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and the complexity of the diagnostic process, illustrating the necessity of a broad, multimodal diagnostic approach and emphasizing the importance of dynamic patient monitoring. In such scenarios, time itself becomes a key diagnostic factor.",

In ideomotor apraxia the execution of simple and complex, meaningful and meaningless movements with the orofacial musculature and/or with the limbs, is impaired in a very distinct way, as has been described in detail. The parapraxic distortions of movements occur, when the movement is required out of context. The recognition of movements and gestures is intact. In ideational apraxia, in contrast, there is a disturbance in the conceptual organization of complex actions requiring the use of various objects. The syndrome is observed already in the spontaneous behaviour of the patients. There are indications that these patients are also impaired in the recognition of actions.",

The visual impairments also affect the patients' motor skills, as vision compensates for poor postural control and difficulty initiating movement. It is important to identify common but frequently underdiagnosed visual impairment, and initiate measures that can increase quality of life and pattern of movement.

Accurate diagnosis is essential to guide management, in particular, treatment options, any genetic implications, and prognosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the family prototype and is a diffuse neurodegenerative disorder characterized by both upper and lower motor neuron cell death, causing progressive paralysis of limb, bulbar (speech and swallowing) and respiratory muscles, and resulting in death from respiratory failure. The cardinal clinical feature of combined upper and lower motor neuron signs in various body regions (bulbar, arms, trunk, legs) forms the basis for diagnostic criteria. There is no cure and the disease progresses relentlessly, with few patients surviving beyond 5 years from symptom onset.",

      "abstract": "Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS), which is characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and tendon areflexia, is generally considered as a clinical variant of Guillain-Barré Syndrome. However some features of the disease are still debated, particularly regarding possible central nervous system involvement. After presenting two new cases of MFS, the authors provide a critical review of the literature and discuss the nosographical position of the disease. The main conclusions can be summarized as follows: MFS is a predominantly axonal inflammatory neuropathy with prevailing involvement of oculomotor nerves. It is associated to spinal multi or polyneuropathy, which in mildly affected cases is manifested by areflexia, while in severe ones it can be responsible of sense and/or motor impairment. In addition to peripheral neuropathy CNS involvement, exclusive or more marked in posterior fossa, occurs not infrequently. The prognosis of the disease is often benign, but disabling or even fatal outcome is possible. Corticosteroid treatment, possibly because of antiinflammatory and/or immunosuppressive action, could be effective in some patients. Finally, in spite of some similarities with GBS, MFS should be considered as a separate entity with its own nosographical position.",

      "title": "Epilepsy in children and anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy, also called seizure disorder, is the most common childhood brain disorder in the United States. The aetiology of epilepsy in children is multifactorial with congenital, metabolic, infective, and problems associated with prematurity being common causes. Nearly 3 million Americans have epilepsy. About 450,000 of them are under 17 years old. About 1 in 200 children (0.5%) have epilepsy, a neurological condition where children have a predisposition to recurrent, unprovoked seizures. There are many different types of epilepsy, especially in infancy, childhood and adolescence. Epilepsy can be thought of in terms of either: the site of seizure origin in the brain (generalised or focal seizures), or the underlying cause. Genetic epilepsies (formerly called idiopathic or primary epilepsies) occur in an otherwise normal person and are due to a genetic predisposition to seizures. Some epilepsies are due to an underlying abnormality of the brain structure or chemistry (formerly called symptomatic or secondary epilepsies). Other epilepsies have no known cause. Epilepsy is commonly diagnosed in children and can be confused with other conditions. An accurate diagnosis is essential. A seizure is an excessive surge of electrical activity in the brain that can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on which parts of the brain are involved. Seizures can be provoked or unprovoked. Provoked seizures, caused by fever in a young child or severe hypoglycemia, are not considered to be forms of epilepsy. Unprovoked seizures have no clear cause but can be related to genetics or brain injury. When a child has two or more unprovoked seizures, epilepsy is often the diagnosis. Despite advances in antiepileptic medication therapy, a significant number of pediatric patients with epilepsy have seizures that are not well controlled. Antiepileptic medications interact with anesthetic agents, and common anesthetics can precipitate or suppress seizure activity. There are important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between AEDs and drugs commonly used in anaesthesia. These affect both drug efficacy and the risk of seizure activity intraoperatively.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT The progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PME) are rare diseases and many clinicians, who have only few opportunities to encounter such patients, may think of them as mythical. However, the category of PME has been retained by the latest classification scheme proposal of the International League Against Epilepsy. PMEs are defined by: 1) generalized epileptic seizures (focal seizures may also occur in certain etiologies), 2) a sometimes invalidating myoclonus, and 3) other neurological symptoms (ataxia, dementia, sensory deficits) that vary according to etiology. Indeed, PMEs are a heterogenous group of conditions, with diverse etiologies. Their prevalence varies according to the ethnic context, and PMEs may appear as fairly frequent in some settings, because of genetic factors (isolate and/or inbreeding, for instance, in PMEs with recessive inheritance). The genetic and biochemical mechanisms underlying PMEs are increasingly recognized. We must nowadays follow a logical diagnostic scheme that will take into account the ethnic and genetic context, the age at onset of symptoms and the respective weight of symptoms. New therapeutic approaches are under development, and the available purely symptomatic treatments can be used to best possible effect. It is thus possible to recognize PMEs as a group of conditions appearing either as epilepsy, or as a movement disorder, or still under the mask of various neurological or cognitive symptoms. It is also possible to organize a logical, comprehensive care for patients with PME.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are undesirable physical events or experiences associated with sleep. Episodes are usually classified according the stage of sleep during or from which they occur. Non-rapid eye movement (NREM) parasomnias occur from deep NREM sleep and often involve complex behaviours that may appear purposeful but are not conscious or under deliberate control. There are a number of different types/presentations of NREM parasomnias. These may range from common manifestations such as sleeptalking, sleepwalking or night terrors, to the rarer sleep-related eating disorder or sexsomnia. Clinical features can facilitate the differential diagnosis, but polysomnography may be needed, particularly to assess potential concomitant sleep disorders that might represent precipitating factors. Medical treatment is often not indicated, but clonazepam or antidepressants may be used in more severe cases. Safety aspects, treating concomitant sleep disorders and avoiding trigger factors are key aspects of management.",

      "abstract": "The overarching concept of cerebral palsy involves several different definitions; it is as group of unprogressive and often changing motor disturbance syndromes caused by brain injury or developmental disorder in early stages of development as a result of premature or severe birth, neonatal complications such as infection or hypoxia, and brain trauma. Cerebral palsy affects two to three children per 1,000 live-born. Typological characteristics of the clinical image of cerebral palsy are the modified muscle tone characterized by muscular tension, altered body posture and disturbed motion. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life. Methods used, based on clinical kinesiology, and appropriate exercise and modification, kinesitherapy has positive effects in treating the condition of people with cerebral palsy",

      "abstract": "Nervous system problems affect around 600 million people worldwide. Among these, neurodegenerative illnesses are often distinguished by a late adult start, a progressive clinical course, and a localized loss of neurons in the central nervous system. These include, among others, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease), Huntington’s disease, Prion diseases, encephalitis, epilepsy, genetic brain disorders, hydrocephalus, stroke, and Alzheimer’s and other less common dementias. The brain stem, cerebellum, thalamus, hypothalamus, basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, and intracranial white matter are among the areas that neurodegeneration typically affects. Mendelian inheritance is well-established, despite the fact that most neurodegenerative illnesses are sporadic. The neuropathological findings and clinical symptoms in hereditary neurodegenerative disorders are intriguing. Regretfully, there are few neurodegenerative diseases for which no effective treatments are available. The rare hereditary types of neurodegenerative diseases, such as ataxias, multiple system atrophy, spastic paraplegias, Parkinson’s disease, dementias, motor neuron diseases, and uncommon metabolic disorders, are highlighted in this chapter along with their clinical and genetic characteristics.",

The classical behavioral defects of PD patients involve motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity, as well as non-motor symptoms such as anosmia, depression, and cognitive impairment. Pathologically, the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) and the accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn)-composed Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) are key hallmarks. Glia are more than mere bystanders that simply support neurons, they actively contribute to almost every aspect of neuronal development and function; glial dysregulation has been implicated in a series of neurodegenerative diseases including PD. Importantly, amounting evidence has added glial activation and neuroinflammation as new features of PD onset and progression. Thus, gaining a better understanding of glia, especially neuron-glia crosstalk, will not only provide insight into brain physiology events but also advance our knowledge of PD pathologies. This review addresses the current understanding of α-syn pathogenesis in PD, with a focus on neuron-glia crosstalk. Particularly, the transmission of α-syn between neurons and glia, α-syn-induced glial activation, and feedbacks of glial activation on DA neuron degeneration are thoroughly discussed. In addition, α-syn aggregation, iron deposition, and glial activation in regulating DA neuron ferroptosis in PD are covered. Lastly, we summarize the preclinical and clinical therapies, especially targeting glia, in PD treatments.",

      "abstract": "The term dysautonomia refers to a change in autonomic nervous system function that adversely affects health. The changes range from transient, occasional episodes of neurally mediated hypotension to progressive neurodegenerative diseases; from disorders in which altered autonomic function plays a primary pathophysiologic role to disorders in which it worsens an independent pathologic state; and from mechanistically straightforward to mysterious and controversial entities. In chronic autonomic failure (pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, or autonomic failure in Parkinson disease), orthostatic hypotension reflects sympathetic neurocirculatory failure from sympathetic denervation or deranged reflexive regulation of sympathetic outflows. Chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with postural tachycardia can arise from cardiac sympathetic activation after “patchy” autonomic impairment or blood volume depletion or, as highlighted in this discussion, from a primary abnormality that augments delivery of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine to its receptors in the heart. Increased sympathetic nerve traffic to the heart and kidneys seems to occur as essential hypertension develops. Acute panic can evoke coronary spasm that is associated with sympathoneural and adrenomedullary excitation. In congestive heart failure, compensatory cardiac sympathetic activation may chronically worsen myocardial function, which rationalizes treatment with β-adrenoceptor blockers. A high frequency of positive results on tilt-table testing has confirmed an association between the chronic fatigue syndrome and orthostatic intolerance; however, treatment with the salt-retaining steroid fludrocortisone, which is usually beneficial in primary chronic autonomic failure, does not seem to be beneficial in the chronic fatigue syndrome.

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Head injuries are becoming much more prevalent and may be secondary to sports injuries, motor vehicle accidents, falls, domestic violence, assault, and military blast explosions. Sleepiness may occur acutely and/or chronically after a head injury. Chronic hypersomnia may be overlooked or under-reported in those with a history of head injury, and the association may not be made. Hypersomnia can occur in those with mild, moderate, and severe head injuries, with or without loss of consciousness. The pathophysiology/neuropathology of sleep-wake disturbances after Traumatic Brain Injury was discussed by Lim and Baumann 2020 in their Up To Date review entitled “Sleep-wake disorders in patients with traumatic brain injury”. They reported possible abnormalities in orexin/hypocretin, decreased histaminergic neurons, melatonin abnormalities, decreased serotonergic neurons, decreased noradrenergic neurons, and structural brain changes that can play a role. It is also possible that a head injury occurs in someone predisposed to the development of narcolepsy or that the sleepiness of undiagnosed narcolepsy leads to increased injuries. Methods A retrospective review of charts from 2013 to 2020 revealed 176 patients diagnosed with narcolepsy in our psychiatric/sleep outpatient practice. Information on head injuries was obtained by questionnaires completed by the patient and/or interview with staff. Narcolepsy was diagnosed by PSG/MSLT and/or DSM-V criteria of narcolepsy. Results Of the 176 patients diagnosed with narcolepsy, 125 were female (71%) and 51 were male (29%). The age range was 11 to 75 years, with an average age of 39 years old. Cataplexy was present in 117 patients (66.8%). A history of a head injury was reported at intake by 50 patients (28.4%). Of the patients with a history of a head injury, 34 (68%) were female, 16 (32%) were male, and 36 (72 %) had a history of cataplexy. Conclusion This study revealed 28.4% of patients diagnosed with narcolepsy reported a history of a head injury of varying degrees of severity. While direct causation cannot be declared, the association of a head injury and continued hypersomnia suggests further evaluation of narcolepsy may be beneficial. Support (if any) **No support for this study was given.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common motor movement disorder and second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease (AD), is often preceded by a period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is associated with impairment of a variety of cognitive domains including executive function, attention, visuospatial abilities and memory. MCI, a risk factor for developing dementia, affects around 30% of de novo PD patients and can increase to 75% after more than 10 years. While 30–40% remain in the MCI state, up to 60% will convert to dementia. Characteristic findings are slowing of EEG rhythms, frontotemporal hypoperfusion, decreased functional connectivity in the default mode and attentional networks, prefrontal and basal-ganglia-cortical circuits, which often manifests prior to clinical symptoms and overt brain atrophy. The heterogeneity of cognitive phenotypes suggests that a common neurodegenerative process affects multiple functional neuronal networks and neuromodulatory systems that may be superimposed by Lewy body and Alzheimer's-related or other co-pathologies. Sparse neuropathological data for PD-MCI revealed a heterogenous picture with various morphological changes similar to MCI in other diseases. This review highlights the essential epidemiological, clinical, neuroimaging and morphological changes in PD-MCI, available biomarkers, and discusses the heterogenous pathobiological mechanisms involved in its development. In view of its complex pathogenesis, well-designed longitudinal clinico-pathological studies are warranted to clarify the alterations leading to MCI in PD, which may be supported by fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers as a basis for early diagnosis and future adequate treatment modalities of this debilitating disorder.",

      "title": "What causes mental dysfunction in Parkinson's disease?",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently associated with mental dysfunction. Domain-specific cognitive deficits are ubiquitous, and although they may not be clinically apparent in all patients, they are demonstrable by neuropsychological testing. Dementia is less frequent but is present significantly more in PD patients than in controls, with a cumulative prevalence rate up to 40% and up to six-fold increased incidence. Cognitive impairment mainly involves executive and visuospatial functions; memory is secondarily impaired with relatively preserved recognition. Qualitatively, the neuropsychological profile of dementia encompasses the same type of deficits found in nondemented PD patients. The dementia seen in PD, therefore, can be described as a dysexecutive syndrome combined with visuospatial dysfunction and behavioural symptoms. Dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic, and cholinergic deficits have all been described as the underlying neurochemical impairment, but the strongest evidence exists for a cholinergic dysfunction. Involvement of brainstem nuclei, limbic structures, and cerebral cortex have been suggested as the site, and Lewy body (LB) degeneration and Alzheimer-type changes as the type of pathology underlying the mental dysfunction in PD. Although there is still some controversy as to the site and type of pathology, recent evidence suggests that LB-type degeneration in limbic structures and cerebral cortex, with consequent synaptic and cell loss, is the main pathological state associated with dementia in PD. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Summary Parkinson's disease (PD) is classically characterized as a hypokinetic movement disorder, with motor features of bradykinesia, resting tremor and rigidity. The non-motor symptoms (NMS) of PD often precede better-recognized motor features in PD but are increasingly recognized, and include cognitive, neuropsychiatric, sleep, autonomic and sensory disturbances. These NMS may be intrinsic to the disease pathology, and are not confined to traditional dopaminergic pathways. For instance, cognitive disturbances are often linked to the cholinergic neuraxis, and depression may result from alterations in the serotonergic system. In addition, some NMS, particularly impulse control disorders or sleep disorders, may be triggered as a result of treatment with dopaminergic agents. Treatment may include interventions independent of traditional, dopaminergic antiparkinson therapy or may be tailored to increase or reduce dopamine responsiveness of the symptom. This chapter will highlight the importance of NMS detection in optimizing treatment of PD patients.",

Mostly, that are not explained by an specifiable organic disease and that especially related to psychiatric underlying cause. Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

The natural history of the disorder stems from an unexplained loss of neurons, and the largest risk factor appears to be age. Literature regarding neuroprotective agents and medications that may help \"slow down\" the disease progression have been widely published. Once the diagnosis is made, in some cases, months to years may have passed before effective therapy is begun. With the advent of levodopa in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the gold standard for therapy of Parkinson disease has remained carbidopa/levodopa. As a result of the treatment, long-term complications of the motor symptoms were reported for the therapy aimed at helping those motor symptoms. Today the prognosis of patients with the diagnosis is excellent. Patients get relief from motor complaints but continue to suffer from non-motor complications.",

The symptoms may be divided into two groups. ‘Positive’ symptoms include a variety of psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations. Although severe, they are less handicapping than negative symptoms such as avolition or anhedonia. Positive symptoms involve the presence of things that should be absent, while negative symptoms involve the absence of things that should be present. Dimensional approaches for classifying symptoms have also become popular in current nosology, proposing three dimensions: positive, negative, and disorganized. The course of the illness evolves over time; a prodrome is often present, followed by illness onset and a variable outcome. Good outcome predictors include good premorbid adjustment, high intelligence quotient, and good social relationships. The pathophysiology of the illness includes genetic, neuropathological, and neurodevelopmental components. A possible association with creativity may suggest reasons why the illness has persisted over many centuries.",

Clinical symptoms of PD consist of resting tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, and abnormal postural reflexes (1). The pathologic hallmark of PD is the progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway and dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra (2) though recent neuropathologic studies suggest a more extended neuronal degeneration starting in the medulla oblongata that later spreads to the midbrain and cerebral cortex (3). Nevertheless it is the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway and subsequent dopamine deficiency in striatum that is believed to underlie many of the clinical manifestations of PD (4-8).",

Myopathies are rare in all age ranges. They may be inherited or acquired. Onset of inherited myopathies in elderly people, not surprisingly, is uncommon, but some of these diseases are asymptomatic, or cause such minor symptoms that their significance is not appreciated by the patient, and thus they may not be recognized until late on in life. Their recognition may have implications for other, younger, family members. Many of the acquired myopathies afflicting older people are treatable, but the commonest, inclusion body myositis, is not, and incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate use of steroids may compound morbidity.",

Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.\n\nLike seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.\n\nSeizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.\n\nBHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, …",

      "title": "Emergency presentations of Parkinson's disease: early recognition and treatment are crucial for optimum outcome",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Pathophysiologically the illness is due to a disruption of dopamine production in the basal ganglia and leads to a wide array of symptoms. These symptoms are not restricted to the nervous system; thus, the illness often presents acutely to a wide range of specialties, many of which may have limited experience in the condition. Patients often become unwell with illnesses unrelated to their PD. However, these conditions frequently lead to a deterioration in PD control. In addition, there exist certain acute complications of PD which are often difficult to recognise and carry significant mortality. Discussing the acute presentations of the illness under the umbrella of PD is important as it enables clinicians to focus upon the specific concerns involved in managing patients with the illness. A number of conditions are extremely common in PD and include falls, orthostatic hypotension, swallowing difficulties, psychosis, and hyperkinetic movement disorders. Optimal treatment of these conditions requires the consideration of issues specific to PD. Lesser recognised acute presentations of PD include the serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome. While encountered less commonly, these conditions have been well described in the literature and untreated may prove fatal. They require urgent management, with their importance being further highlighted by the fact they may often mimic other illnesses, making diagnosis difficult. Therapeutic interventions aimed at treating PD and preventing its complications are evolving rapidly.",

Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW. This means that CP following preterm birth, or brain compromise affecting the motor system, is probably related to a pathomechanism specifically affecting the immature brain, which stresses the importance of gaining insight into the following questions:",

      "abstract": "Extract Key points ... Introduction Acute or subacute autonomic failure can be caused by certain drugs and toxins or in association with systemic disorders that affect the nerves more diffusely (e.g. diabetes, amyloidosis). Once these causes are excluded, many cases of acute or subacute autonomic failure may be attributed to autoimmunity targeting the autonomic nerves and/or ganglia. In addition to the time course of the symptoms, several clinical observations support this concept. Subacute autonomic failure may occur in association with known autoimmune neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis, Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome or acquired neuromyotonia, or may be associated with occult cancer (paraneoplastic autonomic neuropathy). When subacute autonomic neuropathy occurs in isolation, the syndrome often follows a viral prodrome, has a monophasic course, and can be associated with elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein and neuron-specific autoantibodies. Until recently, subacute idiopathic autonomic neuropathy was considered to be a pure autonomic variant of the Guillain–Barré syndrome, but recent evidence suggests that some cases, at least, may be due to a specific immune response to the α3-type neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in autonomic ganglia. Indeed, an animal model of autonomic failure has been induced by immunization against α3-type neuronal nicotinic AChR. The manifestations of autoimmune forms of peripheral autonomic failure are reviewed in this chapter with special consideration of autonomic dysfunction in cancer patients and the emerging experimental and laboratory evidence for specific autoantibodies in both cancer and non-cancer cases.",

      "title": "Parkinson's disease: A Review about Pathogenesis, Pharmaceutical Treatment and Experimental Models",
      "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer disease, characterized by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta, accompanied by motor and non-motor symptoms. Idiopathic PD is the most common cause of Parkinsonism (primary Parkinsonism) while, certain medication and different groups of neurological disorder may be causes of secondary Parkinsonism. The presence of intraneuronal proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions “Lewy Bodies” and the loss of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are the main neuropathological hallmarks of PD. However, the etiology of the disease is still undefined; several studies assume that oxidative stress, mitochondrial defects, neuroinflammation, apoptosis and excitotoxicity play vital roles in the pathogenesis and progress of the disease. Experimental models of PD can be induced by several neurotoxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, 6-hydroxydopamine, rotenone and paraquat which produce neuropathological and neurochemical changes that are identical to those seen in PD. The primary drug for PD treatment is L-dopa; however, drug-induced dyskinesia and motor complications restricted its use as long term treatment. Dopamine agonists are alternative options for initial treatment of PD and have been reported to retard the onset of motor complications. Combination of L-dopa with other medications, such ascatechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors and monoamine oxidase B inhibitors has the ability to alleviate L-dopa-induced motor complications. Anticholinergic drugs can be used to control the symptoms of PD but their cognitive and autonomic side effects make them unsuitable for the elderly.",

      "title": "Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is characterized by recurrent acute sensory and motor neuropathy in a single or multiple nerves. The most common initial manifestation is the acute onset of a non-painful focal sensory and motor neuropathy in a single nerve (mononeuropathy). The first attack usually occurs in the second or third decade but earlier onset is possible. Neuropathic pain is increasingly recognized as a common manifestation. Recovery from acute neuropathy is usually complete; when recovery is not complete, the resulting disability is mild. Some affected individuals also demonstrate a mild-to-moderate peripheral neuropathy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HNPP is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and electrophysiologic findings and either the 1.5-Mb recurrent deletion or a novel deletion involving PMP22 (in 80%), or a PMP22 sequence variant (in 20%) identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and involves occupational therapy and physical therapy as needed to address issues with fine motor and gross motor skills, including activities of daily living. Bracing, such as with a wrist splint or ankle-foot orthosis, may be useful transiently or in some instances permanently. Special shoes, including those with good ankle support, may be needed. Neuropathic pain can be treated with analgesic medications. Protective pads at elbows or knees may prevent pressure and trauma to local nerves. Surveillance: Routine screening neurologic examination focused on muscle atrophy, strength, sensory loss, and neuropathic pain; physical and occupational therapy assessments of gross motor and fine motor skills and activities of daily living; foot examinations for pressure sores or poorly fitting footwear. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged sitting with legs crossed; prolonged leaning on elbows; occupations requiring repetitive movements of the wrist; rapid weight loss; vincristine. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Asymptomatic relatives at risk may wish to clarify their genetic status by undergoing molecular genetic testing for the PMP22 pathogenic variant identified in an affected family member in order to be advised about agents and circumstances to avoid. Genetic counseling HNPP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 20% of individuals with HNPP have the disorder as the result of a de novo PMP22 pathogenic variant. Each child of an affected individual is at a 50% risk of inheriting the PMP22 pathogenic variant. Once the PMP22 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

This illness is seen in an individual who has no history of any preexisting psychiatric illness except for uncomplicated episodes of depression or mania. Clinically there are two types of primary affective disorder. The first is manic depressive disease (bipolar psychosis) which may be considered as a primary affective disorder in which mania is seen; usually, but not always, depression is also seen in this kind of patient. The other type may be called depressive disease; a synonym that might be used is unipolar psychosis; here only depressive episodes are seen (one or more episodes). In addition to the difference in the clinical picture, considerable genetic data exist which indicate that the two illnesses are quite distinct from each other.",

      "abstract": "WHAT IS ENCEPHALOPATHY?Encephalopathy is a clinical state characterised by an alteration of consciousness, behaviour and/or cognition.It can present with lethargy and drowsiness, or conversely with a heightened state of agitation and confusion.It arises from diffuse brain dysfunction that can result from myriad underlying conditions, ranging from primary neurologic to systemic disorders.While encephalopathy more commonly stems from a global brain insult, it can present with a range of focal neurological manifestations such as seizures, visual disturbances, speech abnormalities, motor weakness, and sensory and autonomic deficits.Encephalitis refers specifically to brain inflammation, usually associated with fever, with evidence of cerebrospinal inflammation (pleocytosis and raised protein levels) and/or neuroimaging findings of encephalitis. HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE?Altered behaviour is common in children and has many causes.In the general clinic setting, it is important to pick up common clinical mimics of encephalopathy that can be managed without immediate referral to the hospital.These include post-ictal drowsiness from simple febrile seizures, and metabolic derangements such as hypoglycaemia.Conversely, it is also important to identify red flags in the history and physical examination that necessitate either activation of emergency services or an urgent referral to the neurologist for further workup.In particular, encephalitis accounts for a significant proportion of encephalopathy cases that persist beyond 24 hours, and can result in significant morbidity and mortality.(3) Arriving at an accurate diagnosis for the underlying cause is critical because many causes are reversible, and early specific treatment confers a better prognosis.",

This is paradoxical because neurotropic pathogens are common and contribute significantly to human suffering and disease burden in these regions.

Here, we briefly describe a few examples of such infections causing severe diseases that result in the loss of motor-sensory function (cerebral malaria, viral encephalitis), alterations of cognition/behavior (AIDS), or sleep perturbations (African trypanosomiasis). Importantly, there is an opportunity to interfere with infection because the central nervous system (CNS) is not usually the primary site for pathogen infection.",

      "title": "Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease: Is the Adaptive Immune System a Friend or Foe?",
      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterised by progressive neuronal death and neurological dysfunction, leading to increased disability and a loss of cognitive function. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have neurodegeneration as a primary feature. However, in other CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury and spinal cord injury, neurodegeneration follows another insult, such as demyelination or ischaemia. Although there are different primary causes to these diseases, they all share a hallmark of neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation can occur through the activation of resident immune cells such as microglia, cells of the innate and adaptive peripheral immune system, meningeal inflammation and autoantibodies directed towards components of the CNS. Despite chronic inflammation being pathogenic in these diseases, local inflammation after insult can also promote endogenous regenerative processes in the CNS, which are key to slowing disease progression. The normal ageing process in the healthy brain is associated with a decline in physiological function, a steady increase in levels of neuroinflammation, brain shrinkage and memory deficits. Likewise, ageing is also a key contributor to the progression and exacerbation of neurodegenerative diseases. As there are associated co-morbidities within an ageing population, pinpointing the precise relationship between ageing and neurodegenerative disease progression can be a challenge. The CNS has historically been considered an isolated, \"immune privileged\" site, however there is mounting evidence that adaptive immune cells are present in the CNS of both healthy individuals and diseased patients. Adaptive immune cells have also been implicated in both the degeneration and regeneration of the CNS. In this review, we will discuss the key role of the adaptive immune system in CNS degeneration and regeneration, with a focus on how ageing influences this crosstalk.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Autoimmune neurogenic dysphagia refers to manifestation of dysphagia due to autoimmune diseases affecting muscle, neuromuscular junction, nerves, roots, brainstem, or cortex. Dysphagia is either part of the evolving clinical symptomatology of an underlying neurological autoimmunity or occurs as a sole manifestation, acutely or insidiously. This opinion article reviews the autoimmune neurological causes of dysphagia, highlights clinical clues and laboratory testing that facilitate early diagnosis, especially when dysphagia is the presenting symptom, and outlines the most effective immunotherapeutic approaches. Dysphagia is common in inflammatory myopathies, most prominently in inclusion body myositis, and is frequent in myasthenia gravis, occurring early in bulbar-onset disease or during the course of progressive, generalized disease. Acute-onset dysphagia is often seen in Guillain–Barre syndrome variants and slowly progressive dysphagia in paraneoplastic neuropathies highlighted by the presence of specific autoantibodies. The most common causes of CNS autoimmune dysphagia are demyelinating and inflammatory lesions in the brainstem, occurring in patients with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders. Less common, but often overlooked, is dysphagia in stiff-person syndrome especially in conjunction with cerebellar ataxia and high anti-GAD autoantibodies, and in gastrointestinal dysmotility syndromes associated with autoantibodies against the ganglionic acetyl-choline receptor. In the setting of many neurological autoimmunities, acute-onset or progressive dysphagia is a potentially treatable condition, requiring increased awareness for prompt diagnosis and early immunotherapy initiation.",

The differential diagnoses for this condition are broad. In addition to disability during an acute attack, this disease could also cause a permanent neurologic deficit. The understanding of RPON pathogenesis has changed over time, leading to a change in the classification of this disorder between editions of the International Classification of Headache Disorders, in which the condition was moved from the chapter on migraine to the chapter on cranial neuralgias and central causes of facial pain. There is no consensus on the pathogenesis of RPON. It is possible that multiple pathogenic mechanisms underlie various clinical forms of the disease. A depiction of pathologic analyses of patients with radiologically confirmed changes in the affected nerves during and outside of attacks would significantly contribute to knowledge of its pathogenesis. Brain imaging should be performed in each patient during an acute RPON attack and at a regular schedule between attacks. Further case reports and case series are required before further conclusions can be made regarding RPON pathogenesis and proposals for treatment options.",

La debilidad de los músculos bulbares y respiratorios puede estar presente o no. Es uma emergencia neurológica común que requiere investigaciones inmediatas y cuidadosas para determinar la etiología porque um diagnóstico preciso tiene un impacto significativo en la terapia y el pronóstico. La insuficiencia respiratoria causada por debilidad neuromuscular se considera más crítica que la enfermedad pulmonar porque su desarrollo puede ser insidioso o sutil hasta que la descompensación repentina conduce a una hipoxia potencialmente mortal. Además, el hallazgo de gases en sangre arterial de hipoxemia grave, hipercapnia y acidosis puede no ser evidente hasta que la insuficiencia respiratoria es profunda. Por eso, el requisito de assistência respiratoria también debe investigarse de manera intensiva y rápida en todos los pacientes con enfermedad neuromuscular. El trastorno se clasifica según el sitio del defecto en la vía de la unidad motora, es decir, células del asta anterior, raíz nerviosa, nervio periférico, unión neuromuscular o músculo. La identificación de la causa se basa principalmente en una buena historia clínica y un examen clínico detallado complementado con investigaciones neurofisiológicas y, a veces, algunas pruebas de laboratorio específicas. El historial médico y el examen neurológico deben centrarse en el inicio, la progresión, el patrón y la gravedad de la debilidad muscular, así como en las pruebas de los nervios craneales y las pruebas de disfunción autonómica. También deben tenerse en cuenta las características no neurológicas asociadas, como fiebre, erupción cutánea u otras lesiones cutáneas, etc. A nivel mundial, el síndrome de Guillain-Barré es la causa más frecuente de PNMA y representa la mayoría de los casos de debilidad de los músculos respiratorios asociados con trastornos neuromusculares.",

This review evaluates the more robust prospective or pathologically confirmed publications to establish whether there is a premotor period and if so what is its duration. The most informative studies are considered to be those concerned with olfaction, dysautonomia, and sleep disorder. Estimates for the duration of the prodromal phase vary from months to decades. It is concluded that there probably is an early phase in the disease where a variety of nonmotor features develop, but the sequence and time of onset of such features is not well established.",

Many experienced clinicians view unrecognized depression in old age as a more important problem than that of the organic brain syndromes—it is much more amenable to treatment. About one person in six of those aged 65 years or more have some manifestation of organic brain syndrome. On the other hand, as many as 25% to 30% of the same group have some type of functional disorder, such as depression or neurosis.

      "title": "Syncope And Related Paroxysmal Spells",
      "abstract": "Paroxysmal spells are non-epileptic, paroxysmal events that may mimic epileptic seizures but are not associated with rhythmic discharges of cortical neurons typical of seizures. They clinically manifest as a transient loss of consciousness, often occurring suddenly, with or without a prodrome. Paroxysmal spells can be caused by psychological disorders such as substance abuse and psychiatric disease or physiological events such as hypoglycemia, traumatic brain injury, and syncope. Psychological Conditions Data suggest that men with psychiatric disease have an increased incidence of syncope or paroxysmal events of unknown etiology. This data should lead clinicians to consider screening for psychiatric disorders in patients with transient loss of consciousness they cannot identify with a clear etiology.Among patients with a history of substance use disorder, 45% have been found to have unexplained syncope. This suggests that prior and current substance use is also associated with increased incidence of transient loss of consciousness of unknown etiology. Patients evaluated in the emergency department or even hospitalized with syncope of unknown etiology may benefit from toxicology screening and possible detoxification referral. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is defined as low blood sugar with associated symptoms. In patients without diabetes mellitus, this is usually manifested at glucose levels below 50 mg/dl. To diagnose hypoglycemia, symptoms and blood sugar must improve with exogenous glucose. Hypoglycemia can affect the central nervous system, leading to lightheadedness, nausea, flashes of light, focal neurological deficits, transient loss of consciousness, and seizure. It is, therefore, paramount that patients with any paroxysmal spell or syncope receive a fingerstick glucose. Traumatic Brain Injury Traumatic brain injury is an intracranial impairment, often due to external forces. These forces may include blunt or penetrating trauma to the head, causing acceleration/deceleration injury to the cerebral cortex. Intracerebral bleeding, lacerations, and diffuse axonal injuries may result. Injuries, such as an epidural hematoma, may cause a brief state of loss of consciousness, with rapid return of, usually, altered consciousness. Other injuries, such as large subdural hematoma or diffuse axonal injury may cause worsening mentation and coma over hours to days. This is a result of increased intracranial pressure, leading to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, and finally, neuronal ischemia. Diagnosis is by clinical history and CT imaging, although MRI may be more specific for secondary trauma. Management is to reduce intracranial pressure and edema. Syncope As most paroxysmal events are syncopal, the remainder of this discussion will focus primarily on syncope. Physiologically, syncope is a transient loss of consciousness as a result of cerebral hypoperfusion. As such, syncope varies from other etiologies of loss of consciousness in that it does not include head trauma or a post-ictal state. Syncope instead results in complete and rapid resolution of mental status. It may have myoclonic jerking, but no generalized tonic-clonic movement. Rather than a disease, syncope is a symptom of an underlying pathology ranging from benign to life-threatening. Patients are often divided into low-risk and high-risk groups. The etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, treatment, and management of these patients vary greatly. In the United States, hospitalization costs for syncope are estimated to be $5300 per admission and more than $2 billion annually. These costs are higher than those of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma combined. As extensive workups can be costly, time-consuming, and often unnecessary, a growing cadre of management tools has been devised to evaluate patients with syncope. These tools are tailored to determining the etiology of the syncopal event and treating dangerous, high-risk, syncope patients.",

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

These psychic manifestations simulate all of the neuroses and major psychiatric states. Excitement states with amnesia may lead to violent antisocial behavior. All these manifestations may be aggravated by alcohol. Thalamic epilepsy shows itself in similar psychiatric manifestations and accounts for behavior disorder in children more than temporal lobe epilepsy. Atypical seizures with vegetative or emotional aura and a characteristic electroencephalogram differentiate it from temporal lobe epilepsy. Proper understanding of the varied manifestations, with positive electroencephalographic findings, leads to the correct diagnosis in most cases. All patients with unusual or atypical personality or psychiatric-like states should have careful electroencephalographic examination.

      "abstract": "Motor neurone disease (MND) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative condition. It affects people of all ages, but is more common with increasing age (especially over 50 years) and men are affected twice as often as women. The causes remain unknown, although around 5% of cases have a genetic basis. Survival is usually only three to five years from diagnosis. MND affects both upper and lower motor neurones, with variable contributions. The nerve involvement in MND usually has a focal onset, is asymmetrical, but tends to spread to adjacent regions of the body. If the affected region is in the legs, a common presenting feature is tripping, falls or foot drop. If it is in the arms there may be difficulty with fine tasks such as fastening buttons, or raising an arm, and if the cranial nerves are affected there may be slurring of speech, or difficulty swallowing. Key to the diagnosis is evidence of progression, and this may lead to some delay in considering and also confirming the diagnosis. When examining the patient, evidence of more widespread neuromuscular involvement should be looked for. In a patient with foot drop, and fasciculation of the tongue, MND would be a likely diagnosis. Upper motor neurone involvement may be readily determined by examining the reflexes. Brisk reflexes, in the arms, legs or jaw, in the context of features of lower motor neurone denervation are highly suggestive of MND. Suspicion of MND should lead to referral for a neurology opinion. The most useful investigation is likely to be EMG with nerve conduction studies, and probably MRI scan of relevant areas. Blood tests are arranged to screen for any other causative condition. Riluzole is a disease modifying drug licensed to extend the life of patients with MND. There is no treatment that will reverse, or halt, progression of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Severe closed head injury often results in physical, neuropsychologic, and psychiatric sequelae in the patient and in psychosocial disruption within the family. Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory. Because of the integral involvement of the family in the recovery process, psychosocial intervention must be an important component of any treatment program.",

An epileptic seizure is a transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive, synchronous neuronal activity. Epilepsy is defined as a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. Traditionally epilepsy was diagnosed after a patient had two or more unprovoked seizures. However, a more modern definition of epilepsy would also include patients who have had an isolated seizure and have evidence for an enduring alteration in the brain that increases the likelihood of future seizures such as an ‘epileptiform’ electroencephalogram abnormality or an appropriate lesion on structural brain imaging (CT or MRI). Epilepsy cannot, though, be diagnosed unless there has been at least one clinical event compatible with an unprovoked seizure.",

      "title": "Expanding the Boundaries of Early Intervention for Psychosis: Intervening During the Prodrome",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;It has long been recognized that subclinical manifestations of schizophrenia are evident prior to the onset of full psychosis. This period of time, during which changes in behavior begin to emerge and then progress into more specific early signs and symptoms prior to the onset of frank psychosis, is conceptualized as the “prodrome” or “prodromal stage” of schizophrenia. The term prodrome is somewhat of a misnomer, given the connotation that illness will inevitably follow. Despite this semantic problem, the label is in wide use and in this context suggests only the potential for later development of psychosis or schizophrenia. Verification that an individual is truly at-risk for psychosis (or is in the prodromal stage) can only be determined by following subjects over time. Therefore, putatively prodromal individuals are referred to as being at “ultra high risk” or “clinical high risk” for the development of psychotic disorders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHORS&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrea M.

Adrenal insufficiency is a diagnosis that will not be made unless the clinician maintains a level of suspicion. The decreasing or suppressed adrenal function may be masked until stress or illness triggers an adrenal crisis.An important distinction in these patients is the presence of mineralocorticoid deficiency. Those with secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency will typically have preserved mineralocorticoid function due to the separate feedback systems. Mineralocorticoid levels are regulated by the renin-angiotensin system, independent of hypothalamic or pituitary signals.Another important distinction is the acute versus chronic nature of the disease. Acute adrenal insufficiency patients often present in a critically ill state while chronic presentations can be insidious.",

They are initially subtle, develop insidiously, and their severity often changes. Serious diagnostic problems can be caused by mood disorders, psychotic symptoms, personality changes, from disinhibition to apathy, observed in such patients. The problem in distinguishing them from organic psychiatric disorders, often poses a challenge for psychiatrists, neurologists and general practitioners. We describe a case difficult to diagnose because of apathy, due to a brain tumour in the right frontal lobe, diagnosed as depression. Another difficulty, rather suggesting mood disorder, was rheumatoid arthritis. Thorough and meticulous analysis of clinical data, neuropsychological assessment and neuroimaging diagnosis may help to assess aetiology of the observed disorders which can have similar clinical pictures but various causes.",

      "title": "Dysfunction of olfactory structures: A conserved mechanism of neurodegeneration?",
      "abstract": "The olfactory system participates in the reception, integration, and interpretation of olfactory signals. This chemical sense is essential for survival since it is involved in basic behaviors and physiological processes. Olfactory function decreases with age; however, olfactory impairments are also observed in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric pathologies. It is widely described that olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom in Parkinson (PD) and Alzheimer (AD) diseases, furthermore, olfactory brain areas are affected by the pathological hallmarks of these diseases before the brain areas involved in the motor and cognitive impairments, respectively. This information suggests a key role of olfactory system damage in the beginning of a neurodegenerative process. Not only does the early injury of the olfactory system occur in AD and PD, but also in other pathologies since increasing evidence indicate the presence of olfactory impairments in other neurogenerative and psychiatric diseases namely, depression, schizophrenia, and autism among others. In addition, people with systemic chronic diseases that promote central nervous system damage such as type 2 diabetes and obesity also show olfactory dysfunction, which also suggests that olfactory alterations in these individuals could be an early manifestation of a neurodegenerative process. Then, the aim of the manuscript is to describe the information which supports that olfactory system impairment is a prodromal factor for the development of several neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, to recognize it as a shared mechanism of degeneration among diverse neuropathologies, and discuss the relevance of the assessment of the olfactory function in the diagnosis and improvement of neurodegeneration.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder currently diagnosed solely on the presence of motor symptoms (i.e., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability) and their response to dopamine replacement therapy. A major unmet need is the limited number and failure of clinical trials with putative neuroprotective agents intended to halt or delay disease progression. Three main reasons account for this development: ( i ) At the time of the clinical diagnosis >50% of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have degenerated (1) and other neurotransmitter systems (e.g., norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine) have been affected, indicating that the disease is already at an advanced stage (2); ( ii ) some reports suggest low accuracy for a PD clinical diagnosis, with up to 50% misdiagnosis in early disease (i.e., within 5 y of diagnosis) (3); and ( iii ) there is still no objective meaningful endpoint for clinical trials for early PD other than the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), a rater-based assessment of symptom severity. Thus, there is a need for objective biomarkers that either are neuropathophysiological manifestations of the disease (marker of state), track the speed of its progression (marker of rate), or are present in at-risk PD (marker of trait) (4). Adding complexity to this endeavor is the fact that PD is very heterogeneous in its clinical, neuropathological, and probably also pathophysiological presentation, with various subtyping strategies based on motor and also nonmotor symptoms recently proposed (5).

      "abstract": "__Abstract__\r\n\r\nThe term parkinsonism refers to a neurological syndrome defined by the combination of\r\nbradykinesia (slowness of movement) in combination with any of the following motor signs: tremor\r\nat rest, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes (1). This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

In many cases, these individuals are not seen by neuropsychologists because they may initially present with strong signs of increases in intracranial pressure, strong focal neurologic signs, or seizure activity which can rapidly lead to medical care and treatment. Other neoplasms, however, may present very subtle signs which can be missed or ignored when the patient is evaluated. The symptoms may, in fact, superficially suggest an apparently clear-cut psychiatric disorder. Although this occurs rarely in behaviorally disturbed populations, the presence of psychiatric or cognitive symptoms with such tumors is frequent; the exact symptoms depend upon such factors as the location of the tumor, the rate of growth, the stage of development, and the effects of brain organization and metabolism as a whole (Lishman, 1978).",

In all these cases, dopaminergic treatment can be helpful.

      "abstract": "Cardinal motor features of Parkinson’s disease (PD) include bradykinesia, rest tremor, and rigidity, which appear in the early stages of the disease and largely depend on dopaminergic nigrostriatal denervation. Intermediate and advanced PD stages are characterized by motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, which depend on complex mechanisms secondary to severe nigrostriatal loss and to the problems related to oral levodopa absorption, and motor and nonmotor symptoms and signs that are secondary to marked dopaminergic loss and multisystem neurodegeneration with damage to nondopaminergic pathways. Nondopaminergic dysfunction results in motor problems, including posture, balance and gait disturbances, and fatigue, and nonmotor problems, encompassing depression, apathy, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, pain, and autonomic dysfunction. There are a number of symptomatic drugs for PD motor signs, but the pharmacological resources for nonmotor signs and symptoms are limited, and rehabilitation may contribute to their treatment. The present review will focus on classical notions and recent insights into the neuropathology, neuropharmacology, and neurophysiology of motor dysfunction of PD. These pieces of information represent the basis for the pharmacological, neurosurgical, and rehabilitative approaches to PD.",

Psychosis due to TBI, also referred to as PD TBI in the literature is characterized by the presence of hallucinations and/or delusions in the aftermath of traumatic brain injury. The diagnosis is difficult to make because it requires the clinician to make a determination of whether the psychosis resulted from the brain injury or whether it is a manifestation of another illness. This can be particularly challenging because there can exist a significant lag between the time of head injury and onset of psychotic symptoms. To further complicate the picture, some patients have additional neurological conditions, either primary or secondary to the TBI that may confound the presence of psychotic symptoms.

The latest studies of toxic substance-based animal models of PD suggest that genomic silencing of the inflammasomes hinders neuroinflammation, and is neuroprotective which supports this hypothesis. The key manifestations reported in patients with PD are categorized into: initial symptoms; primary motor symptoms; secondary motor symptoms; primary nonmotor symptoms; and secondary nonmotor symptoms. James Parkinson first identified PD as the \"shaking palsy\" or agitans of paralysis in 1817 caused by a rather precise and gradual neurodegeneration of pigmented nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The initial symptoms are mild and gradually improve, which makes them hard to detect. Sexual impairment is one of the primary factors for worsening of a PD patient's quality of life.",

      "title": "Alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils: a tool to understand Parkinson’s disease and develop disease modifying therapy",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by multiple motor and non-motor symptoms, which include, among others, constipation, sleep disturbance, bradykinesia, gait and balance abnormalities, muscle stiffness and resting tremor. The motor symptoms are caused by progressive age-related death of dopaminergic neurons and in the vast majority of patients suffering from age-related idiopathic PD the cause of dopaminergic neurodegeneration is unknown. Even in the familial early-onset PD where genetic mutations have been identified, the molecular mechanisms driving degeneration of dopaminergic neurons are far from clear. Consequently, there is no clinically approved disease-modifying therapy capable of stopping or at least slowing down the disease progression. Intracellular accumulation of insoluble protein deposits emerged as a common element of major age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Such deposits are commonly observed in histopathological examination of brains from patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (α-synuclein (αSyn), β-amyloid peptide and Tau deposits); amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SOD1, TDP43 and FUS deposits); multiple systems atrophy (MSA), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and PD (αSyn deposits in all three). Moreover, protein aggregation pathology is not limited to neurodegenerative diseases, but can also occur in peripheral organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, for example, in various amyloidoses. Despite being common denominator of most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, the role of pathological protein aggregation in the etiology of AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, MSA, DLB, and PD remains unclear, with very few molecular mechanisms confirmed in patients. Moreover, several clinical trials have targeted protein aggregates in neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. treatments targeting β-amyloid peptide in AD) with limited success, leading to a view that protein aggregation might be just epiphenomenon accompanying neurodegeneration. However, in our opinion it is rather the lack of mechanistic understanding of pathological protein misfolding, spread and disturbances it causes to cells that hindered successful development of disease-modifying therapies (Chmielarz and Saarma, 2020). Recently developed models utilizing αSyn pre-formed fibrils (αSyn PFFs) have rapidly progressed our understanding of protein aggregation in PD, aiming for the development of more evidence based and ultimately effective treatments. αSyn is one of the main components of proteinaceous neuronal inclusions called Lewy Bodies characteristic for DLB and PD (Fouka et al., 2020). Lewy Bodies contain αSyn crowded together with fragments of membranous organelles and vesicles (Shahmoradian et al., 2019) and their formation has been recently proposed to drive neuronal pathology (Mahul-Mellier et al., 2020; Figure 1). Mutations and polymorphisms in the gene encoding αSyn are known risk factors and, in some cases, even direct causes of familial forms of PD. During PD progression, insoluble aggregates are increasingly observed in multiple brain regions, suggesting that misfolded αSyn spreading through interconnected neuronal networks possesses prion-like properties. Supporting thе hypothesis, host-to-graft spread of Lewy Body pathology was also observed in fetal midbrain-derived neurons transplanted to the brains of PD patients. Yet, despite that Lewy Bodies in PD have been described more than 100 years ago and for more than 20 years we know that αSyn is their main component, the causative role of αSyn in PD progression and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons has not been conclusively proven. For example, it is still not clear which conformation(s) and oligomeric state(s) (e.g. soluble oligomers or short fibrils) of misfolded αSyn are the most active in propagation and seeding aggregation in neurons and glial cells in the human brain. The molecular mechanisms for uptake of misfolded αSyn are also not fully elucidated. In addition to genetic and pathological evidence, application of sensitive protein misfolding cyclic amplification or real-time quaking-induced conversion assays demonstrated the presence of misfolded protein species capable of seeding αSyn aggregation in cerebrospinal fluid (Shahnawaz et al., 2020) and even in skin samples of PD patients (Manne et al., 2020). Inoculation with Lewy Body extracts collected post-mortem from PD patients’ brains induced the development and spread of αSyn pathology not only in rodents, but also in non-human primates (Arotcarena et al., 2020). Supported by such data, αSyn has emerged as a promising target for disease-modifying therapy in PD, MSA and, possibly, DLB. Proposed therapeutic approaches targeting αSyn include interfering with initial aggregation by small molecules stabilizing correctly folded protein conformation, directly binding misfolded fibrils and promoting either their dissociation or inhibiting their growth; enhancing degradation of intracellular αSyn by stimulating lysosomal activity or by small molecules – proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) – promoting preoteasomal degradation; lowering cellular αSyn levels by anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASO) and cell-penetrant nanobodies; inhibiting uptake and targeting transmission of extracellular αSyn with active and passive immunization. Many of such treatments are currently in clinical trials (see https://clinicaltrials.gov/ for a regularly updated list) and some have shown good safety profiles (e.g. anle138b, NPT200-11, ENT-01, nilotinib, memantine and several other small molecules and active and passive immunotherapies targeting αSyn misfolding and spread), however, conclusive evidence of their efficacy is still to be demonstrated. Interestingly, encouraging results have recently been reported from PASADENA phase II clinical trial of monoclonal humanized antibody designed to stop misfolded αSyn transmission. While not meeting its primary endpoint, this trial demonstrated clear improvement in both motor and cognitive symptoms, convincing enough to prompt Roche and Prothena to support moving into the next phase of clinical development (see https://ir.prothena.com/news-releases/news-release-details/roche-and-prothena-will-advance-prasinezumab-late-stage-clinical). Further development of successful αSyn targeting therapies would benefit immensely from a comprehensive understanding of the entire process of the pathology transmission, Lewy Body formation and resulting cellular damage. Significant progress in our understanding of these questions has been made in preclinical studies, thanks to multiple αSyn transgenic models (Airavaara et al., 2020) and the development of αSyn PFFs able to seed aggregation of endogenous αSyn in cultured cells and in vivo (Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020).Figure 1: Preparation and application of α-synuclein preformed fibrils to reconstruct multiple steps of Lewy body formation and pathological protein transmission.(A) Major steps in PFF-induced αSyn aggregation model: (1) formation of αSyn fibrils in vitro; (2) cellular uptake of αSyn PFFs; (3) processing and release to cytoplasm; (4) recruitment of endogenous αSyn; (5) seeding of endogenous αSyn misfolding, formation of oligomers and insoluble αSyn fibrils; (6) maturation of fibrils and formation of Levy Bodies containing fragment of lipid membranes and mitochondria; (7) lysosomal and proteasomal degradation of misfolded αSyn oligomers and fibrils; (8) release and propagation of misfolded αSyn. (B) Application of αSyn PFFs and genetic models to study molecular mechanisms and develop therapies targeting pathological αSyn aggregation, and the remaining questions. Numbers correspond to major PFF-induced αSyn aggregation steps depicted in Figure 1. ASOs: Anti-sense oligonucleotides; HMW: high molecular weight; KO: knockout; LBs: Lewy bodies; NTFs: neurothrophic factors; OE: overexpression; PROTACs: proteolysis targeting chimeras.αSyn PFFs model allows studying multiple steps of Lewy Body pathology development: uptake of pathogenic fibrils, their internalization, transport, processing and recruitment of endogenous αSyn, its post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation of Ser129), formation and maturation of Lewy Body-like inclusions (Figure 1A) and, finally, effects of these processes on cell function and survival. Furthermore, with αSyn PFFs we can study the mechanism of pathology transmission between neurons and in vivo spreading through neuronal connectome as well as motor and behavioral outcomes of accumulation of αSyn deposits in different brain structures (Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020). Application of αSyn PFFs as well as genetic models allowed pre-clinical testing of multiple approaches aiming to develop disease-modifying PD therapy (Figure 1B). Additionally, the formation of fibrils may be templated with pathological αSyn species from the brain and/or cerebrospinal fluid samples of PD and MSA patients. In such case the fibrils assume pathological conformation of templating patient material, allowing studying the differences and discriminating pathological αSyn aggregates in PD and MSA (Shahnawaz et al., 2020). αSyn PFFs are purified prion-like, self-templating and transmittable aggregates of misfolded αSyn, which can induce formation of Lewy Body-like inclusions and cellular dysfunction both in in vitro and in vivo models (Er et al., 2020; Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020). αSyn PFFs are formed by bacteria-expressed purified recombinant monomeric αSyn incubated at high concentration at 37°C with shaking for up to seven days, during which time it folds into elongated fibrils, exhibiting amyloid and self templating properties. Obtained fibrils are subsequently sonicated to form short, about 50 nm in length, fragments, most efficient at seeding pathology (Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020; Figure 1A). Formation of fibrils in vitro can be easily monitored to investigate initial steps in this putatively nucleation-dependent process. For example, conversion of monomeric αSyn into pathogenic αSyn PFFs involves the preceding step of liquid-liquid phase separation, which can be fostered by PD linked mutations or heavy metal interaction (Ray et al., 2020). Understanding of the de novo αSyn PFFs formation and ability to monitor it is of obvious value for the development of drugs targeting this process. In vitro PFF model is also useful for testing compounds aiming to dissociate fibrils or inhibit their growth to avoid formation of putatively more toxic αSyn oligomers. Several such compounds (e.g. anle138b, NPT200-11, ENT-01, memantine and others) are currently in different phases of clinical trials. αSyn PFFs were also used to study neuronal uptake of misfolded αSyn, which was shown to be receptor-mediated, albeit alternative hypotheses have also been proposed, such as direct penetration of membrane, adsorptive-mediated endocytosis or transmission through tunneling nanotubes or exosomes (Fouka et al., 2020). After uptake, αSyn PFFs localize in lysosomal compartment and partial lysosomal processing might actually enhance or even be required for αSyn PFFs pathogenicity in cells (Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020; Figure 1). However, it is still not clear how exactly αSyn PFFs are processed and how they are released to cytoplasm and, possibly, also to extracellular space. Several studies highlight the role of extracellular exosomes in promoting the spread of misfolded αSyn; moreover, elevated levels of αSyn in neuronal exosomes isolated from patients’ serum emerge as a promising diagnostic biomarker of early PD (Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020; Jiang et al., 2020). However, additional studies are needed to resolve what type of autophagy/lysosomal pathway modulation will be beneficial and which might be ineffective or even harmful. We have recently utilized αSyn PFFs in vitro in primary dopaminergic neurons and in vivo in mouse to demonstrate protection against formation of αSyn deposits by stimulation of GDNF/RET signaling at early time points after αSyn PFF uptake, presumably through modulation of endo-lysosomal pathway (Chmielarz et al., 2020). Indeed, several molecules, such as ambroxol and venglustat, modulating lysosomal function by affecting levels and activity of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase are currently being tested in clinical trials for PD treatment. When applied to neuronal cultures, including primary and human induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons, αSyn PFFs induce accumulation of insoluble intracellular deposits which maturate over time, increasing their resemblance to Lewy Bodies (Mahul-Mellier et al., 2020). Application of αSyn PFFs to neurons cultured in microfluidic chambers allows to dissect cell-to-cell transmission of pathological aggregates and to demonstrate the effectiveness of antibodies targeting extracellular αSyn or putative αSyn receptors in blocking this process. When αSyn PFFs are injected into the brain parenchyma, similar deposits are observed in anatomically connected areas (Arotcarena et al., 2020; Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020), resembling the spreading behavior of pathology in PD patients (Horsager et al., 2020). Importantly, formation and spreading of αSyn PFFs induced deposits through neuronal connections is dependent on endogenous αSyn, and the extent of pathology varies between neuronal types (Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020). Application of αSyn PFFs to primary mouse midbrain neuronal cultures or human stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons allows monitoring accumulation of αSyn deposits and their effects on survival of PD-relevant dopaminergic neurons in vitro and in humanized rats (Er et al., 2020; Hoban et al., 2020). Sensitivity of αSyn PFF induced pathology to endogenous αSyn levels makes αSyn PFF based models ideally suited to test the effectiveness of ASOs, PROTACs or gene therapy aimed at lowering expression or promoting degradation of αSyn. The biggest limitation of αSyn PFFs model is that seeded deposits only modestly impair neuronal function and survival, the latter only after prolonged period of time (Mahul-Mellier et al., 2020), complicating testing of survival-promoting agents. Different research groups have reported variable effects of PFFs on cell survival. This could be partially because of technical difficulties in standardizing PFF preparations and batch-to-batch variations. However, delayed and modest effects on cell survival seem to be more in line with actual slow PD progression in humans. Actually, the mechanism by which pathological αSyn cause cell death remains elusive, although recent data suggest that this process is driven by formation of pathological deposits resembling Lewy Bodies containing not only αSyn but also fragments of membranous organelles (Mahul-Mellier et al., 2020). Understanding how αSyn pathology contributes to neuronal death could allow to design therapies aimed at increasing survival of cells already afflicted with αSyn pathology, such as neurotrophic factors or small molecules mimetics (Chmielarz et al., 2020). From the perspective of drug discovery, αSyn PFF models have advantages of being adaptable to multi-well plate formats with automatized quantification in dopaminergic neurons (Er et al., 2020). While still not feasible for use in high throughput screening campaigns, they can allow for functional validation of promising therapeutics in a physiologically relevant model allowing for monitoring αSyn aggregation and dopaminergic cell survival. Subsequently, therapies can be further validated in αSyn PFF based models in stem cell-derived human dopaminergic neurons and in vivo for long term effectiveness at slowing the spread of pathology and for behavioral outcomes (Hoban et al., 2020). Thanks to progressive nature of αSyn PFF in vivo model, it could also be used to identify a time window for effective treatment. Moreover, by varying the site of αSyn PFF injection (e.g. brain versus duodenum) (Arotcarena et al., 2020), we can verify the effectiveness of treatments in putative brain-first or body-first subtypes of PD (Horsager et al., 2020). Lastly, in vivo αSyn PFF models will be useful for development of PET tracers for longitudinal assessment of αSyn pathology in PD patients. When developed, such imaging tools would be extremely useful both for monitoring of clinical trials and early diagnosis of the disease. Overall, αSyn PFFs allow to study both pathophysiology of PD and the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches in physiologically relevant cellular and in vivo models, amenable to both meticulous investigations of mechanisms driving Lewy Body formation and spread, and screening and efficacy validation of compounds blocking these processes. While we still have many questions related to αSyn misfolding and pathology progression (Figure 1B), αSyn PFFs have been and will be very instrumental for helping researchers to find answers to these questions. Not surprisingly, αSyn PFFs elicit great hopes as a reliable and robust tool to model pathological protein aggregation in PD research and have seen extensive adoption in the field.

      "abstract": "The developmental epilepsies are distinctive in that they occur in a dynamic and plastic substrate. A variety of acquired insults may present with remarkably similar seizure syndromes that are age-specific and evolve with time. This evolution may be a consequence of the brain injury itself or an alteration of normal brain maturation due to an unfavorable electrical environment. Idiopathic epilepsies are now being correlated with specific gene defects, particularly those involving ion channels and/or neurotransmitter receptors. Despite this specificity, idiopathic seizure syndromes may be caused by mutations in different genes or different mutations in the same gene, and particular syndromes may manifest heterogeneous clinical seizure types. Not all localization-dependent epilepsies are symptomatic, as a growing number of genes have been identified with partial seizure syndromes. Febrile seizures probably do not represent a homogeneous entity, but multiple disorders that may be associated with developmental abnormalities and various coexisting seizure types.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

MDSs most frequently occur in neonates, infants, or juveniles and more rarely in adolescents or adults. Mutated genes phenotypically presenting with adult-onset MDS include POLG1, TK2, TyMP, RRM2B, or PEO1/twinkle. Adult MDS manifest similarly to early-onset MDS, as myopathy, encephalo-myopathy, hepato-cerebral syndrome, or with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), fatigue, or only minimal muscular manifestations. Diagnostic work-up or treatment is not at variance from early-onset cases. Histological examination of muscle may be normal but biochemical investigations may reveal multiple respiratory chain defects. The outcome appears to be more favorable in adult than in early-onset forms. Mitochondrial depletion syndromes is not only a condition of neonates, infants, or juveniles but rarely also occurs in adults, presenting with minimal manifestations or manifestations like in the early-onset forms. Outcome of adult-onset MDS appears more favorable than early-onset MDS.",

      "abstract": "A myogenic palsy is a form of paralytic strabismus in which the weakness of ocular movement is due to a primary problem affecting the muscle itself rather than one disrupting the nerve supply or causing mechanical restriction. This chapter discusses the following conditions under myogenic palsies: myasthenia gravis; Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS); chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO); orbital myositis; and rhabdomyosarcoma. The ocular symptoms and signs, for myasthenia, are the same whether the disease is confined to the eye muscles or if the eye involvement is one aspect of systemic disease. In patients with life-threatening breathing or swallowing difficulty, plasmaphoresis along with human immunoglobulin can reduce the level of circulating antibodies. LEMS is a disorder of neuromuscular transmission that differs from myasthenia in that the transmission defect is presynaptic rather than postsynaptic. CPEO may occur alone or in association with a variety of systemic disorders.",

Deficits in voice initiation or coordination of resonation with speech that occur without significant neuromuscular impairment following a lesion to Broca's area are compatible with a motor speech programming disorder, or apraxia of speech. Conversely, damage to upper or lower motor neurons subserving motor speech results in a group of neuromuscular speech disorders, the dysarthrias, which have signs including aberrations of phonation and resonation which can be differentiated. The neuropathologic and perceptual characteristics of neurogenic dysphonia are elucidated, and suggestions are provided for their identification and differentiation.",

As an important public-health problem, insomnia requires accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.

Polysomnography is indicated when a sleep-related breathing disorder or periodic limb movement disorder is suspected, initial diagnosis is uncertain, treatment fails, or precipitous arousals occur with violent or injurious behavior. However, polysomnography is not indicated for the routine evaluation of transient insomnia, chronic insomnia, or insomnia associated with psychiatric disorders.",

      "abstract": "A specific cognitive status epilepticus (e.g. aphasic status epilepticus) can occur occasionally, but the commoner and best known of purely or mainly cognitive manifestations are those subsumed under the term nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). This corresponds to a prolonged alteration of the mental state with continuous or sub-continuous generalized spikes or spike-wave discharges on the EEG. The prototype is absence status (petit mal status, spike-wave stupor, minor epileptic status),13,14 where there is clouding of awareness but, presumably, no specific cognitive deficit. Apathy, drowsiness, slowness, inattention, perplexity, strange affect, amnesia, slow speech are the most obvious abnormal behaviors. It is not clear to what degree higher-level mental functions are truly preserved and what new memories can be formed during these episodes: detailed studies are rare.15These NCSE can be phases in primary generalized epilepsies, but may be manifestations of complex partial status epilepticus of temporal or frontal origin.15 In temporal partial status epilepticus, only limited purposeful organized activity and responses to outside stimuli are possible and there is usually a total amnesia for the period. The epileptic nature is recognized by the presence, often subtle, of automatic motor behavior and vegetative phenomena.16,17 A special form of frequent refractory nonconvulsive partial status epilepticus, associated with ring chromosome 20, is probably of frontal origin and, because it is so frequent, should allow exploration of the affected and preserved behaviors and memories during seizures.18,19",

Serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways are also affected. However, It has been recognized that nondopaminergic and non-motor symptoms are sometimes present prior to diagnosis and these inevitably emerge with disease progression, impacting on morbidity, quality of life and mortality. The non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease continue to be poorly recognized and inadequately treated in contrast with motor symptoms, and a modern holistic approach to treatment of Parkinson's disease should therefore include recognition and assessment of non-motor symptoms. Certain aspects of the non-motor symptoms complex of Parkinson's disease can be improved with currently available treatments, but other features may be more refractory and require research into effective nondopaminergic drug therapies for the future.",

It represents a primarily geriatric syndrome that may be caused by one of several underlying conditions. There is insufficient evidence to support universal screening for cognitive impairment in older adults; however, clinicians should be alert to patient and caregiver concerns about cognitive changes and investigate such concerns with validated cognitive assessment tools. Alzheimer disease is the leading cause and prototypical form of dementia, presenting insidiously and causing progressive cognitive impairment with increasing severity over a period of years. Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia and often co-occurs with other progressive cognitive disorders. Lewy body dementias encompass Parkinson disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, which have similar features and are differentiated primarily by the order of motor and cognitive symptom onset. Frontotemporal dementias occur earlier than other forms of dementia, progress rapidly, and often have a genetic component. An understanding of the conditions that cause dementia will assist clinicians in making an accurate diagnosis and providing appropriate treatment recommendations and counseling regarding the diagnosis and prognosis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The metabolic and anatomical substrate of most forms of mental retardation is not known. Because the basis of normal brain function is not sufficiently understood, the basis of abnormal function is understood poorly. Even in disorders where the fundamental biochemical defect is known, such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and other enzyme defects, the exact basis for brain dysfunction is uncertain. The outcome for treated PKU, galactosemia, homocystinuria, and lysosomal disorders is not yet optimal. The various forms of nonketotic hyperglycinemia often respond poorly to current therapy. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures, such as deficient synthesis of serine or creatine and impaired glucose transport into the brain, and disorders with variable malformations, such as Smith‐Lemli‐Opitz (SLO) syndrome and the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures and disorders with variable malformations may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Simple tests of urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid may lead to a diagnosis, accurate genetic counseling, and better treatment. Metabolic brain imaging (magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)) has also helped to reveal biochemical abnormalities within the brain. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

It falls into the category of neurodegenerative disease, which also includes Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other Parkinson-related diseases. Though these diseases have overlapping symptomologies - such as cognitive impairment and neuromuscular dysfunction - they can be differentiated from one another based on the time course of the illness and the specific constellation of signs and symptoms. Our case report describes a patient who was found to have sCJD after months of treatment for Parkinson's disease and trigeminal neuralgia.

However, in adolescence, psychotic symptoms are more likely to occur in a range of emotional and other disorders, in addition to major psychotic disorders. Paranoid experiences occur along a continuum in the adolescent and can be transient, and many respond to psychological approaches. By contrast, schizophrenia, a serious psychiatric disorder, that involves multi-system disturbances of perception, thinking, volition and cognition, is extremely rare before the age of ten. However, the incidence rises steadily through adolescence to reach a peak in early adult life to become one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Childhood and adolescent-onset schizophrenia share many characteristics with the later onset forms, but are more severe with early neurodevelopment abnormalities and a poorer response to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive disorder that is the leading genetic cause of infantile death. SMA is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, leading to weakness and muscle atrophy. SMA occurs as a result of homozygous deletion or mutations in Survival Motor Neuron-1 (SMN1). Loss of SMN1 leads to a dramatic reduction in SMN protein, which is essential for motor neuron survival. SMA disease severity ranges from extremely severe to a relatively mild adult onset form of proximal muscle atrophy. Severe SMA patients typically die mostly within months or a few years as a consequence of respiratory insufficiency and bulbar paralysis. SMA is widely known as a motor neuron disease; however, there are numerous clinical reports indicating the involvement of additional peripheral organs contributing to the complete picture of the disease in severe cases. In this review, we have compiled clinical and experimental reports that demonstrate the association between the loss of SMN and peripheral organ deficiency and malfunction. Whether defective peripheral organs are a consequence of neuronal damage/muscle atrophy or a direct result of SMN loss will be discussed.",

Bij kinderen met CP kunnen problemen op het gebied van visuele waarneming in het oog en/of in de hersenen gelokaliseerd zijn. Oculaire Visuele Inperking (OVI) heeft betrekking op die vormen van slechtziendheid welke samenhangen met oogheelkundige aandoeningen. Cerebrale Visuele Inperking (CVI) kan omschreven worden als een visuele stoornis als gevolg van al dan niet aantoonbare schade aan een of meerdere hersengebieden na het chiasma opticum of aan slechtziendheid waar geen oculaire verklaring voor bestaat. CVI kan veroorzaakt worden door het hypoxische-ischemisch letsel. Daarnaast kunnen prematuriteit, hydrocefalus, epilepsie en beschadigingen aan het centraal zenuwstel, CVI tot gevolg hebben. De klinische symptomen van CVI kunnen zich manifesteren in onder andere visueel sensorische symptomen, oculomotorische symptomen en hogere visuele symptomen. Een ander opvallend kenmerk is verminderde gezichtsscherpte zonder oogheelkundige verklaring. CVI kan samengaan met oogheelkundige afwijkingen zoals strabismus, optische atrofie en nystagmus. Daarnaast doen visuele problemen zich met name voor op het gebied van de hogere cognitieve processen als herkenning, orientatie, diepte-perceptie, gelijktijdige perceptie van beweging en visuele waarneming. Kinderen met CVI kunnen bijvoorbeeld moeite hebben met het vinden van de looproutes en de overgang van licht naar donker. Als gevolg van CVI kunnen functioneringsproblemen in het dagelijks leven ontstaan maar ook problemen in het gedrag en motorische ontwikkeling van kinderen. Deze problemen kunnen op verschillende manieren tot uiting komen omdat CVI samen kan voorkomen met andere problemen, zoals gedragsproblemen, epilepsie of problemen op het gebied van aandacht en concentratie.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been found to exceed prevalence rates in the geriatric population. Anxiety occurs more frequently in PD than in most other medical illnesses of comparable disability. Thus, anxiety may be etiologically related to the neurobiological changes that accompany PD and not simply a behavioral reaction to chronic disability. The anxiety disorder in PD tends to be panic, phobic, or generalized anxiety disorder. It can be a manifestation of an \"off\" state, can be worsened by motor fluctuations, or can occur independently from—and even precede—motor manifestations. Anxiety in PD may be directly related to dopaminergic deficit or may be the result of imbalance in other neurochemical pathways. The neurotransmitters primarily implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety are norepinephrine, serotonin, and γ-aminobutyric acid, as well as some neuropeptides. The key to successful management of anxiety in PD is its early recognition. A \"team approach\" to treatment that includes pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures, such as education, counseling, and stress-reduction strategies, is most beneficial, particularly in a complex illness where motor and behavioral dysfunction are often intertwined and tend to affect each other. Well-designed studies that address the pharmacological management of anxiety in PD are needed. Nonetheless, based on clinical experience, the effective agents for primary anxiety disorders seem comparably efficacious in PD-related anxiety.",

      "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and they represent a major source of disease burden. Several non-motor manifestations, such as rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, olfactory loss, gastrointestinal abnormalities, visual alterations, cognitive and mood disorders, are known to precede the onset of motor signs. Nonetheless, the mechanisms mediating these alterations are poorly understood and probably involve several neurotransmitter systems. The dysregulation of GABAergic system has received little attention in PD, although the spectrum of non-motor symptoms might be linked to this pathway. This Mini Review aims to provide up-to-date information about the involvement of the GABAergic system for explaining non-motor manifestations in early stages of PD. Therefore, special attention is paid to the clinical data derived from patients with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder or drug-naïve patients with PD, as they represent prodromal and early stages of the disease, respectively. This, in combination with animal studies, might help us to understand how the disturbance of the GABAergic system is related to non-motor manifestations of PD.",

PD is a common neurology-related disorder after Alzheimer's. Reduction of dopaminergic cells and increased iron deposition in the SN of the midbrain are the primary pathophysiologic causes of tremors, bradykinesia and rigidity. Motor symptoms are seen due to loss of dopamine, whereas nonmotor symptoms are through cholinergic, serotoninergic or noradrenergic systems. This neurodegenerative disease is also called a subtype of synucleinopathy. A protein called alpha-synuclein is abnormally accumulated in the brain leading to the destruction of brain cells resulting in PD-specific symptoms. Clinically and pathologically many neurodegenerative diseases mimic each other and the most common being the close resemblance of PD being mimicked as Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, however, a different protein known as tau protein accumulates in brain cells. Thus, clinical presentations differ predominantly, and dementia is the presentation of Alzheimer's disease, whereas tremors and imbalance would be the presentation of PD [1].",

      "title": "Pathological correlates of cognitive decline in Parkinson’s disease: from molecules to neural networks",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the appearance of protein aggregates in neuronal cell bodies composed predominantly of alpha-synuclein, known as Lewy bodies. PD is now recognized as a multisystem disorder characterized by severe motor impairment and various non-motor symptoms. Cognitive decline is one of the most common and worrisome non-motor symptoms. Moderate cognitive impairment (CI), diagnosed already in the early stages of PD, usually leads to deep dementia. The main types of CI observed in PD include executive dysfunction, attention, and memory disfunction, visuospatial decline, and verbal deficits. According to the literature, the following mechanisms play a significant role in the development of cognitive dysfunctions in PD: (1) changes in the conformational structure of synaptic proteins; (2) disruption of synaptic transmission; (3) neuroinflammation (pathological activation of neuroglia); (4) mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress; (5) metabolic conditions; (6) functional remodeling of the neural networks. The listed molecular and synaptic changes in the brain can lead to the death of dopamine-synthesizing cells of the substantia nigra and dysfunction of other mediator systems, as well as partial cellular atrophy in the neocortex and subcortical nuclei. As a result, the functioning of neural networks involved in the transmission of information related to the regulation of motor activity and cognitive functions is disrupted. Elucidation of the causes of changes occurring in PD and the search for methods to eliminate them will help create new approaches in the treatment of this disease. The aim of the review is to analyze the pathological processes in the brain that underlie the onset of cognitive impairment in PD. The review analyzes the data obtained both from studies on patients with PD and animal (rodents and primates) models of this disease used for the evaluation of the mechanisms underlying etiology and the development of PD in humans.",

      "title": "The need for neuroprotective therapies in Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Slowing of disease progression remains a major unmet need in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Multiple factors are responsible for progression of disability in this disorder including worsening of cardinal motor features due to progressive nigral pathology, the evolution of poorly levodopa-responsive symptoms like freezing, postural instability and falls as well as motor complications of sustained treatment with levodopa. In addition, non-motor symptoms including cognitive decline, autonomic failure, sleep disorders and pain become increasingly prevalent with advancing disease and add to the overall burden of this disease. So far no treatment has been shown to significantly retard the progression of overall disability, and neuroprotective trials have been limited by design issues and a narrow focus on rates of decline of motor scores or imaging markers of nigrostriatal dysfunction only. Current evidence suggests that it may soon be possible to define populations at increased risk to develop PD and thus to target the \"preclinical\" phase of PD for neuroprotection. Such future trials will test intervention for their ability to prevent or retard the development of clinically overt PD in at-risk individuals.",

The burden of NMS tends to increase with age and disease severity and, in the very advanced stage of disease, NMS such as urinary problems, drooling, somnolence, psychosis, and dementia dominate the clinical phenotype. Moreover, the dopaminergic treatment used for the motor symptoms of PD can arise or worsen a number of NMS, including orthostatic hypotension, nausea, sleep disturbances, hallucinations, or impulsive compulsive behaviors.

This predisposition to affective episodes, rather than the episodes themselves (which can have many causes), is arguably the hallmark of bipolar disorder. Most episodes of bipolar disorder, including the first episode, are depressive. This exposes an inherent flaw in our nosological system, which requires a manic or hypomanic episode for diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Treatment of a depressive episode in undiagnosed bipolar disorder can entail the use of medications that were developed to treat a different disorder (major depressive illness) and that may have mood-destabilizing or activating properties.",

      "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndrome that spans the area between normal ageing and dementia. It is classified into amnestic and non-amnestic types, both with two subtypes: single domain and multiple domains. Prevalence of MCI depends on criteria and population and can vary from 0.1 to 42% persons of older age. In contrast to dementia, cognitive deterioration is less severe and activities of daily living are preserved. Most impaired higher cognitive functions in MCI are memory, executive functions, language, visuospatial functions, attention etc. Also there are depression, apathy or psychomotor agitation, and signs of psychosis. Aetiology of MCI is multiple, mostly neurodegenerative, vascular, psychiatric, internistic, neurological, traumatic and iatrogenic. Persons with amnestic MCI are at a higher risk of converting to Alzheimer's disease, while those with a single non-memory domain are at risk of developing frontotemporal dementia. Some MCI patients also progress to other dementia types, vascular among others. In contrast, some patients have a stationary course, some improve, while others even normalize. Every suspicion of MCI warrants a detailed clinical exploration to discover underlying aetiology, laboratory analyses, neuroimaging methods and some cases require a detailed neuropsychological assessment. At the present time there is no efficacious therapy for cognitive decline in MCI or the one that could postpone conversion to dementia. The treatment of curable causes, application of preventive measures and risk factor control are reasonable measures in the absence of specific therapy.",

      "abstract": "Migraine is amongst the oldest of diseases known to mankind. Migraine is a heterogenous entity, usually characterised by periodic attacks of headache on one or both sides of the head. These may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, increased sensitivity of the eyes to light (photophobia), increased sensitivity to sound (phonophobia), dizziness, blurred vision, cognitive disturbances, and other symptoms. Migraines are not always preceded by an aura and some migraines may not include headache. If migraine does not manifest itself in the form of headache but in some other form such as paroxysmal episodes of prolonged visual auras, atypical sensory, motor, or visual aura, confusion, dysarthria, focal neurologic deficits with or without a headache, it is labelled a Migraine Variant (MV). MV is therefore diagnosed by the history of paroxysmal symptoms with or without cephalgia and a prior history of migraine with aura, in the absence of other medical disorders that may contribute to the symptoms. Many of the MVs have been included and redefined in the revised edition of The International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-II) 2004 classification. These include hemiplegic migraine, basilar migraine, childhood periodic syndromes, retinal migraine, complicated migraine and ophthalmoplegic migraine. Even though conditions such as vertiginous migraine, acute confusional migraine of childhood and nocturnal migraine are well recognized entities, they have not yet been included in IHCD-II, but will be discussed here in brief because they are relatively common conditions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The classical term “pituitary apoplexy” (PA) describes a clinical syndrome usually characterized by abrupt onset of headache accompanied by neurologic and/or endocrinologic deterioration due to sudden expansion of a mass within the sella turcica as a result of hemorrhage or infarction within a pituitary tumor and adjacent pituitary gland. PA is a medical emergency and a difficult diagnosis to establish. Thus this article reviews the presenting symptoms of PA patients to help clinicians recognize or at least suspect this critical condition early on. PA commonly occurs in the setting of a preexisting adenoma, and several patients are unaware of its existence prior to the onset of apoplexy symptoms, which are mainly of a neurologic, ophthalmologic, and endocrinologic nature. Neurologic symptoms include sudden-onset severe headache and other symptoms of subarachnoid hemorrhage, symptoms from compression of the cavernous sinus contents, nausea/vomiting, impaired consciousness, and symptoms of meningeal irritation. Ophthalmologic symptoms include visual field defects, visual loss, diplopia, and ophthalmoplegia. Endocrinologic disturbances include pituitary adenoma symptoms, cortisol deficiency, panhypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus, and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Magnetic resonance imaging is the imaging method of choice to aid the PA diagnosis. Its differential diagnoses include cerebrovascular accidents, infectious diseases, and other causes of endocrinologic imbalance. Transsphenoidal surgery is the treatment of choice, especially if there are associated visual abnormalities and ophthalmoplegia. Clinicians should be aware of the presenting symptoms because early diagnosis may reduce the morbidity and mortality of this neurosurgical emergency.",

From the moment clinicians first see patients, they quite naturally notice many things about their motor behavior: body posture, degree of muscle tension, amount of fidgeting or pacing and facial expression. The muscles of the eye and face are innervated by cranial nerves that originate in the brain. Consequently, disturbances in facial or eye muscle functioning provide crucial clues about whether individua's difficulties originate in the nervous system outside the brain or within brain. Neurological soft signs are subtle, lifelong abnormalities in motor and sensory functioning that are likely caused by imperfect embryonic development or minor, early brain injury. “Automatic behavior” refers to rote movement behaviors that are carried out by individuals in an altered state of consciousness.

      "abstract": "Les signes neurologiques mineurs (SNM) sont des marqueurs aujourd’hui bien reconnus dans la schizophrénie, présents à un moindre degré chez les apparentés. Leur signification et leur spécificité reste néanmoins incertaines. Des aspects méthodologiques pourraient expliquer certaines de ces incertitudes (échelles variables selon les publications, méthodes de cotation sensible ou non au changement, types de signes pris en comptes etc) [1]. Les corrélats des SNM peuvent apporter des éléments de réponses sur leur origine et leur signification. Nous avons ainsi montré que la SNM sont associés à une moindre performance cognitive, à plus d’erreurs dans les tâches oculomotrices, notamment dans des tâches de saccades adaptatives [2], ainsi à une altération du circuit préfronto cérébelleux [3], suggérant un dysfonctionnement cérébelleux. Par ailleurs, nous avons également montré que les patients ayant des SNM ont une altération de la morphologie corticale, avec une moindre gyrification corticale, témoignant de l’origine développementale des SNM [4]. Enfin, nous avons montré récemment que les SNM sont plus marqués chez les sujets présentant un début des troubles précoces, avant l’adolescence (avant 15 ans), comparés à ceux présentant un trouble débutant à l’âge adulte, suggérant à nouveau que les SNM sont les marqueurs d’une forme à charge développementale plus importante. L’association des SNM avec un âge de début précoce et des anomalies structurales touchant en particulier les circuits cérébelleux, suggère que les SNM pourraient permettre d’identifier un sous-type de schizophrénie précoce, et interroge sur un continuum avec les troubles du spectre autistique.",

These symptoms are attributable to disruption of vestibular processing in the temporoparietal cortex or associated limbic structures. Neurological dysfunction at high altitude is usually ascribed to high altitude cerebral edema or acute mountain sickness. However, transient neurological symptoms occur abruptly at more extreme altitudes, often following vigorous exertion, without overt altitude-induced prodromes. These symptoms may be caused by intense neuronal discharge or neuronal synchronization as a feature of epileptic discharges or cortical spreading depression. Transient high altitude neurological dysfunction should be recognized as a separate complication of extreme altitude, distinct from high altitude cerebral edema.",

The latter group can be referred to as hypokinesia (decreased amplitude of movement), but bradykinesia (slowness of movement) and akinesia (loss of movement) are common alternatives. The parkinsonian syndromes are the most common cause of paucity of movement; other hypokinetic disorders represent only a small group of patients. Movement disorders are conveniently divided into parkinsonism and all other types.

      "abstract": "We describe 7 children with myoclonic encephalopathy of infants (MEI). MEI is a clinical entity characterized by an acute or subacute onset of polymyoclonia, cerebellar ataxia and opsoclonus (\"dancing eyes\"). It occurs either spontaneously, following an infectiuos illness or in association with an occult neuroblastoma. It is likely that immunological factors play a role in the pathogenesis. Steroid therapy resulted in rapid dramatic improvement of the neurological symptoms in 4 cases. However, this initial response did not correlate with the eventual outcome. We reviewed the literature to compare 45 reported cases of MEI associated with a neuroblastoma with 48 children without such a tumor to identify possible differences in clinical presentation, response to steroid medication and long-term prognosis of the neurological syndrome. In this respect we found no differences. Impairment of motor, verbal or intellectual performance were reported in at least half the cases. Although an immediate and marked response to steroids occurs in many cases of both groups, it remains unclear whether the long-term outcome is favourably influenced by this medication. The two-year-survival rate (90%) in the neuroblastoma group and the percentage of mediastinal localisation of the tumor (49%) are much higher compared with neuroblastomas without MEI. The reasons for these remarkable differences are not known. Diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic implications justify the separation of MEI from the more common and benign syndrome known as acute cerebellar ataxia of childhood.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

Patients with neurological impairment, subtle cognitive dysfunctions, or psychiatric disorders (including dementia and primary depression) show a high incidence of abnormal values. The magnitude of the deviations increases with clinical severity. Different disorders are characterized by distinctive profiles of abnormal values of brain electrical features. Computerized differential classification of some of these disorders can be achieved with high accuracy. Such classification, providing objective corroboration of brain dysfunctions, may be a useful adjunct to psychiatric diagnosis, which relies primarily on subjective clinical impressions.

Some NMS may antedate the diagnosis of PD. Examples of NMS include cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, visual dysfunction, sleep abnormalities and psychiatric disorders. NMS are associated with wide-ranging abnormalities in extranigral dopaminergic systems and non-dopaminergic (e.g. cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic) systems. The type and severity of NMS vary based on age, disease severity and predominant motor symptoms. NMS can be disabling and reduce quality of life. Treatment of NMS can be challenging. Some NMS are helped by dopaminergic treatment, whereas others can be induced or exacerbated by treatments that help the motor dysfunction. Physicians should probe their PD patients about their NMS and address them for better care. Clinical trials should incorporate NMS as outcomes for more meaningful conclusions on the effect of treatments under investigation.",

We investigated whether ROP, mild or severe, is associated with neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) in extremely preterm children. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study in southern Taiwan. A total of 394 children &amp;#x3c;28 weeks of gestation who survived to discharge from 2011 to 2018 received neurodevelopmental assessment at corrected age of 24 months. Severe ROP was defined as ROP of stages 2 plus or worse, or recipients of retinal therapy, and mild ROP as stage 1 or 2 in at least one eye. NDI was defined as cognitive or motor impairment using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, moderate to severe cerebral palsy, or profound hearing loss. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Among the 374 children validated for analysis, 157 children (42%) had non-ROP, 145 (39%) mild ROP, and 72 (19%) severe ROP. As ROP severity increased progressively from non-ROP, to mild ROP, and to severe ROP, the rates of NDI increased from 25%, to 46%, and to 61%. The multivariable logistic regression showed that the model included three levels of ROP, and neonatal morbidities achieved better overall performance for NDI than the model that included neonatal morbidities alone. Compared with non-ROP, mild ROP and severe ROP had adjusted odds ratios of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.10–3.28) and 2.75 (95% CI: 1.33–5.67) for NDI, respectively. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Mild ROP and severe ROP are independent neonatal morbidities associated with NDI. Neurodevelopmental follow-up of extremely preterm children with any stage of ROP is needed.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a disease of insidious onset.The symptoms usually come on slowly over time.(1).Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects an area of the brain-Substantia nigra.This is age related and non-reversible disease.It mainly affects the motor system and to some extent non-motor system is also involved.Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease.It is a progressive disease, which is usually slow.At the onset the most obvious are shaking rigidity, slowness of movements and difficulty with walking and writing.The main motor symptoms are collectively called Parkinsonism or Parkinson's syndrome.Non-motor symptoms are also seen.Thinking and behavioural problems may occur early.(2).Depression and anxiety are also common-occurs in more than one-third of Parkinson's disease.Dementia becomes common in the advanced stage of the disease.Other symptoms are sensory, sleep and emotional problems.The disease is more common in male than female by a ratio of 2: 1.There are two basic types of Parkinson's disease.They are-(1) Idiopathic, and (2) Secondary.Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is more common.In idiopathic Parkinson's disease cause is not known, but genetic and environmental factors are involved.Those with a family history are more prone to suffer from the disease.However, no effective therapy exists till date.The treatment is directed to improve symptoms and slow the progress of the disease.As the disease progresses neurons continue to be lost, these medications become ineffective.Focus of current research is to increase awareness for Parkinson's disease and try to prevent the disease to occur and early diagnosis and management to improve quality of life of patients.The aim is to describe pathophysiology and historical perspective and aware that person suffering from Parkinson's disease can live a normal life.An English doctor James Parkinson published the first detailed description of the disease-\"An Essay of the Shaking Palsy\" in 1817-the disease is named after him-Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "Purpose of review In the central nervous system there are many regulatory processes controlling the lower urinary tract. This review considers the possibility that urinary dysfunction may precede diagnosis of neurological disease. Recent findings Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) occur early in multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and normal pressure hydrocephalus, and may present before neurological diagnosis. Some people present with LUTS and subsequently are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or a spinal condition. In male LUTS, the symptoms could reflect early stages of a neurological disease, which has not yet been diagnosed (‘occult neurology’). Key symptoms include erectile dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation, enuresis, loss of filling sensation or unexplained stress urinary incontinence. Directed questioning should enquire about visual symptoms, back pain, anosmia, bowel dysfunction and incontinence, or memory loss. Examination features can include resting tremor, ‘croaky’ speech, abnormal gait, orthostatic hypotension, ataxia, or altered perineal sensation. Imaging, such as MRI scan, should only be requested after expert neurological examination, to ensure the correct parts of the central nervous system are scanned with appropriate radiological protocols. Summary Urologists should consider an undiagnosed neurological condition can be present in a few cases. Any finding should be further evaluated by colleagues with relevant expertise.",

      "abstract": "The early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (idiopathic parkinsonism) is important for two reasons. Some never drugs possibly have a neuroprotective effect, which can be utilized maximally only with early onset of treatment. Moreover, diagnostic mistakes may occur early in the course of the disease. Although the hallmark of Parkinson's disease is a syndrome of movement disorders, slight cognitive deficits, depression, or pain with or without paresthesias can be present at an early stage. Therefore, symptoms at the time of the first diagnosis and at the beginning of the first clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease are often not identical. The diagnosis can be made only clinically, since no biological marker is available up to now. However, in unclear cases pharmacological tests constitute a valuable extension of the clinical examination.",

The pathological hallmarks of PD include loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta as well as the presence of abnormal protein deposits known as Lewy bodies in some of the surviving nigral neurons. The loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta results in striatal dopamine deficiency, which accounts for the motor impairments of patients with PD. Although the precise etiology remains unclear, several environmental and genetic factors have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of PD. This chapter will systematically discuss each of these factors and their putative pathogenic mechanisms.",

The polyneuropathic syndrome consists of typical symptoms like paraesthesias, pain, cramps and fasciculations as well as characteristic signs like loss of tendon reflexes, weakness and wasting of muscles, sensory loss, cranial nerve palsy and alterations of the autonomic nervous system. The analysis of manifestation-types is very important for the differential diagnosis. The symmetrical sensory type of manifestation can be found in the beginning of almost all toxic neuropathies as well as in uremic and diabetic neuropathy. The symmetrical-motor type of manifestation can be a further development of the symmetrical sensory type of manifestation or exists from the beginning in the case for example of Guillain-Barré-Syndrome. The asymmetric type of manifestation can be observed in the vascular neuropathies and in some types of inflammatory neuropathies like the neuroborrelioses or the neuralgic amyotrophy. The investigation of the CSF, electromyography and electroneurography as well as a great number of chemical lab tests are important for the etiological classification. According to the etiology, the polyneuropathies can be subdivided into four groups such as inflammatory, vascular, exotoxic and endotoxic-metabolic-hereditary diseases. The most frequent etiologies are diabetes mellitus and chronic alcoholism.",

The multiple aetiologies of these disorders are imperfectly understood, and tend to be grouped under the broad heading of cerebral palsy.\n\nCerebral palsy is usually defined as a non-progressive neurological syndrome caused by injury to the immature brain, although recent data have questioned whether the pathological progress is genuinely non-progressive.1 The predominant feature is motor impairment, although about half of the affected population will have significant cognitive or intellectual impairment, and these children comprise about 50% of the total number of those with severe mental retardation in the community.2 Associated features such as visual impairment, hearing loss, or feeding problems are common.\n\nThe birth prevalence of cerebral palsy shows geographical variations, but is generally in the range of 1.5-3 per 1000 live births.3 Trends in prevalence over time have been somewhat contradictory; a fall from 2.24 to 1.9 per 1000 occurred in Sweden between 1954-8 and 1967-70,4 whereas in Western Australia a significant rise from 2.2 to 2.5 per 1000 occurred over a similar period.5 However, in the past two decades most investigators have found a significant increase in the birth prevalence of cerebral palsy, due largely to an increase in the rates recorded for extremely small or preterm infants.6 There is some evidence that this increase is now being reversed.7 \n\nEpidemiological analysis has defined a large number of risk factors for cerebral palsy, including low birth weight, preterm birth, multiple pregnancy, neurological disorder in mother or sibling, thyroid disease or therapy during pregnancy, thyroid hormone deficiency in preterm infants, low placental weight, chorioamnionitis, birth asphyxia, and neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia.

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Die Huntington-Krankheit ist durch fortschreitende Beschwerden mit motorischen Beeinträchtigungen und kognitivem Abbau sowie Verhaltensauffälligkeiten gekennzeichnet. Die Ursache liegt in einer Verlängerung einer Triplett-Repeat-Sequenz in einem spezifischen Gen, Huntingtin-Gen genannt. Bei einer deutlich erhöhten Anzahl an Triplett-Repeats, kann die Erkrankung bereits im Jugend- oder jungen Erwachsenenalter beginnen. Eindrücklichstes motorisches Symptom ist die Chorea, die sich in Form von unwillkürlichen, plötzlichen, kurzen Bewegungen darstellt. Bereits vor dem Auftreten von motorischen Symptomen können Patienten kognitive Einschränkungen entwickeln. Die kognitiven Einschränkungen betreffen primär Exekutivfunktionen wie beispielsweise Problemlösen. Als dritter großer Symptombereich können in jedem Stadium der Erkrankung psychiatrische Störungen hinzukommen. Häufig leiden Patienten unter Depressionen, später kommen vermehrt Irritabilität oder Perseverationen vor. Das Genprodukt Huntingtin ist ubiquitär in allen Körperzellen vorhanden – man vermutet verschiedene Funktionen, die insbesondere in Neuronen wichtig zu sein scheinen. Aufgrund des autosomaldominanten Vererbungsmodus hat die prädiktive Diagnostik bei dieser Erkrankung einen wichtigen Stellenwert. Trotz der Entdeckung der genetischen Ursache vor nun 25 Jahren ist die Behandlung der Huntington-Krankheit gegenwärtig noch auf die Therapie der Symptome und den Erhalt von Funktionen beschränkt. Für die Huntington-Krankheit gibt es noch keine Behandlung, die eine weitere Krankheitsprogression bremsen oder den Krankheitsbeginn verzögern könnte. Allerdings gibt es Hoffnung – klinische Studien mit Therapieformen, die auf die genetische Ursache abzielen, sind bereits auf dem Weg.",

      "abstract": "Neurological diseases present with diverse and often complex symptomatology. Focal neurological signs such as paresis, aphasia or visual field deficits together with often serious general state of a neurological patient usually push auditory symptoms into the background. Here, we present a review of literature on central and peripheral auditory disturbances that can appear in the course of most common neurological diseases. We present: cerebral stroke, cochleovestibular nerve compression syndrome, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, myasthenia gravis and brain tumors. We focus on the neuroanatomical basis of auditory dysfunctions, their character and prevalence typical for the abovementioned diseases. Theoretical considerations are supported by broad audiological and neuroimaging studies of our patients. Auditory symptoms in neurological diseases seem to be rare. However, knowledge of these symptoms and their origin can be helpful in proper diagnosis and comprehensive patient management.",

Furthermore, both the disease process and the treatments of MS can adversely impact an individual's mental health.

      "abstract": "The dopamine deficiency syndrome Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and reduced postural reflexes. Conditions with similar symptoms but other causes than PD (about 1/3 of cases) are called atypical parkinsonism. From a neuropathological perspective, PD is associated with loss of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons (related to motor symptoms) and accumulation of alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies in the mid-brain. Nigro-striatal pathways may also be involved in atypical parkinsonism, but lesions in other parts of the brain/basal ganglions dominate. Parkinsonism may also be related to chronic cerebrovascular disease or use of drugs with extrapyramidal side effects.Articles retrieved from PubMed were reviewed to examine current knowledge on diseases other than PD that can induce parkinsonism.Diseases with atypical parkinsonism usually start more symmetric than PD and tremor is either not present or differs from the typical rest tremor seen in PD. An exception is corticobasal degeneration with very asymmetric symptoms. Other (plus-) symptoms in atypical parkinsonism are (early) falling tendency, dizziness upon change of position, coordination difficulties or early cognitive decline. The article describes the clinical characteristics of atypical parkinsonism, possibilities of improved diagnostics with supplementary examinations and alternative treatment strategies.",

      "title": "Symptomatic therapy in multiple sclerosis: Big pharma should do more—YES",
      "abstract": "1Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a wide variety of clinical phenotypes. This can range from asymptomatic to relapsing–remitting to progressive disease phases as well as an overlapping period in between each of these phases. Each phase can further be classified as being active or not active. 1 It is well known that patients may remain in each type indefinitely or for a variable period before progressing to the next clinical phenotype. Patients may develop residual neurological deficits either from the very beginning or later at any time during the course of the disease. Although a benign course may be seen in up to one-quarter of patients, even these may have some mild motor or sensory symptoms that may cause some discomfort, fatigue that may interfere with their daily living activities or cognitive changes leading to some limitations in their professional life. Most MS patients will end up having some residual neurological symptoms. Although the residual symptoms correlate with some disability steps in MS, this may not always be the case. For example, people without significant motor findings may also have other symptoms that, once properly managed, will ease that individual’s life. However, despite the large proportion of patients affected with a wide variety of neurologic symptoms, the number of available symptomatic treatments is limited and they are only partially effective. It is clear that some of these MS-related symptoms are not MS specific and may be seen as a result of other neurological (and non-neurological) disorders resulting in a much larger patient population that requires such therapies. Regarding the available symptomatic therapies and their efficacies, it becomes clear that this is a neglected area with a high need of new therapies. The emphasis in MS has almost always been on large trials to slow or eliminate the disability worsening by eliminating relapses or shortening the time to recovery after relapses. However, many patients still have residual symptoms after a relapse and continue to develop progressive symptoms despite the available treatments. Currently, there are 12 approved disease-modifying long-term therapies in MS; some others are expected to be approved soon and many more are in clinical trials. However, none offers a cure, but rather reduce clinical relapses and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) burden to a certain extent, with a less pronounced effect on long-term disability. These therapies continue to be effective in responders as long as they are used, but in some their efficacy may wear off over time. The higherefficacy disease-modifying therapies are also associated with more serious adverse events. So, it is clear that new treatments are needed for better long-term management of a progressive disease such as MS. The good news is that there are a large number of ongoing trials in this area, most sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry.",

Mittels neuropsychologischer Testverfahren konnen die betroffenen Domanen klinisch identifiziert und naher klassifiziert werden. Neben der Demenz finden sich bei den Patienten ebenfalls psychische und Verhaltenssymptome wie emotionale Verstimmungen, Depressionen, Angstzustande und vermehrte Aggressionsausbruche sowie Veranderungen der Personlichkeit. All diese Faktoren fuhren zu einer zunehmenden Beeintrachtigung und haben einen erheblichen Einfluss auf die Lebensqualitat nicht nur des Betroffenen, sondern fuhren ebenfalls zu einer zunehmenden Belastung der Angehorigen, verandern die Krankheitsprognose und stellen im fortgeschrittenen Stadium einen der wichtigsten Grunde fur eine Heimeinweisung dar. Bei vielen neurologischen Erkrankungen sind die neurologischen Kardinalsymptome bereits einer medikamentosen Behandlung zuganglich, wahrend dies bei den kognitiven Symptomen schwieriger ist. Derzeit sind nur vier Medikamente zur Behandlung der Demenz zugelassen (Cholinesterasehemmer: Donepezil, Galantamin, Rivastigmin und der NMDA-Antagonist Memantin), die aber uber die AlzheimerDemenz hinaus, meist keine Zulassung fur kognitive Storungen bei anderen neurologischen Erkrankungen besitzen. Die Studienlage ist fur die Cholinesterasehemmer und Memantin fur den Einsatz bei kognitiven Defiziten bei neurologischen Erkrankungen ungenugend.

      "abstract": "Abstract Anti‐immunoglobulin‐like cell adhesion molecule 5 (IgLON5) disease is an autoimmune encephalitis that targets the cell adhesion molecule, IgLON5. The disease presents with various clinical features, including sleep disorders, bulbar palsy, movement disorders, cognitive dysfunction and neuromuscular manifestations. Sleep disorders are characterized by parasomnias and sleep‐disordered breathing (stridor and sleep apnea). Bulbar palsy includes dysarthria, dysphagia, vocal cord paralysis and stridor. Movement disorders include a variety of symptoms and signs, such as chorea, dystonia, rigidity, tremor, myoclonus and myorhythmia. Cognitive dysfunction includes executive dysfunction, impairment of attention, and verbal and visual memory dysfunction. Neuromuscular manifestations include fasciculations in the tongue and peripheral muscles, limb weakness, and muscle atrophy. Some patients resemble those with neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. On video polysomnography, undifferentiated non‐rapid eye movement sleep and poorly structured N2 sleep are characteristic. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid studies are often normal or non‐specific. Human leukocyte antigen testing shows that HLA‐DRB1*10:01‐DQB1*05:01 is highly associated with the disease. Pathologically, neuronal deposition of both hyperphosphorylated 3‐repeat and 4‐repeat tau isoforms, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the hypothalamus, brainstem tegmentum, and upper cervical cord are observed. Some patients are responsive to immunotherapies, such as steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasma exchange therapy and rituximab. Factors associated with a favorable response to immunotherapies include early initiation of treatment, cerebrospinal fluid inflammation and immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) predominance of IgLON5 antibody compared with immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4). Anti‐IgLON5 disease should be suspected in patients with atypical movement disorders complicated by sleep disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Despite its imprecision, atypical parkinsonism is a useful clinical term. It unites a group of disorders linked by the predominant presence of bradykinesia, but where additional clinical features exclude Parkinson's disease (PD; hence the analogous but currently less-favored term Parkinson's plus). In most cases, disease progression is rapid and relentless and the response to dopaminergic drugs minimal or temporary. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is the most common example among the primary neurodegenerations, but a substantial number of cases are found at autopsy to have neurofibrillary tangle degeneration, or a combination of neocortical and subcortical Lewy bodies. Extensive subcortical cerebrovascular disease without additional neurodegenerative pathological change is another relatively common cause, but one that presents considerable diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Because so many of these pathologies carry a grim and hopeless prognosis, the delicate nuance of uncertainty implicit within the term atypical parkinsonism may be preferable to a more precise alternative clinical label. Nonetheless, names given to neurological disorders assume great importance, both within the medical profession and for those individuals who acquire them: \"giving a name to the enemy,\" however baleful, is often greeted, at least initially, with a sense of relief—\"better the devil you know!\"",

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

      "abstract": "Smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) abnormalities are commonly seen in Parkinson's disease (PD). Both reduced speed and saccades seen during SPEM, also known as saccadic pursuit (SP), have been studied in PD. A comprehensive literature review analyzed 26 studies of SPEM and PD. It appears that a greater proportion of PD patients have SPEM abnormalities consisting of reduced SPEM gain and/or SP compared to the normal population. It is not clear whether SPEM abnormalities are present early in the disease or begin sometime during disease progression. SPEM abnormalities may be correlated with disease severity but do not fluctuate or respond to dopaminergic medication in the same manner as other motor symptoms in PD. SPEM in PD is composed of normal SPEM interspersed with SP composed of both catch up and anticipatory saccades. This differs from other neurodegenerative disorders and may be related to an inability to inhibit extraneous saccades or to increased distraction reflecting executive dysfunction. Because the basal ganglia are involved in SPEM physiology, degeneration of the SNr neurons in PD may explain abnormal SPEM in this disorder. Since dementia, aging and medication effects influence SPEM, they should be controlled for in future studies of SPEM in PD. SP is easily detected on clinical exam and may be a biomarker for the disease or for disease progression. Oculomotor testing can be an important part of the Parkinson's exam.",

      "title": "Natural Neuroprotectives for the Management of Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Neurodegeneration is an umbrella term for the progressive loss of structure and/or function of neurons along with destruction of nerve cells. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most general neurodegenerative disorder that involves a decreased nigrostriatal availability of dopamine, resulting in motor impairment including bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. Currently, the exact cause of PD is unclear with no single factor accountable for neurodegeneration. It shows that several factors may contribute to its development, such as formation of reactive oxygen species, protein misfolding, and neuroinflammation. The deficiency of dopamine occurs due to loss of dopaminergic neurons and degradation of dopamine. Free radicals are generated after the degradation of dopamine and contribute to neurodegeneration. The body has various endogenous antioxidants, but when the level of free radicals is too high due to their overproduction, these endogenous antioxidants are unable to scavenge them, and oxidative stress takes place. Many dopamine-replenishing drugs have been developed to minimize the PD-associated motor deficits although they produce symptomatic relief only and fail to prevent disease progression. Increasing evidence that oxidative stress is critically involved in the pathogenesis of PD suggests that pharmacological targeting of the antioxidant machinery may have therapeutic value. These findings strongly suggest consideration of natural antioxidants or neuroprotectives as an intervention in PD. Many experimental reports have shown the role of natural neuroprotectives such as coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, curcumin, naringenin, melatonin, and vitamin C in the prevention and management of PD. Coenzyme Q10 protects mitochondria and dopaminergic neurons from reactive oxygen species. This provides neuroprotective therapy in PD. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps to avoid oxidation of brain lipids. Similarly to tocopherol, ascorbic acid is a free radical scavenger besides aiding in the regeneration of tocopherol. Curcumin, naringenin, and melatonin are antioxidants, with curcumin additionally having the potential to inhibit monoamine oxidase B. This chapter will deal with the literature covering the use of various natural neuroprotective agents that may find application in PD. This chapter will also focus on the mechanism of actions and in vitro and in vivo application of natural neuroprotectives in experimental animal models and in patients with PD.",

Die motorische und sensible Elektroneurographie zeigen eine Minderung der Amplituden von Muskel- und Nervensummenaktionspotentialen (MSAP/NSAP). Veränderungen im EMG finden sich in der Frühphase der Erkrankung nicht. Mit einer aufwändigen elektrophysiologischen Technik wurden Veränderungen der Nerven- und Muskelfaser-Erregbarkeit beschrieben, die als Zeichen einer Fehlfunktion von Na-Kanälen interpretiert wurden. Eine neue, auf jedem EMG-Gerät durchführbare 0,2–0,5 Hz Serienreizung der motorischen Nerven oder direkt des Muskels führt bei CIPNM zu einer starken Fazilitierung der MSAP und eignet sich als diagnostisches Kriterium. Die hochgradige Variabilität der Fazilitierung spricht für eine fluktuierende, dysfunktionelle Neuromyopathie. Sensible Nerven zeigten nur selten eine geringe Fazilitierung. Als pathogene Faktoren wurden fokale Ischämie mit Hypoxie und toxische Entzündungs-Botenstoffe vermutet, die ein Energiedefizit erzeugen und neben anderem Na-Kanäle funktionell beeinträchtigen könnten.",

      "title": "MECR-Related Neurologic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics MECR-related neurologic disorder is characterized by a progressive childhood-onset movement disorder and optic atrophy; intellect is often – but not always – preserved. The movement disorder typically presents between ages one and 6.5 years and is mainly dystonia that can be accompanied by chorea and/or ataxia. Over time some affected individuals require assistive devices for mobility. Speech fluency and intelligibility are progressively impaired due to dysarthria. Optic atrophy typically develops between ages four and 12 years and manifests as reduced visual acuity, which can include functional blindness (also known as legal blindness) in adulthood. Because only 13 affected individuals are known to the authors, and because nearly half of them were diagnosed retrospectively as adults, the natural history of disease progression and other aspects of the phenotype have not yet been completely defined. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MECR-related neurologic disorder is established in a proband with a childhood-onset movement disorder and biallelic (compound heterozygous or homozygous) pathogenic variants in MECR identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Visual aids for decreased visual acuity due to optic atrophy; occupational therapy and physical therapy to maintain range of movement and special aids (e.g., braces, walkers, wheelchairs) to maintain/improve mobility; speech therapy for dysarthria and augmentative communication if needed. Medications that may relieve dystonia include anticholinergic agents, baclofen, and benzodiazepines. Surveillance: The following yearly examinations are warranted: ophthalmologic (need for additional visual aids), neurologic (need for medications to relieve dystonia), speech therapy (need for augmentative communication), cognitive evaluation, and feeding evaluation (assess risk of aspiration). Agents/circumstances to avoid: Stress and febrile illness as much as possible as these are presumed to exacerbate disease progression. Discuss anesthetic risks with a patient's medical team prior to surgical procedures. Genetic counseling MECR-related neurologic disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the MECR pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: One of the most impactful non-motor manifestations of Parkinson's disease (PD) is cognitive impairment. Cognitive decline in PD exists as a continuum, with symptoms ranging from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and finally dementia (PDD). MCI is clinically heterogeneous and its progression varies with cases reverting to normal cognition. On the contrary, when dementia occurs, the decline is usually rapid and stereotyped. The combination of Lewy and Alzheimer's disease pathology is the most robust pathological correlate of PDD. There are no approved drugs for PD-MCI and the benefit from the only approved symptomatic treatment for PDD is modest. This review aims to present the aspects in which greater evidence exists and summarize the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnostic approach, and treatment of cognitive dysfunction and dementia in PD. Keywords: Parkinson, dementia, mild cognitive impairment, review, biomarker, diagnosis, treatment",

Some parasomnias, such as sleep paralysis and sleep-related hallucinations, are part of the classic tetrad of narcolepsy, but are encountered as isolated phenomena in an extremely high proportion of the otherwise normal population. Others are much less commonly experienced or encountered, but a knowledge of these conditions often permits a rapid diagnosis. This chapter discusses a range of other parasomnias that may occasionally be encountered in clinical practice, including rhythmic movement disorder, hypnic jerks, exploding head syndrome and propriospinal myoclonus.",

The mortality and morbidity related with NMS could be reduced by early diagnosis, interruption of the neuroleptics used within a short period and aggressive treatment.

Although it shares certain histopathological findings with Alzheimer disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy has a more specific presentation (hyperphosphorylated tau protein deposited as neurofibrillary tangles, associated with neuropil threads and sometimes with beta-amyloid plaques). Its clinical presentation is insidious; patients show mild cognitive and emotional symptoms before progressing to parkinsonian motor signs and finally dementia. Results from new experimental diagnostic tools are promising, but these tools are not yet available. The mainstay of managing this disease is prevention and early detection of its first symptoms.",

Because the brain and spinal cord are so well protected from invasion, infections are uncommon. In rare cases virus particles enter through the bloodstream, as in encephalitis. Once the polio virus reaches the motor neuron cell body, it causes fatal damage, which results in paralysis. Parkinson's disease (PD) occurs in older adults. The main features are tremor in the hands, a shuffling walk, and muscular rigidity, making it difficult to initiate movement. Alzheimer's disease (AD) causes progressive and relentless loss of nerve cells in the forebrain. The earliest symptoms may be minor episodes of memory loss, but as the disease progresses, the incapacity becomes overwhelming. Bipolar affective disorder describes a category of mood disorders defined by the presence of one or more episodes of abnormally elevated mood.",

Establishing an accurate diagnosis makes it possible to determine the prognosis and further tactics of patient management.Прогрессирующий надъядерный паралич (ПНП) является прогрессирующим нейродегенеративным заболеванием, которое характеризуется началом в возрасте старше 50 лет, синдромом паркинсонизма с ранним развитием постуральной неустойчивости, отсутствием или преходящей реакцией на препараты леводопы, а также нейропсихологическими нарушениями, дисфагией, дизартрией и глазодвигательными расстройствами. В обзоре приводится анализ современных данных по этиологии, клинической картине, дифференциальной диагностике заболевания, приведены критерии диагноза ПНП. Описана морфологическая картина и нейровизуализационные особенности головного мозга, а также современные представления о перспективах лечения. Значительный клинический полиморфизм, а также сходство с другими нейродегенеративными заболеваниями, проявляющимися синдромом паркинсонизма, усложняет диагностику ПНП. Установка точного диагноза позволяет определить прогноз и дальнейшую тактику ведения пациентов.",

La PC engloba varios desordenes del desarrollo del movimiento y la postura que causan limitacion funcional del paciente para la marcha y otras actividades motoras. La PC es en realidad un sindrome neurologico cuyo origen esta localizado en el Sistema Nervioso Central (SNC), a nivel de la primera neurona (lease tambien la neurona motora superior). Ello implica que casi todos los ninos con PC presentan, ademas de defectos de la postura y el movimiento, otros trastornos asociados que son atribuidos generalmente a disturbios no progresivos que ocurren durante el desarrollo fetal, o del cerebro infantil.

Along with acute disorders of cerebral circulation, chronic cerebrovascular disorders are of great medical and social importance, one of the main clinical manifestations is vascular cognitive impairments. The article discusses the pathogenetic and clinical variants of vascular cognitive impairments, presents their modern classification and approaches to diagnosis. The importance of the earliest possible diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairments is due to the fact that they can be one of the first manifestations of cerebrovascular insufficiency, before the development of clinically obvious strokes or cardiovascular diseases in general. Early diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairments is necessary both for the prevention of vascular and neurodegenerative dementia and for the prevention of strokes and other acute vascular episodes. A clinical example of non-stroke formation of mild vascular cognitive impairment is presented. Signs of cognitive impairments typical of chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency, such as a slowdown in the rate of mental activity and disorders of frontal executive functions in combination with behavioral and emotional disorders, are described. The article discusses the issues of treatment of vascular cognitive impairments, which should be comprehensive and include the correction of the underlying vascular disease, non-drug (regular physical activity, smoking cessation, cognitive training) and drug treatment methods aimed at improving cognitive functions. Possibilities of modern neuroprotective and symptomatic therapy of cognitive disorders, the place of EGb 761 ® in the treatment of vascular cognitive impairments are shown.",

Als alterstypische psychische Stoerungen koennen am ehesten diejenigen Erkrankungen angesehen werden, die auf einer organischen Stoerung der Hirnfunktion beruhen. Bei den akuten Stoerungen stehen das Delir und das akute amnestische Syndrom im Vordergrund, die wichtigste Krankheitsgruppe bei Aelteren stellen jedoch die dementiellen Entwicklungen mit einer vielgestaltigen Symptomatik dar. Charakteristisch fuer eine dementielle Entwicklung sind unter anderem Beeintraechtigungen des Gedaechtnisses und des Denkvermoegens sowie Veraenderungen der Persoenlichkeit. Zur Diagnostik ist neben der psychiatrischen Exploration und der koerperlichen Untersuchung eine testpsychologische Quantifizierung des kognitiven Leistungsvermoegens erforderlich. Haeufigste Ursache dementieller Erkrankungen sind degenerative Prozesse, insbesondere die Alzheimer-Demenz. Der psychiatrische Sachverstaendige hat zur Beurteilung der strafrechtlichen Verantwortlichkeit zunaechst zu untersuchen, welche konkreten Auswirkungen die Diagnose auf die Funktionsfaehigkeit des Betroffenen hat. Erst dann erfolgt die Uebersetzung psychiatrischer Befunde und Diagnosen in ein System juristischer Begrifflichkeiten auf der Grundlageder Paragraphen 20/21 des Strafgesetzbuches (StGB). Ergeben sich bei der Begutachtung Hinweise auf eine Desorientiertheit, auf Halluzinationen oderauf wahnhafte Veraenderung des Erlebens, ist eine aufgehobene Steuerungsfaehigkeit im Sinne des Paragraph 20 StGB anzunehmen. Bei der Beurteilung der Voraussetzungen des Paragraph 21 StGB ist zu beachten, dass diese keineeigene Kategorie darstellen, da die verminderte Schuldfaehigkeit als Sonderfall der Schuldfaehigkeit angesehen wird.

A carotid artery disease can manifest as transient monocular visual loss (TMVL), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO), anterior ischemic optic neuropathy or ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS). Stroke posterior to the optic chiasm can cause sectoranopias, quadrantanopias, or hemianopias, which can be either congruous or incongruous. Any stroke involving the dorsal stream (occipito-parietal lobe), or ventral stream (occipito-temporal lobe) can manifest with visuospatial perception deficits. Similarly, different ocular motility abnormalities can result from a stroke affecting the cerebrum, cerebellum, or brainstem. Among these deficits, vision and perception disorders are more difficult to overcome. Clinical, experimental, and neuroimaging studies have helped us to understand the anatomical basis, physiological dysfunction, and the underlying mechanisms of these neuro-ophthalmic signs.",

Then, the disease progresses to the brain stem involving the nuclei in the pons and the substantia nigra, and inducing sleep and wakefulness disturbances, affect problems such as anxiety and depression, and motor problems when the disease process has reached the substantia nigra. Furthermore, the disease has an effect on the nucleus basalis of Meynert, the amygdaloid complex and the cerebrum manifesting cognitive impairment. The olfactory pathway is also frequently involved. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key Messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; For the treatment of PD, younger patients without dementia should be treated with a nonergot dopamine agonist first and then with levodopa if necessary. Elderly patients or those with dementia should be treated with levodopa. However, after 5 years of levodopa treatment, many patients with PD develop wearing off. Drugs for the treatment of wearing-off symptoms are reviewed. Many of the patients with wearing-off symptoms develop dyskinesia, and amantadine is so far the only drug that can ameliorate dyskinesia. Because of this situation, a new method of treatment is warranted, such as RNA interaction, according to the author's opinion. Recent progress in this field is also reviewed. i 2014 S.

Apart from these, various nonmotor symptoms (NMS) also occur in PD and constitute a major clinical challenge, as they are common, but often overshadowed by the dominance of motor symptoms. NMS can present at any stage of the disease including early and pre-motor phase of PD. Several NMS such as olfactory dysfunction, constipation, REM behaviour disorder, depression may antedate the motor signs, symptoms and diagnosis of PD by a number of years. Since, NMS add significantly to the overall disability caused by PD, their early recognition and treatment may go a long way in improving the quality of life of PD patients as well as the economic burden on the carers. The identification of NMS can be improved by the application of quantitative and validated instruments and scales for their assessment.",

      "abstract": "Acute neuromuscular paralysis (ANMP) is a clinical syndrome characterized by rapid onset muscle weakness progressing to maximum severity within several days to weeks (less than 4 wk). Bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness may or may not be present. It is a common neurological emergency which requires immediate and careful investigations to determine the etiology because accurate diagnosis has significant impact on therapy and prognosis. Respiratory failure caused by neuromuscular weakness is considered as more critical than lung disease because its development may be insidious or subtle until sudden decompensation leads to life threatening hypoxia. Also, the arterial blood gas finding of severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and acidosis may not be apparent until respiratory failure is profound. Hence, the requirement for respiratory assistance should also be intensively and promptly investigated in all patients with neuromuscular disease. The disorder is classified based on the site of defect in motor unit pathway, i.e., anterior horn cells, nerve root, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction or muscle. Identification of the cause is primarily based on a good medical history and detailed clinical examination supplemented with neurophysiologic investigations and sometimes few specific laboratory tests. Medical history and neurological examination should be focused on the onset, progression, pattern and severity of muscle weakness as well as cranial nerves testing and tests for autonomic dysfunction. Associated non neurological features like fever, rash or other skin lesions etc. should also be noted. Globally, Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most frequent cause of ANMP and accounts for the majority of cases of respiratory muscles weakness associated with neuromuscular disorders. Newly acquired neuromuscular weakness in intensive care unit patients consist of critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy and drug induced neuromuscular weakness which may arise as a consequence of sepsis, multi-organ failure, and exposure to certain medications like intravenous corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common degenerative disease of the central nervous system that is characterized by movement disorders and non‐motor symptoms (NMSs). The associated NMSs primarily include neuropsychiatric symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, sleep‐wake disorders, pain, fatigue, and hyposmia. These NMSs can occur at any stage of PD, especially before the onset of motor symptoms, and may affect a patient's quality of life more than motor symptoms. Although PD is most commonly diagnosed in people over 65 years, some patients exhibit symptom onset before the age of 50, which is clinically known as early‐onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD). The high heterogeneity and incidence of EOPD‐associated NMSs can lead to the misdiagnosis of EOPD as other neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the research progress related to NMSs in patients with EOPD, focusing on neuropsychiatric disorders, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, and sensory impairment, and outline the association of NMSs with different genotypic alterations, with the aim of providing assistance in the clinical management of patients.",

There is no evidence of causative pathology. The basic functional disturbance is likely to involve arousal mechanisms ('dyshormia') and/or photosensitivity. The genetic factor is highly complex. This entity must be differentiated from electrically or epileptologically very similar conditions. Among 300 epileptics with predominantly generalized seizure discharges in the EEG, only 20% (61 patients) fell into the category or 'pure' CGE; another 24% (72 patients) were listed as atypical CGE and showed additional minimal focal abnormalities or evidence of insult to the brain in the history. Other conditions giving rise to generalized seizure discharges are hereditary essential myoclonus epilepsy (Lafora-Unverricht-Lundborg), deep seated lesions (hypothalamus, mesencephalon) and metabolic disturbances; this group amounted to no more than 4% (12 patients). A primary cortical epileptogenic focus giving rise to 'secondary bilateral synchrony' was presumed in 9% (26 patients). A large group of 125 patients (42%) were characterized by slow spike-wave complexes and mental retardation (Lennox-Gastaut syndrome). The 4 remaining patients (1%) had slow spike-wave complexes but represented an unusual type of post-traumatic epilepsy without the ictal-clinical symptomatology of the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The physiopathogenesis of CGE and its generalized seizure patterns is discussed.",

      "title": "MO1023BARDET-BIEDL SYNDROME OR SENIOR-LOKEN SYNDROME? GOING BEYOND THE OBVIOUS",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Nephronophthisis (NPHP), a ciliopathy which almost always causes end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), may have extrarenal symptoms such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) and Senior-Loken syndrome (SLS), and these are called NPHP-related ciliopathies (NPHP-RC). Bardet-Bield syndrome and SLS share similar clinical features, so that definitive diagnosis might depend on genetic analysis. Bardet-Bield syndrome diagnosis is typically based on clinical manifestations, which comprise, for example, renal defects, polydactyly, obesity, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), learning difficulties, in addition to secondary manifestations such as development delay, speech defects, hypertension, among others. Senior-Loken syndrome classical encompasses familial NPHP and RP; additional variable features can include skeletal, liver, neurologic and other visual defects, as well as obesity. NPHP genes are the most commonly affected in NPHP. Although disruption of the NPHP5 and NPHP6 genes are the most frequent cause of SLS, at least variants in ten genes have been reported. We present a case of a young girl clinically diagnosed with BBS, later known to be a SLS based on genetic analysis, revealing an unusual affected gene. Method We reviewed this case based on medical records. Results The patient presented with polydactyly at birth and pre-obesity in the first six months of age. At the age of 4 years she was first evaluated by ophthalmology due to reduced visual acuity which evolved unfavorably with severe generalized retinal dysfunction and moderate maculopathy at the age of 9 years. Delayed development and poor social skills were increasingly evident, as wells as short stature, small hands and dysmorphic facial features. At the age of 12 years bilateral transmission hearing loss was diagnosed and two years later she was referred to Endocrinology due to hirsutism, stretch marks and cushingoid facies. In this context, blood work was performed and surprisingly revealed plasma creatinine of 2.19 mg/dL and urea of 65 mg/dL. Kidney ultrasound revealed reduced dimensions and increased parenchymal echogenicity; an obstructive component was excluded. She rapidly progressed to ESKD and dialysis dependence. Bardet-Biedl syndrome was considered. She was referred for transplant assessment and underwent genetic testing. A homozygous likely pathogenic variant was identified in TRAF3IP1 gene, compatible with SLS 9 (autosomal recessive inheritance). Conclusion Although phenotype-based diagnosis was common in ciliopathies, genetic testing is now regularly used for definitive diagnosis. Mutations in the geneTRAF3IP1 were only recently described, particularly in patients presenting with NPHP, RP, skeletal defects, hepatic fibrosis and hexadactyly; ESKD is frequent between 3 and 16 years and SLS is formally associated. Our patient had several clinical manifestations suggestive of BBS, and presumptive diagnosis was assumed (although noticeable phenotypic overlap with SLS exists). Genetic analysis was crucial; the identified mutation in TRAF3IP1 justifies some of the extra-SLS/BBS-like manifestations. Patients must be monitored carefully, namely related to ESKD and extrarenal manifestations; there is also the need for segregation analysis (divorced parents and half-brothers). Ultimately this case represents a consequence of genetics evolution, with a wide genetic and clinical variability now described within these syndromes.",

      "title": "Simple Partial Seizure",
      "abstract": "A seizure is a symptom that refers to episodic, excessive, and disorderly neuronal activity in the brain. Traditionally seizures have been classified into and generalized. Partial seizure refers to abnormal neural activity localized to one area of the cerebral hemisphere and having a discernible or localized onset. When there is no associated impairment in consciousness, it is called a simple seizure, and when it is associated with impairment in consciousness, it is called a complex seizure. When a seizure becomes generalized, it is referred to as a partial seizure with secondary generalization. New terminology for a simple seizure is focal onset aware seizure.Partial seizures are the most common type of seizures in patients with epilepsy. Complex seizures occur more often than simple seizures, although most complex seizures start as simple seizures.Patients with simple seizures remain awake and aware throughout the seizure, and some patients can even talk during the episode. It may be difficult to distinguish them from complex seizures in infants and patients with cognitive and speech difficulties, as impairment in consciousness can be difficult to assess in these patients.The term aura refers to signs and symptoms that occur with a seizure before consciousness is lost and for which memory is intact afterward. Auras that are not followed by seizure should be considered aware seizures or simple seizures.Depending on clinical signs, symptoms, and EEG localization, seizures can be further subdivided into four types: Focal motor seizures Focal sensory seizures Autonomic seizures Psychological seizures Focal Motor Seizures The or motor seizure occurs due to an epileptogenic lesion on the contralateral frontal lobe. Motor symptoms constitute the primary clinical manifestation. Typically, consciousness is not impaired in seizures of discrete motor areas. They usually originate from the supplementary motor area and cause turning movements of the head and neck to the opposite side and sometimes tonic contractions of the limbs and trunk on the same side. This may or may not be followed by generalized clonic movements. Subdivisions of ictal motor symptoms include elementary (tonic, clonic, dystonic, versive) and automatism (coordinated, repetitive motor activity like lip-smacking, tapping, and swallowing). Another classification based on clinical symptomatology uses the terms like clonic, tonic, or versive seizures.Focal motor seizures are more common on the face, hands, and toes because these areas have disproportionately large cortical representations. The excitatory focus is usually around the rolandic (motor) cortex. If there are accompanying sensory symptoms, the focus may be on post-rolandic convolution. Temporal lobe origin seizures sometimes have head-turning movements on the same side followed by the forceful contraversive turning of the head and body. Clonic seizures refer to repeated, short contractions of various muscle groups characterized by twitching movements or rhythmic jerking that recur at regular intervals of less than 1 to 2 seconds. These seizures are brief, lasting less than one to two minutes. In clonic seizures, there is epileptic activation of a restricted area of the precentral gyrus. Tonic seizures refer to sustained contractions that last for more than 5 to 10 seconds and result in the posturing of the limbs and whole body. Focal tonic seizures refer to tonic contractions restricted to a part of the body on one side. Focal tonic seizures are attributed to activation of Brodmann area 6, particularly the mesial frontal region. There may be some involvement of the premotor areas in some cases. Versive seizures consist of sustained, forceful, involuntary turning of head and eyes to one side due to tonic contraction of head and eye muscles. Usually, they are accompanied by loss of consciousness, but occasionally patients may be aware of the forced involuntary eye and head-turning. The version can result from seizures originating from various locations and spreading to the premotor cortex. Following convulsions with predominant motor symptoms, patients may have transient, functional, and localized paralysis of the affected limbs. This is known as Todd paralysis and can last minutes to hours, usually in proportion to the duration of the convulsion. This postepileptic paralysis occurs due to persistent dysfunction of the affected epileptogenic area and is the signature of a seizure. It has significant clinical value in lateralizing the hemisphere of seizure onset. Jacksonian March Seizure Jacksonian march seizure starts with tonic contractions in one hand or on one side of the face or the muscles of one foot. This is followed by clonic movements in these parts and sometimes a series of clonic movements with increasing frequency that builds up to a tonic contraction. These movements may spread (march) from the muscles affected to the other muscles on the same side of the body. In classic Jacksonian march, the seizure spreads from hand to arm to face and then down the leg ipsilaterally, or if it started in the foot, then seizure marches up the leg, down the arm, and then to the face. This typically happens over a short time (20 to 30 seconds). There can be other associated symptoms like automatism (lip smacking or tapping movements), hallucinations, muscle cramping, head-turning, etc. Symptoms are usually mild. These seizures rarely become generalized, and typically consciousness remains intact. Jacksonian march seizure can be mistaken for a transient ischemic attack, migraine, or other condition. Focal Somatosensory Seizures Sensory seizures present as numbness, tingling, crawling sensation, pins and needles feeling, and rarely, as pain or thermal sensations. They can be or can march to other ipsilateral body parts and usually have a focus in or around post-rolandic convolution of the contralateral cerebral hemisphere. Visual seizures are rare but have localizing significance. Visual hallucinations and visual loss are typical of occipital lobe epilepsy but sometimes can occur with seizure foci in anteromedial temporal and occipitotemporal regions. Auditory hallucinations are a rare initial manifestation of seizure and have sometimes been noted with lesions in the posterior temporal lobe on one side. Olfactory hallucinations often occur with a lesion in the inferior and medial parts of the temporal lobe. Gustatory hallucinations can occur in temporal lobe disease with lesions in the insula and parietal operculum. Autonomic Seizures Autonomic seizures manifest with predominantly altered autonomic function. Some common autonomic signs and symptoms include diaphoresis, shivering, piloerection, a rising sensation in epigastrium, nausea, changes in blood pressure and heart rate (commonly tachycardia), and pupillary changes. Autonomic features are common in several nonepileptic conditions, making autonomic seizures harder to diagnose.Some specific epilepsy syndromes with prominent autonomic features include neonatal seizures, epilepsy of infancy with migrating seizures, Dravet syndrome, benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, and early-onset benign occipital epilepsy. Psychological Seizures Psychological seizures manifest with affective and cognitive symptoms like memory flashbacks, dream-like events, Deja Vu feeling, hallucinations, anxiety, agitation, and uncontrolled laughter or crying. They arise commonly from the temporal area rather than the extratemporal.",

Non-motor symptoms, most importantly autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep problems, are prevalent in virtually all Parkinson's disease patients and influence the quality of life more than the motor symptoms. Patients may visit a variety of health care professionals, but non-motor symptoms are often missed, because physicians do not explicitly ask patients about them or do not recognise them as being part of the disease.

      "abstract": "Neurological assessment of critically ill patients requires physical examination although coexisting cognitive impairment, sedative or paralytic medication, endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation, neuromuscular weakness, injuries or surgery involving extracranial tissues may limit sensitivity and specificity of findings. Notwithstanding these constraints, neurological signs and syndromes are valuable indicators of severity of illness and prognosis. Common neurologic syndromes in ICU patients include disturbances in the level of arousal and in cognition, delirium, seizures, generalized weakness, and focal neurological deficits. Whenever possible, neurological examination should include an assessment of mental status, attention, cranial nerves, motor and sensory findings. If there is persisting diagnostic uncertainty additional testing should be sought. Computed tomography of the head should be obtained whenever there is a new onset of seizures, focal neurologic deficits, alteration of mental status or loss of consciousness which are not immediately reversible or explainable. Magnetic resonance imaging has greater sensitivity for demyelinating and inflammatory diseases, hyperacute ischemic stroke, microhemorrhagic lesions, anoxic-ischemic damage, and disorders affecting the white matter and the brainstem. Electroencephalography is needed if seizures or status epilepticus are suspected as a cause or consequence of acute brain dysfunction. Somatosensory evoked potentials, best studied in patients with anoxic brain injury may help with prognostication following cardiac arrest. Electromyography and nerve conduction velocities should be obtained when neuromuscular weakness is severe or cannot be assessed clinically.",

      "title": "013 Differential diagnosis of rapidly progressive dementia",
      "abstract": "<b>Abstract:</b> Dementia, as a clinical syndrome, has many potential causes. The majority of cases are due to neurodegenerative diseases and/or vascular disease with relatively gradual progressive clinical courses. However, dementia can be rapidly progressive with time courses measured in only weeks or a few months. These more rapidly progressive dementias often have clinical characteristics that are distinctive from the more typical slower dementias and with different aetiological considerations. There is no specific definition of “rapidly progressive dementia (RPD)”. This talk will review the differential diagnosis of RPD in adults. Infections must be considered, including HIV-associated dementia, PML, SSPE, Whipples disease and prion diseases. Malignancy enters into the differential diagnosis in a variety of ways: rapidly progressive brain primary neoplasm, cerebral secondaries, intravascular lymphoma and non-metastatic encephalopathy. There are a number of miscellaneous immunological/inflammatory disorders, including Hashimoto9s Encephalopathy, Morvan9s Syndrome and primary cerebral vasculitis. Some causes (such as malignancy) are relatively common and usually relatively easy to diagnose and some may be suggested by past medical history or clinical context (as with HIV) but there are also great rarities (like Whipple9s disease) that may be very difficult to confirm. Many of these conditions, especially other infections, will have helpfully differentiating systemic features, general test abnormalities, a CSF pleocytosis and brain imaging abnormalities. Primary and secondary malignancies should be demonstrable on cerebral imaging. Some conditions will have specific diagnostic tests such as HIV testing. Various antibody tests will be helpful in certain situations such as Morvan9s syndrome, Hashimoto9s encephalopathy and paraneoplastic syndromes. There are no specific, non-invasive tests for prion diseases in general, although genetic testing is available for those associated with PRNP mutations. Clinical diagnosis depends on a combination of clinical features, EEG and cerebral MRI characteristics and CSF protein findings. In sporadic CJD, the EEG and CSF 14-3-3 testing have been the main relevant supportive tests, but certain brain MR appearances have been evaluated in recent times. In variant CJD, the brain MR Pulvinar Sign and tonsil biopsy have been most useful. Brain biopsy may be considered in a minority of cases. Autopsy may be necessary for definitive diagnosis of RPD, especially in prion diseases.",

      "abstract": "Delirium is commonly defined as a transient organic brain syndrome characterized by concurrent disorders of attention, perception, thinking, memory, psychomotor behavior, and the sleep-wake cycle. One of the difficulties in studying delirium is that symptoms tend to fluctuate over the course of the day. Pre-existing organic brain disease appears to be a significant risk factor for the development of delirium, and numerous studies have shown a high rate of delirium in patients with cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. The cognitive deficits associated with delirium have not been widely studied in a systematic, quantitative fashion. Following resolution of the frank delirium, documented cognitive deficits can be observed, and may persist in a diluted form for a period of months. Residual cognitive deficits may be due to a minimal and persistent confusion or to an underlying brain disorder.",

Examples of such endogenous molecules include glutamate, bilirubin, nitric oxide, histamine, while alcohol or carbon monoxide represents exogenous insults. Such alterations in the neurons are sometimes not limited to functions, but also involve the anatomy, i.e. the cell structure, of the neurons. The term “neuronopathy” refers to the death (necrosis or apoptosis) of the neuronal cell, and a dead neuron cannot be replaced by new neurons. Types of neurotoxicity other than neuronopathy include axonopathy, myelinopathy, or blockade of the neurotransmission. The duration and intensity of exposure to neurotoxic insult has a significant role on the outcome of the toxic effect. Most of the neurotoxins act by impairing the voltage-dependent ion canals",

Functional (psychogenic) neurological diseases, also called conversion disorders, are involuntary. There are two voluntary mimics of functional disorders: factitious disease, where patients have a psychiatric illness, and malingering, where persons have no illness and are just lying. The term “functional” is beginning to replace “psychogenic” in many circumstances. This chapter discusses clinical features of functional neurological disorders in detail. Negative neurological symptoms like loss of consciousness, blindness, constriction of visual field, motor paralysis, and loss of pain sense are commonly seen in functional diseases, but positive symptoms like convulsion and involuntary movements are more common. Among others, functional movement disorders are not infrequent and have drawn particular attention in the recent years. Within the movement disorders, functional tic-like movements might be difficult to distinguish from real tics, and in fact these two may overlap within the patient.",

Parkinson's disease normally appears between the ages of 55 and 65, affects 1 to 2 percent of persons over 60, and progresses to 3 to 5 percent of people between the ages of 85 and 89. The olfactory bulbs and nucleus as well as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve are first affected, followed by the locus coeruleus and finally the substantia nigra. Later on, the brain's cortical regions are impacted. The multifaceted pathophysiologic changes that result in impairments not only of the motor system but also of the cognitive and neuropsychological systems are caused by damage to these numerous neural systems. Although there is no known cure for Parkinson's disease, drugs can frequently significantly reduce the symptoms. Since they may be taken for a long period without having serious side effects and contain antioxidant characteristics, herbal drugs do well in this category. Surgery may be indicated in select cases with more severe conditions.",

      "title": "Delirium and Dementia",
      "abstract": "Emergency physicians are frequently presented with patients exhibiting neurobehavioral abnormalities. These can be a harbin­ ger of a serious medical condition, and critical decisions must be made expeditiously about diagnostic evaluation, therapeutic intervention, and disposition. The first critical action is to recog­ nize the presence of the neurobehavioral abnormality. The second is to distinguish delirium from dementia or some other neuropsy­ chiatric condition. In the past, terms such as acute confusional state, sundowning, and organic brain syndrome have been used to describe a host of abnormal cognitive states that can be observed in the emer­ gency setting. These terms have loosely defined a group of neurobehavioral disorders that are caused by a physiologic dis­ turbance. Organic brain syndrome is a nebulous term that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition, text revision) eschews because the “organic” connotation implies that so­called functional mental disorders are without a biologic basis. Several key features best distinguish delirium from dementia: the time course of disease evolution, the presence of autonomic system involvement, the level of consciousness, and the presence of an underlying disease processes. Delirium is characterized by a fluctuating level of neurobehavioral disturbance typically pro­ gressing during minutes to hours to days. Delirium is a direct consequence of an acute systemic or central nervous system (CNS) stressor. Dementia, on the other hand, tends to follow a more gradual course, with evolution during months to years. Although patients with dementia exhibit confusion, disturbance in level of consciousness usually is not a feature, and manifestations of auto­ nomic nervous system abnormalities are minimal or absent. The evaluation of patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with a disturbance of neurobehavioral state is best conducted in accordance with the following basic guidelines: 1. The first step is to determine whether this state represents delirium or dementia. The clinical findings may be subtle, and establishment of the diagnosis can be challenging, especially because delirium may be superimposed on dementia and dementia remains an independent risk factor for delirium. Early symptoms and signs may go unrecognized unless an adequate history is obtained from the patient, family members, and caregivers. A careful examination must include memory and cognitive assessment with a mental status screening examination. 2. Supportive care must be provided. This care may range in extent from aggressive airway and cardiovascular support to pharmacologic or physical restraint to simply placing the patient in a quiet room with appropriate environmental support. 3. A diligent search must be initiated for the underlying precipitating stressors in patients presenting with delirium.",

Nevertheless, this is the picture that can be produced by an increased serum viscosity.<sup>1,2</sup>The bleeding characteristically occurs from the nose, mouth, or gums but may stem from the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. Postoperative oozing is also common. Ocular symptoms range from partial to complete loss of vision due to retinal hemorrhages, venous changes, or even papilledema. The neurologic disturbances, often known as the Bing-Neel syndrome, include headache, dizziness, true vertigo, deafness, nystagmus, diplopia, ataxia, paresthesias, and postural hypotension. Less often, congestive heart failure or renal impairment is seen. The main cause of the hyperviscosity syndrome is increased viscosity of the serum (as in macroglobulinemia or myeloma), although increased numbers of cells (polycythemia or leukemia) or increased resistance of cells",

      "title": "Young-Onset Dementia and Neurodegenerative Disorders of the Young With an Emphasis on Clinical Manifestations",
      "abstract": "Young-onset dementia (YOD) refers to a neurological ailment primarily affecting people below 65 years of age in roughly about 8% of cases found through various researches. The high rate of prevalence of secondary dementias among older patients proves that younger people show a better prognosis of the conditions causing dementia than older people. However, effective interventions have to be usually provided early in the course of cognitive decline to help facilitate cognitive improvement. The risk of development of prodromal dementia is high if there is a development of psychoses in middle-aged or older people. When there is a development of psychoses in middle to late life, the likelihood of this indicates prodromal dementia is high. The clinical presentation is quite variable and often subtle in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) but may be dominated by personality change, behavioral disturbances, motivation, or the loss of empathy. There is great heterogeneity in the probable causes of dementia in young age as compared to dementia in old age, and some observed differences also exist in the course and characteristics of the disease. These causes may range from the most probable cause such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) to causes with low probability, such as metabolic disorders and prion diseases. The symptoms of young-onset dementia include a gradual development of personality and behavioral changes over a period of years. However, in the initial stages of young-onset dementia, this change can be attributed to various issues, such as depression, marital problems, and menopause. Other neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease show presentations such as changes in personality, chorea, and depression that can be observed in patients in their early adulthood. A few other neurodegenerative disorders are myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF) and mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) with presentations such as characterized muscle weakness, poor growth, problems with vision and hearing, and the involvement of the multi-organ system, including the central nervous system to name a few. There is also the prevalence of juvenile parkinsonism in the community, which represents a group of clinicopathological entities present before the age of 21. Young-onset Parkinson's disease (PD) (YOPD) appears to have the same pathological presentation as late-onset Parkinson's disease (LOPD). Recent researches have proved that \"gene therapy\" can be useful in the treatment and in preventing the progression of symptoms in cases of neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "Ocular neuropathic pain is a diagnosis of exclusion which refers to the heightened perception of pain in response to normally non-painful stimuli. It usually presents without any visible objective exam findings, making it extremely difficult to identify. For this reason, it often gets misdiagnosed as dry eye disease.Ocular neuropathic pain may present with accompanying visible damage to tissue; however, it can also occur as a result of a physiological dysfunction of the nervous system. With other corneal pathologies, the intensity of corneal pain often correlates with vital dye staining. However, in patients with ocular neuropathic pain, symptoms are severe and unaccompanied by equivalent signs, which is why ocular neuropathic pain is sometimes referred to as “corneal pain without stain” or “phantom cornea.” This is the ocular analog of complex regional pain syndrome, systemic neuropathic pain, or reflex sympathetic dystrophy.Other names for this condition include, but are not limited to corneal neuropathic pain, corneal neuralgia, ocular pain syndrome, keratoneuralgia, corneal neuropathic disease, and corneal allodynia.Ocular neuropathic pain is an important differential to consider because many patients get misdiagnosed due to its significant overlap with dry eye disease. The disparity between signs and symptoms often results in patients being dismissed or considered malingering, hysterical, or psychosomatic. As demonstrated by case reports, patients with extreme cases of this condition have even committed to suicide due to the severity of chronic pain. An important first step in treating ocular neuropathic pain is to communicate the belief that the condition and the symptoms are real.The objective of this article is to provide a summary of the condition and review approaches for its treatment and management, as well as increase awareness of this underrecognized disease.",

Ainsi, certains symptômes tels que les hallucinations visuelles sont rapportées lors des auras migraineuses et des crises occipitales. Chez l'enfant, certains symptômes végétatifs comme les vomissements sont fréquents lors des crises migraineuses, mais également lors de certaines crises d'épilepsie. Enfin, un lien temporel étroit peut être observé entre les deux pathologies. Les céphalées d'allure migraineuse sont en effet très fréquentes lors des crises d'épilepsie mais surviennent parfois avant ou pendant les crises. Plus rarement, les auras migraineuses sont suivies d'une crise d'épilepsie (migralepsie). Sur le plan physiopathologique, la mise en évidence de troubles de l'excitabilité corticale dans la maladie migraineuse et la découverte de mutations génétiques communes aux deux pathologies illustrent également les interactions pouvant exister entre les deux maladies. L'objectif de cette revue est de présenter les situations cliniques pouvant poser des problèmes diagnostiques entre les maladies migraineuses et épileptiques, ainsi que de présenter les principales hypothèses physiopathologiques pouvant expliquer les liens étroits observés entre les deux pathologies.",

      "abstract": "Certain psychiatric diseases have biological pathomechanisms, and as a result they are accompanied by various neurological symptoms. Neurological examination is a simple method to assess these symptoms. Neurological signs come in two varieties; they are either of the hard or the soft type. Hard symptoms appear primarily in organic psychiatric disorders or as side effects of psychiatric therapy. They can also be encountered during neurological diseases of psychiatric patients. Their use in diagnostics and therapy is widely accepted. In contrast, soft neurological symptoms often stay unnoticed, even though they may contain important pieces of information. For this reason they will form the focus of our discussion. Soft neurological symptoms have been studied in different psychiatric disorder-groups. Up to now most attention has been devoted to schizophrenia. The study suggests that the soft symptoms are trait markers of schizophrenia. Furthermore they also signal disease activity and predict the outcome of the disease. Neurological symptoms are also important pointers for psychiatry. However, more systematic studies may increase the theoretical and practical implications of soft symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Autonomic failure with orthostatic and postprandial hypotension, bowel and bladder disturbances, and sexual dysfunction are frequent, disabling features in patients with the three most prevalent neurodegenerative movement disorders: Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy (MSA), and the related neurodegenerative Lewy-body disorder characterized by isolated severe autonomic failure (pure autonomic failure, PAF). All of these disorders have in common the presence of α-synuclein in the cytoplasmic precipitates found in neurons in Lewy body disorders or glia in MSA. Autonomic failure with disabling orthostatic hypotension is the clinical hallmark of PAF. It may also be the initial presentation of MSA, making diagnosis difficult. Within a few years, however, MSA patients develop movement disorders, which are differentiated from PD by the paucity of unilateral resting tremor, the lack of response to levodopa, and their rapidly progressive nature, resulting in disability and death in 7 to 8 years. Moderately effective treatment is available for autonomic symptoms, but management of movement disorders remains unsuccessful. Discoveries relevant to physiology and common pathological conditions were initially made in patients with autonomic failure. Meals induce profound hypotension in these patients. Conversely, commonly used nasal decongestants can produce substantial pressor effects. Even 500 mL of water can increase blood pressure by a previously unrecognized sympathetic reflex. Residual sympathetic tone is able to induce sustained supine hypertension in MSA, because it is resolved after ganglionic blockade. These phenomena were not previously recognized because of the buffering capacity of the baroreflex, but were unmasked in autonomic failure patients.",

      "title": "The Behavioural Dimension of Brain Disorders-An Area for Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is a branch of medicine with a relatively short history. Although mental illness has probably existed throughout the history of mankind, it has received little attention from the medical perspective. Major psychoses have been considered as either spiritual or functional until recently. The functional or organic dichotomy has been the official watershed dividing the disciplines of Neurology and Psychiatry. While Neurology follows the basic medical approach, Psychiatry takes a much broader, and perhaps more diffuse, perspective. During the past few decades, there has been a quantum leap in the volume of basic neuroscientific research. A much better understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying most, if not all, psychiatric disorders has led to a revolutionary change in the concept of mental disorders. Most functional or psychogenic problems have now been found to have an 'organic' aetiology. Functional psychiatric disorders are much better perceived as medical disorders leading to disturbances in brain function. Clinical manifestations are disturbances of the integration between mood, perception, and thought processes. The old distinction between diseases as either neurological or psychiatric faces challenges to its validity. It would be over-simplistic to assume that brain disorders will manifest either along the neurological or psychiatric dimension, and be managed with a single approach. In this issue, the significance of a combined neuropsychiatric approach to the assessment and management of brain disorders is highlighted. The article on depressive disorders in Parkinson's disease (PD) underscores the prevalent psychiatric co-morbidity in this classical neurological disorder. (1) Discovery of degeneration of the dopaminergic system in this disorder led to the development of an associated treatment. It is well-recognised that PD is readily amenable to pharmacological interventions that bolster dopaminergic transmission. Nevertheless, the focusing of attention on the motor symptoms of PD is associated with a neglect of other important determinants of quality of life, such as depressive disorders and other psychopathology. The report on mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like syndrome (MELAS) provides an excellent example of the complex neuropsychiatric manifestations of a rare metabolic brain disease. (2) In MELAS, a combination of neurological and psychiatric symptomatology, and use of sophisticated neuroimaging and laboratory technology are required to make the diagnosis. It is perhaps meaningless to argue about the importance of paying dual attention to the neurological and psychiatric aspects of brain disorders. A more intriguing question may be the need for a division between Psychiatry and Neurology, or more specifically, the distinction between Behavioural Neurology and Neuropsychiatry. …",

      "abstract": "There is an extensive behavioural neurological literature on so-called unilateral attentional disorders, but a striking paucity of papers on global disorders of attention, i.e. confusional states. However, confusional states are distinctive because: (1) they are the most common disturbance of the higher functions in clinical practice, by orders of magnitude; (2) they are the only disturbance of the higher functions from which all normal subjects have suffered; (3) they have characteristic clinical manifestations; (4) they are frequently misdiagnosed as progressive dementias, aphasia, memory disorders, and psychoses; (5) they are the only disturbance of the higher functions that commonly cause patients to produce statements that appear to be extremely witty; (6) they can be readily studied experimentally; (7) they are the most common cause of unconcern with or denial of illness. There are almost certainly several different forms of confusional state depending on the aetiology, the rate of development, the age, and the anatomical systems involved, but little classification has yet been carried on. Confusional states are most simply defined as disorders in which there is a loss of the normal coherence of thought or action. Among the striking clinical features are: (1) failure to pay attention, excessive distractibility, or failure to shift attention; (2) paramnesias, i.e. distortions of memory; (3) reduplicative phenomena, ‘wild’ paraphasias with ‘propagation’ of error, alterations of mood in many different directions; (4) isolated or predominant disturbance of writing (the most common cause of pure agraphia); (5) unconcern with or denial of illness; (6) apparently playful behaviour. While confusional states are usually attributed to ‘global involvement of the brain’ as a result of metabolic or toxic disorder, there are in fact many cases produced by focal infarctions in the right hemisphere, which, in the experience of my department, is one of the commonest effects of cerebrovascular disease. Brief reference is made to the prognosis, and to the theoretical significance for cerebral dominance and the evolutionary development of cerebral dominance in non-human species.",

Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a CNS inflammatory demyelinating disease principally of the optic nerves and cord. NMO is distinct from MS and usually associated with a specific aquaporin-4 antibody. Acute parainfectious inflammatory encephalopathies are monophasic encephalitides characterised by multi-focal CNS lesions.

Although the neurological involvement is less frequent than other major presentations, it is important because it can produce severe disabilities. Peripheral nervous system manifestations are relatively rare in BD. Although few cases of peripheral neuropathy or myopathy have been reported in BD, they are cases of multiple neuropathies, sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy, or neuropathy autonomic dysfunction. Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS), also known as an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, is an acute demyelinating polyradiculopathy of uncertain etiology. No case of GBS associated with BD in Korea has been reported. Herein we report on a patient of BD who suffered from weakness of extremities and was diagnosed as GBS.",

The syndrome manifests when there is an injury to the posterior parietal and occipital lobes and is often bilateral. Several causes of this syndrome were published in the literature, such as trauma, infarctions, infections, tumors, and pre-eclampsia. It can also be the presenting feature of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as atypical Alzheimer's disease. We report a case of a 62-year-old lady who presented with simultanagnosia, optic apraxia, and ocular ataxia which are the typical signs and symptoms of this syndrome. Neuropsychological evaluation revealed severe affection of the visual-spatial function with intact memory, language, and cognition. Brain imaging confirmed atrophy and decreased perfusion in the posterior parietal and occipital lobes. No underlying cause could be identified to explain the brain parenchymal atrophy. The follow-up neuropsychological assessment and brain imaging did not show any progression confirming the static course of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a movement disorder with cardinal motor symptoms of resting tremor, bradykinesia, freezing of gait, and rigidity.1 Most PD treatments aim to manage motor symptoms through pharmacologic and surgical interventions such as deep brain stimulation. Although these treatments can improve or slow decline in motor symptoms, they can also have adverse side effects, such as debilitating motor fluctuations, and costs are an estimated $25 billion per year in the United States alone.2,3 In addition, nonmotor symptoms, including cognitive impairments, can be as troublesome as motor symptoms, but are not responsive to current PD treatments.4 Results from an extensive review by Seppi et al.4 show a lack of evidence for the effectiveness of pharmacologic treatments for cognitive decline in PD, with the exception of rivastigmine for the treatment of dementia. Cognitive difficulties in domains such as speed of processing, memory, and visuospatial and attentional executive functioning are common in PD, may appear before motor symptom onset, and can affect approximately 25% of patients at disease onset.5 Even subtle cognitive decline can negatively affect quality of life. Furthermore, those experiencing cognitive difficulties early in disease progression are at higher risk for cognitive decline, with 80% developing dementia.6 Therefore, there is a great need to explore nonpharmacologic, noninvasive interventions that are effective in treating cognitive symptoms in order to help patients with PD maintain daily functioning, independence and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by severe and age-inappropriate levels of hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention. ADHD is a heterogeneous disorder, and the majority of patients show comorbid or associated problems from other psychiatric disorders. Also, ADHD is associated with cognitive and motivational problems as well as resting-state abnormalities, associated with impaired brain activity in distinct neuronal networks. This needs to be considered in a multimodal treatment, of which neurofeedback may be a promising component. During neurofeedback, specific brain activity is fed-back using visual or auditory signals, allowing the participants to gain control over these otherwise unaware neuronal processes. Neurofeedback may be used to directly improve underlying neuronal deficits, and/or to establish more general self-regulatory skills that may be used to compensate behavioural difficulties. The current manuscript describes pathophysiological characteristics of ADHD, heterogeneity of ADHD subtypes and gender differences, as well as frequently associated behavioural problems such as oppositional defiant/conduct or tic disorder. It is discussed how neurofeedback may be helpful as a treatment approach within these contexts.",

Nicht jede Art von Tremor ist krankhaft und der physiologische Tremor des Normalen sogar unvermeidbares Begleitsymptom jeder muskulären Aktivität. Der pathologische Tremor ist demgegenüber gekennzeichnet durch eine vergrößerte Tremoramplitude, in der Regel durch niedrigere Tremorfrequenzen und häufig durch Auftreten unter unphysiologischen Aktivierungsbedingungen (z.B. Ruhetremor). Die medikamentösen Behandlungserfolge bei allen Tremorformen sind häufig unbefriedigend. Da bei den meisten Tremores der genaue Ort und die Art der Pathologie im zentralen Nervensystem unbekannt ist, gibt es kaum kausale Behandlungsansätze. So hat es bis heute in der spezifischen medikamentösen Behandlung pathologischer Tremores keine wesentlichen Durchbrüche gegeben, die dem Erfolg des Levodopa beim M. Parkinson vergleichbar wären. Deshalb ist der fortgeschrittene pathologische Tremor seit längerem eines der Zielsymptome funktioneil stereotaktischer Behandlungsverfahren. Seit Einführung der tiefen Hirnstimulation, die bei vielen fortgeschrittenen pathologischen Tremores zu einer dramatischen Reduktion der Tremoramplitude führt und weniger Risiken als die läsionellen Verfahren birgt, ist die operative Behandlung zu einer wichtigen Säule der Tremortherapie geworden. Im Folgenden werden zunächst Klinik, Pathophysiologie und die Grundzüge der Pharmakotherapie pathologischer Tremores dargestellt und dann die Möglichkeiten der tiefen Hirnstimulation bei den verschiedenen Tremores auf dem derzeitigen Wissensstand zusammengefasst.",

Los farmacos con capacidad de bloquear los receptores de la dopamina en el cerebro, pero no unicamente ellos, causan con bastante frecuencia trastornos del movimiento secundarios. Estas alteraciones en el movimiento pueden ser por pobreza o dificultad para realizar movimientos del tipo que se observa en la enfermedad de Parkinson idiopatica (parkinsonismos secundarios a farmacos), o tambien por exceso de movimiento con cuadros distonicos o coreicos agudos o cronicos. La causa por la cual los mismos farmacos provocan efectos aparentemente opuestos no se conoce bien, aunque se supone que factores individuales de farmacocinetica, farmacodinamica y sensibilidad de distintos tipos de subreceptores desempenan un papel esencial. Desarrollo. Se exponen, divididos en dos partes segun el trastorno sea hiper o hipocinetico, los grupos sindromicos mas frecuentes, asi como los farmacos mas habitualmente responsables de dichos cuadros. Los trastornos por exceso de movimiento mas frecuentes son la discinesia aguda, la acatisia y la discinesia tardia. El trastorno por escasez de movimiento es un cuadro parkinsoniano que puede ser indistinguible de la enfermedad de Parkinson idiopatica. Conclusion. El conocimiento de la posible existencia de estos trastornos resulta esencial para la sospecha clinica y el diagnostico.

      "abstract": "FOR MOST PARENTS their child's first convulsion is a dramatic, frightening event which demands immediate medical attention. The physician, on the other hand, may see the patient after recovery from the attack and may tend to minimize the severity of the situation and assume a wait-and-see attitude before investigation and treatment are initiated. The convulsion is a symptom that indicates a disturbance of cerebral neurones. This disturbance may be the result of underlying organic disease of the brain, either fixed or progressive, or it may be an indication of a functional disturbance related to a circulatory or metabolic disorder. The first attack may be so mild that the child is unaffected but subsequent attacks may be prolonged, or result in status epilepicus, and produce a mild or severe degree of mental impairment. There is considerable evidence to indicate that anoxia associated with convulsions can cause brain damage and for this reason every child who has had a convulsion should be investigated and, with rare exception, placed on prophylactic daily anticonvulsant medication when no specific treatable condition is discovered. EVALUATION The first step in the study of a child who has a convulsion is to document its occurrence. Anxious parents are, as a rule, poor witnesses. Despite this, every effort should be made to obtain a description of the seizure, particularly premonitory symptoms, loss of consciousness, convulsive movements, duration of the attack, and the state of the patient following the attack. In infants breath-holding spells may simulate convulsive seizures. In breath-holding spells there is always a precipitating factor, usually a slight injury or some emotional disturbance which results in violent crying, ending suddenly in respiratory apnea. The cyanosis in such attacks appears before the loss of consciousness and convulsive movements.",

The cause of PD is still unknown, but a number of genetic as well as environmental factors contributing to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease have been identified. The hallmark of PD includes dopamine deficiency (neurotransmitter imbalance) due to the gradual loss of dopaminergic nerves in the sub-stantia nigra in the midbrain. Studying the mutation of associated genes is particularly informative in understanding the fundamental molecular and pathogenic changes in PD. Intracellular accumulation of misfolded or degraded protein due to mutated genes leading to the manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress followed by multifaceted patho-physiologic symptoms. Other studies include the appearance of both motor and non-motor responses like resting tremor, muscle stiffness, slow movement and anxiety, anaemia, constipation, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Many bioactive natural compounds have shown positive pharmacological results in treating a number of extensive disease models of PD. Despite the availability of end number of potent medicinal plants around the world, limited research has been done associated with various neurological disorders, in-cluding PD. The currently available dopamine-based drug treatments have several side-effects, fur-ther, not effective enough to combat PD completely. Therefore, various plant-based compounds with medicinal benefits have grabbed lots of attention of researchers to deal with various life-threatening neurodegenerative disorders like PD. On the basis of literature available till date, here, we have dis-cussed and addressed the molecular basis, current scenario, and the best possible treatment of PD for the future with minimal or no side-effects using various key bioactive compounds from natural origin/medicinal plants.",

      "title": "Rare Clinical Image of Kennedy’s Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Sir, Bulbar motor neuron disease, often referred to as bulbar palsy or bulbar onset motor neuron disease, is a subtype of motor neuron disease (MND) that primarily affects the motor neurons located in the bulbar region of the brainstem.[1] This condition is characterized by the progressive degeneration of these motor neurons, leading to impairments in speech, swallowing, and sometimes breathing.[2] It falls under the broader category of neurodegenerative disorders, sharing similarities with conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).[3] The bulbar region of the brainstem is crucial for controlling essential functions such as chewing, swallowing, speaking, and breathing. Motor neurons in this area transmit signals from the brain to the muscles responsible for these actions. However, in bulbar motor neuron disease, these neurons gradually degenerate and lose their ability to function properly, resulting in the hallmark symptoms associated with the condition. One of the earliest and most prominent symptoms of bulbar motor neuron disease is dysarthria, a speech disorder characterized by slurred or unintelligible speech.[4] In addition to speech and swallowing impairments, individuals with bulbar motor neuron disease may also experience weakness and wasting of the facial muscles, leading to facial drooping or difficulty with facial expressions. The exact cause of bulbar motor neuron disease remains unclear, although it is believed to involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Like other forms of motor neuron disease, bulbar onset disease is characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and eventual paralysis.[5] An 85-year-old male patient visited the neurology OPD with complaints of left-side weakness, difficulty swallowing solid food, mild discomfort with liquid food, and difficulty in speech articulation. He had a 15-year history of hypertension and had recently stopped taking antihypertensive medications. Over several months, his symptoms had progressively worsened, including slurred speech, recurrent choking during meals, and weakness in his facial muscles. The initial examination showed the patient to be conscious, cooperative, and well oriented. He was examined in a specific position, and his Glasgow Coma Scale score was E4V1M6. Additionally, the examination revealed the loss of certain reflexes, such as the gag reflex and jaw jerk reflex. Sensory examination indicated intact sensations, while motor examination showed reduced strength in the left upper and lower limbs. Diagnostic tests, including an MRI scan and blood tests, confirmed a diagnosis of bulbar disease. Figure 1a and b reveal the presence of a well-defined extra-axial crescent-shaped collection on the right cerebral hemisphere, with a maximum thickness of 2.5 cm. This collection appears hyperintense in T1WI and hypointense in T2/FLAIR, consistent with an early subacute subdural hematoma. The mass effect is evident, causing effacement of sulcal spaces and the ipsilateral lateral ventricle, along with a midline shift of 6 mm to the left. Additionally, there is focal right frontal periventricular white matter edema. Age-related changes are observed, with prominence in sulcogyral spaces, the cerebellar folia, and the ventricular system.Figure 1: MRI brain showing (a) Susceptibility weighted imaging with right subdural bleed, (b) T1WI imaging showing Subacute bleedPatient's consent The patient's guardian has provided a comprehensive and thorough consent.

There was no correlation between the various diurnal symptoms and the presence of uninhibited bladder contractions. Enuresis was associated with obstructive uropathy in only 6 percent of cases. Some evidence has also been presented to support the concepts of ectopic sensory receptors and abnormal sphincter inhibition. A review of the problem of pathogenesis has suggested four main areas of possible abnormality: 1. A sensory lesion producing inadequate or delayed appreciation of bladder activity. 2. Cortical and subcortical dysfunction because of inadequate arousal or defective maturation of subconscious inhibition. 3. A congenital or acquired upper motor neurone lesion causing an uninhibited bladder. 4. A similar or related lesion causing an over-inhibited sphincter. These factors probably always occur in varying combinations. Because of the lack of association between symptoms, signs and objective measurements, there is a strong case for relating diagnosis, prognosis and treatment to urodynamic assessment.",

      "title": "Neural circuits underlying motor and non-motor defects of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes unintended and uncontrollable movements, such as tremors, rigidity, and difficulty with balance and coordination. Neuronal degeneration in the basal ganglia network has been suggested as a likely cause for some PD symptoms. More specifically, such degeneration would lead to an imbalance between the direct pathway (from striatum to substantia nigra) and the indirect pathway (from striatum to pallidum), which subsequently drives movement deficits.1McGregor M.M. Nelson A.B. Circuit mechanisms of Parkinson's disease.Neuron. 2019; 101: 1042-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar Current treatments for the motor dysfunction of PD include dopamine agonists, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and physical therapy. Aside from severe motor impairments, PD patients can also experience defects in cognitive processes such as memory and attention and suffer from depression or stress. However, the neural circuit basis for these different PD symptoms is not well understood. Improving our understanding of these non-motor PD symptoms could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic approaches for their treatment in the future. The parafascicular thalamic nucleus (PF) is located in the caudal region of the intralaminar thalamic complex and projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), caudate putamen (CPu), and nucleus accumbens (NAc), among other regions. Based on the knowledge that both STN and CPu have been linked to PD defects, that NAc activity is correlated with reward/depression, and that DBS targeting PF alleviates some pathophysiological changes, Zhang and colleagues systematically investigated the function of these PF circuits in mice and published their findings in Nature recently.2Zhang Y. Roy D.S. Zhu Y. et al.Targeting thalamic circuits rescues motor and mood deficits in PD mice.Nature. 2022; 607: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar In this study, the authors clarified the function of three different subpopulations of PF neurons in locomotion, motor learning, and depression-like states in PD mice, and they demonstrated that regulating specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed in PF neurons and their projections was sufficient to rescue both motor and non-motor defects in PD mice (Figure 1). PF has extensive connectivity with the basal ganglia network. A recent study dissecting cortical-thalamic-striatal circuits suggests PF neurons are anatomically and transcriptionally organized.3Mandelbaum G. Taranda J. Haynes T.M. et al.Distinct cortical-thalamic-striatal circuits through the parafascicular nucleus.Neuron. 2019; 102: 636-652.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar The authors first investigated whether PF contains subpopulations based on their projections to three different brain regions. They found projections from PF thalamus to CPu, STN, and NAc, as expected. Retrogradely labeled PF neurons from CPu or STN (PF→CPu or PF→STN) were intermingled in lateral PF, whereas NAc-projecting PF neurons (PF→NAc) were restricted to medial PF. These three PF subpopulations showed minimal overlap, suggesting the existence of at least three distinct projection-specific circuits. Based on these anatomical data and additional electrophysiological differences, the authors hypothesized that the functions of these PF subpopulations might be different. By manipulating individual PF subpopulations in wild-type mice, the authors found that CPu-projecting PF neurons contributed to general motor activity (i.e., locomotion), whereas the PF→STN circuit was critical for motor learning. These findings revealed differential functions of PF subpopulations located in the lateral region of this nucleus. In contrast, the PF→NAc circuit was found to be associated with a depression-like state but not locomotion or motor learning processes. Importantly, when the authors examined these three PF circuits in an acute PD model, they found that each circuit showed an alteration in its strength or plasticity, indicating that these circuits are not only critical for physiological functions but are also targeted in this disease model. Although the above findings provided potential targets for developing DBS-based strategies, it is critical to find out if there was a molecular target-based alternative for treating motor and non-motor PD symptoms. The best-known treatment options for PD are levodopa and monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors, which mostly help with locomotion. Motor learning and non-motor symptoms, on the other hand, have fewer treating options. The authors identified an α7 nAChR agonist, PNU282987, which significantly improved motor learning through parvalbumin (PV+) STN neurons. Further, an α6 nAChR antagonist targeting CPu-projecting PF neurons rescued locomotion deficits, and a β2 nAChR agonist acting on D1+ NAc neurons alleviated depression-like behaviors in PD mice. Notably, the authors found that the identified molecular targets expressed in mouse PF can also be found in non-human primates (NHPs). They found that α7 nAChRs were highly expressed in PV+ STN neurons, α6 nAChRs were expressed in PF cell bodies, and β2 nAChRs were highly expressed in D1+ NAc neurons in NHPs. As NHPs are closely related to humans, these findings suggest that targeting different nAChRs in PF circuits may alleviate both motor and non-motor deficits in PD. Another message from both Feng group and Sabatini group is that subpopulations and their projections play unique roles in PF circuitry.2Zhang Y. Roy D.S. Zhu Y. et al.Targeting thalamic circuits rescues motor and mood deficits in PD mice.Nature. 2022; 607: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,3Mandelbaum G. Taranda J.

McEwen S. et al.Exercise-enhanced neuroplasticity targeting motor and cognitive circuitry in Parkinson's disease.Lancet Neurol. 2013; 12: 716-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar Combining single-cell sequencing technologies with neural tracing and electrophysiology recording to precisely dissect regional/subregional markers and their unique connectivity offers an exciting direction for future studies, which will not only strengthen our understanding of brain networks in health and disease conditions, but can also help identify cell type- and projection-specific therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, given the PF-striatal projections were found to be topographically organized with unique molecular architecture and electrophysiological properties,3Mandelbaum G. Taranda J. Haynes T.M. et al.Distinct cortical-thalamic-striatal circuits through the parafascicular nucleus.Neuron. 2019; 102: 636-652.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar Zhang et al. indicated CPu projection was associated with general motor defects in PD. It is intriguing to explore whether heterogeneous populations in PF-striatal projections have distinct functions in PD. Another foreseeable challenge is the therapeutic method. Following the finding that regulating different nAChRs improves motor or non-motor symptoms in PD, it remains challenging to develop an all-in-one treatment. Given that the NHP model has a higher translational potential, the current study pointed out the importance of studying PF circuits and testing molecular target candidates using NHP PD models, which could speed up the clinical applications of this work. Realistically speaking there is a long way to go for the current study to directly benefit patients with PD. As a proof-of-concept study, the findings need to undergo verification in NHPs before an initial preclinical test,5Dai J. Gaining a better understanding of nonhuman primate research.Sci. Bull. 2021; 66: 1499-1501Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar which may take years before an official clinical trial gets approval. In addition to neural circuit-based strategies, other candidate therapeutic approaches are being developed in parallel with the hope of treating PD patients in the future. For instance, converting astrocytes to dopamine neurons using gene-editing technology has recently been reported in rodents. Therefore, there is reason to be hopeful that with the development of cutting-edge experimental techniques our understanding of PD mechanisms will improve and in this way lead to novel therapeutic approaches.

      "abstract": "Neurologists are often called to evaluate central nervous system [CNS] manifestations in patients with suspected or definite systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]. The manifestations are highly diverse and often have major prognostic consequences. The major difficulties are to determine if the given manifestation is primarily due to SLE activity in the brain, or a consequence of metabolic disturbances, infection, or corticosteroid use. The true incidence of CNS manifestations attributable to SLE is not entirely clear, but several studies show prevalence rate between 15-75%, depending on criteria adopted. For cognitive impairment, the prevalence ranges from 17-59%. Cognitive impairment may be attributed to emotional distress, corticosteroid use, active systemic disease or primary CNS dysfunction. These manifestations may occur even in the absence of other neuropsychiatric [NP] manifestations clearly attributable to SLE. The etiology of cognitive impairment may be related to autoimmune mechanisms, such as brain-specific autoantibodies. Despite several studies using computer tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], brain structural abnormalities could not be associated with cognitive findings in SLE patients. Functional neuroimaging methods may be more sensitive for detecting subclinical brain involvement related to cognitive dysfunction in SLE. Despite the fact that cognitive impairment may be residual in patients with previous CNS involvement, it also may be an early marker of CNS involvement in previous asymptomatic patients. This article will review clinical assessment, pathogenic mechanism, and the role of neuroimaging methods in the evaluating of SLE patients with cognitive impairment.

      "abstract": "Chronic fatigue syndrome is characterized by severe, persistent fatigue which is not relieved by rest and is not associated to other medical conditions. Other common symptoms are including concentration and memory impairment, muscle and multiple joints pain, extreme exhaustion after physical or mental exertions, irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms and depression, anxiety, mood swings and panic attacks. Etiology of the syndrome is not yet clear, post-viral and stress hypotheses were not verified. Diagnosis is confirmed in case of new onset of severe fatigue, for six consecutive months or more; fatigue is leading to significant reduction of the activity levels and is accompanied by other four or more of the specific associated symptoms, which are also lasting for six months or longer. The management of the disease is based on cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercise therapy and pacing; medication plays a minor role in therapy. The occupational status is severely affected, more than half of the cases being unable to work. Full recovery rate is in average of about 5%.",

      "title": "MYOCLONUS",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Myoclonus is a sudden, brief, shock-like, involuntary movement caused by muscular contractions (positive myoclonus) or inhibition (negative myoclonus). Myoclonus is not a diagnosis but rather a descriptive term for the clinical event. However, it is a useful sign of clinical significance that may lead to a syndromic diagnosis. Myoclonic jerks may be subtle or may interfere severely with the execution of even the simplest motor task. REVIEW SUMMARY In this review, we describe the classification of myoclonus and the many possible variant and pathophysiological features. Myoclonus may arise from various sites in the neuraxis, including the cortex, subcortex, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system. Electrodiagnostic testing may be useful for clinical diagnosis and may impact therapeutic options. Myoclonus may be difficult to differentiate from other hyperkinetic movement disorders with similar presentations. Therapy is limited and usually symptomatic. CONCLUSIONS Careful attention should be given to the fundamental clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of the hyperkinetic movement phenomenology and the clinical circumstances in which myoclonus appears. This approach may provide clues to the underlying neurologic disorder and may also suggest appropriate treatment options. (THE NEUROLOGIST 7:171-179, 2001)",

      "abstract": "Clinical studies support a bidirectional link between depression and neurological diseases. Here we review the most recent findings supporting the hypothesis that major depression is a medical illness of the brain which can be elicited by neurological illnesses.In the last year major improvements in brain-imaging techniques allowed correlations to be demonstrated between functional and structural brain abnormalities in specific brain areas (prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus) and the presence and severity of affective disorders, thus suggesting a neural basis for their onset and progression. Similar lesions, caused by neurological diseases, have been found to correlate with the presence of depression in neurological illnesses, but literature on the topic is still lacking. Depression in neurological disorders responds to the same treatments available for idiopathic major depression, but patients seem to have different sensitivities to side effects depending on their specific neurological syndrome. Most available data come from case reports and open trials.'Psychiatric' and 'neurologic' depression seem to share common abnormalities in specific brain areas, but sound brain-imaging studies of the neural correlates of depression in neurological disorders are still lacking. Available treatments are efficacious, but no clear-cut guidelines about the best drugs and dosages can be defined because double-blind placebo-controlled studies are still scarce.",

The presence of dementia should be suspected whenever mental changes of insidious onset emerge without sufficient situational stress and gradually interfere with the daily living activities that are appropriate for age and background. Dementia can be reversible or irreversible, precipitously progressive or indolent, bristling with multiple cognitive deficits, or characterized almost exclusively by disturbances of affect, motivation, and personality. When the behavioral changes are dramatic and interfere with active careers in younger individuals, early diagnosis poses little difficulty. The real challenge arises among the elderly, in whom dementia is also far more common. This is because the elderly tend to have less demanding daily activities, the disruption of which may take longer to detect, and also because",

Since it was first described 200 years ago by Dr James Parkinson, great steps have been made in the understanding of the pathology. However, the cause(s) that initiates and perpetuates the neurodegenerative process is (are) still not clear. Thus, early diagnosis is not available, nor are there efficient therapies that can stop neurodegeneration. PD clinical features are defined by motor (like bradykinesia, resting tremor, gait impairment) and non-motor symptoms (like constipation, apathy, fathigue, olfactory dysfunction, depression and cognitive decline) that get more severe as the disease advances. Neuropathological hallmarks comprise selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and Lewy bodies (LB) in different nuclei of the nervous system. Numerous studies have shown that these pathological features are aggravated by the confluence of other contributing factors, such as a genetic component, exposure to environmental toxins, mitochondrial dysfunction, increase of oxidative stress, calcium imbalance and chronic neuroinflammation, among others. Here, we provide a summary of the actual state of PD's pathology, the most studied molecular mechanisms, classic and novel therapeutic strategies and diagnosis methods, especially highlighting recent advances in these 200 years.",

It is a chronic and progressive condition. The word “Moyamoya” is Japanese which refers to a hazy puff of smoke or cloud due to the appearance of blood vessels like a puff of smoke in angiograms of people suffering from this disease. The exact etiology of Moyamoya disease remains unclear, but there seems to be genetic and acquired forms. The first sign of Moyamoya disease is usually stroke or recurrent Transient Ischemic Attacks (TIAs) also called “mini-strokes”. Some other symptoms may include brain hemorrhage, headaches, developmental delays, aneurysm, involuntary movements, problems with cognitive abilities, problems with the senses, seizures, hemiparesis, ischaemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke. Despite the etiology of Moyamoya disease being unclear, there are certain factors which may increase the risk of getting the disease, like Asian ancestry, family history of Moyamoya disease, other medical conditions, being female and being young. Moyamoya disease has a very unclear etiology and pathogenesis. Moyamoya disease can be diagnosed using tests like Cerebral Arteriography, Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), etc. There is no cure for Moyamoya disease, but can be treated using drugs and surgical procedures. Hence, extensive studies need to be conducted in order to better determine the exact pathophysiology of the disease and also to find more effective treatment options that would further improve the prognosis in patients with Moyamoya Disease.",

These changes may be intrinsic and part of the process of ageing (see Chapter 3) or they may be the result of pathological conditions in other organs and tissues, especially in the cardiovascular system. Critchley (1931) has drawn attention to the effects of ageing on neurological signs. Many physical signs indicative of disease in the young may not be of significance in the diagnosis of clinical neurological disorders in old age. Thus loss of vibration sense and tendon jerks in the lower limbs do not necessarily mean peripheral neuropathy; irregular sluggish pupils are not pathognomonic of neurosyphilis and the frequent occurrence of a bodily attitude of flexion, disorders of gait, tremors and a positive glabellar tap sign leads to difficulties in establishing the diagnosis of Parkinsonism.",

No association between primary brain tumors and neuromuscular disorders has been described. Here, we present a case of a 65-year-old patient who developed MG, following an uncomplicated, gross-total resection of a glioblastoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case describing the onset of MG during the early postoperative phase after glioblastoma resection. Current criteria of PNS are insufficient when the neurological syndrome is diagnosed at the time of a malignancy or shortly thereafter and should be revisited.",

Il est à ce jour établi que la triade symptomatique « hypertonie extrapyramidale-tremblement- akinésie » ne peut résumer la complexité du trouble. Parmi les troubles psychiatriques comorbides à la maladie de Parkinson, la dépression est probablement la plus importante en termes de fréquence et d’impact. La prévalence de la dépression est particulièrement élevée, estimée à environ 40 %. Les symptômes dépressifs peuvent être évidents et même précéder les troubles moteurs de la maladie, cependant, le diagnostic d’épisode dépressif est le plus souvent complexe, en raison d’un chevauchement symptomatique des deux troubles. Pouvant inaugurer la maladie de Parkinson ou survenir plus tardivement, la dépression a un retentissement majeur sur l’autonomie fonctionnelle et la qualité de vie des patients. Il existe par ailleurs un lien entre dépression et troubles cognitifs chez les sujets atteints de maladie de Parkinson. La prise en charge de l’épisode dépressif majeur chez un patient présentant une maladie de Parkinson ne fait pas l’objet de recommandation. Les essais cliniques randomisés réalisés sont, à ce jour, trop peu nombreux et les résultats très hétérogènes.

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) are common in the prodromal stage of dementia and can precede the onset of cognitive impairment. The presence of NPS in cognitively normal patients or in patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is associated with an increased risk of progression along the neurodegenerative process. The need to identify, in the early stages of the disease, the population at risk of cognitive decline has led to the formulation of the concept of Mild Behavioral Impairment (MBI). This neurobehavioral syndrome is characterized by late-onset sustained psychiatric symptoms, in patients without cognitive deficits or in those with MCI, identifying a condition associated with an increased probability of conversion into dementia. MBI represents the neurobehavioral axis of pre-dementia risk states, as a complement to the neurocognitive axis of MCI. For some, MBI may be the initial manifestation of neurodegenerative disease, observed before cognitive impairment is apparent. The Mild Behavioral Impairment-Checklist (MBI-C) was developed on the basis of the MBI diagnostic criteria, established by the International Society to Advance Alzheimer's Research and Treatment (ISTAART). The MBI-C allows to identify, in a standardized way, patients with MBI and to follow the course of their neurodegenerative disease. This article describes the creation of the MBI-C scale and presents its Italian version.",

Psychiatric symptoms often represent the clinical onset of such disorders, thus potentially leading to misdiagnosis, delay in treatment, and a worse outcome. In this review, psychiatric symptoms observed along the course of several neurological diseases, namely Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis, are discussed, as well as the involved brain circuits and molecular/synaptic alterations. Special attention has been paid to the emerging role of fluid biomarkers in early detection of these neurodegenerative diseases. The frequent occurrence of psychiatric symptoms in neurological diseases, even as the first clinical manifestations, should prompt neurologists and psychiatrists to share a common clinico-biological background and a coordinated diagnostic approach.",

      "abstract": ": Neurological diseases expose individuals to a higher risk of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior, including completed suicides and suicide attempts. They also represent a paradigmatic arena to study the etiopathogenic mechanisms underlying suicidality because they are emblematic of the heterogeneity and complexity of mutual interrelationships characterizing this issue. On the one hand, neurological diseases imply strictly biological impairments that are postulated to be the basis of vulnerability to suicide or result in the need for treatments for which a suicidal risk has been hypothesized. On the other hand, they question some subjective experiences of neurological patients, up to near existential positions. Often, in fact, they are accompanied by severe hopelessness. The latter may originate in, particularly for the most severe neurological diseases, the absence of curative treatments, unpredictable disease progression that leads to acute relapses or chronicity, a decrease in autonomy or selfidentity, progressive social isolation, a sense of becoming useless, and perception of feeling stigmatized. This may ultimately cause a slip into experiencing an absurd condition. At the confluence of neurobiology and hopelessness, frequent psychiatric comorbidities may play a primary role. To conclude, neurological patients require special attention from clinicians in form of openly verbalizing and exploring the suicidal thematic, inquiring about protective and risk factors, and promptly initiating both a psychopharmacological treatment and, where possible, psychological support.",

Most frequently mood disorders have a primary origin, following poligenic multifactorial model. Moreover there is a non negligible proportion of cases in which depressive symptoms accompany neurological illnesses or they even constitute a part of predominant manifestations at the clinical start of neurologic disease, or mark a point of inflexion in its course. The aim of the present article is to review relevant literature dealing with this topic.A significative higher frequency of depressive phenomenology, not explainable by hazard, can be an early manifestation in children and adolescents with: epileptic syndromes, sleep disorders, chronic recurrent cephalalgias, several neurometabolic diseases, and intracranial tumors. Points of coincidence have been shown in dysequilibrium of brain neurotransmitters (serotonine, noradrenaline, hyperglutamatergic states) which could not be hypothesized as maintaining both neurological and mood conditions.The suspiction of a neurological disease should be adopted in cases of mood disorder not easily explainable by familial antecedents or clear biographical stressors. The search for a brain disorder by means of a meticulous anamnesis and neurological clinical and ancillary exams makes possible to discover the brain disorder at a very early stage and ameliorate the chances of accurately manage both the neurological and mood disorders. The simultaneous treatment of both dimension of the illness helps to improve the patients' quality of life.Fenomenologia depresiva al inicio de enfermedades neuropediatricas.Introduccion. La depresion, en sus diversas formas, afecta al 8-10% de niños y adolescentes y en la mayor parte de casos su origen es primario, siguiendo el modelo genetico multifactorial. Pero hay una proporcion de pacientes, no bien cuantificada todavia, en la que la depresion acompaña precozmente una enfermedad neurologica o marca un punto de inflexion en el curso de esta. El objetivo es revisar la bibliografia al respecto. Desarrollo. Se observa fenomenologia depresiva, con una frecuencia significativamente mayor que por azar, en niños y adolescentes afectos de epilepsia, trastornos del sueño, cefaleas primarias cronicas recurrentes, enfermedades neurometabolicas y tumores intracraneales. En varias de estas patologias neuropediatricas se hipotetizan puntos de coincidencia fisiopatologica con la depresion a traves de un deficit de disponibilidad cerebral de serotonina y noradrenalina. No se considera aqui la depresion disadaptativa a una neurodiscapacidad cronica. Conclusiones. En niños y adolescentes, los trastornos del animo sintomaticos de enfermedad neurologica deben sospecharse en ausencia de antecedentes familiares o de experiencias vitales que los expliquen. La busqueda sistematica de anomalias neurologicas y los examenes complementarios permitirian en estos casos abordar precozmente el tratamiento de la enfermedad cerebral causante del cuadro depresivo. A su vez, como ocurre en casos de epilepsia, cefaleas o trastorno del sueño, la terapia farmacologica y psicologica del cuadro depresivo contribuye a mejorar la calidad de vida de los afectados.",

      "title": "Psychomotor retardation in major depressive disorder: A dimension to be rediscovered?",
      "abstract": "Psychomotor activity is one of the traits we most immediately perceive in others. Psychomotor slowing, which can be easily noticed on a first medical examination, is a symptom which may be prodromal of psychic disturbances. Historically, psychomotor retardation is a characteristic attached to depression, especially melancholia. Some studies show that psychomotor retardation is associated with good therapeutic prognosis, including positive response to electro-convulsivo-therapy. The cluster of non-verbal symptoms includes both basic aspects related to motor behavior such as attitudes and movements and more complex aspects such as goal-directed behaviors. We will see that this intuitive and fundamental dimension of clinical depression is not homogeneous. From a motor point of view, hypo-bradykinesia in depression may be compared to the one found in cortico-subcortical syndromes such as Parkinson's disease. This comparison suggests that key brain structures such as the basal ganglia could be involved in depression. Moreover, the loss of vital energy is the dominant psychopathological explanation linked to psychomotor retardation. From a phenomenological point of view, this interpretation seems to be relevant but appears disappointing as an experimental variable. However, motivation, understood as the factor that energizes the behavior seems to be an interesting and promising concept. Experimentally, it is possible to measure how much an individual is able to invest energy in order to achieve a goal. The impact of depression on the process of incentive motivation will be analyzed before turning to a description of therapeutic interventions related to psychomotor field such as sports or sensorimotor stimulations that appear to be promising tracks for clinical improvement.",

This report compares and contrasts clinical features of new onset of psychotic symptoms between two patients, one with an acute basal ganglia hemorrhagic stroke and another with an acute mid-brain ischemic stroke. Delusions and hallucinations due to basal ganglia lesions are theorized to develop as a result of frontal lobe dysfunction causing impairment of reality checking pathways in the brain, while visual hallucinations due to mid-brain lesions are theorized to develop due to dysregulation of inhibitory control of the ponto-geniculate-occipital system. Psychotic symptoms occurring due to stroke demonstrate varied clinical characteristics that depend on the location of the stroke within the brain.

      "title": "Do seizures cause brain damage?",
      "abstract": "Children with epilepsy are at significant risk for cognitive impairment and behavioral abnormalities. In most children with epilepsy, the likely reason for cognitive impairment is the underlying pathology responsible for the seizures. However, there is considerable controversy about whether seizures per se can cause brain damage or increase subsequent susceptibility to seizure. Although some longitudinal studies have related a decline in intellectual abilities to continued seizures, other studies indicate that treatment with antiepileptic drugs or progression of the encephalopathic process is responsible for the decline. Both clinical and animal studies have focused on the long-term effects of seizures on the developing brain. Whereas prolonged seizures may cause permanent neurologic sequelae in the mature animal, the immature brain may be more resistant to the long-term sequelae of seizures.",

      "abstract": "Das maligne neuroleptische Syndrom (MNS) als gefürchtete Komplikation einer Therapie mit Neuroleptika ist in seinem Pathomechanismus weiterhin unverstanden. Die Ausprägung des Vollbildes mit Hyperthermie, Hyperhidrosis, Verwirrtheit, Rigidität, autonomer Dysregulation sowie gesteigerter Kreatininkinase zeigt eine Inzidenz zwischen 0,02 und 2,4%. Milde subsyndromale Verlaufsformen sollen in der Inzidenz um 12% liegen [3]. Oft ist die differenzialdiagnostische Unterscheidung von MNS und febriler Katatonie schwierig. Die perniziöse oder febrile Katatonie gilt als Sonderform der katatonen Schizophrenie. Aufgrund erheblicher Überschneidungen in der Symptomatik (Hyperthermie, Bewusstseinsstörungen, Stupor und autonome Dysregulationen bei beiden Syndromen) spricht man auch vom \"katatonen Dilemma\". Diagnostische Unterschiede lassen sich, wenn überhaupt, am Anfang der Symptomatik herausarbeiten. So beginnt die perniziöse Katatonie mit typischen schizophrenen Symptomen. Ein MNS entwickelt sich dagegen meist innerhalb von 1–2 Wochen nach Beginn der Neuroleptikatherapie, wenn die psychotische Symptomatik häufig bereits abgeschwächt ist. Bei der perniziösen Katatonie findet sich typischerweise eine ausgeprägte extrapyramidale Symptomatik mit Rigor, Akinese, aber auch Dys- und Hyperkinesen sowie Stupor [1,2,4].",

Pojavnost Parkinsonove bolesti raste s životnom dobi. Etioloski se dijeli u 3 grupe: idiopatski, postencefaliticni i neurolepticni oblik. Dijagnostika se temelji na prisutnosti tri glavna simptoma,a to su tremor, rigor i bradikinezija. Nema laboratorijske pretrage koja ce potvrditi bolest. Problemi koji se javljaju se mogu podjeliti na tjelesne, psiholoske i socijalne. Simptomi koji karakteriziraju Parkinsonovu bolest su: akineticki tremor, rigor, bradikinezija i posturalna nestabilnost. Depresija, anksioznost i poremecaj spavanja se pojavljuju u vidu psiholoskih problema. Socijalni problemi oboljelih su položaj u drustvu, prisutnost predrasuda i neadekvatnih arhitektonskih barijera. Bolest se ne može u potpunosti izlijeciti. Cilj lijecenja je usporiti tijek bolesti, a to se provodi primjenom lijekova i fizikalne terapije. U ovom radu je analizirano istraživanje o stavovima okoline prema osobama s Parkinsonovom bolesti. Istraživanje je obuhvacalo 26 ucenika 4. razreda Srednje skole Pakrac, smjera fizioterapeutski tehnicar. Upitnik koji se koristio za istraživanje je „Stavovi okoline prema osobama s tjelesnim teskocama“. Upitnik sadrži tri komponente: Kognitivna komponenta stavova (1 i 2) i Afektivnu komponentu stavova. Kognitivna komponenta stavova se dijeli na implikaciju devijantnih karakteristika i tragicno sagledavanje osoba s tjelesnim ostecenjima. Afektivna komponenta podrazumijeva emocionalan odnos ispitanika prema oboljelima. Rezultati istraživanja su pokazali da ucenici imaju pozitivne stavove prema oboljelima od Parkinsonove bolesti, a najvise prema njihovom odnosu u drustvu. Ucenici ne pokazuju neugodno ponasanje, nesigurnost te strah od izravnog kontakta u prisutnosti oboljelih.",

The actual burden of mental disorders in older adults is probably underestimated because the stigma associated with mental disorders results in under-reporting of symptoms by older adults, under-diagnosis by healthcare providers, clinical significance of sub-threshold symptoms, and underrepresentation in epidemiological studies of high-risk older adults. Common mental health problems often present atypically in older individuals; and loss of physical abilities, financial resources, and family and friends can challenge even the most resilient amongst older people. As part of comprehensive diagnostic workup, neuroimaging such as non-contrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans are recommended for all older adults with significant cognitive deficits, new-onset mood or psychotic symptoms accompanied by subtle neurological symptoms, or general physical symptoms.",

A medida que la enfermedad de Parkinson progresa, sus manifestaciones no motoras se van haciendo cada vez mas evidentes, hasta el punto de que, en fases avanzadas, llegan a dominar el cuadro clinico. El abanico de sintomas no motores de la enfermedad de Parkinson es muy amplio. Las alteraciones de la funcion urinaria y de la funcion sexual (entendida como capacidad para llevar a cabo la funcion sexual) pueden enmarcarse dentro de los trastornos disautonomicos. La hipersexualidad se englobaria en el grupo de trastornos del control de impulsos. Desarrollo. Se revisa la epidemiologia, fenomenologia y tratamiento de los trastornos urinarios, la disfuncion sexual y la hipersexualidad como sintomas no motores de la enfermedad de Parkinson. Conclusiones. Los trastornos urinarios son el sintoma no motor mas frecuente en la enfermedad de Parkinson. Se presentan, habitualmente, como nicturia, urgencia y aumento de la frecuencia miccional (polaquiuria). El tratamiento de eleccion son los anticolinergicos. La disfuncion sexual es una queja frecuente en el enfermo parkinsoniano. Su etiologia es multifactorial y resulta mas frecuente en el varon que en la mujer. En el hombre se manifiesta principalmente como incapacidad para la ereccion, eyaculacion precoz o perdida de la capacidad para eyacular, mientras que en la mujer predomina la disminucion de la libido, la disminucion del arousal y la dificultad para alcanzar el orgasmo. La hipersexualidad afecta sobre todo a varones jovenes y se ha relacionado con el uso de agonistas dopaminergicos.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Hereditary optic neuropathies are a group of disorders characterized by optic nerve damage in which the underlying cause is heritable. Optic atrophy is a clinical state in which there is pallor of the optic nerve due to loss of ganglion cell axons and supporting microvascular tissue, often associated with decreased vision. Optic neuropathy is a more general term that includes the early phase of the disease when optic atrophy may not yet be present. Clinical severity may vary from lack of symptoms to complete blindness. Hereditary causes of optic neuropathy include primary optic nerve disease; compression by a genetically determined tumor, for example, in neurofibromatosis; or degeneration, as occurs in the later stages of retinitis pigmentosa. Although glaucoma is an optic neuropathy and has features like other hereditary optic neuropathies, it is not discussed in this chapter. Optic atrophy may be an isolated event or may be associated with other neurologic or systemic manifestations. In this chapter we discuss Kjer autosomal dominant optic atrophy and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) as well as optic atrophy associated with Wolfram syndrome and some of the neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction appears to be a common denominator in many of the hereditary optic neuropathies.",

Certain chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension are associated with mildly impaired cognitive functioning. Delerium may be mistaken for dementia in older people. Parkinson's disease occurs as a result of cell loss in the basal ganglia, an area in the underlying structure of the brain. A cerebrovascular accident or stroke occurs as a result of an infarction in the blood vessels to and within the brain, or a haemorrhage in the brain. Although head injuries affect larger numbers of younger people, falls and related head injuries are more common in older people. The onset of dementia is often accompanied by depression and anxiety.

TBI can be separated into a primary injury and secondary injury. Primary injury is a result of the physical head impact, whereas secondary injury can occur as long as months to years later and is the result of pathophysiological changes in the central nervous system. TBI is considered a risk factor for chronic neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy) in spite of each disease having unique clinical symptoms, pathologies, and specific discriminating proteins. To date, little is known about the pathological changes responsible for linking TBI to neurodegenerative diseases.",

      "abstract": "The prognosis for those suffering from frequent seizures will be closely linked to their etiology (1). If there is extensive brain damage, whether this results from trauma, disease, or brain tumors, there is likely to be a poor response to whatever treatment is given. The more diffuse the lesions the worse this will be: and localisation is also a factor, for example mesial temporal sclerosis causing complex partial seizures. For these reasons patients who are mentally handicapped often have the additional handicap of epilepsy (2). The best chance of controlling the fits lies in making an accurate diagnosis and applying appropriate treatment, whether this is surgery to remove a tumor or the identification of a metabolic disorder which can be controlled, such as pyridoxine dependency or biotinidase deficiency (3). It is important to identify epileptic syndromes, often genetically determined, so that at least an accurate prognosis can be given, even if this does not effect treatment. For example the prognosis for infantile spasms and the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are well known (4). Tuberous sclerosis is another diagnosis to be viewed with concern. Even within the field of epilepsy there are important diagnostic issues; for instance differentiating minor seizures from reflex anoxic seizures, and absence epilepsy and pseudoseizures from complex partial seizures (5).

      "abstract": "Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction or Ogilvie's syndrome is a disorder causing massive colonic dilation with no evidence of mechanical obstruction. The actual incidence of acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is unclear; However, electrolyte imbalance, psychiatric disorders, the use of medications such as anticholinergics or antipsychotics, and recent abdominal surgery are the most common predisposing factors associated with this syndrome. Ogilvie's syndrome is most likely caused due to impairment of the gut's motor system and an imbalance of the autonomic nervous system including a reduction in the activity of stimulatory neurotransmitters. The predisposition to psychotic disorders could be, in some instances, due to neurodevelopmental abnormalities of the brain and the gut’s autonomic nervous system. The symptoms of Ogilvie's syndrome are similar to mechanical obstruction of the colon but no physical cause of obstruction is usually present. Ogilvie's syndrome can be managed conservatively; however, if left untreated, Ogilvie's syndrome can lead to bowel perforation, which is associated with a high mortality risk. Antipsychotics have been considered the cornerstone treatment for psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia. Even though they are highly effective in treating psychiatric illnesses, their usage carries multiple risks. Overall, constipation is a common side effect of antipsychotic medications with some classes posing more risk than others. Constipation can be severe and may lead to serious complications such as paralytic ileus, bowel ischemia, and death. We present here a case of delusional disorder managed with risperidone and complicated by intestinal pseudo-obstruction. This case reiterates the need to consider all complications of antipsychotic medications, even rare ones, and include them in the discussion with patients and their caregivers before commencement.",

The physician involved in the care of these patients knows that the disease may present itself also with extramotor symptoms, which condition a more difficult management of the patient. The non-motor symptoms are classified in four categories in order of management importance: 1) disautonomic, 2) cognitive, 3) affective and 4) sensitive. These symptoms are more frequent and difficult to manage in late stage of disease, except for affective type, which may be precox and adaptive at the communication of the diagnosis or sometime precede it. The more frequent disautonomic symptoms are: constipation, symptoms related to the uro-genital sphere, the cardio-pressor regulation (orthostatic hypotension), the thermoregulation, sialorrhea dysphagia and seborrhoea. The cognitive symptoms: isolate (bradyphrenia, alteration of executive function) or dementia with or without delirium and allucinosis. The affective symptoms: depression, agitation, anxiety, panic attacks. The sensitive symptoms: pain, dysesthesia, paresthesia with bizzarre features (cold sensation, numbness, interior agitation). There are other symptoms which are not framing in the previous categories: sleep, respiratory and circulatory disorders (venous and lymphatic), which have different causal factors: emotional-affective, motor and iatrogenic. The therapeutic intervention on these symptoms is of essential importance in the management of the patient with Parkinson's disease, with a great impact on his quality of life.

These neuropathies may have different chemical features depending on the nature of the dysglobulinemia. Most frequently it is a picture of predominantly sensory polyneuropathy. The autoimmune origin of the neuropathies with demyelination, observed in \"benign\" monoclonal gammopathies or some Waldenström diseases, is strongly suggested by immunohistochemical studies. Neuropathies associated with multiple myeloma or amyloidosis, are generally due to compressions, infiltrations or hemorragic destructions. The neuropathy frequently reveals and preceeds the dysglobulinemia, which should be looked for in all neuropathy without any obvious cause.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder diagnosed by the presence of bradykinesia and at least 1 of the symptoms of rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability. It is increasingly recognized that nonmotor symptoms are common and can adversely affect quality of life, yet they often are not diagnosed and consequently are often untreated. Nonmotor symptoms include neuropsychiatric issues such as anxiety, depression, hallucinations, impulse control disorders, and cognitive impairment, as well as autonomic dysfunction, which may present as gastrointestinal, urinary, and sexual disturbances. Nonmotor symptoms also include excessive sweating, orthostatic hypotension, and sleep disturbances. Management of PD requires recognition of both motor and nonmotor symptoms as well as an understanding of the relationship between these symptoms and how they can be affected by treatments for PD. Therapy should be individualized for each patient, as treatments for the motor symptoms of PD can improve some nonmotor symptoms while they can worsen others. In many cases, symptom-specific treatments are necessary to control nonmotor symptoms of PD.",

Each may cause altered mental status and behavior, but by different mechanisms. Encephalopathies involve widespread, usually inhibitory, brain dysfunction. Epileptic seizures usually consist of paroxysmal rhythmic excitatory brain activity that produces abnormal function. Some syndromes include both. Sometimes, an encephalopathy may cause seizures, and many patients are encephalopathic postictally. Nonconvulsive seizures and nonconvulsive status epilepticus may be difficult to distinguish from encephalopathies. The EEG is crucial in the distinction, but epileptiform features may appear in either. The greatest area of overlap and difficulty in diagnosis is probably that following clinical seizures, when a patient may have a postictal encephalopathy or may still be seizing.",

The prevalence of sexual disorders in women taking antidepressants varies from 22% to 58% with higher rates for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and lower rates for bupropion. The presence of other than sexual MS symptoms such as fatigue, spasticity, impaired coordination, impaired mobility, muscle weakness, bladder and bowel dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, and medication side effects cause difficulty in experiencing sexual intercourse or other sexual acts.

Un diagnóstico precoz y la detección de los signos clínicos de gravedad son fundamentales, ya que influyen directamente en la actitud a tomar y en el resultado del tratamiento. Los casos que se presentan, se trataron de forma quirúrgica y se encontraron lesiones nerviosas severas. Es difícil estandarizar el tratamiento, ya que existen distintas causas de lesión nerviosa y un rango amplio de gravedad. Tras analizar la mayoría de los casos publicados, la recomendación inicial es esperar la mejora espontánea de cuatro a seis meses. Si después de ese período, no hay mejoría de la sintomatología neurológica, está indicado realizar una exploración microquirúrgica del nervio.

First, the disorder must cohere as a clinical entity that is distinct from other disorders. Second, schizophrenia must be linked with an identifiable neuropathology. Third, implicated brain systems must have behavioral functions that fit the psychological characteristics actually seen in schizophrenia. In each case, the evidence is weak or equivocal. However, this does not mean that neurogenic interpretations are untenable. Instead, the primacy of problems associated with the first condition, the need to parse schizophrenia and reduce heterogeneity, must be recognized. Progress in understanding schizophrenia depends on a neurobehavioral approach to resolving the heterogeneity problem.",

      "abstract": "Migraine and restless legs syndrome are diseases that disturb the normal quality of human life. Moreover, comorbidity of these disorders determines even more difficult condition of the patients. Migraine is a headache that can cause severe throbbing pain, usually on one side of the head, and it is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine is one of the reasons that can cause unhealthy sleep, and if sleep is disturbed, this leads to the provocation of migraine attacks. Sleep disorders have various clinical manifestations, one of which is restless legs syndrome. It is a neurosensory impairment which is characterized by an unrelenting urge to move the legs that occurs or worsens at rest. For this reason, patients may complain of impaired sleep. Although the relationship between migraine and restless legs syndrome and their pathogenesis is not fully understood, current research suggests that these diseases may be related. People with restless legs syndrome are 1.23 to 2.65 times more likely to develop migraine attacks. It is believed that the occurrence of both diseases is determined by several pathophysiological factors, such as the activity of the dopamin- ergic system, iron deficiency, genetic predisposition, and changes in the gray matter of the brain. Although the association between restless legs syndrome and migraine is being investigated, the predominant pathophysiological link has not yet been established. Separate treatment of these diseases has been known for a long time. The principle of migraine treatment is to suppress pain and reduce the frequency of attacks. Treatment for restless legs syndrome is based on the relief of symptoms. Unfortunately, a common treatment for both diseases in relation to each other has not yet been approved. Because of the similar pathophysiology of these disorders, drugs that affect the dopaminergic system (e.g., pramipexole) are currently being investigated in order to relieve the symptoms of restless legs syndrome and migraine attacks.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

The cardinal neuropathological features of PD include selective and progressive loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra, deficiencies in dopaminergic signaling in the striatum, and occurrence of phosphorylated α-synuclein-identified Lewy bodies in the nervous system. Parkinsonism, the clinical presentation of movement disorders seen in PD, is a feature shared commonly by other pathologically distinct neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Consequently, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish PD from such parkinsonism-related neurological disorders. In addition, parkinsonism is not always a feature of certain neurodegenerative diseases, and it can sometimes develop as a result of various forms of drug intoxication or cerebrovascular disease. Here, we describe the clinicopathological features of three patients (cases 1, 2, and 3) diagnosed as having PSP, MSA, and PD, respectively, in each of whom the postmortem histopathological diagnosis differed from the final clinical diagnosis. Neuropathologically, they had suffered from coexistent disorders: PD, MSA, and argyrophilic grain disease (case 1); PD (case 2); and vascular parkinsonism (case 3). The variety of patients showing features of parkinsonism underlines the importance of careful long-term follow up followed by postmortem neuropathological evaluation.",

      "title": "Nonmotor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "The nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) of Parkinson's disease (PD) have received a lot of attention in the last few years. Despite this fact, they have still been underrecognized and undertreated [1, 2]. NMS may include cognitive problems, apathy, depression, anxiety, hallucinations, and psychosis as well as sleep disorders, fatigue, autonomic dysfunction, sensory problems, and pain [1]. Since these symptoms substantially contribute to patients' quality of life and are a frequent cause of hospitalization and institutionalization, the NMSs and their management have been recognized by the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence as an important unmet need in PD [3]. Besides dopamine and Lewy-type pathology involving both striatal and extrastriatal brain regions, deficits in other neurotransmitter systems and/or other types of brain pathologies seem to play a key role in the pathogenesis of NMS in PD [4–6].\r\n\r\nIt has been clearly shown that dopaminergic treatment improves motor symptoms and the quality of life in patients with PD. However, it only partly improves some features of the NMS, and it is not free from nonmotor side effects such as hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms, irritability, sleep attacks, and impulse control disorders. Furthermore, one study found that the patients who survived at 20 years from PD diagnosis suffered mainly from the nondopaminergic symptoms including falls, choking, dysarthria, but also dementia, visual hallucinations, daytime somnolence, symptomatic postural hypotension, and urinary incontinence [7]. Therefore, the management of these non-dopaminergic symptoms is a priority for research in the near future.\r\n\r\nIn addition to pharmacotherapy, high-frequency deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) is a powerful surgical treatment in well-selected candidates with advanced PD. STN DBS leads to improvements in dopaminergic drug-sensitive symptoms and reductions in subsequent drug dose and dyskinesias [8]. Although quality of life improves substantially, the procedure cannot be recommended for the treatment of NMS, and it may even cause specific cognitive side effects and may increase the risk for suicide. Skilled speech and physical therapy with cueing to improve gait, cognitive therapy to improve transfers, exercises to improve balance, and training to build up muscle power and increase joint mobility are efficacious. Regular physical and mental exercise is therefore recommended for all PD patients [9].\r\n\r\nAs outlined above, multidisciplinary approach including both pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment of PD is essential; however, the current delivery of allied healthcare services is inadequate, and many people who require such care are not being referred to the relevant specialist. Parkinson's Standards of Care Consensus Statement will soon be released by the European Parkinson's Disease Association and should be implemented in Europe in the near future.\r\n\r\nBesides symptomatic treatment, search for the disease-modifying, neuroprotective, and restorative treatment of PD is ongoing. Despite many so far unresolved issues, gene- and stem-cell-based therapies as well as immunotherapy targeting alpha-synuclein might become treatment options in the future. Development of these therapies is dependent on an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of PD and on the ability of very early diagnosis of premotor stages of PD. Therefore, a search for specific biomarkers (clinical, neuroimaging, biochemical, genetic) for early (premotor) diagnosis and for the disease progression is essential and large multicenter trials are underway.\r\n\r\nThis special issue is dedicated to nonmotor symptoms of PD and focuses on the above-mentioned “old-new” topics. We sincerely hope that it will provide readers with interesting new data as well as with comprehensive up-to-date reviews. We wish our readers pleasant and inspiring reading.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrena Rektorova\r\n\r\nDag Aarsland\r\n\r\nK. Ray Chaudhuri\r\n\r\nAntonio P. Strafella",

      "title": "Motor symptoms and phenotype in patients with Parkinson’s disease dementia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Traditionally Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been classified as a motor disorder, although non-motor symptoms are increasingly recognized prior to disease onset and throughout the disease course. The underlying disease pathogenesis between these motor and non-motor features share some commonality, with possible candidates including neurotransmitter dysfunction and abnormal amyloid metabolism, in addition to Lewy body burden. This chapter discusses the motor phenotype associated with dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD-D), which includes more axial disease, balance impairment, and greater fall frequency, in addition to sleep disorders and autonomic disturbance. As the milestone of PD-D is reached, deterioration in motor disease and diminished levodopa response is more likely to occur, and this is further explored. Lastly, motor phenotype, specifically the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) phenotype, is discussed in relation to future risk of cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Nach den Erkenntnissen der modernen neurophysiologischen Grundlagenforschung und neuroradiologischer Studien wird die Migräne (MI) als ein neurobiologisches resp. neurovaskuläres Syndrom definiert. Diese Sicht schließt eine ätiologisch-pathogenetische Beteiligung psychischer Befunde nicht prinzipiell aus, diesbezügliche Forsschungsaktivitäten sind umfangreich. Entsprechendes gilt für den Kopfschmerz vom Spannungstyp (SK). Die These von einer spezifischen MI-Persönlichkeit bzw. einem spezifischen Typus migraenicus hat sich nicht erhärten lassen. Wohl aber gibt es zahlreiche Beobachtungen einschließlich psychometrischer Testmethoden, die eine Komorbidität der MI und des SK mit Neurotizismus, depressiven Störungen und Angststörungen belegen. Manche Autoren postulieren eine kausale Beziehung. Diesbezügliche Thesen müssen aber relativiert werden. Neurotizismus, Depressivität, Angststörungen, ihrerseits eng miteinander verknüpft, lassen sich nur bei einem Teil der MI-Patienten nachweisen, abhängig vom Alter, von Dauer und Schwere der MI und wohl auch von der Region (Großstadt/Land), in der die Studien erstellt wurden. Es besteht keine Spezifität bezüglich MI und SK. Gleiche Befunde gibt es bei chronischen Schmerzsyndromen anderer Lokalisation (ohne Kopfschmerz). Depressive Störungen sind bei einer ganzen Reihe chronischer neurologischer Erkrankungen in beträchtlicher Größenordnung wie bei MI bekannt, und primäre depressive Störungen ihrerseits gehen häufig mit leiblichen Schmerzempfindungen, insbesondere auch mit Kopfschmerz, einher. Derzeit gibt es keine schlüssigen Hinweise auf eine ätiologisch-pathogenetische Verknüpfung der MI mit den genannten psychischen Merkmalen bzw. Störungen. Gleiches gilt für den SK, der ohnehin keine Entität darstellt, nur dass hier beim chronischen SK die Tendenz zu Neurotizismus und depressiven Störungen ausgeprägter zu sein scheint als bei der MI und dem episodischen SK.",

      "title": "Advances in MR Imaging of Leukodystrophies",
      "abstract": "Leukodystrophies are hereditary disorders of white matter that impair brain that is initially normally formed and developed (1, 2). They can affect brain myelin throughout life. The disorders are commonly progressive in nature and ultimately fatal. First manifestations are often cognitive deterioration and neuropsychological problems. Motor and balance difficulties occur, as do visual abnormalities. Classic leukodystrophies lead to a vegetative state or death within months to years. In general, the earlier the onset of symptoms, the more progressive the disease course. Most leukodystrophies are monogenetic disorders. The mutant gene often encodes an enzyme or protein that maintains neuronal and/or glial health and is responsible for regulation of brain metabolism. Many enzymes involved play a role in lipid metabolism. The inability to degrade or synthesize substrate leads to an upstream excess or downstream lack of vital lipids. This can cause a wide range of pathology, from inflammatory demyelination to axonal degeneration and microglial activation. Hence, the often cited prominent demyelination is only one manifestation in leukodystrophies, and myelinforming oligodendrocytes are not the only cells affected in these disorders. Yet, there are some common characteristics that distinguish the pathology in leukodystrophies from that of other disorders. MRI has played a seminal role in visualization of the lesion pattern. (3). The demyelinating lesions are usually confluent and symmetric. Many of the classic disorders, such as X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and Krabbe, show relative sparing of subcortical fibers. Yet again, other disorders have early involvement of the U fibers and other unique characteristics, such as cystic rarefaction and degeneration. Hereditary disorders that do not show demyelination but rather hypomyelination have come to increasing attention (4). Common neurological features in hypomyelinating disorders are developmental delay, nystagmus, cerebellar ataxia and spasticity. One of the better characterized hypomyelinating disorders is Pelizaeus Merzbacher disease (PMD). Beyond this classic disorder, a multitude of other hypomyelinating disorders exist. Only about half of the patients with evidence of hypomyelination on MRI come to a definitive diagnosis. Yet, specific clinical and MRI features can be pathognomonic and lead to diagnosis.",

      "title": "Benign childhood focal epilepsies",
      "abstract": "Summary The idiopathic focal epilepsies comprise a group of syndromes characterized by focal‐onset seizures for which there is no detectable structural brain abnormality and for which there is a proposed functional mechanism for the epilepsy and electroencephalography (EEG) abnormalities. This group includes benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE), benign epilepsy with occipital paroxysms (both early onset and late‐onset types), idiopathic photosensitive occipital lobe epilepsy, and some less well‐defined syndromes. The limits of the early onset idiopathic occipital epilepsy syndrome are not clear, and perhaps this entity represents part of a larger syndrome group of “autonomic” age‐related epilepsies. The term “idiopathic” implies absence of a structural brain lesion and a genetic propensity to seizures. The term “benign” implies that the epileptic seizures are easily treated or require no treatment, show remission without sequelae with ultimate and definitive remission before adulthood, do not have severe or exceedingly disturbing seizures, and have no associated serious intellectual or behavioral disturbances. It may be that a syndrome is benign only when it can be recognized early with reasonable certainty, thereby avoiding unnecessary investigations, overtreatment, and lifestyle restrictions. Although BRE has such characteristic clinical and EEG features to make early recognition possible, this is less constantly so in the other focal idiopathic epilepsy syndromes, where the term “benign” may be inappropriate. Mild and selective neuropsychological impairment may occur even in those with typical syndromes but it is unclear whether such selective deficits outlast the active phase of epilepsy. Sometimes the clinical course may be complicated by obvious cognitive and language impairments. In such cases, the term benign is obviously inappropriate, even when seizures are rare. In most patients with the typical focal idiopathic epilepsy syndromes, medication is not necessary.",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

This article addresses the diagnosis, pathophysiology, treatment, and course of bipolar disorder after a manic episode as well as mania as a manifestation of neurologic disease.Mania can be a primary psychiatric disorder but can also be a symptom of a neurologic disorder, especially right-sided cerebrovascular disease. Treatments (such as corticosteroids and dopaminergic agents) for neurologic illnesses regularly induce mania. The neurobiology of primary mania and bipolar disorder involves alterations in intracellular signaling, changes in gene expression, neural network interactions, and apoptosis. Except when induced by time-limited treatment with a provoking agent, mania tends to be highly recurrent and to alternate or be exhibited alongside depression. Symptoms of mania become more complex and treatment refractory with time, although effective treatment improves the long-term outcome.Behavioral manifestations of mania may be more obvious than affective symptoms, especially in patients with aprosodia. Atypical antipsychotic drugs are often first-line acute treatments, but the evidence supporting their long-term prophylactic efficacy is questionable. In addition to being an established mood stabilizer, lithium has putative neuroprotective properties, although a side effect can be impaired memory.",

The CNS manifestations are aseptic meningitis, cerebrovascular accidents (stroke), demyelinating disorders, headache, involuntary movements like chorea, myelopathy, acute confusional states, cognitive dysfunction, mood disorder, seizures, psychosis and cranial nerve palsies.1 The PNS manifestations are Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS), autonomic disorder, mononeuropathy, polyneuropathy and plexopathy.1 Neuropathy in SLE can be clinically classified as mononeuritis multiplex and symmetrical and asymmetrical polyneuropathy. Symmetrical polyneuropathy being the most commonly seen clinical entity amongst the neuropathies in SLE. The neuropathy can be slowly progressive or acute in onset. Electrophysiologically, neuropathy is classified as axonal neuropathy, small fibre neuropathy, demyelinating neuropathy, mixed axonal-demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy and plexopathy. Axonal neuropathy is further divided into sensory, sensorimotor and mononeuritis multiplex. Demyelinating neuropathy can be of two types: acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) and sensory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Anecdotal case reports also suggest that CIDP can occur as part of SLE neuropathy.2.",

      "title": "Exploring Myelin Dysfunction in Multiple System Atrophy",
      "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, yet fatal neurodegenerative disease that presents clinically with autonomic failure in combination with parkinsonism or cerebellar ataxia. MSA impacts on the autonomic nervous system affecting blood pressure, heart rate and bladder function, and the motor system affecting balance and muscle movement. The cause of MSA is unknown, no definitive risk factors have been identified, and there is no cure or effective treatment. The definitive pathology of MSA is the presence of α-synuclein aggregates in the brain and therefore MSA is classified as an α-synucleinopathy, together with Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Although the molecular mechanisms of misfolding, fibrillation and aggregation of α-synuclein partly overlap with other α-synucleinopathies, the pathological pathway of MSA is unique in that the principal site for α-synuclein deposition is in the oligodendrocytes rather than the neurons. The sequence of pathological events of MSA is now recognized as abnormal protein redistributions in oligodendrocytes first, followed by myelin dysfunction and then neurodegeneration. Oligodendrocytes are responsible for the production and maintenance of myelin, the specialized lipid membrane that encases the axons of all neurons in the brain. Myelin is composed of lipids and two prominent proteins, myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein. In vitro studies suggest that aberration in protein distribution and lipid transport may lead to myelin dysfunction in MSA. The purpose of this perspective is to bring together available evidence to explore the potential role of α-synuclein, myelin protein dysfunction, lipid dyshomeostasis and ABCA8 in MSA pathogenesis.",

      "title": "Attenuated variants of Lesch-Nyhan disease",
      "abstract": "Lesch–Nyhan disease is a neurogenetic disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. The classic form of the disease is described by a characteristic syndrome that includes overproduction of uric acid, severe generalized dystonia, cognitive disability and self-injurious behaviour. In addition to the classic disease, variant forms of the disease occur wherein some clinical features are absent or unusually mild. The current studies provide the results of a prospective and multi-centre international study focusing on neurological manifestations of the largest cohort of Lesch–Nyhan disease variants evaluated to date, with 46 patients from 3 to 65 years of age coming from 34 families. All had evidence for overproduction of uric acid. Motor abnormalities were evident in 42 (91%), ranging from subtle clumsiness to severely disabling generalized dystonia. Cognitive function was affected in 31 (67%) but it was never severe. Though none exhibited self-injurious behaviours, many exhibited behaviours that were maladaptive. Only three patients had no evidence of neurological dysfunction. Our results were compared with a comprehensive review of 78 prior reports describing a total of 127 Lesch–Nyhan disease variants. Together these results define the spectrum of clinical features associated with hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency. At one end of the spectrum are patients with classic Lesch–Nyhan disease and the full clinical phenotype. At the other end of the spectrum are patients with overproduction of uric acid but no apparent neurological or behavioural deficits. Inbetween are patients with varying degrees of motor, cognitive, or behavioural abnormalities. Recognition of this spectrum is valuable for understanding the pathogenesis and diagnosis of all forms of hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In these patients, cognitive, mood, and emotional disturbances are commonly observed, including depression, anxiety, mania, psychosis, and anger/aggression. The debilitating effect of TBI extends years after the initial injury and impairs the recovery process and patients' quality of life. Compared to other major neurological diseases such as stroke or degenerative diseases, TBI occurs relatively young. Therefore, patients have to endure the sequelae for a more extended period. Therefore, proper diagnosis and treatment of the cognitive–emotional symptoms are essential. Studies have been made to seek the pathogenesis of the cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Unfortunately, these emotional disturbances are not apparent and often unnoticed by busy clinicians. Their phenomenology, predicting factors, and pathophysiology have been underrecognized and understudied. In addition, well-designed clinical trials regarding these symptoms are rare. It has been suggested that the congitive and emotional sequelae are related to the \"remote\" effect of the initial brain injury rather than the initial pathology itself. This review will describe some of the most common or relevant poststroke mood and emotional disturbances. The phenomenology, factors or predictors, and relevant lesion locations will be described, and pharmacological treatment of these emotional disturbances will be discussed based on presumable pathophysiological mechanisms.",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

Despite its significance, the neurophysiology and neuropathology of this illness is incompletely understood. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques have helped to begin clarifying these areas. Specifically, bipolar disorder appears to arise from abnormalities within discrete brain networks (eg, the anterior limbic network). The expression of the symptoms of bipolar disorder does not appear to result from single, localized brain lesions, but rather are emergent properties of dysfunction of these brain networks. As neuroimaging techniques continue to improve, the underlying neural basis of bipolar disorder will be clarified.",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric manifestations in adult lupus patients are common but not always serious. They may occur early or late in the course of lupus, may be the presenting feature of lupus and can be a challenge to manage. The most common manifestations early in the disease are headache, mood disorders and anxiety, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, and acute confusional state. Other neuropsychiatric manifestations that may occur include movement disorders such as chorea, transverse myelitis, cranial nerve and peripheral neuropathies and myasthenia gravis. Neuropsychiatric features may be due to inflammatory mechanisms related to lupus, thrombosis usually due to antiphospholipid antibodies, atherosclerosis or co-morbid conditions, of which infection is the most important not to misdiagnose. Being aware of the risk factors and underlying mechanisms for different neuropsychiatric manifestations will ensure prompt and appropriate investigations and treatment. Investigations may include MRI and in selected cases other forms of imaging, CSF examination, neurophysiology and cognitive function testing. Therapy may include immunosuppressants, anticoagulation, antiplatelet agents and treatment specific to the clinical presentation. Most headaches in lupus patients are not due to lupus but the possibility of aseptic meningitis, benign intracranial hypertension, cerebral haemorrhage and venous thrombosis should be considered. Seizures may be part of the initial presentation of lupus and unless recurrent or associated with abnormalities on imaging do not require long term therapy with anticonvulsants. Cerebrovascular disease presenting as stroke is more common later in the disease, and is more often due to atherosclerosis, thrombosis or emboli than haemorrhage or vasculitis. Chorea is usually associated with anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. Transverse myelitis may be due to inflammatory or thrombotic mechanisms and is not always associated with abnormalities on MRI scan at the time of the acute event. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is essential to reduce the risk of permanent disability. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None Declared",

      "title": "Hypokinesia and Movement Challenges in Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by hypokinesia and motor dysfunction. The cardinal symptoms of PD are bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, and tremor. Associated deficits such as worsening handwriting (micrographia), shuffling gait, speech disturbance, dysphagia, and finger incoordination also occur frequently. In general, the combination of asymmetric presentation of symptoms and clinical improvement with levodopa treatment distinguishes PD from other movement disorders. PD is caused by dysfunctions in the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia consist of several important nuclei in the subcortical part of the brain and play a major role in initiation and control of normal voluntary movement. They do not regulate strength nor do they communicate with the spinal cord or peripheral limbs directly. They receive their primary input from the cerebral cortex and send the majority of their output, via the thalamus, back to the cortex. Neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, leading to a decrease in the level of dopamine in the striatum, is the pathophysiologic hallmark of PD. The loss of dopamine produces an imbalance of activities in the striatum and causes an increase in inhibitory signals to the thalamus. Because the thalamus is responsible for the activation of the cortical areas involved in generation of movements, the final outcome of dopamine deficiency is poverty or slowness of movements. Bradykinesia or slowness of movement can be observed in the loss of a patient’s automatic movements, such as decreased arm-swing while walking, eye-blinking, facial expression, or swallowing of saliva. Patients also complain of difficulty getting up from a chair, turning over in bed, or putting on a jacket or sweater. They feel restrained in their movements and every action becomes more effortful.

      "abstract": "Moyamoya disease is a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disorder caused by narrowed or blocked arteries supplying the brain. The name refers to the appearance of net-like collateral blood vessels that develop in response. Its incidence is significantly higher in East Asian countries and primarily affects children in the first decade of life, although it can also occur in older individuals. The disease may cause ischaemic or haemorrhagic strokes that are considered the two main types of moyamoya disease presentation, varying in prevalence in the population of children and adults. Other symptoms include headache, epilepsy, and transient ischaemic attack. Treatment remains mainly surgical, as no medication has yet been found to cure or slow down the progression of the disease. The pathogenesis remains unclear, although it is most likely multifactorial, including modifiable risk factors such as obesity, but also unmodifiable risk factors, like genetic predisposition. At the same time, moyamoya syndrome, also known as quasi-moyamoya disease, is a moyamoya-like vasculopathy associated with various systemic diseases or conditions, such as atherosclerosis or brain tumours. However, many studies do not distinguish moyamoya disease from moyamoya syndrome. Still, both conditions present with the same symptoms, and the management approach is generally the same.",

Organic psychoses refer to those psychoses attributed to identifiable brain diseases andare thereby distinguished from primary psychoses such as schizophrenia.

There are general symptoms and causes which include gradual slowness of moment, muscles get stiff and finally tremors. Apart from this severe symptoms there are so many other symptoms too, many of which are severe, and some may occur sometimes. It generally affects the different nervous systems and the types of neurons. However, substantial attention has been paid to neurons in brain areas linked to overt motor symptoms, which are part of a key cerebral network important for movement facilitation. Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra die slowly in Parkinson's disease,May start causing the nigra which tends to malfunction and creates a problem of typical moment types. Parkinson's disease is more common in those over the age of 50. It is a slowly progressing disease. The main aim of the paper is to prove that the neurodegenerative disorder can be solved using deep learning techniques such as neural networks and get a great accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Parkinson’ s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’ s disease. Patients with PD exhibit various non-motor symptoms, including constipation, hyposmia, and sleep disturbance, in addition to classical motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and rest tremor. The pathological hallmarks of PD are phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (p-syn) accumulation and dopaminergic neuronal loss in substantia nigra pars compacta. Patients are generally diagnosed with PD after the onset of motor symptoms, but the onset of non-motor symptoms often precedes that of motor symptoms. This prodromal phase of PD, which lasts for more than a decade, is a critical time window for disease modification to prevent or delay the onset of motor symptoms. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder in older adults and patients with PD. In patients with PD, chronic sleep fragmentation due to frequent nocturnal arousals is the most prevalent symptom of insomnia. While various PD-related etiologies induce chronic sleep fragmentation, recent epidemiological studies suggested that chronic sleep fragmentation itself may accelerate the clinical and pathological progression of PD. However, the precise causal relationship between progression of PD and chronic sleep fragmentation remains unknown. Aims &amp; Objectives We aimed to test whether chronic sleep fragmentation accelerates the disease course of PD using model mice. Method Transgenic mouse model of PD (Tg) that recapitulates age-dependent onset and progression of premotor non-motor symptoms, or wild type (WT) mice were housed in either of the following cages from the age when Tg mice do not exhibit non-motor symptoms: (1) sleep disturbance (SD) cage, a running- wheel-based device that induces chronic sleep fragmentation similar to PD patients (SD group), (2) wheel cage (WC), a control cage with a running wheel but with no sleep disruption (WC group), or (3) normal cage (NC), another control cage without running wheel (NC group). After 5 or 6 weeks, multiple non- motor symptoms were evaluated. After 7 weeks, brains were collected, and p-syn accumulation in the brains of Tg mice was evaluated. Results Among Tg mice, only the SD group showed non-motor symptoms. Among WT mice, the SD group showed no or minimal non-motor symptoms which were milder than that of Tg mice in the SD group. Among Tg mice, the SD group showed significantly increased p-syn accumulation in multiple brain regions. Discussion &amp; Conclusion These results suggest that chronic sleep fragmentation accelerates the onset of prodromal symptoms and p-syn accumulation in PD model mice. Our findings implicate that chronic sleep fragmentation would be a potential target for preventing or delaying the motor onset of PD.",

The eye is frequently affected by syndromic as well as nonsyndromic mitochondrial disorders. Primary and secondary ophthalmologic manifestations can be differentiated. The most frequent ophthalmologic manifestations of mitochondrial disorders include ptosis, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, optic atrophy, retinopathy, and cataract. More rarely occurring are nystagmus and abnormalities of the cornea, ciliary body, intraocular pressure, the choroidea, or the brain secondarily affecting the eyes. It is important to recognize and diagnose ophthalmologic manifestations of mitochondrial disorders as early as possible because most are accessible to symptomatic treatment with partial or complete short-term or long-term beneficial effect. Ophthalmologic manifestations of mitochondrial disorders need to be appropriately diagnosed to initiate the most effective management and guarantee optimal outcome.",

Esta revisión describe las características clínicas de la EP con énfasis en aquellas que diferencian la enfermedad de otros trastornos parkinsonianos. Debido a que no existe una prueba definitiva para el diagnóstico de la EP, la enfermedad debe diagnosticarse con base en criterios clínicos. El temblor en reposo, la bradicinesia, la rigidez y la pérdida de los reflejos posturales se consideran generalmente los signos cardinales de la EP. La presencia y la presentación específica de estas características se utilizan para diferenciar la EP de los trastornos parkinsonianos relacionados. Otras características clínicas incluyen síntomas motores secundarios (por ejemplo: Hipomimia, disartria, disfagia, sialorrea, micrografía, marcha arrastrando los pies, festinación, congelación, distonía, reflejos glabelares), síntomas no motores (por ejemplo: Disfunción autonómica, anomalías cognitivas / neuroconductuales, trastornos del sueño y anomalías sensoriales como anosmia, parestesias y dolor). La ausencia de temblor en reposo, la aparición temprana de dificultad para caminar, la inestabilidad postural, la demencia, las alucinaciones y la presencia de disautonomía, oftalmoparesia, ataxia y otras características atípicas, junto con una respuesta deficiente o nula a la levodopa, sugieren diagnósticos distintos de la EP. Un conocimiento profundo del amplio espectro de manifestaciones clínicas de la EP es fundamental para el diagnóstico adecuado de la enfermedad. Las mutaciones o variantes genéticas, las anomalías en la neuroimagen y otras pruebas son biomarcadores potenciales que pueden mejorar el diagnóstico y permitir la identificación de personas en riesgo.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are an integral feature of depressive disorders. Like the disorders themselves, the sleep disturbances associated with depression are heterogeneous, ranging from hypersomnia to marked difficulties maintaining sleep. These difficulties are to some extent age dependent and reflect abnormalities of central nervous system arousal. Moreover, the sleep disturbances associated with depression have both reversible, or state-dependent, and more persistent trait-like characteristics. Polysomnographic recordings can be used to document sleep maintenance difficulties, and they often also reveal reduced slow wave sleep, an early onset of the first episode of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and increased phasic REM sleep. A deficit of serotonergic neurotransmission, a relative increase in pontine cholinergic activity, and, perhaps, an excess of noradrenergic and corticotropin-releasing hormone activity have been implicated in the pathogenesis of the sleep disturbances of more severe depressive disorders. Antidepressant medications have class- and compound-specific effects on polysomnographic profiles. Unlike other antidepressants, bupropion may increase or intensify REM sleep. While no single effect of antidepressants on sleep neurophysiology is necessary or sufficient for treatment efficacy, differences in drug effects may provide important clues to selection of specific medications for particular patients.",

There are, however, some peculiarities that are typical of cardiac and skeletal muscle disorders. Skeletal muscle weakness presenting at any age may indicate a primary neuromuscular disorder (associated with creatine kinase elevation as in dystrophinopathies), a mitochondrial disease (particularly if encephalopathy, ocular myopathy, retinitis, neurosensorineural deafness, lactic acidosis are present), a storage disorder (progressive exercise intolerance, cognitive impairment and retinitis pigmentosa, as in Danon disease), or metabolic disorders (hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperammonaemia or other specific biochemical abnormalities). In such patients, skeletal muscle weakness usually precedes the cardiomyopathy and dominates the clinical picture. Nevertheless, skeletal involvement may be subtle, and the first clinical manifestation of a neuromuscular disorder may be the occurrence of heart failure, conduction disorders or ventricular arrhythmias due to cardiomyopathy. ECG and echocardiogram, and eventually, a more detailed cardiovascular evaluation may be required to identify early cardiac involvement. Paediatric and adult cardiologists should be proactive in screening for neuromuscular and related disorders to enable diagnosis in probands and evaluation of families with a focus on the identification of those at risk of cardiac arrhythmia and emboli who may require specific prophylactic treatments, for example, pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and anticoagulation.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Myoclonus is a motor symptom commonly associated with reflex seizures in people with idiopathic generalized epilepsies. The most frequently observed triggers of myoclonus are related to visual stimuli, including flashing lights or patterns; nonetheless, myoclonus can also be activated by movement, speech or reading, calculations, and praxis. Reflex myoclonic seizures may be the hallmark of a reflex epilepsy, but it may lead to the diagnosis of generalized epilepsy syndromes. In the setting of idiopathic generalized epilepsies, reflex myoclonus can persist despite optimal medical therapies and may be a marker for active, even medically intractable, epilepsy. In this article, the clinical significance, diagnosis, and treatment of myoclonus, associated with visual stimulation, movement, and praxis, will be reviewed.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

      "title": "News in treatment of Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinsonova bolest je idiopatski, sporo progredirajuci poremecaj sredisnjeg živcanog sustava koji obilježava sporost i siromastvo pokreta (bradikineza) udružena s jos barem jednim od slijedecih simptoma: povisen tonjus (rigor) misica, tremor u mirovanju i nestabilnost u održavanju položaja tijela. U pocetku simptomi su cesto asimetricni, a bolesnici vrlo dobro reagiraju na terapiju levodopom. Bolest zahvaca oko 1% pucanstva starijeg od 65 godina. Temelj bolesti je propadanje dopaminergicnih neurona u pars compacta substantiae nigre i posljedicna hipoaktivnost dopaminergicnog sustava. Nakon propadanja >50% dopaminergickih neurona u pars compacta substantiae nigre pojavljuju se prvi simptomi. Glavni biokemijski poremecaj Parkinsonove bolesti je hipoaktivnost dopaminergicnog sustava, odnosno smanjenje razine dopamina u nigrostrijatalnom sustavu. Cilj lijecenja Parkinsonove bolesti je postici kontinuiranu stimulaciju dopaminergicnih receptora nigrostrijatalnog sustava. Stoga se u lijecenju Parkinsonove bolesti pokusava: nadomjestiti dopamin primjenom prekursora dopamina – levodopa (dopamin ne prolazi kroz hematoencefalnu barijeru, za razliku od levodope koja je prolazi) s inhibitorima periferne dopa dekarboksilaze (karbidopa ili benzerazid) blokirati razgradnju dopamina – primjenom inhibitora enzima koju razgrađuju dopamin (monoamino oksidaza tipa B (MAO-B) - selegilin, katehol-O-metiltransferaza (COMT) - entakapon direktno stimulirati dopaminergicne receptore – bromokriptin, pramipeksol, ropinirol povecati aktirnost kolinerricnog sustava primjenom antikolinergika – biperidin primjenom amantadima inhibirati NMDA receptore? U terapiji Parkinsonove bolesti primjenjuju se: levodopa s inhibitorima periferne dopa dekarboksilaze: levodopa + karbidopa (Sinemet, Nakom) levodopa + benzerazid (Madopar) COMT inhibitor (Comtan) MAO-B inhibitor (Niar) dopaminergicki agonisti bromokriptin (Bromergon) pramipeksol (Mirapexin) ropinirol (Requip) amantadin (nije dostupan u Hrvatskoj) antikolinergicki lijekovi biperidin (Akineton) Levodopa, metabolicki prekursor dopamina koji prolazi hematoencefalnu barijeru, najucinkovitiji je lijek za Parkinsonovu bolest i l zlatni standardr terapije. Može imati i dijagnosticki znacaj: ako bolesnik ne reagira barem u pocetku bolesti na levodopu, tada vrlo vjerovatno ne boluje od Parkinsonove bolesti. Međutim, dugotrajnom primjenom levodope pojavljuju se komplikacije: diskinezije i fluktuacije u motorickom odgovoru. Postoje i indicije da dugotrajna primjena levodope može dovesti do oksidativnog stresa povecavanjem oksidacije glutationa, peroksidacijom lipida, povecanim stvaranjem hidroksilnih radikala i disfunkcijom respiratornog lanca u mitohondrijima. Za oksidativn stres se pretpostavlja da bi mogao dovoditi do progresije propadanja dopaminergicnih neurona sto bi moglo ubrzavati napredovanje Parkinsonove bolesti i biti odgovorno za komplikacije dugotrajne priomjene levodope. Stoga preparate levodope treba primjenjivati prema principu: low&slow, but go. U Hrvatskoj su dostupni preparati levodope s karbidopom i levodope s benzerazidom, u klasicnom obliku i u pripravcima sa sporim, postupnim, kontroliranim otpustanjem. Dopaminergicki (DA) agonisti se u zadnje vrijeme sve vise propisuju, kako u pocetnim, tako i u uznapredovalim fazama bolesti jer se pokazalo da bi mogli odgoditi pocetak primjene levodope, odgoditi i ublažiti diskineziju i motoricke fluktuacije koje su posljedica primjene levodope, a postoje indicije i o neuroprotektivnom ucinku DA agonista. U studiji CALMPD pokazano je da su bolesnici koji su uzimali pramipeksol imali manje znacajno smanjenje propadanja dopaminergicnih neurona mjereno SPECT-om u usporedbi s bolesnicima koji su uzimali levodopu. Također, u studiji REALPET pokazano je da su bolesnici koji su uzimali ropinirol imali znacajno manje smanjenje propadanja dopaminergicnih neurona mjereno PET-om u usporedbi s bolesnicima koji su uzimali levodopu. U Hrvatskoj je dostupan ergotski DA agonist bromokriptin, te selektivniji, ne-ergotski DA agonisti pramipeksol i ropinirol. DA agoniste je u pocetku terapije potrebno postupno titrirati. U Hrvatskoj je od nedavno dostupan periferni COMT inhibitor entakapon koji sprecava razgradnju levodope i na taj nacin povecava poluvrijeme eliminacije levodope cime dovodi do ublažavanja motorickih fluktuacija povezanih s dugotrajnom primjenom levodope. Primjenom entakapona mogu se umanjiti motoricke fluktuacije i diskineze uzrokovane dugotrajnom primjenom levodope. Selegilin, MAO-B inhibitor, blokira enzimatski put razgradnje dopamina i na taj nacin povecava raspoloživu kolicinu dopamina. Postoje i neke indicije o njegovom neuroprotektivnom djelovanju. Može se primjenjivati kao monoterapija u pocetku bolesti, ili kao dodatak terapiji levodopom. Amantadin je lijek koji nije dostupan u Hrvatskoj, a najcesce se propisuje u pocetnim fazama bolesti. Jos uvijek nije sasvim objasnjen mehanizam njegovog djelovanja, ali se pretpostavlja da djeluje inhibicijom NMDA receptora. Antikolinergici su prvi lijekovi koji su se primjenjivali u lijecenju Parkinsonove boelsti. U primjeni su ve vise do sto godina. Djelotvorni prvenstveno u smirivanju tremora bolesnika, no s obzirom na mnoge nuspojave, sve rjeđe se primjenjuju u terapiji. U Hrvatskoj je na raspolaganju biperidin. U terapiji Parkinsonove bolesti nužno je potreban individualni pristup, za svakog bolesnika ponaosob treba odrediti monoterapiju ili kombinaciju lijekova koji tom bolesniku u određenoj fazi bolesti najbolje djeluju. U pocetnoj fazi bolesti kod mlađih bolesnika terapija se obicno pocinje dopaminergickim agonistom, selegilinom ili amantadinom. U starijih bolesnika (>70 godina) vec u pocetku terapije uvodi se levodopa. S napredovanjem bolesti uvode se novi lijekovi tako da se vecina bolesnika najcesce lijeci kombinacijom navedenih lijekovima.",

      "abstract": "Psychotic depression is a unique subtype of depressive illness in which mood disturbance is accompanied by delusions, ballucinations, or both. Once considered relatively uncommon, it is frequently encountered in clinical practice, particularly in treatment-resistant depressed patients. Psychotically depressed patients respond poorly to antidepressants, but remission is likely with neuroleptic-antidepressant combinations or electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotic depression may be unipolar or bipolar with early or late onset and may be more likely to occur in patients with a history of childhood psychic trauma. Much is known about the course and treatment response of obvious presentations of psychotic depression, but more must be learned about depressed patients who have intermittent, subtle, or mild psychotic symptoms and about the ways in which the capacity to become psychotic interacts with the capacity to become depressed to produce a syndrome greater than the sum of its parts.",

      "abstract": "The Lewy body disorders are a group of neurodegenerative disorders that share the common pathology of fibrillar aggregates of α -synuclein protein in selective populations of neurons and glia. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 5th Edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association 2013) presents current criteria for major or mild neurocognitive disorder with Lewy bodies and their applications in clinical practice. In this chapter, these conditions will be collectively referred to as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) when the cognitive-behavioral symptoms are the initial presentation and as Parkinson's disease (PD) or Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD) if the movement disorder is the initial presentation and substantially precedes cognitive-behavioral symptoms. The underlying pathological lesion in these disorders is the intracellular aggregation of α -synuclein. Aggregates of α -synuclein are present in neurons as neocortical Lewy bodies and dystrophic Lewy neurons in DLB, PD, and PDD, or as cytoplasmic inclusions in oligodendrocytes in less common Lewy body disorders such as multiple system atrophy. However, α -synuclein pathology can be present in many other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down syndrome (Table 21–1 ). The Lewy body disorders are broadly characterized by variable degrees of progressive decline in cognitive, motor, behavioral, and autonomic function. Disorders with synuclein pathology Synuclein pathology commonly found Synuclein pathology may be found Dementia with Lewy bodies Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Parkinson's disease (with and without dementia) Pick's disease Alzheimer's disease (particularly autosomal dominant forms) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Traumatic brain injury Down syndrome Multiple system atrophy Pure autonomic failure Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation Note.

The data of the Groningen Perinatal Project, a long-term follow-up project on the relations between prenatal and perinatal adversities and neurological, behavioral, and cognitive development revealed that two basic forms of MND can be distinguished: simple and complex MND. During school age children with simple MND are characterized by the presence of one or two dysfunctional clusters of MND, in adolescence by the presence of choreiform dyskinesia or hypotonia. Probably the major sources of origin of simple MND are genetic constitution and stress during early life. Simple MND might reflect the lower tail of the normal distribution of the quality of non-pathological brain function. In line with this hypothesis is the finding that simple MND is associatedwith only a moderately increased risk for learning- and behavioral problems. Children with complex MND present at school age with at least three dysfunctional clusters of MND, in adolescence with problems in fine manipulation or coordination. Perinatal adversities play an evident etiological role in the development of complex MND, suggesting that it might be attributed to a lesion of the brain at early age. In line with this idea is the finding that complex MND shows a strong correlation with attention and learning problems.",

      "title": "The neuropathology of primary mood disorder",
      "abstract": "The biological mechanisms proposed to underlie primary mood disorder do not usually include a neuropathological component. However, a significant MRI literature attests to structural abnormalities in regions and has encouraged neuropathological investigations from which candidate histological correlates have begun to emerge. In particular, there are several reports of cytoarchitectural alterations in anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices, characterized by a decrease in the number or density of glia. Reductions in the size and density of some neuronal populations have also been described, accompanied by alterations in indices of synaptic terminals and dendrites. This form of pathology putatively reflects aberrant neurodevelopment or impaired cellular plasticity. A separate pathological process is suggested by the excess of subcortical focal lesions seen on MRI, especially in elderly patients; these probably reflect white matter damage of vascular origin. Both types of pathology have been observed, to a greater or lesser extent, in unipolar as well as bipolar mood disorders. None of the findings appear attributable to treatment with antidepressants, mood stabilizers or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). However, all findings remain preliminary due to a lack of unequivocal replication and the failure to control fully for other potential confounders and co-morbid conditions. There are also basic questions to be answered concerning the clinical correlates, magnitude, progression and heterogeneity of the pathology. Nevertheless, it must now be considered likely that changes in brain structure, both macroscopic and microscopic, are a feature of primary mood disorder, a fact to be taken into account when interpreting functional imaging, neuropsychological and neurochemical data. The neuropathology is postulated to contribute to the pathophysiology and dysfunction of the neural circuits which regulate mood and its associated cognitions, behaviours and somatic symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

Autonomic neuropathy can accompany the painful peripheral neuropathy but can be difficult to recognize since the symptoms can be protean. In this chapter, clinical characteristics of small-fiber and autonomic neuropathy are discussed. Various diagnostic modalities are described, including the benefits and pitfalls of available options. The most common conditions causing small-fiber and autonomic neuropathy are reviewed. The controversy surrounding impaired glucose tolerance as an etiological factor is dicusssed.

Limited by methodological issues such as recall bias and confounding risk factors, epidemiological studies on the association between TBI and idiopathic PD have so far yielded mixed results. While clinical reports describe parkinsonism - often with lesions in the substantia nigra - secondary to traumatic brain injury, these do not represent cases of idiopathic PD. In laboratory studies, animal models of traumatic brain injury demonstrate neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, altered dopaminergic metabolism, or altered synuclein pathology. While parkinsonism does occur secondary to TBI, the relationship between TBI and subsequent idiopathic PD remains controversial.",

      "title": "Functional cognitive disorder: dementia’s blind spot",
      "abstract": "Abstract An increasing proportion of cognitive difficulties are recognized to have a functional cause, the chief clinical indicator of which is internal inconsistency. When these symptoms are impairing or distressing, and not better explained by other disorders, this can be conceptualized as a cognitive variant of functional neurological disorder, termed functional cognitive disorder (FCD). FCD is likely very common in clinical practice but may be under-diagnosed. Clinicians in many settings make liberal use of the descriptive term mild cognitive impairment (MCI) for those with cognitive difficulties not impairing enough to qualify as dementia. However, MCI is an aetiology-neutral description, which therefore includes patients with a wide range of underlying causes. Consequently, a proportion of MCI cases are due to non-neurodegenerative processes, including FCD. Indeed, significant numbers of patients diagnosed with MCI do not ‘convert’ to dementia. The lack of diagnostic specificity for MCI ‘non-progressors’ is a weakness inherent in framing MCI primarily within a deterministic neurodegenerative pathway. It is recognized that depression, anxiety and behavioural changes can represent a prodrome to neurodegeneration; empirical data are required to explore whether the same might hold for subsets of individuals with FCD. Clinicians and researchers can improve study efficacy and patient outcomes by viewing MCI as a descriptive term with a wide differential diagnosis, including potentially reversible components such as FCD. We present a preliminary definition of functional neurological disorder–cognitive subtype, explain its position in relation to other cognitive diagnoses and emerging biomarkers, highlight clinical features that can lead to positive diagnosis (as opposed to a diagnosis of exclusion), and red flags that should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses. In the research setting, positive identifiers of FCD will enhance our recognition of individuals who are not in a neurodegenerative prodrome, while greater use of this diagnosis in clinical practice will facilitate personalized interventions.",

Plexopathies occur less frequently than the peripheral nerve disorders affecting the nerve roots or distal nerves, either as focal or generalized peripheral neuropathies. Brachial plexopathies are more common than the other plexopathies, in part due to the greater vulnerability to trauma and the close proximity to other organs with the neck and upper thorax. Entrapment neuropathies may be triggered by underlying systemic disease or hormonal changes. Focal peripheral neuropathies due to entrapment occur frequently.

      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

At one end of the scale there are the hypochondriacal patients, with their increased awareness and over-emphasis of discomfort and deficiency; at the other end there are those who make light of, or even ignore, their disabilities. The psychiatrist is often faced with the task of modifying such abnormal attitudes. This aim can, in many cases, be achieved by psychotherapy, while in others physical treatment such as shock therapy or prefrontal leucotomy may prove successful. Both the abnormal attitudes towards illness and the success of treatment are as yet little understood.

      "abstract": "Parkinsonian dementia syndromes entail a combination of motor and cognitive symptoms and a variety of underlying etiologies. Lewy body dementias are most common, encompassing Parkinson disease (PD) with dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, which share the common pathologic substrate of intracellular neuronal inclusion bodies that contain α-synuclein. Multiple system atrophies (MSAs), which are now divided into parkinsonian and cerebellar subtypes, are related disorders with core features that include autonomic and parkinsonian motor signs and α-synuclein-containing glial intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration are parkinsonian dementias that superficially resemble PD and MSA in terms of motor features, but are distinguished pathologically by neurofibrillary tau protein abnormalities. Some other causes of dementia associated with parkinsonism include drug-induced parkinsonism, vascular parkinsonism, normal pressure hydrocephalus, prion diseases including Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (see the chapter \"Rapidly Progressing Dementias\"), Alzheimer disease with extrapyramidal signs (see the chapter \"Alzheimer Disease Update\"), and metabolic derangements that have a predilection for basal ganglia structures. This review will discuss clinical presentations, differential diagnoses, laboratory and neuroimaging characteristics, and therapeutic strategies for the synucleinopathies and several parkinsonian dementia syndromes.",

These symptoms include executive dysfunction and disorders of thought, such as hallucinations and psychosis. Such symptoms may go on to predict dementia related to PD, which involves amnestic dysfunction and is typically seen later in the disease. Cognitive symptoms are associated with dysfunction in cholinergic circuits, in addition to the abnormalities in the prefrontal dopaminergic system.

DEVELOPMENT The term 'paroxysmal' refers to the abrupt onset of clinical manifestations in a relatively stereotyped manner, usually upon exposure to specific triggering factors with an almost complete resolution of such findings between attacks. They are commonly not associated to either a relentless progression or a stepwise deterioration, and the majority of them do not lead to the development of gross neuropathological abnormalities. Although they are difficult to classify due to the heterogeneity of their clinical manifestations and underlying deficits, a neuroaxis-based approach is proposed for practical purposes, for example, from those conditions affecting predominantly cortical grey matter (manifesting mainly with seizures) to those with an almost exclusive muscular and/or neuromuscular pattern of involvement. The majority of them are caused by genetic defects in either transporters or neuronal channels, which can be either ions or neurotransmitters. In recent years, the concept of 'channelopathies' has grown in acceptance in the medical field, although not all of the described disorders are caused by defects in molecular channels. CONCLUSIONS Despite their individual rarity, as a group, they are important to the neurologist due to the advances that their understanding have provided for the development of the field of neurogenetics and neurosciences in general.",

The diagnosis of NMS commonly requires core symptoms of hyperthermia and muscle rigidity. Although diagnostic criteria for NMS have been established and are widely accepted and used, it should be recognized that atypical presentations pose a diagnostic dilemma, as hyperthermia and/or muscle rigidity may be absent or develop slowly over several days, leading to impairment or a significant delay in diagnosis and treatment. Evidence from case reports and retrospective evaluations supports a concept of atypical NMS, particularly with regard to treatment with atypical antipsychotics. However, it remains unclear whether these atypical presentations represent early or impending NMS. Furthermore, it is unclear whether dysfunction in other neurotransmitter systems, in addition to dopamine, may be involved in the pathogenesis of NMS induced by atypical antipsychotics. In patients receiving any antipsychotic, clinicians should carefully evaluate any features of NMS and should not prematurely exclude a diagnosis of NMS in cases where severe rigidity or hyperthermia is not initially apparent.",

      "title": "Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease: What We Know Now",
      "abstract": "Small delays in onset of Alzheimer's Disease are predicted to reduce its global burden, but we need to better understand factors that increase the risk-and methods to reduce it. The clinical syndrome of dementia refers to a pattern of cognitive deficits characterized by impairment in memory and at least one other cognitive domain (e.g., language, executive functions, visuospatial abilities) that is sufficiently severe to impact behavior and interfere with social or occupational functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Dementia may be progressive, static, or remitting, and its onset and course of symptoms are a function of underlying neuropathology from various causes. For example, dementia because of a neurodegenerative process tends to involve an insidious onset with gradual progressive cognitive impairment. In contrast, dementia from vascular or acquired brain injury tends to involve an abrupt onset of clinical symptoms that may remain static or show stepwise cognitive decline that corresponds to episodes of cerebrovascular accidents. The most common causes of dementia are neuropathologically distinguished on the basis of the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease); multiple or strategically placed infarctions, ischemic injury, or hemorrhagic lesions (e.g., vascular dementia); cell loss and the deposition of Lewy bodies in sub-cortical, limbic, and neocortical regions (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies); and prominent frontal and temporal lobar atrophy (frontotemporal dementia). Dementia can also be found in the context of other neurological, infectious, or metabolic conditions, such as Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, human immunodeficiency virus, or traumatic brain injury. Despite recent advances in amyloid imaging and cerebral spinal fluid analysis, neuropathological changes are often only accurately assessed at autopsy. This makes definitive diagnosis during an individual's lifetime difficult. Effectively differentiating between forms of dementia or normal aging requires reliance on the neuropsychological definition of a specific pattern of cognitive deficits. Epidemiology and Neurobiology of Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's Disease is the leading cause of dementia in elders and accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of all dementia cases. An estimated 5.3 million Americans have Alzheimer's Disease. Reports indicate the disease is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and deaths because of Alzheimer's Disease are on the rise, with an increase of 46 percent between 2000 and 2006. Given the advancing age of the baby boom generation, by 2050, 14 million older Americans and 81 million adults worldwide are expected to have the disease (Alzheimer's Association, 2010a). Alzheimer's Disease is an age-related degenerative brain disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of extracellular fibrillar amyloid deposits and intra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. These characteristics lead to neuronal atrophy and synapse loss in medial temporal lobe limbic structures that are critical for episodic memory and extend to the association cortices of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes with disease progression (Braak and Braak, 1991). Consistent with these widespread neuropathological changes, the primary clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive global dementia syndrome that usually begins in later life. It is generally agreed that the pathological cascade of brain changes occurs gradually in Alzheimer's Disease, beginning with the very early accrual of Aβ plaques in the brain, and is followed by a variable lag time after which neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the leading pathological process (Jack et al., 2010). Although Aβ neuropathology is thought to be causal, clinical symptoms are more closely related to neurofibrillary tangles than amyloid deposition. …",

Diabetic, alcoholic, uremic, and drug-induced polyneuropathies take the leading place among these diseases. The main forms of diabetic polyneuropathy are presented. The main clinical form is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy. Clinical symptoms depend on the type of fibers involved in the pathological process - thin or thick. There is an assessment scale in points to determine the severity of diabetic polyneuropathy, which helps in clarifying the diagnosis and prognosis of the disease. The next most frequent among metabolic polyneuropathies is uremic polyneuropathy as the most frequent complication in patients suffering from chronic renal insufficiency. Risk factors of uremic polyneuropathy development, clinical picture, the course of the disease are described. Within the framework of toxic polyneuropathies, the main place is given to alcoholic polyneuropathies, chemotherapy-induced, and drug-induced. For each of these categories, clinical forms and pathophysiology of development are described. For all polyneuropathies, the main diagnostic aspects are presented.

      "title": "Invited Article: Nervous system pathology in sporadic Parkinson disease",
      "abstract": "Sporadic Parkinson disease (PD) is, after Alzheimer disease (AD), the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder.1 The pathologic process in PD is progressive and takes years to reach its full extent. It does not affect nonhuman vertebrates or organ systems other than the nervous system, and, apparently, it does not go into remission. Unlike AD, however, the pathology is distributed throughout the entire nervous system—that is, not only the central but also the peripheral and the enteric nervous systems (CNS, PNS, ENS). As a result, PD has come to be acknowledged as more than a monosystemic disorder with preferential obliteration of nigral dopaminergic neurons.2–8,e1-e3\n\nIn the clinically recognizable, i.e., motor, phase of sporadic PD, most patients display signs of motor dysfunction (hypo- or bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, postural instability, resting tremor),9,e4,e5 but these symptoms also occur in other disorders associated with dopamine loss in the nigrostriatal system.e6,e7 Familial forms of parkinsonism exist,3,e8,e9 and the syndrome may also develop as a sequel to intoxication, trauma, vascular alterations, metabolic disease, or infection.e3,e10-e14 In addition, parkinsonism can develop in tauopathies, including corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy,e15-e17 or in synucleinopathies, such as multiple system atrophy and Lewy body disease.10,11,e18-e20 Lewy body disease has been subdivided further into pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and sporadic PD.11,12 The latter two entities are nearly indistinguishable at neuropathologic examination, and there is a growing consensus that, clinically, they are closely related, if not identical.13–17 Here, we refer only to the Lewy body pathology associated with the synucleinopathy sporadic (or idiopathic) PD, the most widespread form of parkinsonism.1,8,e25\n\nIn PD, typical α-synuclein immunoreactive inclusions (Lewy neurites [LNs], Lewy bodies [LBs]) develop within specific types of projection neurons in all portions of the …",

Besides, recent studies have found a variety of non-motor symptoms, including neuropsychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, abnormal sensory and autonomic dysfunctions, etc. PD with pure apathy, referring to apathy without dementia and depression, is correlated with motor symptoms and other non-motor symptoms, and greatly reduces the activity of daily living and the quality of life for PD patients. The pathogenesis of PD with pure apathy involves the mechanisms of neuroanatomy, neuropathology, neurological biochemistry and neuroinflammation. This paper will introduce the clinical features and pathogenic mechanisms of PD with pure apathy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Autonomic dysfunction may result from diseases that affect primarily either the central nervous system or the peripheral autonomic nervous system. The most common pathogenesis of disturbed autonomic function in central nervous system diseases is degeneration of the intermediolateral cell columns (progressive autonomic failure) or disease or damage to descending pathways that synapse on the intermediolateral column cells (spinal cord lesions, cerebrovascular disease, brainstem tumors, multiple sclerosis). The peripheral autonomic nervous system may be damaged in isolation in the acute and subacute autonomic neuropathies or in association with a generalized peripheral neuropathy. The peripheral neuropathies most likely to cause severe autonomic disturbance are those in which small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers are damaged in the baroreflex afferents, the vagal efferents to the heart, and the sympathetic efferent pathways to the mesenteric vascular bed. Acute demyelination of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in the Guillain‐Barré syndrome may also cause acute autonomic dysfunction. Although autonomic disturbances may occur in other types of peripheral neuropathy, they are rarely clinically important.",

They discuss aetiopathologic hypotheses which have been proposed to interpret pathological situations of this type. It seems reasonable to attribute an autonomous disease classification to idiopathic orthostatic hypotension as a systemic degenerative disease concerning peripheral and central structures with vegetative functions. The Shy-Drager syndrome (idiopathic orthostatic hypotension associated with diverse signs of involvement of the central nervous system) must not, however, be considered as an independent form of disease. The associated signs are none other than the expression of commonly found cerebral ischemic lesions deriving from abrupt arterial hypotension, or from cerebral dysautoregulation; or the expression of the association of a systemic degenerative disease with another, a not infrequent occurrence well known in the pathology of the nervous system.",

Visual acuity of affected eye may be minimally or severely affected, depending on the extent of lesion. All of these conditions can be unilateral or bilateral. Children who have unilateral optic disc abnormalities generally present during the preschool years with sensory esotropia. Visual acuity may be unaffected like in optic disc pit, optic disc drusen, fibre medullares, ect. However, during the evolution they may cause a decrease in visual acuity like serous retinal detachment in optic disc pit, atrophy or subretinal neovascularisation in optic disc drusen. Some of them like fibre medullares needs only a good diagnose and they do not have any evolution. Fluorescein angiography and ultrasonography may be crucial diagnostic procedures to discover some of them, like optic disc drusen. Optic disc abnormalities may be associated with other congenital disorders of the eye and often central nervous system malformations. Secondary they may be associated retinal detachment, retinochisis, macular edema, choroid neovascularisation and lipid exudation. Some of these conditions may be found on routine ophthalmologic exam such as optic disc drusen and fibre medullares and often are diagnostically problem. The aim of our study was to present some of our cases with different optic disc abnormalities such as fibre medullares, optic disc coloboma, hypoplasio disc, optic disc drusen and optic disc pit.",

Complex partial seizures frequently present as altered or 'automatic' behaviour. The patient may pluck at his or her clothes, fiddle with objects and act in a confused manner.

      "title": "Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (FTNCD) represents a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that compromise function of frontal brain networks, resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits (see Box 65- ). More often referred to as frontotemporal dementia in the medical literature, FTNCD is a common cause of dementia among patients ages 45–65 years and comprises two sometimes overlapping clinical syndromes: behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD) (Table 3- ). The latter syndrome includes two subtypes: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression. Either (1) or (2): Behavioral variant: Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: Behavioral disinhibition. Apathy or inertia. Loss of sympathy or empathy. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior. Hyperorality and dietary changes. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities. Language variant: Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production, word finding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if either of the following is present; otherwise, possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder should be diagnosed: Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation, from either family history or genetic testing. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuroimaging. Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) For mild neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.83 (G31.84). ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) FTNCD involves a variety of largely nonoverlapping neuropathological patterns that are distinct from those observed among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathological subtypes include diseases that are characterized by aggregation of one of three proteins in affected frontal or temporal areas of the cerebral cortex: tau, transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), and fused-in-sarcoma (FUS). Other less common pathologies have been described. Clinical symptomatology may provide clues about the underlying FTLD subtype, but there are no strict associations between Bv-FTNCD or Lv-FTNCD and a particular histopathology. Clinical features of behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD), including progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD) Subtype Symptoms Cognitive profile Neuroimaging Motor findings Neuropathology Bv-FTNCD Behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, repetitive or stereotyped motor behaviors, and hyperorality Deficits in attention, working memory, set shifting, mental flexibility, response inhibition, and abstract reasoning, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Right hemispheric frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy, particularly involving the orbitofrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices Motor neuron disease in 10%–15%; Parkinsonian findings or supranuclear gaze disturbance in others FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS, and others Lv-FTNCD (PNFA) Slow, effortful, and telegraphic speech; dysarthria; agrammatisms; and occasional asymmetric right foot and hand motor impairment Agrammatical speech, decreased phonemic fluency, and apraxia of speech, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Left frontoinsular and perisylvian atrophy Asymmetric Parkinsonian signs, apraxia, focal dystonia, myoclonus, alien limb phenomenon, supranuclear gaze disturbance, axial rigidity, and postural instability FTLD-tau in most cases Lv-FTNCD (SD) Decreased object naming and single word comprehension Impaired naming, surface dyslexia, and prosopagnosia, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Asymmetric anterior and lateral temporal atrophy, usually left more than right Less common than in other FTNCD subtypes FTLD-TDP in most cases Note. FTLD = frontotemporal lobar degeneration; FUS = fused-in-sarcoma; TDP = transactive response DNA-binding protein. There are two general approaches to treatment of FTNCD: disease modification and symptomatic management. Disease-modifying therapies target pathogenic molecules and thereby alter, slow, or arrest the disease process.

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevailing progressive disorder leading to neurodegeneration, typically in people above 65 years of age. Motor clinical manifestations of PD appear in a much later stage and include rigidity, tremors, akinesia, and gait dysfunction. There are also nonmotor symptoms like GI and olfactory dysfunction. However, they cannot be considered for diagnosis of the disease, as they are unspecific. PD pathogenesis is mainly characterized by deposits of inclusion bodies on dopaminergic (DA) neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta region (SNpc) of the brain. The major component of these inclusion bodies, are α-synuclein aggregates. α-Synuclein undergoes misfolding and oligomerization to form aggregates and fibrils. These aggregates gradually propagate PD pathology. Other prominent features of this pathological development include mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired autophagy. These all contribute to neuronal degeneration. Besides this, there are many underlying factors which influence these processes. These factors comprise molecular proteins and signaling cascades. In this review, we have listed out underexplored molecular targets that may aid in development of neoteric and advanced therapeutics.",

Risk factors associated with chronic post-traumatic encephalopathy include: exposure to contact sports, the presence of apolipoprotein E4, and advanced age. Histopathological, although it shares certain characteristics with Alzheimer's disease, it has a more specific presentation (deposition of phosphorylated tau protein in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, associated with an accumulation of neuropil elements, sometimes accompanied by beta-amyloid plaques). Clinically, it is characterized by a slow course that begins with mild cognitive and emotional symptoms, and progresses towards the appearance of parkinsonian symptoms and dementia. Although there are promising diagnostic elements, they are not currently a reality, and the key to managing this disease is prevention and early detection of its first symptoms.",

The Sylvian aqueduct syndrome is characteristic of involvement in the upper midbrain-pretectal region, usually a pinealoma. Cerebellar lesions may be manifested by gaze paresis, skew deviation, disturbances of saccadic or smooth pursuit movements, ocular myoclonus, or several characteristic forms of nystagmus.

Neuro-ophthalmology is a complex field, and although there are several syndromes recognized in veterinary medicine, their diagnosis and understanding can be difficult and incomplete. Horner's syndrome is best understood and most frequently diagnosed in the dog. However, Horner's syndrome occurs in all of the most common domestic species and can indicate significant neurological disease. The clinical signs of Horner's syndrome in horses include miosis, ptosis, enophthalmia, and protrusion of the nictitating membrane. Facial nerve paralysis is one of the more frequent neuro-ophthalmic disorders in the dog. Hemifacial spasms result in a narrowed palpebral fissure and an asymmetrical face secondary to the facial muscles' contractions. In neurotropic keratitis, the trigeminal (or its ophthalmic branch) nerve functions are impaired or absent, and the cornea and conjunctiva lose their sensation.",

The diagnosis of neuropathies is based on following criteria: nerve conduction velocity studies; neurological examination; quantitative motor, sensory and autonomic function tests; neuropathic symptoms. Autonomic functions should be evaluated by standard cardiovascular reflex tests.

Enlargement of CDR is a classical sign of glaucoma, but it can also result from non-glaucomatous optic neuropathies such as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).

The development of the kidney, the major excretory organ after birth, consists of 3 stages: the pronephros, or cervical kidney; mesonephros, or thoracic kidney; and metanephros, or abdominal kidney, the definitive kidney. In humans, nephrogenesis and organogenesis occur from the 6th to the 36th weeks of gestational age. After 36 weeks, nephrogenesis is complete and each kidney has a full complement of nephrons. The extent of chemical-induced renal toxicity is related, in part, to the efficiency in which the particular compound is transported by renal tubules. Because renal tubular transport capacities vary with maturation, the degree of nephrotoxicity may also vary with maturation. The signs and symptoms of nephrotoxicity can appear acutely or insidiously. Unexplained acute renal failure, chronic mild proteinuria, or even hypertension can be a manifestation of nephrotoxic agents. Species differences occur, thus the need for studies in humans.",

Mild traumatic brain injury in general and concussion in athletes in particular, offer a unique testing ground for hypotheses related to the interaction of psychological and biological variables. Most practicing clinical neuropsychologists recognize that the majority of individuals with concussion or mild traumatic brain injury recover quickly with minimal or conservative interventions. Athletes experiencing concussion often voice uncertainty regarding their health and their career. The very nature of concussion symptoms can be quite alarming and raise anxiety about threats to life or, at least, the quality of life. Symptoms comprising the post concussion syndrome are generally grouped into those of a physical, cognitive or psychological nature. The prevalence of persisting symptomatology in these three conditions is remarkably similar.",

We present the case of a 17-year-old female requiring psychiatric hospitalization for obsessive-compulsive disorder and major depressive disorder with mixed affective features, who was subsequently diagnosed with primary Sjogren's syndrome. Treatment with potent immunosuppression resulted in remission of psychiatric illness. Due to a lack of awareness and/or the lack of specific biomarkers, clinicians may not associate psychiatric symptoms with autoimmune disease, including primary Sjogren's syndrome. This case demonstrates that Sjogren's syndrome may be a causative or aggravating factor in mental disorders and that autoimmune diseases should be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis of psychiatric illness especially in cases of concurrent physical symptomatology and severity or treatment resistance of psychiatric disease.",

      "title": "Relationship between Sleep Quality and Cognitive Function in Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in middle-aged and elderly people. PD is characterized by resting tremor, myotonia, bradykinesia, abnormal posture, and gait. The incident of PD increases with age. In addition to motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms have raised additional concerns in recent years. Cognitive impairment is very common in PD patients. It is estimated that the incidence of PD mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is 20–50%,[1] which is present at the initial visit in some patients and a great number of patients with PD-MCI eventually develop PD with dementia (PDD). PD patients are much more likely to develop dementia than the normal population. It has been found that 2/3 of PD patients suffer from different forms of sleep disorders, which are indicated to be one of the common nonmotor symptoms in PD patients. The symptoms of various sleep disorders in PD patients include night insomnia, increased sleepiness, sleep fragmentation, reduced sleep efficiency, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, thus having a serious impact on the patient's sleep quality and increasing the risk of dementia.[2] Therefore, cognitive dysfunction and sleep disorders are two important nonmotor symptoms of PD, exerting greater impacts on the quality of life (QOL). Here, we evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and cognitive function of PD patients. From May 2016 to May 2017, we enrolled a total of 111 native Chinese patients with primary PD and without audiovisual dysfunction who were admitted to the Department of Neurology, the First Hospital of Hebei Medical University. The diagnosis of PD was based on the criteria of the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank. Moreover, the diagnosis of PDD conformed to the diagnostic criteria of dementia proposed by the Movement Disorder Society Task Force: (1) diagnosis of primary PD, (2) PD-related cognitive decline by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), (3) cognitive impairment that affected the patient's daily life ability, and (4) development of extrapyramidal system of PD before dementia, with regular time interval. Patient information was collected by two trained neurologists, including name, sex, age, duration of illness, and educational level. Of these, duration of disease was calculated from the time the patient initially complained of discomfort. The assessment was performed since medications were initiated. The Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) was used to assess the severity of the disease, and Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) staging was utilized for disease rating. According to the severity, the patients were divided into stage 1.0–5.0, including mild (1.0–2.0), moderate (2.5–3.0), and severe (4.0–5.0). According to complaints of patients and their family concerning declined cognitive function and interference with daily life activities in our study, PD patients were divided into three groups as follows: normal group, MCI group, and dementia group, according to MMSE and MoCA (Beijing version) normal cognitive function. MoCA ≥26 points and denying cognitive decline was categorized as a normal cognitive function, MoCA <26 points and MMSE ≥26 as well as a complaint of decreased cognitive function but denying interference with daily life activities as MCI, and MMSE <26 and complaint of decreased cognitive function and affected daily lives as dementia. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate the quality of sleep in PD patients over the pastmonth. Patients with PSQI score ≥6 points were classified as suffering sleep disorders, and patients with long-term use of sleeping pills were excluded. SPSS version 19.0 software (SPSS, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Student's t-test was used for the comparisons. The significance level was set at a value of P < 0.05. There were a total of 111 (61 males and 50 females) PD patients, with a mean age of 66.5 ± 8.7 years, a mean educational level of 11.2 ± 3.5 years and a mean duration of 6.1 ± 4.1 years. The mean H-Y staging was 2.20 ± 0.80, which was classified as mild-to-moderate PD, including mild in 59 (53.15%) patients, and moderate in 52 (46.85%) patients. Patients with PSQI ≥6 were diagnosed with having sleep disorders. There were 67 (60.36%) patients with cognitive impairment, including 30 (27.03%) with MCI and 37 (33.33%) with dementia. The MMSE score in dementia group was 23.04 ± 1.73, which was categorized as mild dementia. The results of the comparison of sleep quality in PD patients with different cognitive levels showed different sleep quality in mild PD patients with different cognitive levels, with the poorest sleep quality in the dementia group. Pairwise comparison showed that the PSQI score was significantly higher in the dementia group than in the normal group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) [Supplementary Table 1]. Different cognitive levels in moderate PD patients were associated with different sleep quality, with the poorest quality in the dementia group. The pairwise comparison indicated significantly higher PSQI scores in dementia group than in the normal group (P < 0.01) [Supplementary Table 2]. Regarding sleep quality, no significant differences were noted in mild and moderate PD patients (P = 0.935).Supplementary Table 1: Comparison of sleep quality in mild Parkinson's disease patients with different cognitive levelsSupplementary Table 2: Comparison of sleep quality in moderate Parkinson's disease patients with different cognitive levelsWith respect to general information in PD patients with different sleep quality, there was no significant difference between the two PD groups regarding age, educational level, duration of disease, and H-Y staging (P > 0.05). However, UPDRS score was significantly higher in the sleep disturbance group than in the normal group, whereas MoCA score and MMSE score were remarkably lower than those in the normal group (both P < 0.05) [Table 1]. The correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between cognitive level and sleep quality in PD patients after controlling H-Y variables (r = 0.461, P < 0.01).Table 1: Comparison of general information in Parkinson's disease patients with different sleep conditionsPD is a common degenerative disease of CNS in the elderly. In addition to motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms in recent years, such as cognitive decline, sleep disorders, autonomic nerve damage, anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, seriously affect the QOL of patients, thereby raising additional concerns. A considerable number of people experience decreased sleep quality at the onset of early PD or before PD symptoms. Common types of sleep disorders in PD patients include difficulty falling asleep, wakefulness/sleep fragmentation, daytime lethargy, sleep-deprivation, REM sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and sleep episodes. In addition, altered sleep parameters have been observed, including sleep structure. Those are confronted with unapparent difficulties of falling asleep, difficulties of maintaining sleep and disordered sleep structure, higher incidence of asymptomatic periodic limb movements, and REM sleep behavior disorder, adversely impacting patients' QOL. There are studies suggesting that RBD is a risk factor for cognitive impairment in PD patients.[3] As we reported, mean H-Y staging of all 111 patients was 2.20 ± 0.80, showing a mild-to-moderate PD. PQSI scale was used to assess the quality of sleep in 111 PD patients enrolled, indicating the prevalence of 54.95% in sleep disorders. PD sleep disorders have been reported to be associated with aging, the severity of illness, depression, and dopaminergic dose. There is no consensus on the prevalence of sleep disorders in PD patients based on various studies, which is, however, generally higher than our results. Several studies have shown that PD patients suffer abnormal sleep at an early stage, which is likely to worsen as the disease progresses. Even at early stage, PD patients have a significantly decreased health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) compared with their peers, and that PD impacts HR-QOL in various manners. PD at an early stage has a limited effect on HR-QOL due to relatively mild motor symptoms. Thus, the priority should be given to nonmotor symptoms. The authors of the study recognize depression, fatigue, and sleep disorders as the leading cause of the decline in HR-QOL in early PD patients.[4] The current findings reveal that a higher rate (54.95%) of sleep disorders is noted in mild-to-moderate PD patients, and sleep disorders negatively impact cognitive function in PD patients, thereby leading to further decline of HR-QOL. Sleep disorders and cognitive disorders, as the two major nonmotor symptoms of PD, interact with each other. Sleep disorders can be seen as a concomitant symptom of cognitive impairment and can lead to involvement of the brainstem nerve nucleus, thus impairing cognitive function. The current results showed that sleep disorders in PD patients were associated with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and a marked decline in cognitive function. Consistent with the above findings, PD patients with dementia had poorer sleep quality than those with normal cognitive function, suggesting an interaction between sleep quality and cognitive function. Based on studies in the Western countries,[5] α-synuclein, Aβ protein, and tau protein have been found in multiple brain functional areas of PD patients with sleep disorders. Currently, Aβ protein and tau protein are recognized to be associated with pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease.[6] In addition, α-synuclein abnormally aggregates to form Lewy bodies, which are characteristic pathological changes of Lewy body dementia, suggesting a common pathological basis of sleep disorders and cognitive decline. This study has several limitations. First, patients enrolled had mild-to-moderate PD and MCI. Second, there was a small sample size. Third, the effect of medications patients took on sleep is not taken into account. Last, the types of sleep disorders patients suffered were not specified. Patients with severe PD should be included, and larger sample size is needed. In addition, research methods need to be improved to obtain more detailed and accurate data. Conclusively, our findings suggest that sleep disorder in PD patients can be considered as a concomitant symptom of cognitive decline, and further aggravate cognitive impairment, indicating a potential interaction. Although the underlying pathophysiological processes remain incompletely understood, the association between sleep disorders and cognitive function in PD patients may suggest a decrease in dopamine levels in the limbic system.

On the contrary, headaches of organic origin have only recently received a proper nosological individuation thanks to the modern technological progress achieved in the field of medicine. The migraine crisis, both with and without aura, is so typical in its clinical features that it does not require subtle instrumental methodologies to be diagnosed. In most cases a careful anamnesis provides all the elements necessary to formulate a precise diagnosis: the positive family history, the time and mode of onset of crises, the nature of head pain, the chronological stages are quite constant whatever the trigger factor may be. Some other considerations add further evidence to the primitivity of migraine. First of all, migraine can be relieved by quite structurally different drugs with different mechanisms of action. In addition, no significant relationship has ever been found between migraine and other pathologies.",

      "title": "Reversible dementias.",
      "abstract": "In recent years, more attention has been given to the early diagnostic evaluation of patients with dementia which is essential to identify patients with cognitive symptoms who may have treatable conditions. Guidelines suggest that all patients presenting with dementia or cognitive symptoms should be evaluated with a range of laboratory tests, and with structural brain imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While many of the disorders reported as 'reversible dementias' are conditions that may well be associated with cognitive or behavioral symptoms, these symptoms are not always sufficiently severe to fulfill the clinical criteria for dementia. Thus, while the etiology of a condition may be treatable it should not be assumed that the associated dementia is fully reversible. Potentially reversible dementias should be identified and treatment considered, even if the symptoms are not sufficiently severe to meet the clinical criteria for dementia, and even if partial or full reversal of the cognitive symptoms cannot be guaranteed. In the literature, the most frequently observed potentially reversible conditions identified in patients with cognitive impairment or dementia are depression, adverse effects of drugs, drug or alcohol abuse, space-occupying lesions, normal pressure hydrocephalus, and metabolic conditions land endocrinal conditions like hypothyroidism and nutritional conditions like vitamin B-12 deficiency. Depression is by far the most common of the potentially reversible conditions. The review, hence addresses the common causes of reversible dementia and the studies published so far.",

      "title": "Migraine: A Chronic Sympathetic Nervous System Disorder",
      "abstract": "Objective.—To determine the degree of diagnostic and clinical similarity between chronic sympathetic nervous system disorders and migraine. Background.—Migraine is an episodic syndrome consisting of a variety of clinical features that result from dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system. During headache‐free periods, migraineurs have a reduction in sympathetic function compared to nonmigraineurs. Sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is also the major feature of rare neurological disorders such as pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. There are no known reports in the medical literature, however, comparing sympathetic nervous system function in individuals with migraine, pure autonomic failure, and multiple system atrophy. Methods.—A detailed review of the literature was performed to compare the results of a wide variety of diagnostic tests and clinical signs that have been described in these 3 heretofore unrelated disorders. Results.—The data indicate that migraine shares significant diagnostic and clinical features with both pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy, yet represents a distinct subtype of chronic sympathetic dysfunction. Migraine is most similar to pure autonomic failure in terms of reduced supine plasma norepinephrine levels, peripheral adrenergic receptor supersensitivity, and clinical symptomatology directly related to sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. The peripheral sympathetic nervous system dysfunction is much more severe in pure autonomic failure than in migraine. Migraine differs from both pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy in that migraineurs retain the ability, although suboptimal, to increase plasma norepinephrine levels following physiological stressors. Conclusions.—The major finding of the present study is that migraine is a disorder of chronic sympathetic dysfunction, sharing many diagnostic and clinical characteristics with pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy. However, the sympathetic nervous system dysfunction in migraine differs from pure autonomic failure and multiple system atrophy in that occurs in an anatomically intact system. It is proposed that the sympathetic dysfunction in migraine relates to an imbalance of sympathetic co‐transmitters. Specifically, it is suggested that a migraine attack is characterized by a relative depletion of sympathetic norepinephrine stores in conjunction with an increase in the release of other sympathetic cotransmitters such as dopamine, prostaglandins, adenosine triphosphate, and adenosine.

The close relationship between stress and migraine attacks and the significant psychiatric comorbidities in migraine provide evidence of a \"paradigm\" of tight interaction between somatic and psychological aspects in paediatric migraine. In particular in younger children, an uncomfortable situation, a psychological problem or an emotional distress is rarely expressed directly but usually through physical symptoms. So migraine may be considered as a disorder of psychobiological adaptation in which genetic predisposition interplays with internal and/or external environmental influences such as psycho-emotional, climatic, hormonal, dietary or other factors.",

Common mental symptoms include: depression and other mood disorders, irritability, emotional lability, paroxysms of laughter or crying, and paranoid thinking. Physical functioning often is affected. The presenting physical symptoms consist of the focal findings associated with the areas of brain cell damage. Consequently, the physical symptoms are highly variable from individual to individual. The presentation of this disorder is extremely variable and depends on the site of actual damage to the brain, the extent of the damage, and the timing of events that lead to neuronal cell death. Strokes are almost always unmistakable medical crises, while transient ischemic attacks are more easily dismissed by patients as insignificant because they are transient.",

Depression occurs in up to 50% of cases of both of these disorders. Other neuropsychiatric manifestations may include fatigue, apathy, manic symptoms and bipolar disorders, pathological crying and laughing, anxiety, delusions, and personality changes. In both of these diseases of the brain, lesion location is related to, and can usually predict the likelihood of, development of these psychiatric syndromes. Purely neuroanatomical models, however, do not explain all manifestations; this chapter reviews other theories on the pathophysiology of psychiatric disease in stroke and multiple sclerosis. A thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation can form an essential part of the overall assessment and subsequent management of these disorders.",

While some cases of familial PD have been reported, the etiology of most cases is still unknown. Significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology of PD has been made from genetic and epidemiologic studies that have implicated defects in a few key biological processes as potential final common pathological pathways. PD is a progressive motor disorder characterized by death of dopaminergic neurons in the region of the brain called the substantia nigra pars compacta although other areas of the central and peripheral nervous system are involved (Braak, Del Tredici et al. 2003). The loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD leads to motor symptoms that include akinesia (inability to initiate movement), bradykinesia (slowness of movement), resting tremor, and balance problems. Non-motor symptoms can include cognitive impairments, mood disturbances, sleep dysfunction, gastrointestinal problems, and dysautonomia. PD is a progressive disorder and despite several effective therapies that treat many of the symptoms, there are no treatments that alter disease progression. Uncovering the causes of PD is likely necessary to find effective disease modifying therapies. The pathological hallmark of PD is the presence of Lewy bodies, which are cytosolic inclusions with several molecular components although -synuclein (-syn) is the predominant protein (Spillantini, Schmidt et al. 1997). Lewy bodies also contain ubiquitin, a polypeptide that targets proteins to the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) for degradation.",

Due to the nature of gliomas, the clinical spectrum of symptoms is broad. Disease trajectories may differ from other tumor entities outside the brain in cause of absence of systematic metastasis affecting other organ systems. Functional impairment is mainly elicited through the localisation, size and surrounding oedema. This may include neurological deficits like paresis, aphasia or symptoms like epilepsy or headache, leading to mood and behavioural disorders, as well as cognitive impairment. Increasing brain swelling is consecutively evolving to cerebral herniation with decrease of vigilance and is most frequently the cause of death.",

These symptoms typically dissipate over time, but the presence of PEs is associated with an elevated risk of developing a clinical psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia. In addition, PEs show associations with neuropsychological impairment and disturbances in brain structure and function. It is thought that PEs are driven by similar neurodevelopmental and environmental mechanisms, but it is unclear how similar the underlying pathways are. This chapter will discuss the cognitive difficulties and differences in brain structure and function associated with PEs. Then, it will examine these in relation to typical neurodevelopment and the course of impairment towards clinical psychotic disorders.",

These complications occur at greater frequency and are often unrecognized because critically ill patients are often intubated, sedated, and/or receiving neuromuscular blocking agents. Encephalopathy is the most common neurologic complication in the ICU and is usually multifactorial in origin. Sepsis is associated with the highest incidence of neurologic complications. Neurologic complications are associated with increased disability, longer hospital stay, and increased mortality.

      "title": "Perioperative Management of Acute Central Nervous System Injury",
      "abstract": "Neural function is essential to human existence. Thus, loss of any neural element in the course of a critical illness represents a major loss to a given individual. Neurons or supporting elements may be lost in a small, virtually unnoticeable manner, perhaps manifest as cognitive or behavioral deficit, or there may be widespread selective neuronal loss or tissue infarction with more apparent and disabling deficits. Based on the notion that neural function is the essence of acceptable survival from critical illness, it is crucial for perioperative management to include considerations of neural viability and the impact and interactions of the primary diseases and therapeutics on the nervous system. There are numerous perioperative scenarios where a patient may present with neurologic dysfunction. In a general sense, these scenarios often involve ischemia, trauma, or neuroexcitation. Each of these, as they progressively worsen, at some point typically involve a period of decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), usually resulting from elevated intracranial pressure, eventually compromising cerebral blood flow sufficiently to produce permanent neuronal loss, infarction, and possibly brain death. A variety of biochemical pathways play a major role. Optimization of perioperative outcome after injury to the central nervous system (CNS) is a multifactorial process requiring skillful and well-informed anesthetic and critical care management. However, none of these interventions is risk-free, and extensive knowledge and expertise are very important to ensure a fine balance between the benefits and risks of specific interventions. By the end of this chapter, the anesthesia provider should have a general understanding of how to address the most commonly encountered complications in the acutely injured central nervous system.",

To accurately diagnose and to adequately treat depression are still the key points to obtain a good response during acute phases and to reduce the risk of relapses/recurrences. Somatic symptoms (namely, headache, stomachache, on the back pain, etc.) may be precursors or prodromals of a depressive episode, preceding for years the onset of mood disorders. Nonetheless, their detection is complicated, because somatic symptoms are often underestimated or misinterpreted. Physical symptoms are part of typical depressive symptomatology. Changes in energy, sleep, neurovegetative functions and sexual activity are common during a major depressive episode. Nonetheless, special populations of patients may show only this aspect of depression. Cognitive symptoms of depression in the elderly or during childhood or adolescence are often “covered” by the presence of physical symptoms; depressed mood or low energy levels are considered by the patient (and sometimes by physicians) as the “obvious consequence” of enduring physical symptoms, that are disturbing, interfering with social adaptation and thereof producing significant levels of impairment. The accurate detection of all the aspects of a mood disorder is the first step, especially in special populations of patients (elderly, childhood, pregnant women, etc.). Early detection of mood liability, mood instability, low energy levels, diurnal variations, loss of interest and pleasure is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Sometimes, patients are closely focused on physical symptoms and tend to explain every other psychological manifestation as a consequence of the loss of subjective wellbeing.",

An important clinical consideration for IEED is that of distinguishing mood from affect. IEED describes a syndrome of relatively stereotypical episodes of uncontrollable crying and/or laughing, resulting from lesions of multiple types, in multiple brain regions, without an apparent stimulus to trigger such responses. This syndrome is common among a number of neurological diseases like patients with a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as dementias such as Alzheimer;s disease (AD), and motor disorders such as Parkinson;s disease (PD). The neuropathological cause and neurochemistry of the disorder remains unclear. There is general agreement that IEED is the result of an injury to the neurological pathways that control the expression of emotions.

However, over the last two decades, there has been an increasing focus on the non-motor symptoms that accompany this disorder. Problems such as anxiety and depression are often comorbid with Parkinson's disease. Difficulties with aspects of cognition are also frequently present and may include deficits in executive function, working memory, planning and visuospatial problems. There is an extensive body of research that has examined the range of cognitive problems that emerge early in the disease process and often progress to dementia. More recently, research in this area has focused on identifying a stage referred to as preclinical dementia or mild cognitive impairment. There are still a number of difficulties that prevent accurate classification of patients with Parkinson's disease who will experience cogntive problems. However, identifying a period of preclinical dementia offers an opportunity to intervene to stop or slow the progression to dementia for this group.",

There is an increased incidence of seizures inAlzheimerâ€™s disease compared to age-matched controls. Seizures also occur in prion disorders and some frontotemporal lobar degenerationsyndromes, whereas parkinsonian dementia disorders seem relatively seizure free. Seizure pathogenesis in these conditions is uncertain,but may relate to neocortical and hippocampal hyperexcitability and synchronised activity, possibly as a consequence of dysfunctionalprotein metabolism, neuronal structural changes, and concurrent cerebrovascular disease. Alzheimerâ€™s disease may be a neuronalnetwork disorder, characterised by both cognitive decline and epileptic activity, in which seizures are an integral part of disease phenotyperather than epiphenomena. Treatment of seizures in dementia syndromes currently remains empirical. Greater understanding of dementiapathogenesis may shed light on mechanisms of epileptogenesis and facilitate more rational approaches to seizure treatment.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may present neuropsychiatric and conduct disorders at different stages of the development of the disease that make treatment even more difficult. Development The neurologist must be on the lookout for the possible appearance of alterations affecting impulse control, even from the early stages of the disease, so as to be able to prevent them or to plan a suitable adjustment of treatment. Some of the most common impulsivity disorders include hypersexuality, compulsive gambling and other addictive behaviours which, if left undetected and untreated, can end up having a destructive effect on the patient's socio-familial surroundings. Psychotic disorders (hallucinations, delusions) are often associated to advanced phases of PD and to the effect of dopamine therapy, and they are associated to a higher morbidity and mortality rate. Factors of a genetic or pharmacogenetic nature or a gene-environment interaction may account for the different individual susceptibility to disorders in the neuropsychiatric realm among patients with PD. It is wise to bear in mind the possible medico-legal implications that may stem from behavioral disorders, both for the patient and his or her family and for the physician, because situations could arise that trigger conflicts between confidentiality and preventing third parties from being harmed, as well as harm that can be attributed to the side effects of medicines. Conclusions The specialist must be familiar with, foresee and propose suitable treatment for behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders in PD with potential medico-legal implications.",

      "title": "Some Neurological and Psychiatric Complications in the Disorders of the Thyroid Gland",
      "abstract": "Thyroid hormones are of primary importance for the perinatal development of the central nervous system, and for the normal function of the adult brain. These hormones primarily regulate the transcription of specific target genes. They increase the cortical serotonergic neurotransmission, and play an important role in regulating central noradrenergic and GABA function. Thyroid deficiency during the perinatal period results in mental retardation. Hypothyroidism of the adults causes most frequently dementia and depression. Other less common clinical pictures include myxoedema coma, dysfunction of cerebellum and cranial nerves. Hypothyroidism also increases predisposition of stroke. Peripheral diseases frequently include polyneuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, myalgic state, and rarely myokymia. Nearly all the hyperthyroid patients show minor psychiatric signs, and infrequently psychosis, dementia, confusion state, depression, apathetic thyrotoxicosis, thyrotoxic crisis, seizures, pyramidal signs, or chorea occur. The peripheral complications may be indicated by chronic thyrotoxic myopathy, infiltrative ophthalmopathy, myasthenia gravis, periodic hypokalemic paralysis and polyneuropathy. Generalized resistance to thyroid hormone was confirmed in a number of patients with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Significantly elevated antithyroid antibody titers characterize Hashimoto’s encephalopathy. This condition is a rare, acute–subacute, serious, life-threatening, but steroid-responsive, relapsing-remitting, autoimmune disease.",

Their symptoms can be grouped into five subclusters which make their similarities clear: (1) disturbances of perception, (2) disturbances of motor behaviors, (3) disturbances in the ability to relate to others, (4) absent or pathologic language development, and (5) disturbances of developmental rate. The disturbances of perception appear to be fundamental to the other aspects of the disease. The total symptom complex suggests that there is an underlying neuropathology<sup>2</sup>which leads to periodic overloading and underloading of the central nervous system. These alternating states of excessive facilitation and inhibition vary the child's awareness and response to the same stimuli and causes what we have termed perceptual inconstancy.",

      "abstract": "The clinical presentation and course of patients with mitochondrial syndromes are extremely diverse. These diseases may manifest at any age from birth until late adulthood with acute manifestation or as a chronic progressive disease. Virtually any organ may be impaired, but the organs with the highest energetic demands are most frequently involved, including brain, muscle, heart and liver. Some mitochondrial disorders affect a single organ (e.g., the eye in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy), but many involve multiple organ systems. Many patients display an assemblage of clinical features that can be ascribed to a discrete clinical syndrome, such as the Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), neurogenic weakness with ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers (MERRF), or mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). On the other hand, many other mitochondrial disorders do not clearly fit into one particular and recognizable syndrome category, and the spectrum of disease phenotypes can be broadly overlapping among several syndromes. All possible inheritance patterns can be found (maternal, X linked, autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, and de novo occurrence) due to the dual involvement of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.",

OCD has a perennial prevalence of 1 to 3%, making it the fourth most prevalent psychiatric disorder. OCD has been named as a leading global cause of nonfatal disorder by the World Health Organization. According to various studies the majority of patients suffer from both obsessions and compulsions; nevertheless, neither is required for a diagnosis. Throughout their disorder, at some point, the majority of patients are able to recognize their symptoms as unreasonable or excessive. In this chapter, the clinical characteristics and pathophysiology theories of OCD are summarized. Separate sections in this issue discuss etiologic ideas based on genetic elements, cognitive neuroscience, and infection-triggered immunological dysfunction. Also, the causes and challenges faced by a person in this cognitive psychological disorder is discussed briefly.",

The diagnosis is clinical and in 50% of cases it can be confirmed by a mutation in the PTPN11 gene. Studies into the effect of growth hormone treatment on final height have yet to provide any definite conclusions. Therefore, for the time being this treatment should be carried out in a research setting. Early-childhood feeding difficulties are troublesome. However, these disappear spontaneously and do not seem to negatively affect growth. Specific developmental patterns, resulting in behavioural and learning problems (non-verbal learning disability) are frequently encountered and require a specific approach.",

Cataplexy and other types of seizures may be found during the evolution of the disease. In some cases a psychosis may be the only manifestation for several years; the treatment by psychotropic drugs raises the question of a superimposition of a drug-induced lipidosis. Hepatosplenomegaly is often discrete, contrary to infantile cases. Foam cells or sea-blue histiocytes are a general feature of the disease.

      "abstract": "Nocturnal and sleep-related motor disorders in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a wide spectrum of manifestations and present a complex clinical picture. Problems can arise due to impaired movement ability (hypokinesias), e.g. nocturnal hypokinesia or early-morning akinesia, or to excessive movement (hyperkinesias), e.g. end-of-the-day dyskinesia, parasomnias, periodic limb movement during sleep and restless legs syndrome. These disorders can have a significant negative impact on the sleep, daytime functional ability, and overall quality of life of individuals with PD and their carers. The debilitating motor issues are often accompanied by a combination of non-motor symptoms, including pain and cramping, which add to the overall burden. Importantly, nocturnal motor disorders encompass a broader timeline than just the period of sleep, often starting in the evening, as well as occurring throughout the night and on awakening, and are not just limited to problems of insomnia or sleep fragmentation. Diagnosis can be challenging as, in many cases, the 'gold standard' assessment method is video polysomnography, which may not be available in all settings. Various validated questionnaires are available to support evaluation, and alternative approaches, using wearable sensors and digital technology, are now being developed to facilitate early diagnosis and monitoring. This review sets out the parameters of what can be considered normal nocturnal movement and describes the clinical manifestations, usual clinical or objective assessment methods, and evidence for optimal management strategies for the common nocturnal motor disorders that neurologists will encounter in people with PD in their clinical practice.",

It is in meningitis rather than in mania that it may be truly said—“And each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head.” The patient suffering from cerebral inflammation has a motiveless ferocity of aspect, rarely met with in pure mania. The stage of effusion in meningitis, and all the stages of some forms of deep-seated cerebral inflammation, in which the meninges are not affected, require to be distinguished from dementia, rather than from mania. The history of the case, however, and the affection of the muscular system, will generally render the diagnosis easy.",

      "abstract": "Objetivo: Analisar as características da Doença de Parkinson (DP). Revisão bibliográfica: A DP é um distúrbio progressivo em que as células produtoras de dopamina localizadas na substância negra do cérebro degeneram. Esta afeta mais de 10 milhões de pessoas em todo o mundo, e espera-se que esse número dobre até 2030, dado o envelhecimento da população mundial. A doença é caracterizada por um conjunto central de anormalidades de movimento (motoras) como lentidão de movimentos, rigidez muscular e tremores, bem como uma série de características não motoras, como constipação, ansiedade e demência. Considerações finais: A DP é a segunda doença neurodegenerativa mais comum com sintomas motores e não motores que causa comprometimento na qualidade de vida do paciente. Seu diagnóstico é clínico com base na tríade bradicinesia ou lentidão de movimento associada a tremor de repouso e/ou rigidez. O tratamento farmacológico é feito através da reposição de dopamina, mas não fornece cura e nem retarda a progressão da doença, agindo apenas nos seus sintomas, sendo feito a base dos medicamentos Carbidopa/Levodopa. Além disso, estratégias como medicina complementar e estímulo a atividade física são amplamente utilizados em associação a terapêutica farmacológica.",

      "title": "Trastornos de la reactividad al dolor",
      "abstract": "espanolLa funcion protectora del dolor es bien conocida. Existen algunas enfermedades que cursan con la ausencia de la percepcion dolorosa y conllevan a multiples problemas para los pacientes afectados. En los trastornos de la reactividad al dolor se pueden distinguir trastornos congenitos y adquiridos. Dentro de los congenitos se incluyen dos cuadros clinicos bien diferenciados: la insensibilidad congenita al dolor o analgesia congenita y la indiferencia congenita al dolor. En el primer caso el estimulo doloroso no es transmitido adecuadamente al sistema nervioso central debido a un defecto en las vias sensitivas; mientras que en el segundo la via sensorial esta integra pero el paciente no identifica el estimulo doloroso como desagradable. Actualmente la insensibilidad congenita al dolor se encuadra dentro de un grupo de neuropatias hereditarias llamadas sensitivo-autonomicas, con afectacion de la sensibilidad dolorosa, en relacion con la implicacion de las fibras nerviosas mielinicas pequenas y amielinicas, vehiculos de la mayor parte de la sensibilidad dolorosa, asi como de las fibras autonomicas. Se distinguen cinco tipos de neuropatia hereditaria sensitivo-autonomica, que se describen en el texto, existiendo alteracion de la percepcion dolorosa en todas ellas, aunque con mayor grado en alguna de ellas como en el caso de la neuropatia hereditaria sensitivo-autonomica tipo IV o insensibilidad congenita al dolor con anhidrosis. Clinicamente en estas neuropatias se pueden producir lesiones a diversos niveles como consecuencia de la perdida de la sensibilidad dolorosa. Las alteraciones que se asocian con mayor frecuencia son: fracturas multiples, articulaciones de Charcot, dismetria de extremidades inferiores, osteomielitis, artritis septica, luxaciones, autoamputaciones, automutilaciones y escoliosis progresiva. Es necesario un tratamiento multidisciplinar y especializado junto con la colaboracion paterna para minimizar las complicaciones de esta enfermedad potencialmente grave. En ausencia de tratamiento etiologico, el tratamiento sintomatico adquiere una gran importancia. Se evitaran en lo posible los procesos de riesgo, produccion de fracturas, mordeduras, roces, infecciones y mutilaciones. Cuando se producen lesiones en areas del cerebro que sustentan el procesamiento del estimulo doloroso, pueden tener lugar deficits en uno o varios componentes de la percepcion dolorosa, y pueden producirse situaciones clinicas similares a la insensibilidad congenita al dolor. Dentro de los trastornos adquiridos se describen la asimbolia dolorosa, la analgotimia y la hemiagnosia dolorosa. EnglishThe protective role of pain is well-known. There are some diseases in which pain perception is absent, causing multiple problems to the patients. In pain reactivity disorders can be divided into congenital and acquired disorders. Congenital disorders cover two well-differentiated clinical conditions: congenital pain insensitivity or congenital analgesia and congenital pain indifference. In the first case, pain stimuli are not adequately transmitted to the central nervous system due to a deficiency in the sensitive routes, whereas in the second the sensitive routes are intact, but the patient cannot perceive the pain stimulus as unpleas-ant. Congenital pain insensitivity is currently included in the group of the so-called sensitive-autonomous hereditary neuropathies, characterized by pain sensitivity disorders involving small myelinic and non-myelinic nerve fibres, which are the vehicles of most pain sensitivity, as well as the autonomous fibres. Five types of hereditary sensitive-autonomous neuropathies can be differentiated and are described in the text. All of them are associated to pain perception disorders, particularly the hereditary sensitive-autonomous neuropathy type IV and the congenital pain insensitivity with anhidrosis. Clinically, the loss of pain sensitivity in these neuropathies can cause damage at different levels. The most frequent associated disorders are: multiple fractures, Charcot joints, lower limb dysmetria, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, luxations, self-amputations, self-mutilations and progressive scoliosis. Multidisciplinary and specialized therapy is required, as well as parental collaboration, in order to minimize complications of this potentially severe disease. In the absence of an etiological treatment, the symptomatic treatment becomes very important. Risk processes, fractures, bites, rubs, infections and mutilations shall be prevented as far as possible. Damage of brain areas involved in pain stimulus process-ing can cause deficits in one or several components of pain perception, resulting in clinical conditions similar to congenital pain insensitivity. Within the acquired disorders, painful asymbolia, analgotimia and painful hemiagnosia are described.",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

      "title": "Psychiatric aspects of infections",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neuropsychiatric disturbances stemming from infectious diseases are widespread in both the industrialized world and developing countries. Such neuropsychiatric syndromes are not necessarily the result of infectious processes directly involving the central nervous system, they may also be complications of systemic infections. There are many microbial, viral, and parasitic agents, as well as other types of infectious substances, which can affect the central nervous system, leading to the appearance of neurological and psychiatric symptoms that may cause suffering to the patient, and even be disabling. When considering the psychiatric manifestations of infectious illness, it is important to consider clinical manifestations derived from a possible systemic infection, which can be less obvious than a direct involvement of the central nervous system. Acute organic reactions may accompany many systemic infections, especially at the extremes of life. A clear example is the delirium that frequently occurs with pneumonia in the elderly. In these clinical syndromes, several factors could be responsible for the alterations in cerebral metabolism. The mere fact of having a fever could be involved. Cerebral anoxia often appears to be responsible, or the influence of toxins derived from the infecting micro-organism. More complex metabolic disturbances or the accumulation of toxic intermediate products can also be -implicated. Likewise, infections that course as chronic or subacute illnesses are frequently accompanied by the onset of depressive syndromes. One of the factors implied in clinical depression that occurs within the context of systemic infectious illnesses (e.g. tuberculosis and infectious mononucleosis), is a sense of physical vulnerability, possibly heightened by a loss of strength and negative changes in the patient's appearance. Patients are often afraid of losing their earning capacity or even their jobs, as well as other social and occupational problems associated with the illness. Another very important factor, above all with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted disease (STD), is the social stigma that these patients may suffer. Sexually transmitted disease infection implies sexual activity that historically carries connotations of illicit, casual, sexual encounters, and acquiring an STD is frequently associated with embarrassment and social stigma. In addition to the disease itself, the medications commonly used to treat infectious illnesses can have side-effects that alter patients’ behaviour, as well as their cognitive and affective functioning (Table 5.3.5.1). In this chapter we consider infections of clinical interest in the practice of psychiatry. These conditions will be dealt with briefly, and textbooks of general medicine should be consulted for further details. Prion diseases and chronic fatigue syndromes, which are also related to the subject of the present chapter, are discussed in Chapters 4.1.4 and 5.2.7, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Stereotyped behaviour can be regarded as that which is repetitive, purposeless, and involuntary, often interfering with normal behaviour. Such behaviour is generally a consequence of disruption of the normal chemical milieu of the central nervous system and, in humans, stereotypy is usually seen as an unwanted side-effect of medications or, in the context of primary disease of the nervous system, as one of the so-called movement disorders. The taxonomy of the movement disorders is controversial and often confusing even to those well versed in neurology. One approach is to divide the disorders into those in which motor activity is either increased (hyperkinetic) or decreased (hypokinetic) or those predominantly affecting tone (i.e. the resistance to passive movement). Even this classification has its difficulties, since Parkinson’s disease, for example, one of the commonest movement disorders, is characterized simultaneously by too little motor activity (bradykinesia), excessive movement (tremor), and increased muscular tone or rigidity. For the purposes of this chapter, we will first deal with primary hyperkinetic disorders, and then discuss drug-induced involuntary movements. The hyperkinetic disorders can be subclassified into tremor, chorea, tic, myoclonus, and dystonia.",

However, with further identification of childhood benign partial seizures it is becoming clear that inheritance plays a major role in the pathogenesis of these seizures. Diagnostic criteria proposed for benign partial seizures include absence of neurologic or intellectual deficits, family history of epilepsy, onset of seizures after age 2 years, stereotyped brief seizures, frequent nocturnal occurrence, spontaneous remission in adolescence, and electroencephalograms (EEGs) demonstrating spikes with a distinctive morphology and localization superimposed on normal background activity. The two most commonly described benign partial epilepsies of childhood are benign Rolandic epilepsy (BRE) and benign occipital epilepsy (BOE). Both disorders begin in childhood, are associated with characteristic EEG patterns, have seizures that are easily controlled with medication, often are familial, and have an excellent prognosis. The other benign partial seizure disorders in children that have been described are not as well studied as BOE and BRE, and the role of inheritance pattern, if any, is less clear.",

      "abstract": "Thyroid hormone deficiency or excess may cause emotional disturbances and mood disorders, encompassing major depressive syndromes and bipolar disorders, along with various other neuropsychiatric conditions, some of which may have developmental origins. In particular, profound long-term untreated hypothyroidism can culminate in severe psychosis, historically referred to as myxedema madness. Addressing the underlying thyroid condition typically proves highly effective in rectifying the associated brain disorder. Subclinical thyroid diseases have also been implicated in emotional and cognitive disorders, prompting inquiry into the optimal treatment window. Moreover, thyroid hormones have demonstrated potential in expediting or augmenting the effects of standard mood disorder treatments in euthyroid patients, hinting at a baseline state of localized cerebral hypothyroidism with an uncertain pathogenesis, potentially remediable through high doses of thyroid hormones.",

      "abstract": "One adult subgroup of the schizophrenic syndrome seems to share minimal brain dysfunction (MBD) as Anlage, mostly but not exclusively on a familial basis and occurring in varying degrees. Pathogenically, MBD usually involves problems of spatial orientation, the development of language, and a low external and internal stimulus barrier. These cortical problems can lead to problems of establishing self-boundaries and coordination, to feelings of perplexity, difficulties with the written and spoken word and abstract conceptualization, poor impulse control and defenses, overload by external stimuli, and resulting disorganization. These phenomena in turn cause secondary emotional problems, especially during the school years. In addition to neuropsychological and soft neurological signs and symptoms, this group is diagnostically characterized by a poor response to phenothiazines alone. Therapeutically, energizers, together with diphenylhydantoin, at times in combination with lithium, are often useful. Psychotherapy must include education concerning MBD and must deal with the primary and secondary cognitive and emotional aspects of MBD as well as other problems. Prevention of overload and genetic counseling may be indicated.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Several illnesses expressed somatically that do not have clearly demonstrated pathophysiological origin and that are associated with neuropsychological complaints are reviewed. Among them are nonepileptic seizures, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, Persian Gulf War unexplained illnesses, toxic mold and sick building syndrome, and silicone breast implant disease. Some of these illnesses may be associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, but it is not likely that these abnormalities are caused by traditionally defined neurological disease. Instead, the cognitive abnormalities may be caused by a complex interaction between biological and psychological factors. Nonepileptic seizures serve as an excellent model of medically unexplained symptoms. Although nonepileptic seizures clearly are associated with objective cognitive abnormalities, they are not of neurological origin. There is evidence that severe stressors and PTSD are associated with immune system problems, neurochemical changes, and various diseases; these data blur the distinctions between psychological and organic etiologies. Diagnostic problems are intensified by the fact that many patients are poor historians. Patients are prone to omit history of severe stressors and psychiatric problems, and the inability to talk about stressors increases the likelihood of suffering from physiological forms of stress.",

The convulsive phenomena take certain distinctive and often subtle forms because of the status of the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological development of the neonatal brain. The predominant etiological process is hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, but intracranial hemorrhage, intracranial infection, developmental defects and metabolic disorders are also responsible for a considerable proportion of cases. Prognosis is related primarily to the neurological disease that underlies the seizures. Treatment may be specific for the underlying disorder, e.g., glucose, calcium, magnesium, pyridoxine, but whatever the cause, urgent control of the convulsions is important because they may have deleterious consequences. Phenobarbital is the single, most important anticonvulsant in the management of neonatal seizures.",

The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

Important characteristics of mechanically limited ocular movement are explained. Brown's syndrome involves restricted elevation in adduction but normal depression in adduction. Trapped superior oblique tendon is mainly caused by trauma in the trochlear region from industrial injuries or road traffic accidents. Trauma affecting the trochlea usually results in restriction of elevation and depression. Graves' orbitopathy (thyroid eye disease) is part of Graves' disease (GD), a systemic autoimmune disorder characterised by hyperthyroidism, orbitopathy, pretibial myxoedema, and acropachy. Orbital injuries usually arise following blunt trauma, and limitation of ocular movement and diplopia are common consequences. Strabismus fixus is a rare disorder in which there is a marked esotropia or less commonly an exotropia, associated with extreme tightness of the medial or lateral rectus muscles. Adherence syndromes can be congenital or acquired.",

      "abstract": "At least three types of ictal atomic phenomena can be seen in partial seizures. Focal atomic seizures are partial seizures with ictal paresis or paralysis of one or more body parts preceding or independent of any convulsive activity. A diagnosis may be difficult without simultaneous EEG recording supplemented by video monitoring or polygraphy. Epileptic negative myoclonus manifests as brief lapses in tone in one or more muscle groups that interferes with motor coordination and postural control. Drop attacks can also occur in partial seizures, as have been well documented in patients with temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy. Different mechanisms may underlie these three phenomena. Focal atonic seizures probably result from relatively circumscribed seizure activity in one or more cortical areas that contribute to the elaboration and execution of motor functions. Whether this represents inactivation or interference in motor integration, or activation of inhibitory system, remains unresolved. The pathophysiology of epileptic negative myoclonus, like that of its positive counterpart, is probably to be found at a more local level, possibly from transiently enhanced local inhibition in the motor cortex. Drop attacks in partial seizures may be close in mechanism to that also seen in generalized seizures, possibly related to ictal activation of descending inhibitory pathways in the brainstem.",

Chronic impotence is often due to a combination of aetiological factors. Erectile selectivity is not a reliable means of diagnosing purely psychogenic impotence.

The either/or concept of impotence being organic or psychogenic should be abandoned as serious errors can be made by adhering to it.",

      "title": "Neurological Deterioration in Wilson's Disease—Types, Etiology, Course, and Management",
      "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism in which pathological copper accumulation, mainly in the liver and the brain, leads to hepatic and/or neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms. Chelators and zinc salts can successfully induce negative copper balance in many patients; however, neurological deterioration may still be observed. This phenomenon can be divided into: (1) early `paradoxical' neurological deterioration, which usually develops in the first 6 months of anti-copper treatment and may be commonly related to drug type, or (2) late neurological deterioration, which mostly occurs after 6 months of treatment and is often related either to non-compliance with treatment, overtreatment resulting in copper deficiency, or adverse drug reactions. Another explanation, especially for early neurological deterioration, is natural WD progression, which can be difficult to differentiate from drug-related deterioration, but usually leads to a worse outcome. There is still no consensus on how to define neurological deterioration in WD using scales or biomarkers, how to distinguish it from the natural disease progression, its risk factors, and optimal management. This narrative review, based on the current literature, aims to provide definitions, prevalence, pathological mechanisms and factors related to neurological deterioration, and also proposes schemes for diagnosis and treatment.",

      "title": "Psychosis and Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "The clinical spectrum of Parkinson's disease (PD) psychosis ranges from mild illusions to formed hallucinations or even frank delusions. Hallucinations occur in about one-third of PD patients treated with chronic dopaminergic therapy and are most often visual. Delusions are less common but typically consist of well-systematized, thematic ideas such as paranoia or infidelity. PD psychosis may be due to extrinsic (i.e., pharmacological treatment) and/or intrinsic (i.e., disease-related) factors. Risk factors for the development of psychosis include older age; advanced disease; akinetic-rigid motor phenotype; concomitant cognitive impairment, depression, or sleep disturbances; and multiple medical problems. When psychosis in PD develops acutely, becomes troublesome or frightening, or poses a safety risk, medical attention is necessary. Medical management of acute psychosis typically includes the following: identifying and addressing specific causes (e.g., infection, medications), reducing or discontinuing medications for PD and other conditions that may aggravate psychosis, and introducing antipsychotic medications. Since antipsychotics with dopamine-blocking properties may worsen parkinsonism, medications with greater serotonergic properties such as clozapine and quetiapine are favored. Effective and well-studied treatments that improve PD ­psychosis without worsening motor function are still needed.",

      "abstract": "The effects of environmental chemicals, drugs, and physical agents on the developing kidney are influenced by the state of renal development and maturation. The development of the kidney, the major excretory organ after birth, consists of 3 stages: the pronephros, or cervical kidney; mesonephros, or thoracic kidney; and metanephros, or abdominal kidney, the definitive kidney. In humans, nephrogenesis and organogenesis occur from the 6th to the 36th weeks of gestational age. After 36 weeks, nephrogenesis is complete and each kidney has a full complement of nephrons. The extent of chemical-induced renal toxicity is related, in part, to the efficiency in which the particular compound is transported by renal tubules. Because renal tubular transport capacities vary with maturation, the degree of nephrotoxicity may also vary with maturation. The signs and symptoms of nephrotoxicity can appear acutely or insidiously. Unexplained acute renal failure, chronic mild proteinuria, or even hypertension can be a manifestation of nephrotoxic agents. Species differences occur, thus the need for studies in humans.",

      "abstract": "We previously hypothesized that depressive and manic states may be consecutive presentations of the same underlying neuronal plasticity, and that moderate impairments in neuronal plasticity cause depressive states while further impairment to neuronal plasticity causes manic states. Psychopathological or biological relationships between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have also been revealed. Therefore, in addition to depressive and manic states, psychosis may also be considered a manifestation resulting from additional impairments to neuronal plasticity. In the present manuscript, we hypothesize that moderate and more severe impairments to neuronal plasticity cause depressive and manic states, respectively, and that more serious impairments to neuronal plasticity cause psychosis. Many studies have suggested that impairments in neuronal plasticity contribute to schizophrenia and other mental disorders with psychotic features, and that the impairment of neuronal plasticity in schizophrenia is more severe than that in bipolar disorder. Therefore, we hypothesize more specifically that impairments in neuronal plasticity may be more severe in the order of the cases featuring psychosis, mania, and depression. This progression notably overlaps with the arrangement of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive disorder in the DSM-5. Psychotic symptoms are thought to appear further towards the base of the psychopathological hierarchy than are manic or depressive symptoms. If impairments to neuronal plasticity contribute to this psychopathological hierarchy, as we contest that they do, our hypothesis may serve as a bridge between clinical psychopathology, diagnosis, and biological psychiatry.",

PD is characterized by intra-cellular aggregates of α-synuclein (syn) and neuron cell loss in the brain region of substantia nigra (SN), which results in deficiency in dopamine levels. Several other types of cell in the peripheral and central autonomic nerve are also involved, most probably from the beginning of the disease. PD is associated with numerous non-motor indicators that donate to overall infirmity, despite the fact a medical diagnosis of the ailment governed by the existence of bradykinesia and some of the other essential motor features. Several paths and machineries, containing proteostasis of syn, mitochondrial function, oxidative injuries, calcium homeostasis, axonal transport, and neuro-inflammation, are participated in the principal molecular pathogenesis. The mainstay of PD treatment is the pharmacological replacement of striatal dopamine. Non-dopaminergic methods are also utilized to treat non-motor and motor symptoms, and deep brain stimulation is utilized for patients who experience unmanageable motor complications related to L-DOPA. For the pharmacological treatment of PD, levodopa, dopamine agonists, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors are commonly used.",

Traditionally, attention has focused on the motor symptomatology of PD, but it is now appreciated that the nonmotor symptoms affecting neuropsychiatric, sleep, autonomic, and sensory domains occur in up to 88% of PD patients and can be an important source of disability. Nonmotor manifestations of PD play a significant role in the impairment of disease-related quality of life. The cause of nonmotor manifestations of PD is multifactorial, but to a large extent, these manifestations are related to the nature of the neurodegenerative process and the widespread nondopaminergic neuropathological changes associated with the disease. Recognition of nonmotor disability is essential not only for ascertaining the functional status of patients but also for better appreciating the nature of the neurodegenerative process in PD. In addition, a number of nonmotor manifestations can precede the onset of motor symptoms in PD and can be used as screening tools allowing for early disease identification and for trials of possible disease-modifying interventions. This article reviews depression, sleep, and autonomic dysfunction in PD.",

It is not infrequently associated with evidences of an attempt at simulation. 5. While related to hysteria in nature it can hardly be regarded as a hysterical psychosis, though of psychogenic origin. 6. Great apprehensiveness with partial stupor, hallucinations of sight and hearing, and often mutism are frequently the most prominent symptoms. Their rapid disappearance upon transfer to a hospital for insane is usual and striking.",

Neurological and cardiac symptoms may share underlying physiopathological mechanisms in diseases, such as Friedreich's ataxia and Wilson's disease, and in certain metabolic disorders, including Refsum disease, Gaucher disease, a congenital disorder of glycosylation, or cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. In certain conditions, such as Sydenham's chorea or dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia syndrome (ATX-DNAJC19), heart involvement can present early in the course of disease, whereas in others such as Friedreich's ataxia or Refsum disease, cardiac symptoms tend to present in later stages. In another 68 acquired or inherited conditions, cardiac involvement or movement disorders are seldom reported.As cardiac disease is part of the phenotypic spectrum of several movement disorders, heart involvement should be carefully investigated and increased awareness of this association encouraged as it may represent a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.",

It is defined as a predisposition to recurrent unprovoked epileptic seizures, which are the clinical manifestations of transient abnormalities of neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex. Epileptic seizures represent a transient malfunction that can occur in any mammalian brain and may be provoked by a wide variety of factors from mechanical trauma to hypoglycemia. As might be anticipated in such a complex organ, their manifestations are highly variable, from the well-known, generalized tonic–clonic seizure or ‘‘grand-mal’’ convulsion in which consciousness is lost and the limbs shake, to brief sensory or cognitive disturbances only apparent to the patient. Epileptic seizures fall into two main categories: generalized, which begin simultaneously in both cerebral hemispheres, and partial (or focal), which originate in one or more localized foci in the brain.",

Diese\r\nErscheinung ist vor allem beim idiopathischen Parkinson‐Syndrom, bei der Alzheimer‐Demenz und bei der Lewy‐Body‐Demenz sichtbar. Andere neurodegenerative Erkrankungen sind mit einer leichten oder masigen Riechminderung verbunden.\r\nBeim idiopathischen Parkinson‐Syndrom ist die olfaktorische Storung ein sehr haufiges Symptom, welches bei 80‐90% der Betroffenen auftritt. Eine Riechstorung kann bei einer Person, die unter dem idiopathischen Parkinson‐Syndrom (IPS) leidet unabhangig\r\nvon Alter, Geschlecht und Dauer der Erkrankung auftreten.\r\nMit psychophysischen Riechtests (z.B. „Sniffin´ Sticks“) kann eine olfaktorische Storung schnell erkannt werden. Diese ist besonders in der Fruhdiagnostik von\r\nneurodegenerativen Erkrankungen von groser Bedeutung, denn nur so besteht eine Chance fur eine potenzielle Neuroprotektion im noch prasymptomatischen\r\nKrankheitsstadium‐ vor Auftreten motorischer Symptome. Hier steht folgende Beobachtung im Vordergrund: neurodegenerative Prozesse beginnen im olfaktorischen System und im Hirnstamm und befallen erst dann spezifische\r\nHirnregionen. Heutzutage wird angenommen, dass Riechstorungen den motorischen\r\nStorungen etwa 4‐6 Jahre vorausgehen.\r\nBei Personen, die eine idiopathische olfaktorische Storung aufweisen‐ eine\r\nRiechstorung mit unklarer Ursache, muss immer mit einem hoheren Risiko fur die\r\nspatere Entwicklung einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung, vor allem eines\r\nidiopathischen Parkinson‐Syndroms oder einer Alzheimer‐Demenz gerechnet werden.\r\nIn diesen Fallen sollten bei Auffalligkeiten in der Anamnese und der arztlichen\r\nUntersuchung neurologische Tests erfolgen. Hier empfehlen sich besonders die\r\nMagnetresonanztomographie (MRT) und die Single‐Photonen‐Emissions‐\r\nComputertomographie‐Untersuchung (SPECT).\r\nEine wichtige Rolle spielen Riechtests ebenfalls in der fruhen Differentialdiagnose\r\nneurodegenerativer Erkrankungen. Da Patienten mit progressiver supranuklearer\r\nBlickparese (PSP) und kortikobasaler Degeneration (CBD) keine Beeintrachtigung des\r\nRiechvermogens aufweisen und Patienten, die an Multisystematrophie (MSA) leiden\r\nnur eine leichte Hyposmie zeigen, kann man dadurch zwischen diesen Krankheiten und\r\ndem idiopathischen Parkinson‐Syndrom differenzieren.\r\nMit Hilfe von psychophysischen Riechtests, die in der Fruh‐und Differenzialdiagnose\r\nneurologischer Erkrankungen sinnvoll eingesetzt werden konnen, kann man\r\nolfaktorische Storungen leicht, schnell und preisgunstig feststellen, wodurch eine\r\nfruhzeitige Erkennung einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung ermoglicht wird.",

Among the signs that help in the correct diagnosis of mental disorders caused by neurological pathology, their sudden occurrence on heteronomy soil with very variable and atypical for mental diseases of clinical manifestations, the absence of aggravated by mental illness (including family) history, resistance to the drugs commonly used in psychiatric pathology, the patient’s intake of drugs, among side effects which are mental disorders. In the diagnosis, the key is the correct assessment of neurological status, its dynamics, as well as confirmed by paraclinical research methods, in patients with neurological diseases, which in themselves can lead to the development of mental disorders. However, ignoring the features of mental disorders, the lack of a clinically adjusted approach to this category of patients, difficulties in highlighting the most significant symptoms, can lead to misdiagnosis. Therefore, it is so important to know not only the neurological manifestations of certain neurological diseases, but also to properly navigate their mental manifestations. To solve this problem, it is necessary to closely interact psychiatrists with neurologists. Only with this condition will it be possible to effectively help the patient.",

Nerve biopsies are indicated if the diagnosis has not been made with clinical and electrophysiologic studies and other methods, and should only be performed in laboratories with appropriate techniques for the study of the nerve. It is important to know the normal development of the nerve, the thickness of the myelin sheath and the distribution of small and large fibers, according to the age. The main morphological aspects of the most frequent neuropathies in children - acquired (inflammatory, demyelinating) and hereditary (sensory-motor, sensory-autonomic, ataxic, and those associated with metabolic and degenerative disorders), are reviewed.",

This review presents diagnostic clues for physicians and neurologists without specialist competence in neuromuscular disorders. Diagnostic procedure of polyneuropathy include cerebrospinal fluid examination, electrophysiological examinations, and sural nerve biopsy. Although pathologic examinations using biopsied sural nerve rarely reach specific diagnosis and are recently seem to be underestimated, careful scrutiny of the morphology of each myelinated nerve fiber as well as evaluation of clinical/pathological correlation may be powerful tools to reach proper diagnosis. Polyneuropathy presents symmetric motor and sensory impairment with gloves and stockings distribution. This characteristic clinical presentation is based on two different types of pathophysiology. One, neuronal malfunction which leads to inability in keeping homeostasis of axonal endings; the other, the sum of scattered focal lesions throughout the peripheral nervous system: longer axons have more chances to get local injuries. The former pathomechanism is shared by most of hereditary neuropathies and toxic neuropathies, and the latter includes inflammatory neuropathies as well as some vasculitic neuropathy, and possibly, diabetic neuropathy. Hence, we should keep in mind that the exact lesion site does not necessarily present at sural nerve, especially in inflammatory neuropathies and vasculitic neuropathies.",

Although they affect most individuals who develop dementia, no medicines have yet been approved in the US for treatment of dementia-related behavioural and emotional problems. Agitation and aggression are the symptoms most likely to require medical intervention. Rates of major depression are markedly increased in dementia patients. Apathy is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome in dementia patients. Psychotic symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations are remarkably disruptive to the lives and relationships of people with dementia. Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been linked to abnormalities of acetylcholine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and dopamine systems. Antidepressant, antipsychotic, anti-epileptic, and anti-adrenergic medications have modest effects on some neuropsychiatric symptoms, but all are associated with significant risks. Further study of neuropsychiatric symptoms will contribute substantially to our understanding of the neurochemistry, anatomy, and treatment of cognitive disorders.",

Clinically, as well as the classic features of akinesia, rigidity and often rest tremor, patients may present a wide range of other symptoms including pain, other sensory symptoms, impaired olfaction, personality change, mild executive cognitive deficits, dementia and depression, an extraordinary richness of symptoms and signs rendered even more extraordinary by the long-term effects of drug treatment. While there may be little difficulty recognizing typical cases of IPD, there has been, at least until recently, a considerable misdiagnosis rate in both atremulous (confusion with ageing, vascular disease, multiple system atrophy (MSA) or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)) and tremulous (confusion with essential tremor (ET), dystonic tremor, and MSA) forms. However, increasing awareness of the clinical features of all these conditions, together with adherence to exacting diagnostic criteria, is leading to improved diagnosis, which is crucial for patients (who want to know what the future holds for them), for their treatment (giving them the right drug and not the wrong one) and for research (since all the different diseases above have different aetiologies and pathology).",

      "abstract": "Une toxicomanie n'est-elle qu'un symptome parmi d'autres possibles d'un trouble psychique plus profond ou bien constitue-t-elle une maladie, une entite nosologique a part entiere ? La reponse n'est pas simple et ne va pas de soi. Cette meme question fut jadis posee a propos de l'epilepsie et de la crise epileptique avant qu'on ne rejette celles-ci dans les enclos d'une certaine neurologie reductionniste (toute neurologie ne l'etant pas necessairement). Pour ce qui concerne la toxicomanie, les auteurs ne sont pas d'accord entre eux. Certains auteurs ne voient dans la prise de produit qu'un symptome clinique relevant d'une problematique soit psychotique, soit nevrotique, soit perverse. D'autres, au contraire, croient pouvoir reperer et decrire une organisation psychopathologique specifique de la toxicomanie (Geberovich). Szondi pose avec son schema pulsionnel un premier jalon de reponse. Ainsi, son facteur epileptique (e), en tant qu'il constitue une categorie psychiatrique (Schotte), est la pour nous indiquer que l'epilepsie revele pathoanalytiquement un probleme anthropologique universel, constitutif de l'humain, ainsi que Freud l'avait deja explicite dans son analyse de la crise epileptique, probleme genialement souleve bien avant lui par Dostoievski dans son roman Crime et Châtiment : a-t-on ou non le droit de tuer son prochain et/ou de se supprimer soi-meme ? Le genie de Szondi est de nous avoir fourni le radical pulsionnel irreductible qui se trouve au travail dans l'epilepsie comme dans tout questionnement ethique : la tendance cainesque a (se) tuer : e-. Mais revenons au probleme nosographique pose par la toxicomanie. Dans la perspective d'une nosographie structurale articulant des categories et ne juxtaposant pas simplement des classes (Schotte), Szondi se montre, en matiere de toxicomanie, aussi eclairant qu'il l'avait ete pour la question de l'epilepsie. En effet, son schema pulsionnel affirme l'existence du facteur maniaque (m) qui renvoie a la fois a la manie de la maniaco-depression (Manie) et a celle de la toxico-manie (Suchtigkeit). Dans son traite de pathologie pulsionnelle (Triebpathologie, pp. 415-431), Szondi decrit la pathogenese specifique de la toxicomanie et il en isole le radical pulsionnel universel : m+, la tendance a s'accrocher, tendance pulsionnelle qui ne concerne pas seulement les toxicomanes toujours preoccupes, comme ils le disent eux-memes, de decrocher du produit. Cette tendance pulsionnelle a s'accrocher a tout ce qui nous supporte, et nous permet de nous supporter, est a l'oeuvre dans tout homme car tout homme est toujours confronte a la question de la separation, la vie etant ainsi faite comme l'ecrit Rilke a : So leben wir und nehmen immer Abschied (Ainsi vivons-nous, toujours pris dans l'adieu). Bref, pour Szondi, la toxicomanie peut constituer une maladie a part entiere dont la portee ou la teneur anthropologique concerne tout un chacun a des degres divers.",

The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by slow movement (bradykinesia), tremors, and muscle stiffness. These symptoms occur due to the degeneration of dopamine- producing neurons in the substantia nigra region of the brain, leading to reduced dopamine levels. The development of Parkinson's Disease (PD) involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. PD is associated with abnormal regulation of the monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzyme. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) are an important class of drugs used to treat PD and other neurological disorders. In the early stages of PD, monotherapy with MAO-B inhibitors has been shown to be both safe and effective. These inhibitors are also commonly used as adjuncts in long-term disease management, as they can improve both motor and non-motor symptoms, reduce \"OFF\" periods, and potentially slow disease progression. However, current MAO-B inhibitors come with side effects like dizziness, nausea, vomiting, light-headedness, and fainting. Therefore, accelerating the development of new MAO-B inhibitors with fewer side effects is crucial. This review explores natural compounds that may inhibit monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), focusing on key findings from the past seven years. It highlights the most effective heterocyclic compounds against MAO-B, including thiazolyl hydrazone, pyridoxine-resveratrol, pyridazine, isoxazole, oxadiazole, benzothiazole, benzoxazole, coumarin, caffeine, pyrazoline, piperazine, piperidine, pyrrolidine, and morpholine derivatives. The review covers in vitro, in silico, and in vivo data, along with the structure- activity relationship of these compounds. These findings offer valuable insights for the development of more effective MAO-B inhibitors and advancements in Parkinson's disease research.",

      "title": "Genetic Imaging of Neuroinflammation in Parkinson’s Disease: Recent Advancements",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative aging disorders characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms due to the selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. The decreased viability of DA neurons slowly results in the appearance of motor symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia, resting tremor, and postural instability. These symptoms largely depend on DA nigrostriatal denervation. Pharmacological and surgical interventions are the main treatment for improving clinical symptoms, but it has not been possible to cure PD. Furthermore, the cause of neurodegeneration remains unclear. One of the possible neurodegeneration mechanisms is a chronic inflammation of the central nervous system, which is mediated by microglial cells. Impaired or dead DA neurons can directly lead to microglia activation, producing a large number of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytotoxic factors contribute to the apoptosis and death of DA neurons, and the pathological process of neuroinflammation aggravates the primary morbid process and exacerbates ongoing neurodegeneration. Therefore, anti-inflammatory treatment exerts a robust neuroprotective effect in a mouse model of PD. Since discovering the first mutation in the α-synuclein gene (SNCA), which can cause disease-causing, PD has involved many genes and loci such as LRRK2, Parkin, SNCA, and PINK1. In this article, we summarize the critical descriptions of the genetic factors involved in PD’s occurrence and development (such as LRRK2, SNCA, Parkin, PINK1, and inflammasome), and these factors play a crucial role in neuroinflammation. Regulation of these signaling pathways and molecular factors related to these genetic factors can vastly improve the neuroinflammation of PD.",

      "abstract": "Some tropical diseases are the direct cause of severe disturbances of cerebral function while others affect only finer cerebral systems controlling fears, anxiety and personality traits. The mechanisms by which psychiatric symptoms are produced in tropical disorders are not any different from the mechanisms that relate to any physical disorders. Neuropsychiatric symptoms may be caused by a number of different mechanisms including bacterial toxins, release of cytokines, hyperthermia, shock (poor perfusion), acute renal insufficiency, pulmonary failure (shock lung), coagulopathy, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and/or the nest of pathogens into the central nervous system. The following tropical illnesses can be associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms: neurocysticercosis, malaria, trypanosomiasis, dengue, and schistosomiasis. Neurological and psychiatric impairments induced by tropical diseases both represent a major category of invalidating disorders, which cause profound changes in the nervous system functions, often associated with severe sequels or late-onset disturbances. It is therefore important to disseminate knowledge of the neuropsychiatric symptoms accompanying tropical diseases in order to increase the awareness of these problems and challenges.",

Core features include abnormal movement and posture due to impairments in coordination and/or muscle tone. CP is not an etiologic diagnosis. Rather, it is a descriptive term based on an individual's clinical picture. Among children diagnosed with CP, there is great heterogeneity with respect to etiology, type of impairment, and severity of impairment. Brain disturbances that lead to CP may occur prenatally, perinatally, or in the young child during brain development and maturation. Although the brain disturbances leading to CP are not progressive, the clinical picture is not static. Clinical features of CP evolve with time, development, learning, motor training, and therapy. The disorder can potentially lead to poor growth of a limb, contractures and poor range of motion, pain secondary to spasticity, inability to complete voluntary movements, neglect of a limb, inability to complete activities of daily living, and poor participation in the community.",

      "abstract": "Although the majority of epileptics who are well controlled on medication do not show significant evidence of psychopathology, a subset of epileptics have serious psychiatric disturbances. Risk factors for the development of psychopathology appear to include poorly-controlled seizures, a long duration of seizure disorder with onset in childhood, seizure focus in the temporal lobe, bilateral or multiple discharges on EEG, and structural lesions. All of these factors appear to put the patient at greater risk of brain dysfunction, possibly because of the disruption of limbic functions associated with behavior and personality. The onset of seizures in childhood is likely to affect the development of personality and social functioning adversely. Although not a focus of this article, premorbid personality, psychologic reactions to having epilepsy, and the social problems accompanying the disease are likely to contribute greatly to the development of psychopathology. The development of psychiatric disorders in epilepsy thus appears to be a complex, multifactorial process. No single factor, such as seizure type, EEG findings, lateralization, pathology, or demographic variables is likely to be explanatory. Recent research has focused on accounting for many of these factors, and future investigations should shed further light on why some epileptics develop psychiatric problems and how best to treat these disorders.",

      "abstract": "Possible underlying organic causes of psychiatric symptoms can be overlooked in the clinical setting. It is important to increase awareness amongst psychiatric and neurological professionals with regard to certain inborn errors of metabolism as, in some cases, disease-specific therapies are available that can, for instance, treat underlying metabolic causes. The following article describes the basic pathophysiology, clinical and neurological features, and available diagnostic procedures of six treatable metabolic diseases that are associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms: Wilson's disease, cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, porphyrias, homocysteinemia, urea cycle disorders, and Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C). NP-C is taken as a particularly relevant example because, while it is traditionally considered to be a condition that presents with severe neurological and systemic manifestations in children, an increasing number of patients are being detected who have the adolescent- or adult-onset form, which is frequently associated with neuropsychiatric signs. A notable proportion of adult-onset cases have been reported where NP-C has mistakenly been diagnosed and treated as a psychiatric condition, usually based on patients' initial presentation with psychotic or schizophrenia-like symptoms. Underlying organic causes of psychiatric disorders such as psychosis should be considered among patients with atypical symptoms and/or resistance to standard therapy. Alongside improved frameworks for additional multidisciplinary diagnostic work in patients with suspected organic disease, the development of convenient and affordable biochemical screening and/or diagnostic methods has enabled new ways to narrow down differential diagnoses.",

Neurotransmission changes may show up in several ways on the clinical level. They also have endocrinological correlations, since the neurotransmission systems implicated in the nociception disorders share transmitters with the regulation system operating at the pituitary level. In this sense, nocipathies exhibit analogies and may be compared to disorders of motricity and behaviour that also show endocrine changes that may be likewise explained. Though specifically different in each instance, the neurotransmission alteration that is a common denominator of these disorders allows comparisons, especially in those situations, such as the nocipathic and behavioural ones, where correlations are relevant on clinical and interpretative grounds.",

      "title": "New symptoms in a patient with diagnosed porphyria – untypical clinical course or another disease? Extended differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Acute liver porphyrias are caused by mutations of genes encoding the heme biosynthesis enzymes. A lack of any of these enzymes leads to a decrease in the heme level, which in each case is manifested by identical clinical symptoms. Nervous tissue is particularly susceptible to a depletion of heme levels. Three classical symptoms of a porphyria attack include: abdominal pain (as a manifestation of autonomic neuropathy), peripheral neuropathy, and psychic disturbances. Apart from the main symptoms, porphyria attacks may be manifested as various neurological disturbances, such as: bulbar palsy, epileptic seizures, psychic disturbances and focal symptoms of CNS damage. The intensity of individual symptoms can vary. Although neurological symptoms usually disappear after the attack, they may cause permanent deficits. Through involving CNS, porphyria can mimic other neurological disorders. Damage to the nervous system can be confirmed by additional examinations. Thus far, disseminated focal changes during the attack, which disappear after the regression of clinical symptoms, have been described in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain. Spinal cord abnormalities in MRI scans have not been described yet, despite the fact that damage to the anterior horn associated with porphyria has been confirmed in literature. While examining cerebrospinal fluid during the attack, an elevated protein level has been noticed, so far without the presence of oligoclonal bands. This paper aimed to demonstrate that porphyria should be considered in differential diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and multiple sclerosis (MS). This paper is based on the case of a symptomatic patient who carried a mutation in one of the genes for porphyria, and who developed a clinical manifestation of focal damage to CNS. A differential diagnosis of porphyria and CIS, with a subsequent conversion to a clinically defined MS, was carried out. The results of additional examinations performed routinely in both disorders, the clinical picture and data from medical literature have been used in the analysis of this case. The authors present the case of a patient with confirmed genetic porphyria, who was hospitalized for purposes of establishing a diagnosis due to weakened lower extremities. The patient manifested spastic lower extremity paresis, sensation disorders and urinary incontinence, which indicated spinal cord damages. An MRI scan of the thoracic spine revealed disseminated foci with contrast enhancement. A high level of proteins and oligoclonal bands were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid. On the basis of a new clinical picture (differing from the previous attack symptoms), prolonged symptoms, spinal cord lesions in MRI, and the presence of oligoclonal bands, CIS was diagnosed. Quick and complete recovery was obtained due to the administering of a steroid therapy. After several months, the patient reported a similar, passing episode, which, according to the authors, confirmed the diagnosis and an expected conversion to a clinically defined MS. Taking into consideration the clinical manifestation of spinal cord involvement untypical of porphyria, the detection of spinal lesions in an MRI scan, the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid and the positive effect of steroid therapy, the authors believe that this described patient, who was a symptomatic carrier of a mutation in a gene for porphyria, developed CIS. This reported case, supported by data from medical literature, shows that porphyria should be taken into consideration in any differential diagnosis of CIS and MS.",

Some autonomic neuropathies are of acute onset, but most are chronic and of gradual onset. Diseases that primarily affect small fibers in peripheral nerves or cause acute demyelination of small myelinated fibers are those most likely to cause autonomic dysfunction. Conditions that cause severe autonomic dysfunction include acute dysautonomia, familial and primary amyloidosis.

      "abstract": "Nail tic disorders are fairly under-recognized and under-diagnosed nail disorders. Tic disorders are characterized by multiple sudden, rapid, recurrent, and non-rhythmic movements (motor tics) or utterances (vocal tics), or both. They fall under the category of neuropsychiatric disorders. Tic disorders pertaining to nails, also known as compulsive nail disorders, include onychophagia, habit tic deformity, onychotillomania, perionychotillomania, onychotemnomania, onychotieromania, onychodaknomania, bidet nails, and others. Onychophagia, onychotillomania, and habit tic are the most common nail tic disorders where the patient has a habit of nail biting and nail picking, respectively. Nail tic disorders are not only limited to cosmetic disfigurement of the nail, but may be associated with psychopathological states that can affect patient's quality of life. Each such case should be addressed with a detailed history, physical examination, and psychiatric evaluation in selected cases. Diagnosis is based on history and clinical examination but histopathology may be required in special circumstances. Management includes both non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities. Proper counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy play an important role in the management. The choice of pharmacological agent depends on the type of nail tic disorder and its severity.",

      "title": "Psychomotor Epilepsy in Childhood",
      "abstract": "The most poorly understood and most frequently misdiagnosed seizure state of childhood is psychomotor epilepsy. Difficulties in diagnosis are related to the variety of possible clinical manifestations which characteristically differ from one child to another. In addition, psychomotor epilepsy can occur at any age, even during infancy. Therefore, the child's ability to verbalize the perceptive and affective sensations of this seizure state is obviously limited by his chronologic age. The diagnostic dilemma is further complicated as physicians tend to confuse psychomotor seizures and petit ma! epilepsy. INCIDENCE AND ETIOLOGY The terms psychomotor and temporal lobe epilepsy are often used synonymously and interchangeably. At times the seizure state may also be called uncinate epilepsy, epileptic automatisms or epileptic fuges. However, not all psychomotor seizures are associated with temporal lobe lesions, nor is temporal lobe pathology always productive of psychomotor epilepsy. Abnormalities and electrical foci from areas other than the temporal lobe can produce this seizure state. For these reasons, the term psychomotor epilepsy is preferred, and temporal lobe epilepsy, if used, should be restricted to those psychomotor seizures that result from primary temporal lobe pathology. Ten to 20% of children in most pediatric seizure clinics have psychomotor epilepsy. Focal lesions are often considered to be the responsible etiologic factor, but diffuse encephalopathies, above all in children, are more commonly encountered. Prolonged febrile convulsions, perinatal trauma and hypoxia, craniocerebral trauma or meningoencephalitis can be the specific etiologic condition. Expansive lesions including neoplasms, vascular malformations, cysts and abscesses must be considered, especially when there is clinical or electrical evidence of a focal lesion.",

Several cognitive deficits can be observed in nondemented patients with PD during their history. The core symptom in the cognitive deficits in PD is the executive dysfunction. Neuropsychological tests such as Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, Trail Making Test are used to measure the degree of this dysfunction. Executive dysfunction is thought related to abnormalities in the dorsolateral prefrontal circuit which largely passes through the caudate nucleus. The dysfunction emerges as the pathology spreads to the nigrocaudate project corresponding to Hoehn & Yahr stage II-III. Effective therapy for cognitive dysfunction in PD remains elusive, however donepezil, Attention Process Training, Music therapy and Transcranial magnetic stimulation have been reported to have partial efficacy.",

      "title": "Aberrant Hippocampal Neuroregenerative Plasticity in Schizophrenia: Reactive Neuroblastosis as a Possible Pathocellular Mechanism of Hallucination",
      "abstract": "Hallucination is a sensory perception that occurs in the absence of external stimuli during abnormal neurological disturbances and various mental diseases. Hallucination is recognized as a core psychotic symptom and is particularly more prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia. Strikingly, a significant number of subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and other neurological diseases like cerebral stroke and epileptic seizure also experience hallucination. While aberrant neurotransmission has been linked to the neuropathogenic events of schizophrenia, the precise cellular mechanism accounting for hallucinations remains obscure. Neurogenesis is a cellular process of producing new neurons from the neural stem cells (NSC)-derived neuroblasts in the brain that contribute to the regulation of pattern separation, mood, olfaction, learning, and memory in adulthood. Impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the adult brain has been linked to stress, anxiety, depression, and dementia. Notably, many neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the mitotic and functional activation of neuroblasts and cell cycle re-entry of mature neurons leading to a drastic alteration in neurogenic process, known as reactive neuroblastosis. Considering their neurophysiological properties, the abnormal integration of neuroblasts into the existing neural network or withdrawal of their connections can lead to abnormal synaptogenesis, and neurotransmission. Eventually, this would be expected to result in altered perception accounting for hallucination. Thus, this article emphasizes a hypothesis that aberrant neurogenic processes at the level of reactive neuroblastosis could be an underlying mechanism of hallucination in schizophrenia and other neurological diseases.",

      "title": "F1‐01‐02: Tackling overlap of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and other dementias: Toward a unified approach to evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

      "abstract": "Corticobasal degeneration is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disease and a member of the 'parkinsonian' group of disorders, which also includes Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. The most common initial symptom is limb clumsiness, usually affecting one side of the body, with or without accompanying rigidity or tremor. Subsequently, the disease affects gait and there is a slow progression to influence ipsilateral arms and legs. Apraxia and dementia are the most common cortical signs. Corticobasal degeneration can be difficult to distinguish from other parkinsonian syndromes but if ocular signs and symptoms are present, they may aid clinical diagnosis. Typical ocular features include increased latency of saccadic eye movements ipsilateral to the side exhibiting apraxia, impaired smooth pursuit movements and visuo-spatial dysfunction, especially involving spatial rather than object-based tasks. Less typical features include reduction in saccadic velocity, vertical gaze palsy, visual hallucinations, sleep disturbance and an impaired electroretinogram. Aspects of primary vision such as visual acuity and colour vision are usually unaffected. Management of the condition to deal with problems of walking, movement, daily tasks and speech problems is an important aspect of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Migraine is a complex neurological disorder with a well-documented genetic basis. Migraine is a product of allelic variation in genes of neurological, vascular and hormonal origin interacting with environmental triggers. Presentation can include attacks of head pain with symptoms of nausea, emesis, photophobia, phonophobia, and occasionally, visual sensory disturbances, known as aura. Migraine pain is difficult to ignore, associated with a deep sense of malaise and manifests as a throbbing, pulsatile headache, localized to one side of the head that intensifies with physical activity and that can last from 4-72 hours. Migraine is diagnosed according to criteria developed by the International Headache Society (IHS) and is subdivided into two main types based on the occurrence of aura symptoms that may be present in the early stages of the headache: migraine with aura (MA) and migraine without aura (MO). The majority (about 70%) of migraineurs are diagnosed with the MO subtype whilst the remaining 30% experience MA accompanied by neurological symptoms that manifest as fully reversible, visual, sensory and/or dysphasic speech disturbances in conjunction with their headache. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) and over-excitation of glutamate receptors is regarded as a contributing factor, through various mechanisms, to the pathology of migraine. In this chapter we present an overview of the pathophysiology and co-morbidity of migraine with other psychiatric disorders and discuss the role of the glutamatergic system in migraine, its molecular components as potential drug targets, in addition to the current treatments and progress of modulators of glutamatergic signaling.",

It is predominantly a motor disorder but has shown to present with psychosis in few cases. Psychotic symptoms result from chronic treatment with few anti- Parkinson’s medications, ranging from depression, delusions to visual hallucinations, eventually progressing to auditory hallucinations in a few cases. Presence of psychotic symptoms with loss of insight is indicative of late stage of Parkinson’s disease and has poor prognosis. Accurate diagnosis of symptoms can be difficult due to significant overlapping clinical presentations which can be an admixture of underlying disease, exacerbation of pre-existing psychiatric illness or iatrogenic. The article below portrays the complex interplay between Parkinson’s disease psychosis, medications and underlying disease process which heralds early identification of the symptoms using diagnostic tools and imaging techniques to improve the health of individuals and the community by “translating” findings into diagnostic tools and medicines. It also highlights the dire need to develop neuroprotective drugs as a mode of primary prevention of psychosis. We cannot underemphasize the need to educate the patient and caregiver to seek medical attention at earliest for prompt identification and application of disease modifying therapies to reduce disability and morbidity associated with it and limit nursing home placements",

      "abstract": "Various grades of cognitive impairment generally occur in older adults over the age of 55, where cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and/or hypertension, coronary artery disease, or cerebrovascular accidents are also common. Cognitive impairment occurs in various forms, from mild or amnesia such as forgetting today's date to more ominous and progressive forms, such as frank dementia. Over 5 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, most of whom live in low- and middle-income countries. It has been envisaged from the beginning that dementia or cognitive impairment has neurodegenerative origins. However, recent studies have indicated that dementia may have a mixed origin or may be preceded by vascular insult and then neurodegenerative pathology. From a pathophysiological standpoint, one of the puzzling questions in the field of cognitive impairment and comorbidities is that it is not clear whether cardiovascular comorbidity or cognitive impairment comes first. Cognitive impairment negatively affects mobility and fitness and this can potentially contribute to development of hypertension or/and diabetes. The present review examines this perplexing situation and tries to anser whether the comorbid conditions are innocent bystanders to cognitive impairment or they play greater causative roles. The rationale of the review is that it is possible to address these cardiovascular risk factors for dementia prevention and hence it summarizes the evidence related to cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive impairment.",

Njegovi simptomi mogu se odraziti na govornom, psihičkom, fiziološkom i socijalnom planu. Neurogeno mucanje, kao stečeni oblik mucanja, rjeđe je i manje poznato područje, čije netečnosti nastaju kao posljedica oštećenja mozga, s moždanim udarom kao najčešćim uzrokom. Cilj ovog rada je, na osnovi novije literature, dati uvid u poznate etiološke čimbenike, simptomatologiju, diferencijalnu dijagnostiku te trenutne metode intervencije kod neurogenog mucanja. Mehanizam nastanka nije u potpunosti razjašnjen, ali brojni autori potvrđuju ulogu oštećenja bazalnih ganglija kod pojave mucanja. Često koegzistira s poremećajima poput afazije i motoričkih govornih poremećaja - dizartrije, apraksije i palilalije - što dodatno otežava dijagnostiku. Osim teškoća prilikom diferencijalne dijagnostike, zbog prisutnosti drugih poremećaja ima nesuglasica prilikom diferenciranja tipova mucanja, s obzirom na mišljenje da uočljivi simptomi nisu dovoljan distinktivni kriterij. U terapiji mucanja najčešće se primjenjuju bihevioralne metode, dok su lijekovi prisutni u manjoj mjeri zbog nuspojava i mogućnosti zlouporabe. Za detaljnije objašnjenje navedenog poremećaja potrebna su dalja istraživanja.",

Axonal polyneuropathies are most commonly associated with diabetes, alcohol, or toxins, including side effects of medication. Demyelinating polyneuropathies, as a whole, are much less common and can be acute or chronic, and idiopafhic or associated with a monoclonal gammopathy. Finally, hereditary neuropathies, including the various forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, have similar but somewhat distinct characteristics compared with acquired forms of polyneuropathy. Nerve conduction studies, and, to some extent, needle eletromyography (EMG), can assist with the evaluation of polyneuropathies, and can help to shorten the differential diagnosis regarding potential causes.",

Die Formen motorischer Auffalligkeiten variieren in Phanomenologie, Verlauf und Pathophysiologie, sodass man von mehreren zugrundeliegenden Mechanismen ausgehen muss. Einzelne Symptome haben in bestimmten Erkrankungsstadien pradiktiven Wert fur den Verlauf. Motorische Auffalligkeiten wie Parkinsonismus oder neurologische Soft Signs sind beispielweise mit schlechterer Ausfuhrung von Handgesten, aber auch mit schlechterer Wahrnehmung nonverbaler sozialer Stimuli assoziiert. Storungen der Handgestik als Einschrankungen in der nonverbalen Kommunikation sagen wiederum niedrigeres soziales Funktionsniveau und mehr Negativsymptomatik im Verlauf von 6 Monaten vorher. Einzelnen motorischen Phanomenen und auch der gestorten Gestenproduktion liegen Storungen in motorischen Hirnnetzwerken zugrunde. Relevant sind hier vor allem fronto-parietale Verbindungen sowie Verbindungen zwischen Thalamus und primar sowie sekundar motorischen Kortexarealen. Mittels nicht-invasiver Hirnstimulationsmethoden lassen sich diese motorische Netzwerke prinzipiell modulieren. Erste Ergebnisse einer rTMS Studie weisen darauf hin, dass insbesondere inhibitorische Stimulation des supplementar-motorischen Areals uber 3 Wochen die psychmotorische Verlangsamung zu verbessern vermag. Solche Interventionsstudien sind ebenfalls denkbar zur Verbesserung der Gestenproduktion oder feinmotorischer/koordinativer Storungen bei Schizophrenie. Die motorische Dimension der Erkrankung ist objektiv gut erfassbar, relevant fur die Klinik und potentiell veranderbar durch Hirnstimulationsmethoden.",

The parkinsonian syndromes are the most common cause of paucity of movement; other hypokinetic disorders represent only a small group of patients.

      "abstract": "Background: Leigh disease[1], also termed as Sub Acute Necrotising Encephalopathy (SNP) is a rare, inheritable, progressive neurodegenerative disorder with characteristic pathological features usually presenting in infancy or early childhood. It was first reported in 1951 by Denis Leigh[2], a British neuro pathologist, in a 7 month old infant that progressed rapidly and resulted in death over a 6 week period. Clinically, Leigh disease is characterized by psychomotor delay or regression, muscular hypotonia, brainstem signs (especially strabismus, nystagmus and swallowing difficulties) & ataxia. In late stages pyramidal signs & respiratory insufficiency occurs. In most cases, dysfunction of the respiratory chain enzymes is responsible for the disease. There are several known genetically determined causes of Leigh disease: pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, complex I or II deficiency, complex IV (COX) deficiency, complex V (ATPase) deficiency, and deficiency of coenzyme Q10[1]. These defects may occur sporadically or be inherited by autosomal recessive transmission, as in the case of COX deficiency; by X-linked transmission, as in the case of pyruvate dehydrogenase E1α deficiency; or by maternal transmission, as in complex V (ATPase 6 nt 8993 mutation) deficiency. About 30% of cases are due to mutations in mtDNA[1]. Despite its considerable clinical, genetic and biochemistry heterogeneity, the basic neuro pathological features in children affected are almost identical; which are focal, bilateral, and symmetric necrotic lesions associated with demyelination, vascular proliferation and gliosis in the brainstem, diencephalon, basal ganglia, and cerebellum[1]. It is possible to come to a diagnosis of SNE on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms, mode of inheritance, metabolic abnormalities, and neuro imaging findings[4]. We report a rare case which presented clinically as a neurodegenerative disorder and diagnosed as Leigh disease on MRI.",

In both a group of twin volunteers and a group of patients with panic disorder/agoraphobia, the lifetime experience of more than one diagnosis of a neurotic syndrome was common but there was no evidence of patterns of co-occurrence of diagnoses being associated with particular syndromes. Receiving a diagnosis was associated with abnormal scores on measures of neuroticism and locus of control, the extent of the abnormality increasing with the number of different diagnoses satisfied. It is argued that the concept of a general neurotic syndrome depends in part on the presence of such predisposing personality factors, and that reduction in this predisposition to neurosis should be the focus of treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons associated with rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia, and postural instability. In addition to the above motor symptoms, nonmotor manifestations are increasingly recognized as part of Parkinson's disease pathology and contribute to overall symptom burden, morbidity, and mortality. Such nonmotor symptoms include autonomic dysfunction, impaired olfaction, gastrointestinal disturbances, and a variety of psychiatric symptoms including psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms may be inherent to the disease process itself, secondary to treatments aimed at restoring dopamine, or related to comorbid mental illness. Given that traditional medications used to treat psychosis are dopaminergic antagonists, pharmacologic treatment of these symptoms carries the risk of worsening the movement disorder, creating a challenge for providers. This review examines current literature regarding psychosis in the context of Parkinson’s disease including risk factors for psychosis, prognosis, and management of these challenging symptoms.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a spectrum of neuropsychiatric deformities, characterized by hallucination, delusion, mood disorders, speech pathology, and neurocognitive deficits. Among various clinical manifestations, hallucination has been recognized as a core psychotic symptom that occurs more frequently in schizophrenia. A significant number of subjects with neurocognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and other neurological diseases like stroke and epileptic seizure also experience hallucinations. While aberrant neurotransmission has been linked to the neuropathogenic events of schizophrenia, the specific cellular mechanism contributing to hallucinations remains ambiguous. Neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of the brain has been identified as a predominant pathogenic determinant of dementia. While the scientific proof for the neurodegeneration in schizophrenia is limited, the occurrence of dementia in schizophrenia has become increasingly evident. To note, both neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and neuropsychiatric disorders display impaired neurogenesis in the brain. Impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus has been linked to dementia and mood disorders. Notably, the early phase of many neurodegenerative disorders has been characterized by reactive neuroblostosis and aberrant cell cycle activation in mature neurons leading to the fluctuation in neurogenic processes leading to abnormal synaptogenesis and neurotransmission in the brain. Thus, this article emphasizes a hypothesis that aberrant neurogenic processes could be an underlying mechanism of hallucination in schizophrenia and other neurological diseases.",

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Clinicians are commonly confronted with the differential diagnosis of altered mental status, impaired cognition and altered level of consciousness in hospitalized patients including those admitted to medical, geriatric, emergency, intensive and post-operative care units. Although delirium is the most common acute neuropsychiatric condition in the acute hospital setting this diagnosis is commonly delayed, made too late or missed altogether. Difficulties and importance of timely diagnosis The causes of delirious states are manifold. Both, direct damage to the brain tissue as well as encephalopathy as a result of other medical diseases, can be the cause of delirium. Depending on the predisposition delirious syndromes can be provoked by minor medical interventions. Clinical presentation is very variable, but remains largely independent of the triggering mechanisms. Purely catatonic, hypoactive, hyperactive and excitatory types as well as mixed forms can be distinguished. Immediate diagnosis of a delirious syndrome and rapid elucidation of its causes are keys for the implementation of curative therapy. There is a need to act fast because delirious phases are associated with significantly longer hospital stay and increased morbidity as a result of long-term cognitive deficits as well as increased mortality. As negative outcome is closely linked to the duration of a delirious episode, early diagnosis and rapid termination of the delirium constitute a significant positive predictor of outcome. In this respect, delirium represents an emergency, with or without concomitant cerebral or extracerebral symptoms.",

      "title": "The Development of Psychiatric Illness and Chemoprophylaxis of Botulinum Toxin in Migraine: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "A migraine is not just a headache. It is an extremely prevalent neurological condition marked by periodic episodes of unilateral headache, with more than 10 million cases yearly. Migraine often begins at the age of puberty. It substantially impacts the brain and, consequently, psychiatric behavior linked with frequent migraine attacks that may be moderate to severe in intensity. A crucial aspect of migraine variability is comorbidity with other neurological diseases, vascular diseases, and mental illnesses. Psychiatric disorders related to migraine include anxiety disorders, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, depression, etc. It is also estimated that people suffering from migraine are about five times more likely to develop depression than others without migraine. The stimulus for migraine is stress, lack of sleep, skipped meal or fasting, visual stimulation due to high intensity of light, auditory stimulus due to noise, and olfactory stimulus due to a pungent smell. A majority of patients suffer from migraine attacks triggered by noise, some due to visual stimulation, and a few due to perfumes or other odors that trigger their migraine. Diagnosis of this is primarily dependent on history taking and clinical evaluation. Migraine can be classified depending on whether an aura is present or absent. It can further be divided based on the frequency of headaches into episodic migraine or chronic migraine, which may be determined by the duration of the headache. The development of migraine is influenced by both genetics and the environment. It has a detrimental effect on children’s quality of life. A comprehensive analysis of psychiatric illnesses in migraine contributes to early diagnosis and proper treatment of the disease. Also, having a healthy lifestyle (including exercise, a balanced diet, and enough sleep) seems to prevent and improve the condition. Headache in migraine is resistant to medical treatment but responds well to botulinum toxin. This review primarily focuses on the psychiatric issues like depression and anxiety that often accompany migraine. The article also highlights the effects of botulinum toxin on migraine.",

      "title": "ATP1A3-Related Neurologic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders represent a clinical continuum in which at least three distinct phenotypes have been delineated: rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP); alternating hemiplegia of childhood (ACH); and cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss (CAPOS). However, some affected individuals have intermediate phenotypes or only a few features that do not fit well into one of these major phenotypes. RDP has been characterized by: abrupt onset of dystonia over days to weeks with parkinsonism (primarily bradykinesia and postural instability); common bulbar involvement; and absence or minimal response to an adequate trial of L-dopa therapy, with few exceptions. Often fever, physiologic stress, or alcoholic binges trigger the onset of symptoms. After their initial appearance, symptoms often stabilize with little improvement; occasionally second episodes occur with abrupt worsening of symptoms. Rarely, affected individuals have reported a more gradual onset of symptoms over weeks to months. Anxiety, depression, and seizures have been reported. Age of onset ranges from four to 55 years, although a childhood variation of RDP with onset between ages nine and 14 months has been reported. AHC is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome most frequently manifesting in infancy or early childhood with paroxysmal episodic neurologic dysfunction including alternating hemiparesis or dystonia, quadriparesis, seizure-like episodes, and oculomotor abnormalities. Episodes can last for minutes, hours, days, or even weeks. Remission of symptoms occurs with sleep and immediately after awakening. Over time, persistent neurologic deficits including oculomotor apraxia, ataxia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, parkinsonism, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction develop in the majority of those affected; more than 50% develop epilepsy in addition to their episodic movement disorder phenotype. CAPOS (cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss) syndrome is characterized by episodes of ataxic encephalopathy and/or weakness during and after a febrile illness. Onset is between ages six months and four years. Some acute symptoms resolve; progression of sensory losses and severity vary. Diagnosis/testing Diagnosis of an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder is established in an individual with the clinical features of RDP, AHC, or CAPOS syndrome and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A3. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment of visual disturbance, hearing loss, seizure disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy. Consideration of CPAP or BiPAP for those with sleep apnea. Those with severe dysphagia may require a gastrostomy tube. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy for motor dysfunction, ataxia, and dysarthria. Acute spasms may respond to chloral hydrate or other medication that induces sleep. Dystonia can be treated with benzodiazepines, dopamine agonists, or levo-dopa. Psychotherapy and standard pharmacotherapy for those with mood disorder or psychosis. Early referral for developmental support / special education. Prevention of primary manifestations: Prophylaxis for AHC episodes may include flunarizine, topiramate, a ketogenic diet, and sleep. A trial of high-dose benzodiazepines may be considered in individuals with RDP and AHC. Triggers that lead to acute attacks should be avoided. Prevention of secondary complications: When dystonia is present, physical therapy to prevent contractures in the hands and feet. Surveillance. Affected individuals should be monitored for the development of dysphagia (RDP and CAPOS syndrome), seizures (RDP and AHC), and psychiatric symptoms (RDP). Agents/circumstances to avoid: RDP. Triggers including alcohol, fever, psychological stress (e.g., childbirth), excessive exercise. AHC. Triggers including psychological stress / excitement; environmental stressors (e.g., bright light, excessive heat or cold, excessive sound, crowds); water exposure (e.g., bathing, swimming); certain foods or odors (e.g., chocolate, food dyes); missed meals; excessive or atypically strenuous exercise; illness; irregular sleep (missing a nap, delayed bedtime). CAPOS syndrome. Febrile illness, pregnancy. Pregnancy management: Affected pregnant women should be monitored for the development of symptoms of RDP. The number of pregnant women with RDP is small, but several reports of childbirth as a trigger have been noted. Exposure to anti-seizure medication may increase the risk to the fetus of adverse outcome; that risk, however, is often less than the risk to the fetus associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Discussion of the risks and benefits of using a given anti-seizure medication during pregnancy should ideally take place before conception. Genetic counseling ATP1A3-related neurologic disorders are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. ATP1A3 pathogenic variants may be inherited or occur de novo. In contrast to initial reports a familial history is not required for a diagnosis of RDP. In AHC, pathogenic variants are more commonly de novo than inherited; in both RDP and CAPOS syndrome both inherited and de novo pathogenic variants have been observed. Each child of an individual with an ATP1A3-related neurologic disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the ATP1A3 pathogenic variant in the family is known. The variability of presentation within a family with a known ATP1A3 pathogenic variant further complicates genetic counseling. Lifelong asymptomatic individuals who harbor a heterozygous ATP1A3 pathogenic variant have been reported in families with RDP.",

Patients often present with heterogeneous symptoms, reflecting the underlying complex nature of pathogenesis (1). Prevalent motor-related symptoms include bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability due in large part to the loss of pigmented, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). However, additional brain regions that influence cognitive decline and other psychiatric conditions are affected both prior and subsequent to neurodegeneration in the midbrain, an important factor when considering pathogenic mechanisms in PD (2). In sporadic disease, lesions first occur in the dorsal motor nucleus of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves and anterior olfactory nucleus. Gradually, nuclear grays and cortical areas become affected as the disease process in the brain stem follows an ascending course. Lesions then appear in the anteromedial temporal mesocortex and neocortex, with end-stage dysfunction in first-order sensory association/premotor areas and primary sensory and motor fields (3).",

      "title": "Origin of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

      "abstract": "Neural plasticity is considered the neurophysiological correlate of learning and memory, although several studies have also noted that it plays crucial roles in a number of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Indeed, impaired brain plasticity may be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlies both cognitive decline and major depression. Moreover, a degree of cognitive impairment is frequently observed throughout the clinical spectrum of mood disorders, and the relationship between depression and cognition is often bidirectional. However, most evidence for dysfunctional neural plasticity in depression has been indirect. Transcranial magnetic stimulation has emerged as a noninvasive tool for investigating several parameters of cortical excitability with the aim of exploring the functions of different neurotransmission pathways and for probing in vivo plasticity in both healthy humans and those with pathological conditions. In particular, depressed patients exhibit a significant interhemispheric difference in motor cortex excitability, an imbalanced inhibitory or excitatory intracortical neurochemical circuitry, reduced postexercise facilitation, and an impaired long-term potentiation-like response to paired-associative transcranial magnetic stimulation, and these symptoms may indicate disrupted plasticity. Research aimed at disentangling the mechanism by which neuroplasticity plays a role in the pathological processes that lead to depression and evaluating the effects of modulating neuroplasticity are needed for the field to facilitate more powerful translational research studies and identify novel therapeutic targets.",

The etiology could vary considerably ranging from self‐limited to chronic or even progressive disorders, the latter falling into encephalopathic pictures that need a prompt diagnosis. Beyond the etiological classification, others evaluate myoclonus' body distribution (i.e., clinical classification) or the location of the generator (i.e., neurophysiological classification); particularly, knowing the anatomical source of myoclonus gives inputs on the observable clinical patterns, such as EMG bursts duration or EEG correlate, and guides the therapeutic choices. Among all the chronic disorders, myoclonus often presents itself as a manifestation of epilepsy. In this context, myoclonus has many facets. Myoclonus occurs as one, or the only, seizure manifestation while it can also present as a peculiar type of movement disorder; moreover, its electroclinical features within specific genetically determined epileptic syndromes have seldom been investigated. In this review, following a meeting of recognized experts, we provide an up‐to‐date overview of the neurophysiology and nosology surrounding myoclonus. Through the dedicated exploration of epileptic syndromes, coupled with pragmatic guidance, we aim to furnish clinicians and researchers alike with practical advice for heightened diagnostic management and refined treatment strategies. Plain Language Summary In this work, we described myoclonus, a movement characterized by brief, shock‐like jerks. Myoclonus could be present in different diseases and its correct diagnosis helps treatment.",

The term is misleading, for it suggests that this diathesis is confined solely to the mentally afflicted, and, further, its precise meaning is vague. A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

It seems to make little or no difference whether the individual suffers from the mild or the severer type of convulsions, sooner or later he will show deterioration of the intellect, or the periodic occurrence of graver forms of insanity. Nevertheless, it may be stated as a general rule that the earlier the disease comes on, the greater the liability to mental deterioration and the more rapid the failure, while in those persons in whom the attacks begin in later years of life, the deteriorating process is much slower, owing to the stability of the nerve tracks acquired in infancy and youth. Epileptics who have had fits for years show a dimming of the reasoning faculties, defects of memory, alternations of character, a sinking to a lower plane of intelligence, and above all a tendency to impulsiveness and irritability. To this rule there are but infrequent exceptions. In many instances of the disease the epileptic is irritable even to violence, unmanageable, careless of the feelings of his family and friends, and is among the most difficult of mental cases to handle. As a general rule it may be stated that the more frequent the seizures, the more rapid the mental deterioration. There are, however, cases who have a great many attacks and who hold up mentally in a surprising manner in spite of the frequent assaults on the nervous system; again, there are cases with very infrequent seizures who deteriorate with great rapidity.",

Treatment strategies that have demonstrated to be efficacious in adults have been extrapolated to be use in pediatric age.",

      "abstract": "PLA2G6-dystonia-parkinsonism (PLAN-DP) is characterized by levodopa responsive parkinsonism and dystonia. While neuropsychiatric symptoms and early cognitive decline are also common in this entity there is little information regarding other non-motor symptoms (NMS). Here, we describe a 26-year-old patient with PLAN-DP whose motor symptoms were preceded by mild cognitive impairment and anxiety, and who developed many other NMS as the disease evolved. Furthermore, we reviewed the NMS described in all the PLAN-DP patients published to date. A total of 50 patients with PLAN-DP were identified, 42 of whom developed NMS and in 23 of these cases, NMS preceded the motor symptoms of the disease. Neuropsychiatric symptoms dominated the premotor phase of this condition and cognitive impairment/dementia was the most prevalent NMS. Other NMS were reported infrequently like sleep disorders, autonomic symptoms, pain and hyposmia, and mostly as the disease evolved. NMS are very frequent in PLAN-DP and they may appear before diagnosis or during the course of the disease. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline are the most frequent NMS. The appearance of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression, anxiety or personality changes prior to a diagnosis of parkinsonism in younger individuals might suggest the presence of PLA2G6 gene mutations.",

Autonomic and cognitive dysfunction are among the most prevalent of these nonmotor aspects of the disease. Although exact clinico-pathological correlations have not been established, α-synuclein pathology with Lewy body formation in the central and peripheral autonomic nervous system as well as in neocortical areas are generally believed to be driving factors for autonomic failure and cognitive decline in PD. Recent pathological and clinical studies have suggested greater prevalence of clinical dysautonomia and cardiac sympathetic denervation in PD dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies as compared with PD without dementia. This raises the possibility that spread of synuclein pathology to involve neocortical areas producing cognitive decline could be somehow linked to involvement of the autonomic nervous system in PD. © 2007 Movement Disorder Society",

      "title": "Champ 9 – états de mal épileptiques non convulsifs☆",
      "abstract": "Les états de mal non convulsifs et confusionnels sont classiquement séparés en deux formes, l’état d’absence (EA) et l’état de mal partiel complexe (EMPC). Le diagnostic est difficile sur la base des seuls éléments cliniques et nécessite un électroencéphalogramme (EEG) d’urgence. L’EA ou « petit mal status » est la forme la plus fréquente d’états de mal non convulsifs et confusionnels. Il est caractérisé par une confusion fluctuante, d’intensité variable, souvent associée à des myoclonies périoculaires. L’EEG montre des décharges critiques généralisées qui cèdent sous benzodiazépines alors que la conscience se normalise. Les EA possèdent une importante hétérogénéité nosographique. Quatre groupes peuvent être individualisés : EA typiques s’inscrivant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie généralisée idiopathique, EA atypiques survenant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie généralisée symptomatique ou cryptogénique, EA « de novo » de l’adulte caractérisés par des facteurs de provocation toxiques ou métaboliques, EA avec éléments focaux s’observant dans le cadre d’une épilepsie partielle préexistante. Les EMPC temporaux sont caractérisés par des décharges temporales continues ou récurrentes et peuvent être organisés de façon cyclique, cette présentation étant caractéristique mais rare. Ils nécessitent un traitement énergique en raison de leur résistance et du risque de séquelles cognitives. Les EMPC frontaux constituent un défi diagnostique. Ils sont en effet souvent inauguraux, de présentation clinique déroutante et symptomatiques d’une lésion focale dans un cas sur trois. Nonconvulsive confusional status epilepticus is classically divided on the basis of the ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) into absence status (AS) and complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). Based on clinical semiology alone, diagnosis is difficult and requires emergent EEG. AS is a polymorphic condition that can complicate many epileptic syndromes. Confusion of varying intensity is associated in half of the cases with bilateral periocular myoclonias. Clinical and EEG normalization is obtained after intravenous benzodiazepine injection. From a nosographic point of view, four types of AS may be recognized. Typical AS occurs as part of an idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Atypical AS occurs in patients with symptomatic or cryptogenic generalized epilepsies. “De novo” AS of late onset is characterized by toxic or metabolic precipitating factors in middle-aged subjects with no previous history of epilepsy. AS with focal characteristics occur in subjects with a preexisting or newly developing partial epilepsy, most often of extratemporal origin. Most cases are transitional forms between these four entities. CPSE is characterized by continuous or rapidly recurring complex partial seizures, which may involve temporal and/or extratemporal regions. Cyclic disturbance of consciousness characterizes CPSE of temporal lobe origin that requires vigorous treatment to prevent recurrence or cognitive sequelae. CPSE of frontal lobe origin is a diagnostic challenge: it is rare, symptoms are unusual and patients should be documented extensively. A focal frontal lesion is revealed in one third of cases.",

O prognostico das crises convulsivas e muito variavel, e em geral metade casos evolui de forma satisfatoria e a outra metade tem um risco maior para subsequente deficiencia intelectual, paralisia cerebral, epilepsia e morte. Por muitas decadas tem sido aceito que a etiologia das crises e o fator mais importante na predicao do prognostico do desenvolvimento neurologico, contudo ainda que persista a controversia se a crise neontais per se ou se outros fatores associados contribuem para o prognostico adverso, independentemente da etiologia. Este trabalho teve como objetivo investigar os fatores que contribuem para o prognostico adverso das crises neonatais e se as crises neonatais produzem efeitos neurologicos deleterios de longo prazo. Os estudos clinicos apontam que embora a etiologia subjacente as crises neonatais esteja relacionada com a gravidade do prognostico, outros fatores que incluiu a ultrasonografia craniana anormal, indice de resistencia anormal da arteria cerebral anterior, eletroencefalograma anormal, doenca cardiaca congenita e a semiologia das crises neonatais, aparecem tambem como um preditores independentes para o prognostico. Em modelos animais, as crises neonatais produzem prejuizos de longo prazo, tais como deficits na aprendizagem viso-espacial e na memoria de longo e curto prazo, prejuizo na flexibilidade cognitiva, aumento do estado de ansiedade, prejuizo no comportamento social e aumento da vulnerabilidade para a epileptogenese.

LATEST DEVELOPMENTS Peripheral neuropathy can be the predominant or only manifestation of certain nutrient deficiencies. Cognitive difficulties or involvement of other parts of the central nervous system, such as the optic nerve and spinal cord, may accompany nutritional peripheral neuropathies. In most patients, the nutritional deficiency may have a single predominant cause, but in some cases, multiple causes may coexist. Obesity, for unclear reasons, can be associated with nutrient deficiencies. The rising rates of bariatric surgery and the incidence of nutrient deficiencies following bariatric surgery make this a particularly relevant topic for neurologists. ESSENTIAL POINTS Neuropathies caused by nutrient deficiencies are preventable with appropriate supplementation in high-risk situations. Early recognition and prompt treatment are essential to ensure an optimal outcome and minimize neurologic morbidity.",

Particular etiologies at risk for seizures include ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke and traumatic brain injury. The use of prophylactic antiepileptic drug administration remains controversial in many situations, with most of the larger studies having used older antiepileptic drugs prophylactically. If seizures do occur, patients are typically treated with parenteral antiepileptic drugs. The duration of treatment is unknown in most situations, but it should be individualized depending on acute and monophasic injury versus chronic process. Late seizures, which occur after the first 2 weeks from the insult, have a more ominous risk for subsequent epilepsy and should be treated for extended periods of time or indefinitely. Electrolyte and glucose abnormalities and medications at high or low levels, when corrected, usually lead to seizure control. This review discusses the risk for seizures with commonly encountered types of brain injuries in the NICU and ends by examining the treatment algorithms for simple seizures and status epilepticus and the role newer antiepileptics may potentially play.",

Field loss # Appearance of retina, macula, and optic nerve In assessing a patient who has experienced an acute disturbance of vision in an uninflamed eye an accurate history is crucial, because it may be that a longstanding visual defect has only just been noticed by the patient. It is important to make this differentiation as this alters the range of diagnoses and the urgency of treatment. Acute visual disturbance of unknown cause requires urgent referral. In many cases the diagnosis may be made from the history. Symptoms of floaters or flashing lights suggest a vitreous detachment, a vitreous haemorrhage, or a retinal detachment. Horizontal field loss usually indicates a retinal vascular problem, whereas a vertical defect suggests an abnormality posterior to the optic chiasm. If there is central field loss (I can't see things in the centre) there may be a disorder at the macula. Associated symptoms such as headache may indicate giant cell arteritis or migraine. The visual acuity gives a strong clue to the diagnosis. A total lack of perception of light indicates complete occlusion of either the central retinal artery or the arteries supplying the head of the optic nerve. The nature of the field defect gives clues as outlined above. Obstruction of the red reflex on ophthalmoscopy suggests a vitreous haemorrhage, although the patient may have a pre-existing cataract. The appearances of the macula, remaining retina, and head of the optic nerve will indicate the diagnosis if there has been a haemorrhage or arterial or venous occlusion in these areas.",

Pathologically, there is a loss of nigrostriatal neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), which is believed to represent a middle stage of the degenerative process that starts in the lower brainstem and olfactory nuclei and ascends throughout the cortex (2). Neurochemically, the key feature relating to current therapeutics and nigral cell death is a loss of dopamine (3).",

There are many causes, some of which are unknown, but the common ones can be divided into three groups. Congenital developmental failure may be total and incompatible with life, or less severe, in which case resection may be possible. Acquired inflammatory damage, other than Chagas' disease, can occur anywhere in the gut. Autonomic neuropathy may involve either the neurons or the Schwann cells. The former is often due to drugs because the autonomic ganglia are outside the blood-brain barrier. The latter is frequently associated with metabolic disease, such as diabetes mellitus.",

Within little more than a decade, the subject which was thought to be associated with relatively few conditions, such as mongolism, cretinism, microcephaly and the like, has been shown by medical, genetical and psychiatric research to be significantly related to about 70 conditions. It is possible to arrange a list of these conditions, not necessarily complete, under three basic headings for the purpose of description: subcultural defects, instability defects and somatic defects. Subcultural defectives are characterized by intellectual inadequacy paralleled by a lower level of social development; unstable defectives are characterized by abnormal rather than subnormal conduct and may be of the psychopathic, the epileptic or the exogenous type. Somatic defects are distinguished ordinarily",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. Symptoms start gradually, where tremors are the most common, but the disorder also commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement. Parkinson's disease signs and symptoms can be different for everyone. Early signs may be mild and go unnoticed. Many of the symptoms are due to loss of neurons that produce a chemical messenger in the brain called dopamine. Early detection of the disease allows rapid intervention, which is important because in most cases it is not possible to recover from. It is only possible to slow down or better, to stop progression but not to reverse damage that has already incurred. Eye tremors are prevalent in PD illness and could be an initial warning for the neurodegenerative disorder. In the very early stages of the disease, these eye tremors are very small that make it impossible to be detected by naked eyes. We are proposing to use a new technology developed by MIT to generate motion magnification from recorded videos. The technology, called phase based video magnification, can be used for providing a convenient solution to detect ocular tremor. By capturing then analyzing and interpreting the results of recorded videos using smartphone's camera, we can obtain a low-cost and widely available early diagnostic system. A prototype was developed and tested on healthy and diseased subjects with encouraging results.",

Although affected patients may appear to have a neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis or epilepsy, no structural disease process is evident, nor are symptoms deliberately feigned. Instead, brain function is disordered; hence, current preference for the term “functional neurological disorder.” Conversion symptoms exist at the interface between neurology and psychiatry and remain a common cause of disability and distress. The conundrum of hysteria was essential to the development of Freudian psychoanalytic theory, which today is only one of many competing hypotheses to explain these intriguing symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Parametric and symptomatologic studies of the EEG in large populations have served to define stages of maturation and criteria of \"normality\". The younger the subjects, however, the wider are the variations. In the first stage of life only massive cerebral lesions afford unquestionable EEG evidence: in evaluating dysrhythmias it is necessary to bear in mind their high incidence in normal subjects. Hence their meaning is to be understood only by prolonged longitudinal studies. The reference here is not only to diffuse or focal slow anomalies, but also to specific pathologic rhythms. The difficulty of interpreting such anomalies is particularly evident when epileptogenic potentials are found, since they may be signs of a lesion but their clinical correlations are uncertain. The concept of \"masked epilepsy\" must be rejected. Only the diagnoses of latent or proven epilepsy are admissible, and these epilepsies may be without direct relationship to the clinical, psychiatric or central nervous findings in the affected subject. Numerous genetic, afferential, emotional or biologic factors are involved in the development of non-lesional disorders. Accordingly, the EEG has only a minor contribution to make in the definition of mild focal or diffuse pathologic anatomy of the brain in the very young subject.",

PD mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is evident in approximately one-quarter of patients at the time of PD diagnosis, and half of PD patients have progressed to PD dementia (PDD) after 10 years. The transition to PDD from PD-MCI is not linear and may depend on the facets of cognition affected. Despite increased understanding of pathological, neurotransmitter and genetic drivers, there are no proven pharmacological treatments for PD-MCI and those licensed for PDD are of modest benefit only. Biomarkers to predict those most at risk of developing PDD are under investigation and are likely to be essential so that early and individualized treatment can be provided.

      "abstract": "Extreme states can be psychospiritual and “functional” in origin or they can be “organic” and driven by biological dysfunction. Contemporary psychiatry largely rejects this distinction, preferring to insist that everything “extreme” is biological in origin; but the distinction is important for understanding and helping people. Psychospiritual crises, including those labeled bipolar or schizophrenic, are “functional” and express meaning. As “bizarre” as the language or the symbols may seem, meanings that often reflect childhood abuse can be explored in a trusting, kind, and caring therapeutic relationship. The more that a real biological or organic dysfunction, such as traumatic head injury or neurotoxic exposure, is the root cause of the extreme state, the less sense its manifestations will make. Nonetheless, drug-induced extreme states, even when caused by hallucinogens or by psychiatric “medicines,” often leave sufficient brain function operational to reveal important meanings about the person’s experience, along with the otherwise senseless intoxication. With so many people prescribed psychiatric drugs, these neurotoxic chemicals are now the most common cause of extreme states in clinical practice, and withdrawal from these offending agents is critical to recovery (Breggin, 2013). However, even when the extreme state is driven by neurological dysfunction, a safe space and skilled therapists can help relieve the individual’s otherwise overwhelming feelings of anxiety or terror.",

Motor impairments, including weakness, muscle atrophy, and impaired coordination, may also occur, which causes activity limitations and participation restrictions. Additionally, autonomic dysfunction causes further complications such as gastrointestinal disturbances, orthostatic hypotension, and urinary retention. These symptoms can range from mild to severe pain and disability, ultimately impacting the quality of life of the suffering individuals.

      "abstract": "Οι νευροεκφυλιστικές παθήσεις, είτε κληρονομικές είτε σποραδικές, χαρακτηρίζονται από προοδευτική δυσλειτουργία του νευρικού συστήματος που σχετίζεται με ατροφία εγκεφαλικών περιοχών του μεταχμιακού συστήματος. Η νόσος του Πάρκινσον (PD) αποτελεί μία από τις πιο συχνές νευροεκφυλιστικές παθήσεις του Κ.Ν.Σ με χρόνια και προοδευτικά εξελισσόμενη πορεία κινητικών διαταραχών, που τα τελευταία χρόνια συσχετίζεται με συναισθηματικές και γνωσιακές διαταραχές. Οι διαταραχές της διάθεσης και ιδιαίτερα η κατάθλιψη καθώς και οι αγχώδεις διαταραχές αποτελούν συχνή συν-νοσηρότητα των ασθενών με PD, προτείνοντας ένα κοινό νευροανατομικό υπόβαθρο στο φλοίο-μεταιχμιακό σύστημα. Νευροχημικοί μηχανισμοί που ευθύνονται για τις μη-κινητικές διαταραχές, τις νοητικές και συναισθηματικές λειτουργίες στην PD έχουν συσχετισθεί με μεταβολές νευροδιαβιβαστικών συστημάτων όπως είναι αυτό της σεροτονίνης και της νοραδρεναλίνης. Επίσης, προτείνεται ότι τόσο η φλεγμονώδης αιτιολογία της PD αλλά και η αλλοστατική έκφραση νευροτροφικών παραγόντων εμπλέκονται στην εκδήλωση αγχωδών διαταραχών έπειτα από εκφύλιση των ντοπαμινεργικών νευρώνων της μέλανας ουσίας. Η υπάρχουσα φαρμακευτική αγωγή δεν παρέχει μακροχρόνια αποτελεσματική διαχείρηση των συμπτωμάτων της νόσου και τα τελευταία χρόνια έχει αναδειχθεί η διατροφική αξία φυτοχημικών ουσιών προκειμένου να κατανοηθούν οι μηχανισμοί της πιθανής νευροπροστατευτικής επίδρασης της συμπληρωματικής διατροφής που είναι πλούσια σε φαινολικά συστατικά, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της Κορινθιακής σταφίδας (Vitis vinifera L. var Apyrena). Οι πολυφαινόλες που αποτελούν ομάδα φυτοχημικών παρουσιάζουν πληθώρα ευεργετικών δράσεων για την υγεία. Μεταξύ άλλων επιδεικνύουν αντιοξειδωτικές, αντιφλεγμονώδεις, αγγειοδιασταλτικές και αντιθρομβωτικές ιδιότητες. Συγκεκριμενα στην Κορινθιακή σταφίδα έχουν ταυτοποιηθεί απλές φαινολικές ενώσεις και φλαβονοειδή όπως κερκετίνη, καμπφερόλη, ρεσβερατρόλη και 3-Ο-γλυκοζίτες ανθοκυανιδινών.Στο πλαίσιο της παρούσας Διατριβής, ερευνητικό ερώτημα αποτέλεσαν οι νευροχημικές μεταβολές, ο ρόλος προ-φλεγμονωδών παραγόντων καθώς και η κατανόηση των μηχανισμών της πιθανής νευροπροστατευτικής δράσης της συμπληρωματικής διατροφής πλούσιας σε φαινολικά συστατικά, όπως η Κορινθιακή σταφίδα (Vitis vinifera L. var Apyrena). Για τη διερεύνηση των νευροβιολογικών μηχανισμών που υπογραμμίζουν την εκδήλωση μη-κινητικών διαταραχών στην PD καθώς και τον ρόλο των πολυφαινολών χρησιμοποιήθηκαν ως ζωικό πρότυπο αρσενικοί ενήλικοι Wistar επίμυες. Το ζωικό μοντέλο της PD αναπτύχθηκε σε πειραματικές ομάδες που έλαβαν υποδόρια ενέσεις της νευροτοξίνης ροτενόνη για 28 ημέρες σε συγκέντρωση 2,5 mg/kg. Οι ομάδες παρέμβασης έλαβαν συμπληρωματική διατροφή με Κορινθιακή σταφίδα, ενώ υπήρχαν και οι αντίστοιχες ομάδες ελέγχου (με έκδοχο νευροτοξίνης και ροτενόνης-ζώων) χωρίς την διατροφική παρέμβαση. Η κινητική συμπεριφορά καθώς και η εκφύλιση των ντοπαμινεργικών νευρώνων χαρακτήρισε τον φαινότυπο που ομοιάζει με PD. Στην παρούσα μελέτη επιπλέον διερευνήθηκε η εκδήλωση αγχώδους συμπεριφοράς με δοκιμασίες ανοιχτού πεδίου (Open Field) και υπερυψωμένου λαβυρίνθου σχήματος «+» (Elevated Plus Maze). Παράλληλα πραγματοποιήθηκαν νευροχημικές μελέτες με στόχο τον συσχετισμό της εκφύλισης των ντοπαμινεργικών νευρώνων με τη νοραδρενεργική και σεροτονινεργική διαβίβαση σε εγκεφαλικές περιοχές που εμπλέκονται στον έλεγχο συναισθημάτων και συγκεκριμένα σε αυτές του μεταιχμιακού συστήματος, όπως ο προμετωπιαίος και ο κογχομετωπιαίος φλοιός, ο ιππόκαμπος και ο βασικός και έξω αμυγδαλοειδής πυρήνας. Εξετάστηκαν δείκτες της νοραδρενεργικής διαβίβασης, όπως οι β2 αδρενεργικοί υποδοχείς και της σεροτονεργικής διαβίβασης με επίκεντρο την σεροτονίνη (5-ΗΤ) και τον μεταφορέα της σεροτονίνης (SERT), με μεθόδους ανοσοϊστοχημείας, διπλού ανοσοφθορισμού και Western Blot. Παράλληλα, στα πλαίσια της γλουταμινεργικής διαβίβασης, διερευνήθηκε η αλλαγή στα επίπεδα έκφρασης της NR2B (NMDAε2) υπομονάδας του NMDA υποδοχέα και της μετασυναπτικής πρωτεΐνης PSD95. Σε επόμενο στάδιο πραγματοποιήθηκε μελέτη των επιπέδων έκφρασης του νευροτροφικού παράγοντα BDNF και της προφλεγμονώδους κυτοκίνης IL-1β στις υπό μελέτη περιοχές του φλοιο-μεταιχμιακού κυκλώματος επίμυων που έλαβαν ροτενόνη ή έκδοχο με ή χωρίς συμπληρωματική διατροφή με Κορινθιακή σταφίδα.Σύμφωνα με τα αποτελέσματα της παρούσας Διατριβής, η ντοπαμινεργική δυσλειτουργία στη μελαινοραβδωτή οδό σε πειραματικό ζωικό μοντέλο ροτενόνης συνοδεύτηκε από αγχώδη φαινότυπο που διαπιστώθηκε ότι σχετίζεται με μεταβολές στους β2-ARs, την 5-ΗΤ, τον SERT, τον BDNF και την IL-1β σε περιοχές του φλοιο-μεταιχμιακού συστήματος εγκεφάλου επίμυος. Στην παρούσα μελέτη, η συμπληρωματική διατροφή με Κορινθιακή σταφίδα αποκατέστησε εν μέρει τα κινητικά καθώς επίσης και τα μη κινητικά ελλείμματα. Σε κοινό πλαίσιο, η συμπληρωματική διατροφή με Κορινθιακή σταφίδα αποκατέστησε εν μέρει τις επαγόμενες από τη ροτενόνη αλλαγές στους β2-ARs και διέσωσε εν μέρει την πυκνότητα των κυττάρων 5-ΗΤ+ και BDNF+. Συνολικά με βάση την υπόθεση της εργασίας, της παρούσας Διατριβής προτείνονται ως πιθανοί παθοφυσιολογικοί νευροχημικοί μηχανισμοί στην εκδήλωση αγχωδών συναισθηματικών διαταραχών οι μεταβολές στη σεροτονινεργική διαβίβαση στο φλοίο-μεταιχμικό κύκλωμα και επίσης αναδεικνύεται η μερική «(πολυ)φαινολική νευροπροστασία» σε νευρικά κυκλώματα που ελέγχουν κινητικές και συναισθηματικές λειτουργίες.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

Los pacientes con enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) pueden presentar alteraciones neuropsiquiatricas y del comportamiento en diferentes estadios evolutivos de la enfermedad que dificulten el tratamiento. Desarrollo. Es necesario que el neurologo este atento a la posible aparicion de alteraciones en el control de los impulsos, incluso desde fases tempranas de la enfermedad, para poder prevenirlas o planificar un ajuste adecuado del tratamiento. Entre los trastornos de impulsividad mas comunes estan la hipersexualidad, la ludopatia y otras conductas adictivas que, si no se detectan y tratan, pueden resultar destructivas para el entorno sociofamiliar del paciente. Los trastornos de la esfera psicotica (alucinaciones, ideas delirantes) a menudo estan asociados a fases avanzadas de la EP y al efecto del tratamiento dopaminergico, y se asocian con una mayor morbimortalidad. Es posible que factores geneticos, farmacogeneticos o una interaccion gen-ambiente expliquen la diferente susceptibilidad individual a alteraciones en la esfera neuropsiquiatrica entre los pacientes con EP. Es conveniente recordar las posibles implicaciones medico-legales que pueden tener los trastornos de la conducta, tanto para el paciente y su familia como para el medico, pues se podrian plantear conflictos entre la confidencialidad y la prevencion de danos a terceros, asi como dano atribuible al efecto secundario de medicamentos.

      "abstract": "There are three major types of headaches: tension, migraine, and organic.Tension headaches are the most common and are characterized by a dull ache or squeezing sensation around the head. Stress, hunger, fatigue, and eye strain are common causes of tension headaches. Eye strain may be the result of an uncorrected refractive error, problems with accommodation, or a convergence insufficiency.Migraine is a vascular headache often characterized by a throbbing or pulsating sensation. This type of headache is almost always accompanied with nausea and/or vomiting. Children describe many visual symptoms with migraine headaches and attacks are often caused by an external trigger.Organic headaches may be caused by fever, infection, inflammation, head trauma, or brain tumors—all of which require medical attention. Ophthalmologists should look for signs of papilledema, anisocoria, unexplained loss of vision, or diplopia. Headaches caused by brain tumors are typically progressive, severe in intensity, and resistant to analgesics. Children with brain tumors typically have other neurological symptoms such as dizziness, loss of coordination, numbness, tingling, or confusion.The proper diagnosis of headaches in children often hinges on the parents' ability to keep a detailed headache diary. If the headaches are frequent or severe enough that they are interfering with the child's social or emotional development, a complete physical and neurological evaluation is in order.",

      "title": "A Rare Cause of a Treatable Abnormal Movement, Not to Miss",
      "abstract": "Parkinsonism is a syndrome composed of tremor at rest, bradykinesia, rigidity, loss of postural reflexes, flexed posture, and freezing.1 There are various acquired etiologies causing parkinsonism, such as dopaminergic blocking agents, cerebrovascular diseases, brain neoplasm, the intoxication of various toxins, brain trauma, and metabolic disturbances. Abnormal calcium metabolism causing hypo- or hypercalcemia can lead to adverse effects of the human nervous system. Although neurological manifestations of hypercalcemia mainly present as an alteration of consciousness or depression, the manifestations of hypocalcemia range from muscle twitching, spasms, tetanic contraction, numbness, altered mental status, encephalopathy, and seizures.2, 3 Movement disorders, such as chorea and parkinsonism, are unusual complications of hypocalcemia. Herein, we report a case of hypocalcemia attributed to post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism that presented with acute parkinsonism and psychomotor retardation. Those symptoms were dramatically improved after correcting hypocalcemia. A 74-year-old Thai woman had been diagnosed with hypertension for 7 years. She had been taking enalapril 5 mg/day and propranolol 10 mg/day. She had had a thyroidectomy 30 years ago due to a large goiter. For 3 days, she was hospitalized because of a severe, disabling right-hand tremor and psychomotor retardation. She had a history of diarrhea and vomiting 4 to 5 times/day without fever for 5 days. Neurological examination demonstrated several parkinsonian features, including a masked face; chin tremor; and resting, postural, and intention tremors at the right upper extremity. Bradykinesia presented in both the upper and lower extremities bilaterally (Video 1, segment 1). She also developed severe psychomotor retardation and attention deficit. Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs were negative. In segment 1 (pretreatment), physical examination revealed signs of parkinsonism, including masked face, chin tremor, resting, postural, and intention tremor approximately 3 to 4 Hz at the right upper extremities. Bradykinesia presented both upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Wide-based gait and decreased arm swing on both sides predominantly on the right were observed. In segment 2 (posttreatment), after 4 days of calcium supplementation, parkinsonian symptoms and psychomotor retardation were markedly improved. In segment 3 (posttreatment), after 8 months of proper calcium supplementations, parkinsonian symptoms have not recurred. Video content can be viewed at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mdc3.13540 Routine blood chemistry showed acute kidney injury (blood urea nitrogen of 36.4 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.22 mg/dL, baseline creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL) with severe hypocalcemia (4.4 g/dL; normal range, 8.8–10.2 mg/dL), normal serum albumin (4.3 g/dL), hyperphosphatemia (7.8 mg/dL; normal range, 2.5–4.5 mg/dL), hypomagnesemia (1.0 mg/dL; normal range, 1.6–2.6 mg/dL), a low 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (21.4 ng/mL; normal range, ≥ 30 ng/mL), and a low parathyroid hormone level (8.13 pg/mL; normal range, 15–65 pg/mL). An electrocardiogram showed a prolonged QT interval. Axial T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence of the brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a diffuse patchy confluence over the bilateral periventricular white matter without evidence of acute ischemic stroke by diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient, and brain computer tomography showed calcification at the bilateral globus pallidus (Fig. 1). Lumbar puncture was performed. The result was normal, including a negative viral meningoencephalitis panel. Hypocalcemia was corrected by intravenous calcium gluconate, and plasma calcium level was monitored closely. After 4 days of treatment, plasma calcium returned to the normal level concomitant with a remarkable improvement of both the parkinsonism and psychomotor speed (Video 1, segment 2). The patient was discharged from the hospital 7 days after admission. Calcium and vitamin D supplements were prescribed without dopaminergic medication. 18F-fluorodopa and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography were performed. The results showed no evidence of abnormal presynaptic dopamine deficit and no hypometabolic pattern compatible with neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes (Fig. 1). At 8 months after taking calcium and vitamin D, the parkinsonism had vanished and never recurred (Video 1, segment 3). We report a case of acute parkinsonism and psychomotor retardation attributed to hypocalcemia, which was a complication of post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism. Parkinsonism in patients with hypocalcemia is rare. Its frequency increases in chronic hypocalcemia (Video 2). Full video from the 2021 Video Challenge discussion of this case. Video content can be viewed at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mdc3.13540 The neurological manifestations of hypocalcemia can occur in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). In the PNS, signs and symptoms of neuromuscular hyper-excitability including muscle twitching, tetanic contraction, trismus, and opisthotonos can be observed. The manifestations in CNS include encephalopathy, seizures, and, rarely, movement disorders.3-5 Hypocalcemia can result from hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, and post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism.6 Early evidence of the association between parkinsonism and hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism was reviewed by McKinney.5 He reviewed cases of hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia with symptoms other than tetany between 1950 and 1960, finding that 3 of 90 patients had presented with parkinsonism. He also found calcification of the basal ganglion did not correlate with the presentation of abnormal movements.5 Subsequently, Abe and colleagues reported a summary of published cases of hypocalcemia attributed to hypoparathyroidism presenting with movement disorders.6 They found 31 reported cases in the literature published between 1965 to 1994.6 Of those, 18 cases presented with parkinsonism including their own cases.6 We have summarized the reports of parkinsonism associated with hypocalcemia to date in Table 1.7-11 Mood: improved Parkinsonism: persisted Brain imaging of hypocalcemia frequently showed basal ganglia calcifications, especially in chronic hypoparathyroidism.2 Precipitation of calcium-phosphorus hydroxyapatite crystals in the basal ganglia and cerebellum of patients with hypoparathyroidism has been proposed as the possible pathogenesis for developing movement disorders in patients with hypoparathyroidism.10 However, this hypothesis cannot explain why some patients with hypoparathyroidism develop movement disorders despite the absence of basal ganglia calcification. Our patient had experienced acute parkinsonism and psychomotor retardation attributed to hypocalcemia caused by hypoparathyroidism. Despite its rarity, hypocalcemia could be a treatable cause of acute parkinsonism. Physicians should be aware of this condition, and it should not be missed. Early recognition and prompt treatment provides excellent clinical outcomes. 1. Research project: A. Conception, B. Organization, C. Execution; 2. Statistical Analysis: A. Design, B. Execution, C.

      "title": "Diagnosis and Treatment of Parkinson Disease",
      "abstract": "<h3>Importance</h3> Parkinson disease is the most common form of parkinsonism, a group of neurological disorders with Parkinson disease–like movement problems such as rigidity, slowness, and tremor. More than 6 million individuals worldwide have Parkinson disease. <h3>Observations</h3> Diagnosis of Parkinson disease is based on history and examination. History can include prodromal features (eg, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, constipation), characteristic movement difficulty (eg, tremor, stiffness, slowness), and psychological or cognitive problems (eg, cognitive decline, depression, anxiety). Examination typically demonstrates bradykinesia with tremor, rigidity, or both. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography can improve the accuracy of diagnosis when the presence of parkinsonism is uncertain. Parkinson disease has multiple disease variants with different prognoses. Individuals with a diffuse malignant subtype (9%-16% of individuals with Parkinson disease) have prominent early motor and nonmotor symptoms, poor response to medication, and faster disease progression. Individuals with mild motor-predominant Parkinson disease (49%-53% of individuals with Parkinson disease) have mild symptoms, a good response to dopaminergic medications (eg, carbidopa-levodopa, dopamine agonists), and slower disease progression. Other individuals have an intermediate subtype. For all patients with Parkinson disease, treatment is symptomatic, focused on improvement in motor (eg, tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) and nonmotor (eg, constipation, cognition, mood, sleep) signs and symptoms. No disease-modifying pharmacologic treatments are available. Dopamine-based therapies typically help initial motor symptoms. Nonmotor symptoms require nondopaminergic approaches (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for psychiatric symptoms, cholinesterase inhibitors for cognition). Rehabilitative therapy and exercise complement pharmacologic treatments. Individuals experiencing complications, such as worsening symptoms and functional impairment when a medication dose wears off (\"off periods\"), medication-resistant tremor, and dyskinesias, benefit from advanced treatments such as therapy with levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension or deep brain stimulation. Palliative care is part of Parkinson disease management. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Parkinson disease is a heterogeneous disease with rapidly and slowly progressive forms. Treatment involves pharmacologic approaches (typically with levodopa preparations prescribed with or without other medications) and nonpharmacologic approaches (such as exercise and physical, occupational, and speech therapies). Approaches such as deep brain stimulation and treatment with levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension can help individuals with medication-resistant tremor, worsening symptoms when the medication wears off, and dyskinesias.",

Instead, presbyophrenia may constitute a sub-type of dementia characterised by severe atrophy of the locus coeruleus, marked impairment of noradrenergic transmission, and uninhibited behaviour.",

Because of predominant motor features of absences, it is usually misdiagnosed as complex partial seizures and given drugs for partial seizures which can precipitate absence status epilepticus.

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease in its earlier stages is argued to be the best available model for human basal ganglia dysfunction. The negative motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are considered to give the greatest clue to normal function of this region of the brain. Particular attention is given to disorders of movement. These include delayed initiation and slowed execution of simple fast movements, due to abnormal specification of initial agonist activity. This might compromise predictive motor action, but this is shown to be preserved in Parkinson's disease. Disorders of more complex movements, such as repetitive, concurrent and sequential motor actions, are also abnormal in Parkinson's disease. These various defects are discussed in terms of a motor strategy involving the selection and sequencing of motor programmes to form a motor plan, and the initiation and execution of that motor plan. On the evidence available, it is suggested that patients with Parkinson's disease are unable to automatically execute learnt motor plans.",

These sleep symptoms are also described in patients suffering from the sleep/wake disorder, narcolepsy. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) narcolepsy criteria uses a number of markers for diagnosis, of which lack or deficiency of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 levels is a key marker. Hypocretin neurons prominently located in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical nucleus have been proposed to interact with mechanisms involving sleep and arousal. Low hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF have been shown to correlate with hypothalamic hypocretin cell loss in narcolepsy and other forms of hypersomnia; therefore, it has been proposed that degenerative damage to hypocretin neurons (such as in PD) may be detected by low CSF hypocretin-1 concentrations, and may also explain the sleep symptoms experienced by some PD patients. To date, there is mixed conflicting data describing hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF of patients with parkinsonism associated with sleep symptoms, with most studies showing no significant decrease when compared with controls. However, hypocretin-1 CSF deficiency has been shown in some studies to be more prominent in PD patients with sleep symptoms versus those without. Notably, the hypocretin system has been shown not to be selectively disrupted, with one study showing melanin concentrating hormone cell loss in the same patients with hypocretin loss. It is likely that hypocretin deficiency in PD patients occurs secondary to collateral damage caused by the neurodegenerative process involving the hypothalamus. Awareness of narcoleptic events in PD is important for driving related advice, in addition to the possible use of dopamine D3 receptor active agonists.",

Impairment of motor skills and cognition compromise the patient’s diet, nutrition and ability to maintain proper oral hygiene. As a result dental caries and edentulism seem to be a direct impending predicament. It is important to understand that people with parkinson’s disease start experiencing symptoms later in the course of the disease because a significant amount of the substantia nigra neurons have already been lost or impaired. Lewy bodies (accumulation of abnormal alphasynuclein) are found in substantia nigra neurons of PD patients. In addition to movement-related (motor) symptoms, Parkinson’s symptoms may be unrelated to movement (non-motor). People with Parkinson’s disease are often more impacted by their non-motor symptoms than motor symptoms such as apathy, depression, constipation, sleep behavior disorders, loss of sense of smell and cognitive impairment. Prosthodontics management of patients with parkinson’s disease require diligent handling.Objectives and Methods: A patient with a history of Parkinsons disease for the past 5 years (under medication) visited Saveetha dental college with the chief complaint of broken prosthesis. High impact resin was chosen to be material of choice for this patient due to its high flexural strength. So the prosthetic phase was modified and a drug delivery denture was fabricated to meet the demands of this patient. Results: Drug delivering partial denture was fabricated to meet the esthetic demands of the patient as well as to deliver the extended release formulation of the drug for managing the motor fluctuations.Key words: Parkinson’s disease, Tab.

Although mild injuries are usually associated with short-term cognitive and emotional difficulties that resolve within weeks, sometimes symptoms persist longer than three months. These prolonged or post-concussion syndrome symptoms are not related to the injury itself but rather are influenced by prior and current psychological symptoms.

      "title": "Modulating the aggregation of alpha-synuclein and prion protein with small molecules.",
      "abstract": "As living and health conditions improve in modern societies, the percentage of older people rises. A byproduct of this ageing is the marked increase of cases of cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases. Many neurodegenerative diseases share a common hallmark: Protein misfolding and aggregation that either drives or accompanies neuronal death in discrete or widespread brain regions. Finding ways to inhibit protein aggregation is thus a key step in preventing neurodegenerative diseases. Out of these, Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common disorder, affecting more than five million people worldwide. Its most common symptoms include slowness of movement, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability. At the tissue level, PD is characterized by a profound loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the brain. This loss generates a lack of dopamine in the striatum and a concomitant deregulation of the limbic system that causes the main symptoms in PD patients. Closer examination of the substantia nigra reveals the formation of protein aggregates in which the main component is a misfolded form of the protein alpha-synuclein. This, together with the fact that triplications and point mutations in the alpha-synuclein gene are associated with familial forms of PD makes alpha-synuclein an optimal target for research. As part of this work we have now discovered that the first steps of alpha-synuclein aggregation follow significantly different pathways in a lipid-based environment versus aggregation in solution, and that different small chemical compounds display distinct anti-aggregation properties depending on the presence or absence of lipid vesicles. We further demonstrated that the aggregation of vesicle-bound alpha-synuclein depends on the insertion of the hydrophobic domain into the membrane. The insertion of alpha-synculein into the membrane can be prevented by a small chemical compound, opening a novel approach to block aggregation and toxicity of alpha-synuclein. The second part of my thesis revolves around the aggregation properties of a small peptide from the prion protein (PrP). We have shown that the residue at position 129 plays a central role in its aggregation and that a region spanning from residues 111-137 form a strongly solvent-protected segment, with residues 111 and 135 being in close spatial proximity. We have also demonstrated that the protonation state of a histidine residue in position 111 critically impacts the aggregation of this prion peptide. Furthermore, we showed that sequence homology within the solvent-protected region is of utmost importance for the height of the species barrier, a central aspect of PrP biology.",

This reflects a conception of the mental as being biologically based, though it is also thought that thinking of psychiatric illness this way will reduce the stigma attached to psychiatric illness. If psychiatric illnesses are brain diseases, however, it is not clear why psychiatry should not collapse into neurology, and some argue for this course. Others try to maintain a distinction by saying that neurology deals with abnormalities of neural structure while psychiatry deals with specific abnormalities of neural functioning. It is not clear that neurologists would accept this division, nor that they should. I argue that if we take seriously the notion that psychiatric illnesses are mental illnesses we can draw a more defensible boundary between psychiatry and neurology. As mental illnesses, psychiatric illnesses must have symptoms that affect our mental capacities and that the sufferer is capable of being aware of, even if they are not always self-consciously aware of them. Neurological illnesses, such as stroke or multiple sclerosis, may be diagnosed even if they are silent, just as the person may not be aware of having high blood pressure or may suffer a silent myocardial infarction. It does not make sense to speak of panic disorder if the person has never had a panic attack, however, or of bipolar disorder in the absence of mood swings. This does not mean psychiatric illnesses are not biologically based. Mental illnesses are illnesses of persons, whereas other illnesses are illnesses of biological individuals.",

      "abstract": "The evidence linking delirium to poor outcomes after critical illness is compelling, including higher mortality, prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer length of intensive care unit stay, and long-term cognitive impairments. The attitude toward delirium in the neurologic community is shifting away from viewing it as an unmodifiable, inevitable consequence of severe illness to treating it is as a neurologic emergency, akin to seizures or encephalitis. Delirium, like other manifestations of critical illness encephalopathy, is an organ dysfunction syndrome. Given the brain's central role in maintaining homeostasis, brain failure may dysregulate many downstream functions of significant consequence in critically ill patients. The diagnosis of delirium may be confounded in patients with primary brain disorders, but nevertheless delirium symptoms in the neurologic population are also independently associated with worse outcomes. There is scant evidence for directed pharmacological treatment of delirium, but multicomponent care bundles that address the management of pain, agitation, sedation, and delirium are effective at reducing the burden of delirium in the general intensive care unit population. The management of delirium in the neurologic intensive care environment is mostly extrapolated from studies on general medical critical illness and noncritically ill neurologic patients. Further investigation into the unique risks and management needs of critically ill neurologic and neurosurgical patients is needed to reduce the burden of delirium in that population.",

      "title": "Psychotic symptoms in Parkinson’s disease: pathophysiology and management",
      "abstract": "AbstractParkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease, in which mainly dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in the brain degenerate, leading to a depletion of dopamine (DA) in the striatum. The most important motor disturbances of the disease are bradykinesia (slowing down of movement), hypokinesia (poverty of movement), rigidity (muscle stiffness), tremor and postural instability. Besides these well-known motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms may develop, such as depression, cognitive impairment and psychosis. Psychotic symptoms constitute a relatively common but nevertheless serious complication, with visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions often being most prominent. These symptoms are important contributors to patient and caregiver distress and are often important risk factors for nursing home placement. Exogenous (related to therapeutic interventions) factors are of major importance but endogenous (related to the disease process itself) factors might also contribute to the development of psychotic symptoms in PD. Therapeutic strategies comprise reduction of antiparkinsonian treatment, cholinesterase inhibitors and atypical antipsychotics. As psychotic symptoms in PD are often influenced by both endogenous and exogenous factors, a combination of strategies may be chosen.Keywordsatypical antipsychoticscholinesterase inhibitorsdelusionshallucinationsParkinson's disease (PD)",

However, it is possible that the degenerative process may in certain types also affect the peripheral nervous system. If this were so it would be valuable to recognize it not only from the pathological point of view but also, since peripheral nerves are more easily investigated during life, for differential diagnosis which is often difficult and sometimes impossible on clinical findings alone. While involvement of the lower motor neurone is unlikely to be present without causing physical signs impairment of sensation due to involvement of the primary sensory neurone may be overlooked, more especially because sensory testing is often not possible in demented patients.",

Parkinsonism is the term used to describe the clinical features of conditions resembling PD. Their management requires specialist assessment and a multidisciplinary approach. Levodopa remains the mainstay of treatment for PD. Although other treatments are used, older people are more sensitive to their side effects.

Man könnte sagen, daß eine solche Auffassung einer Krankheit nicht mehr unseren heutigen Grundsätzen entspreche, da wir ja gewohnt sind, auch bei Restzuständen einer Krankheit diese selbst zu diagnostizieren; wir wären also verpflichtet, statt von zerebraler Kinderlähmung etwa von fötaler Mikrozephalie, von geburtstraumatischer Porenzephalie, von postenzephalitischer Hemiplegie u. dgl. zu sprechen. Das ist aber nicht möglich, denn die Restzustände, wie wir sie vor uns haben, lassen die Art ihrer Entstehung nicht mehr erkennen und die Anamnesen sind zuweilen unsicher und uncharakteristisch.

      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

Disturbances of memory may, of course, appear in other organic syndromes, but only when memory defects are the dominant clinical feature or the sole defect (probably quite rare) should one speak of the “mnestic syndrome”. A number of sub-types or syndromes, e.g. the so-called Korsakov syndrome, are contained in the mnestic syndrome. As the syndrome may show various types of amnesia, dysmnesia or hypermnesia, the term “mnestic syndrome” was suggested rather than “amnestic syndrome” (Conrad, 1953).",

It is unclear whether the frequency of these disorders increases or decreases with age. Clinical expression of psychiatric disorders in old age may be different from that seen in younger age groups, with less and often milder symptoms. Concurrently, comorbidity between different psychiatric disorders is immense, as well as comorbidity with somatic disorders. Cognitive function is often decreased in people with depression, anxiety disorders, and psychosis, but whether these disorders are risk factors for dementia is unclear. Psychiatric disorders in the elderly are often related to cerebral neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease, although psychosocial risk factors are also important. Psychiatric disorders, common among the elderly, have consequences that include social deprivation, poor quality of life, cognitive decline, disability, increased risk for somatic disorders, suicide, and increased nonsuicidal mortality.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric neurodegenerative disorders encompass a wide range of conditions that result from progressive damage to cells and nervous system connections that are essential for mobility, coordination, strength, sensation, and cognition. Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Neurological disorders are disorders that involve the brain, spinal cord or nerve and muscle. Children with neurological disorders may have disorders such as epilepsy, developmental delay, cerebral palsy, meningitis, genetic/metabolic diseases or diseases of muscle or nerve such as muscular dystrophy or peripheral neuropathy. These illnesses are frequently severe and potentially have long lasting consequences for the affected children. The pathologies most frequently responsible for psycho-physical disorders can be summarized into three groups: collaboration difficulties (autism spectrum disorders, intellectual impairment, phobia); motor dysfunction (cerebral palsy, epilepsy, other brain pathologies, neuromuscular disorders), and craniofacial anomalies (Down syndrome, other genetic syndromes). Due to their clinical history, and the lack of collaboration, in pediatric non-cooperative patients with Special Needs (SN), the anesthesiological risk may result difficult to assess, despite the fact that they meet the criteria of the outpatient management applied for the patient without disabilities. The perioperative management of pediatric patients with psycho-physical disorders with related relational and cognitive problems must be carefully planned, in order to make the entire hospitalization process as comfortable and as less traumatic as possible. General anesthesia is the most suitable type of anesthesia in pediatric patients with Special Needs (SN), although anesthetic complications are more frequent in these patients, mainly due to comorbidities, taken drugs and anatomical peculiarities. Some studies observed no correlation between multiple anesthesia exposures and neurodevelopmental deficits, while others reported that even a single exposure could increase the risk of deficits. An increased risk of developmental or behavioral disorders as the consequence of surgeries requiring general anesthesia was observed. Based on current studies, it is necessary to endeavor to limit the duration and numbers of anesthesia and the dose of anesthetic agents. The evaluation must include history and physical examination pertaining to the conditions requiring special anaesthetic considerations. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing these neurological disorders in pediatric patients to improve overall quality of life and long-term outcomes.",

There seems to be a predisposition for involvement of groups of muscles innervated by cranial nerves. The causation is unknown, but it is believed that there is such an insufficiency of acetylcholine or some like substance at the myoneural junction that the neuromotor impulse is not transmitted across the junction. It has been postulated that this fault is caused either by underproduction of the choline-like substance at the motor end plates or by an accelerated disposal of it by an overabundance of acetylcholine esterase, a substance whose normal function is to destroy acetylcholine.<sup>2</sup> This disease is no regarder of sex, approximately equal numbers of males and of females being affected.",

      "title": "CLINICAL CASE OF MULTISYSTEM ATROPHY WITH PARKINSONISM",
      "abstract": "Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a steadily progressive neurodegenerative disease involving the pyramidal system, cerebellum, and autonomic nervous systemх[1]. MSA is an α-synucleinopathy with specific glioneuronal degeneration involving striatonigral, olivopontocerebellar, and autonomic nervous systems but also other parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems[3]. Clinical manifestations include hypotension, urinary retention, constipation, ataxia, parkinsonism, and postural instability. Multiple system atrophy affects both men and women equally, the first symptoms usually appear after age 53. The etiology of this pathology is unknown, but is associated with the accumulation of bodies containing alpha-synuclein in different parts of the brain[1]. There are two types of MSA. The first type occurs with a predominance of cerebellar dysfunctions: ataxia, postural instability. In the clinical setting of the second type of MSA, symptoms of parkinsonism predominate, such as muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, postural disturbances, non-resting tremor and dysarthria. Also, both types exhibit autonomic disorders. The prognosis for this pathology is unfavorable; after the first symptoms appear, life expectancy is 9-10 years.",

Häufig wird in den Lehrbüchern hier lapidar auf neurotoxische Schäden des Alkoholismus oder Mangelzustände verwiesen. In Teilbereichen ist die Forschung aber heute schon weiter. Im Vortrag wird ein kurzer Überblick über die wichtigsten neuropsychiatrischen Folgeschäden bei Alkoholismus gegeben und einige aktuelle Befunde zu Pathophysiologie und Therapie mitgeteilt. Eines der thematisierten Krankheitsbilder betrifft dabei die Alkoholhalluzinose, eine eher seltene Störung, bei denen der Alkoholkranke an akustischen Halluzinationen, gelegentlich auch paranoiden Symptomen oder Bewusstseins- und Orientierungsstörungen leidet. Trotz phänomenologischer Ähnlichkeit besteht offensichtlich keine genetische Verbindung zur Schizophrenie. Kasuistische Beobachtungen aus der Bildgebung haben gezeigt, dass bei Patienten mit Alkoholhalluzinose häufig eine Hypofunktion des Thalamus vorliegt, ähnlich wie bei schizophrenen Erkrankungen. Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt des Vortrages wird das Wernicke-Korsakow-Syndrom sein, für das bislang keine ausreichenden Therapiemöglichkeiten bestehen.",

      "abstract": "This chapter outlines the two means of determining biological death: one is cardiopulmonary, and the other neurological. It provides support for the continued use of the brain death concept based on operational usefulness and its moral rightness in that it can provide good in the absence of harm and, for most, in the absence of offense to intuition or moral sense. Brain death is the irreversible cessation of whole-brain function, which would be followed by the cessation of cardiopulmonary function without the institution of artificial measures. Recognition of the vegetative state (VS) entails a clinical diagnosis. The VS is likely to be permanent 12 months after traumatic brain injury and 3 months after nontraumatic injury in children. Minimally conscious state (MCS) is considered by some to be a neurological state whose recognition allows special legal and moral consideration. The interpretation of \"minimal\" becomes \"hardly different from vegetative\".",

It represents the most common (and only permanent) sequel of encephalitis lethargica and clinically may resemble idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Morphologically it is characterized by severe neuronal depletion and gliosis in many brainstem nuclei, in particular the substantia nigra, associated with widespread globose neurofibrillary tangles and tau-positive glial inclusions that are usually immunoreactive for both three- and four-repeat tau isoforms. Postencephalitic parkinsonism shares histopathological features with other tauopathies as a multisystem degeneration with tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles that have biochemical and ultrastructure features similar to Alzheimer's disease while α-synuclein and TDP-43 pathologies are absent. Postencephalitic parkinsonism differs both clinically and morphologically from both idiopathic Parkinson's disease and other tau-related movement disorders. There is no known genetic factor associated with postencephalitic parkinsonism and its etiopathogenesis is still unknown; despite its suggested relationship with EL, recent research has failed to identify a causative agent.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

Les troubles de l'accommodation representent un effet indesirable oculaire, souvent mentionne dans les resumes des caracteristiques des medicaments. Ils peuvent se manifester de plusieurs facons, allant d'un simple inconfort en vision de loin ou de pres a des symptomes plus marques tels qu'une fatigue oculaire ou des cephalees. On definit les troubles de l'accommodation soit par : -­ Une perte ou une paralysie de l'accommodation qui s'explique par une gene ou une incapacite a lire de pres sans correction. Il s'agit d'une atteinte du muscle ciliaire et/ou a une mydriase par stimulation du nerf sympathique ou par inhibition du systeme parasympathique. -­ Un spasme d'accommodation a l'origine d'une myopie transitoire. Cela s'explique par la contraction permanente du muscle ciliaire et s'associe, en cas d'origine medicamenteuse, a un myosis par stimulation excessive du systeme parasympathique. Les medicaments parasympathomimetiques induisent ainsi un myosis actif, et les medicaments parasympatholytiques une mydriase passive. A l'inverse, les medicaments sympathomimetiques alpha-­adrenergiques provoquent une mydriase active, et les medicaments sympatholytiques alpha-­adrenergiques un myosis passif. Le but de ce travail a ete de faire l'etat des lieux bibliographique le plus large possible des medicaments a l'origine des troubles de l'accommodation. Cela permet d'apprehender les familles therapeutiques couramment decrites comme pourvoyeuses de troubles de l'accommodation et d'utilisation tres diverse (antihistaminiques, neuroleptiques, antiparkinsoniens, anticancereux, antidiabetiques, etc…), mais aussi d'autres molecules moins decrites. Le pharmacien est un acteur important dans la prise en charge des patients. Il permet, grâce a ses conseils, d'accompagner le patient en matiere d'effets indesirables et de lui signaler leur survenue eventuelle en matiere de vision. Afin de mieux maitriser les risques de troubles de l'accommodation, le pharmacien doit garder une formation continue, et etre vigilant quant aux risques que comporte chaque molecule commercialisee.",

      "abstract": "Basic and Clinical Endocrinology Up-to-Date 136 Single benign sporadic insulinomas 2.1 Diagnosis of hypoglycaemia related to endogenous hyperinsulinism 2.1.1 Clinical symptoms of insulinomasThe clinical symptoms of insulinomas are heterogeneous and may differ among the patients.There is no specific clinical symptom.Hypoglycaemia results in autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms.Autonomic symptoms comprise adrenergic symptoms, such as palpitations and tremor, and cholinergic symptoms, with sweating, hunger, sometimes paresthesias.Neuroglycopenic symptoms comprise severe weakness, and many psychiatric and neurological manifestations, the most commonly reported being behavioural changes, confusion, agitation or slow reaction patterns, blurred vision, and finally seizures, transient loss of consciousness or hypoglycaemic coma.Hypoglycaemic coma is typically sudden, with agitation, sometimes pyramidal signs, and hypothermia; it may be profound and prolonged and therefore may be a cause of neurologic and cognitive sequelae and may occasionally lead to brain death.The combination of autonomic and moderate neuroglycopenic symptoms strongly suggests the diagnosis of hypoglycaemia.However, in insulinoma patients, autonomic symptoms may often be lacking.Neuroglycopenic symptoms are more specific of hypoglycemia related to insulinoma, but may be mild, or more often misleading.Therefore measurement of plasma glucose concentrations should be recommended in all patients with such symptoms, either in a patient without any known neurological or psychiatric disorder, or in a patient in whom such disorder had been previously controlled.Hypoglycaemic spells typically occur suddenly after a period of fast, several hours after the last meal, or after physical exercise.Some of them have been reported to occur within the hours following a meal or without any relationship with meal time, so that symptoms occurring in non fasting patients cannot rule out the diagnosis of insulinoma.In a series of 214 insulinoma patients with a reliable clinical history, symptoms of hypoglycaemia were reported exclusively in the fasting state in 73%, postprandial state in 6%, and both fasting and postprandial state in 21% (Placzkowski et al. 2009).Weight gain is found only in 25% of patients.Rapid (or rarely delayed) resolution of symptoms after glucose administration is part of Whipple's triad, which makes the diagnosis of hypoglycaemia when it has been assessed reliably; the triad comprises clinical symptoms of hypoglycaemia, the finding of a low plasma glucose concentration at the time of clinical symptoms, and subsiding of clinical symptoms after glucose administration.In rare pregnant patients with insulinoma, symptoms may resemble those of emesis in early pregnancy and may subside in late pregnancy as a consequence of insulin resistance, then are unmasked after delivery (Diaz et al. 2008), as reported in a patient who presented with coma and clonic seizures 14 hours after delivery (Christiansen & Vestergaard 2008). Biological diagnosis of insulinomas Plasma glucose concentrationsSince the clinical symptoms lack diagnostic specificity, measurement of plasma concentration of glucose is mandatory (ideally at the time of occurrence of clinical symptoms) and must be performed in venous blood samples with a reliable laboratory method.In order to avoid pseudohypoglycaemia, i.e. a consequence of glucose metabolism by blood cells in the tube containing the blood sample, the blood sample should be collected in a tube with a glycolysis inhibitor (NaF).Glucose concentrations are measured using reference method with hexokinase.",

      "title": "Parkinson's disease: clinical features and diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder characterised by a large number of motor and non-motor features that can impact on function to a variable degree. This review describes the clinical characteristics of PD with emphasis on those features that differentiate the disease from other parkinsonian disorders.A MedLine search was performed to identify studies that assess the clinical characteristics of PD. Search terms included \"Parkinson's disease\", \"diagnosis\" and \"signs and symptoms\".Because there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of PD, the disease must be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of postural reflexes are generally considered the cardinal signs of PD. The presence and specific presentation of these features are used to differentiate PD from related parkinsonian disorders. Other clinical features include secondary motor symptoms (eg, hypomimia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhoea, micrographia, shuffling gait, festination, freezing, dystonia, glabellar reflexes), non-motor symptoms (eg, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive/neurobehavioral abnormalities, sleep disorders and sensory abnormalities such as anosmia, paresthesias and pain). Absence of rest tremor, early occurrence of gait difficulty, postural instability, dementia, hallucinations, and the presence of dysautonomia, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and other atypical features, coupled with poor or no response to levodopa, suggest diagnoses other than PD.A thorough understanding of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of PD is essential to the proper diagnosis of the disease. Genetic mutations or variants, neuroimaging abnormalities and other tests are potential biomarkers that may improve diagnosis and allow the identification of persons at risk.",

Verbal learning, verbal memory and executive functions foremost, working memory, (sustained) attention and processing speed are substantial cognitive domains in bipolar disorder. Dysfuntions in verbal learning and memory might be observed in first degree relatives as well; and thus seem to be best candidates for the cognitive endophenotype concept. Prior psychotic episodes, numbers and types of episodes, age of illness onset and duration of illness are clinical parameters seem to influence cognitive functions. There are relatively limited numbers of researches about cognitive dysfunctions in early onset forms, old age, type II disorder and comorbidity aspects of bipolar disorders. Results from the researches regarding qualitative and quantitative effects of medications on cognition are inconsistent. Cognitive deficits of first degree relatives and familial resemblance of deficits might be indicators of heritability of cognitive functions, therefore taking genetic models into account in designs of researches may provide considerable data.",

Obgleich sie sehr häufig auftreten, werden sie bis heute allzu oft nicht angemessen wahrgenommen und therapiert. Die Gründe dafür sind u. a. in der Vielfältigkeit der Schmerzen und in der anspruchsvollen Differenzialdiagnostik zu suchen. Die Krankheit vereint unter dem Überbegriff Morbus Parkinson Schmerzen verschiedenster Art. In Analogie zum chronischen Schmerzsyndrom kann man jedoch 3 große Subgruppen unterscheiden: den neuropathischen, den nozizeptiven und den gemischten Schmerz (mixed pain). Die Pathophysiologie von Schmerzen bei Parkinson ist sehr komplex und in vielen Punkten noch unklar. Neue wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse weisen auf eine Dysfunktion der Basalganglien bei der Entstehung, Weiterleitung und Verarbeitung von Schmerzen hin. Schmerzen können bereits in der präsymptomatischen Krankheitsphase auftreten und der motorischen Symptomatik vorausgehen, oder aber sie treten in Analogie zu den motorischen Krankheitssymptomen nach Diagnosestellung auf. Es gibt Schmerzen, die durch eine Optimierung der dopaminergen Medikation gelindert werden können, aber auch Schmerzen, die keine Response auf L-Dopa zeigen. Schmerzen, welche durch motorische Krankheitssymptome und Off-Phasen assoziiert auftreten, weisen auf eine notwendige Optimierung der dopaminergen Medikation hin. Botulinumtoxin hat sich in der Therapie fokaler Dystonien bewährt. Kasuistisch wird über eine Besserung von Schmerzen und Dysästhesien nach tiefer Hirnstimulation berichtet. Nicht L-Dopa-responsive Schmerzen sollten einer multimodalen Schmerztherapie zugeführt werden, welche insbesondere auf mögliche Interaktionen mit Parkinson-Medikamenten Rücksicht nehmen sollte.",

      "title": "Análisis evolutivo y valoración neuropsicológica integral de pacientes con deterioro cognitivo leve o enfermedad de Alzheimer.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION \nEl envejecimiento de la poblacion esta causando un aumento en la aparicion de patologias asociadas a la edad, como es el caso de las demencias. Afortunadamente los avances de las Ciencias de la Salud como la Medicina, la Psicologia y, en particular, la Neuropsicologia estan aportando herramientas de gran utilidad para la evaluacion, el diagnostico y el tratamiento de procesos como el Deterioro Cognitivo Leve (DCL) y la Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA).\nEl Deterioro Cognitivo Leve es definido como un sindrome clinico caracterizado por la alteracion adquirida en una o mas areas cognitivas (atencion, funciones ejecutivas, lenguaje, memoria o area visuoespacial) con una duracion de meses a anos, que sin cumplir los criterios para el diagnostico de demencia excede a lo esperado por la edad. La afectacion es referida por el propio paciente o por un informador y debe ser objetivada en la exploracion neuropsicologica, pudiendo provocar una interferencia minima en el desarrollo de las actividades habituales. El DCL es frecuentemente ubicado en un continuo que transcurre desde el envejecimiento normal hasta la enfermedad de Alzheimer, considerando a las personas con DCL como un grupo poblacional con alto riesgo de padecer posteriormente demencia (predominantemente Enfermedad de Alzheimer).\nLa Enfermedad de Alzheimer (EA) ha sido la demencia mas estudiada y aunque su evolucion es heterogenea, la afectacion cognoscitiva mas grave en los primeros estadios es la alteracion de la memoria. La EA se caracteriza por un comienzo insidioso, dificultando la discriminacion y la realizacion de un diagnostico temprano. Conforme avanza la enfermedad otras areas cognitivas se ven gravemente afectadas.\n Por tanto, la definicion del perfil clinico y neuropsicologico asociado a las primeras etapas de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas es crucial para facilitar la deteccion temprana de la enfermedad, establecer el punto de partida para una intervencion adecuada y poder llevar a cabo un seguimiento de la evolucion de manera controlada.\nOBJETIVO\nEn la presente Tesis Doctoral se analiza el perfil neuropsicologico integral y el curso evolutivo de pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve y Enfermedad de Alzheimer en dos estadios, leve y moderado, atendiendo a la capacidad funcional y cognitiva en tres momentos diferentes de su evolucion, al inicio y a los seis y doce meses.\nMATERIAL Y METODOS\nSe han llevado a cabo cinco estudios basados en una metodologia descriptiva transversal (Estudios I-IV) y longitudinal (Estudio V), mediante la exploracion neuropsicologica integral y clinica de una muestra inicial de 116 pacientes de los cuales 72 se han ajustado a los criterios de inclusion en la fase de valoracion basal y 44 en la fase de evolucion. El protocolo de evaluacion ha estado conformado por los siguientes tests de screening, de funcionalidad y de dominio cognitivo especifico: Examen Cognoscitivo MiniMental, Test de los 7 Minutos, Escala de Deterioro Global (GDS), Escala para las Actividades Basicas de la Vida diaria BARTHEL, Escala de sobrecarga del cuidador de ZARIT, Cuestionario de Actividad Funcional (FAQ) de Pfeiffer y diferentes subtests del Programa Integrado de Exploracion Neuropsicologica-Test Barcelona.\nRESULTADOS\nA nivel funcional, el grupo con DCL inicialmente era independiente en el desarrollo de las ABVDs pero conforme ha transcurrido el tiempo han comenzado a requerir cierta supervision en sus actividades. A nivel cognitivo inicialmente han presentado afectacion principal de las funciones ejecutivas, la memoria diferida y la velocidad de procesamiento, manteniendo preservadas a los doce meses de investigacion el resto de las funciones evaluadas aunque con un descenso en la ejecucion a los seis meses en orientacion temporal y fluencia verbal.\nLos pacientes con EAL han presentado dependencia funcional desde el inicio incrementada a los doce meses. A nivel cognitivo, en la valoracion inicial se han encontrado resultados sugerentes de afectacion en las funciones ejecutivas (planificacion y secuenciacion), memoria verbal (inmediata y diferida) y velocidad de procesamiento. A los seis meses han comenzado a verse afectadas las funciones de span atencional, coordinacion motora, denominacion y comprension lectora y a los doce meses la orientacion temporal tambien se ha visto afectada. Los sujetos han preservado algunas funciones como la orientacion espacial, lenguaje (automatico, repeticion de palabras, comprension auditiva), praxias ideomotoras y abstraccion verbal.\nPor ultimo, los sujetos con EAM han mostrado alteracion funcional inicial y afectacion de casi todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas (orientacion temporal y espacial, abstraccion, planificacion y secuenciacion, control mental, span atencional, repeticion de material verbal extenso, fluencia verbal semantica y fonetica, comprension verbal auditiva y lectora, praxias ideomotoras, memoria y velocidad de procesamiento). A los seis meses se ha afectado tambien la orientacion en persona y la denominacion de imagenes. En la ultima evaluacion todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas han estado afectadas a excepcion de la capacidad para repetir palabras conocidas y logatomos y para emitir series automaticas del lenguaje cuando son requeridas en orden directo.\nCONCLUSION\nLos sujetos con DCL han comenzado a presentar alteraciones clinicas que les conducen a sentir limitaciones clinicas considerables y que son percibidas por el propio paciente y por las personas de su entorno. En el caso de la Enfermedad de Alzheimer, la evolucion de la misma termina por causar afectacion de todas las funciones mentales superiores y conduce al paciente a un estado de dependencia donde requieren una ayuda continua cada dia. Ademas las areas que en estadios mas temprano comienzan a alterarse son las que se han observado dramaticamente mas afectadas en estadios mas avanzados (memoria, funciones ejecutivas y velocidad de procesamiento).\nLa evaluacion realizada en esta investigacion ha contibuido a la definicion del perfil neuropsicologico de los pacientes con Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer en estadio leve y moderado, facilitando la labor de discriminar la afectacion funcional y cognitiva inicial en los tres grupos de estudio.\nPALABRAS CLAVE: Deterioro Cognitivo Leve, Enfermedad de Alzheimer, Perfil Neuropsicologico, Evaluacion Neuropsicologica",

      "abstract": "Sarcoidosis of the nervous system may be considered for convenience under two headings; neuropathies and infiltrations of the central nervous system. Both cranial and peripheral nerves may be affected, and the changes in them may be either granulomatous or non-granulomatous. In the central nervous system, granulomatous infiltration of the meninges and diffuse and focal granulomatosis of the brain or more rarely the spinal cord may occur. There are some relatively frequent patterns of involvement; e. g. facial and other cranial nerve palsies in the uveo-parotid syndrome, and within the central nervous system, granulomatous infiltration of the meninges at the base of the brain and in the adjacent hypothalamus causing neuro-endocrine and visual disturbances. But any part of the nervous system may be affected, and the great variety of possible combinations of pathological changes can give rise to bizarre clinical features. Diagnostic difficulty may be increased by occasional association with sarcoid myopathy (Chapter 9) or with the neuro-psychiatric effects of corticosteroid treatment or of hypercalcaemia (Chapter 19).",

Nonmotor features of PD, such as dementia, may be an intrinsic feature of the disorder and persist regardless of the medication state (ie, they continue to manifest in the “on” or “off” state); some nonmotor features, such as psychotic symptoms, may be iatrogenic complications of pharmacologic intervention for the treatment of the motor manifestations of PD. Iatrogenic complications, such as psychosis and impulse control disorders, may respond to modification of the PD treatment regimen at the risk of worsening motor symptoms. Thus, a balance must be struck between controlling nonmotor manifestations and motor features of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease with motor, cognitive, and other neuropsychiatric manifestations. Cognitive symptoms include impairments in attention, information processing efficiency and speed, executive functions, and long-term memory. These cognitive impairments are independent of the disease’s duration and are minimally associated with neurological manifestations. Most MS patients require psychiatric treatment, usually for cognitive or affective disorders. Therapeutic management includes treatment of acute exacerbations, symptomatic treatment, and disease-modifying treatments/biological therapies. This case presentation aims to emphasize the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between psychiatrists and neurologists when addressing the psychiatric manifestations of MS. Our patient is a 52-year-old man who presented to our clinic with suicidal ideation, a plan and method, depressive mood, multiple delusions, affective inversion towards family members, severe anxiety, and irritability, symptoms that led to significantly diminished functionality. He also presented with neurological symptoms and severe damage to the motor area. MS is a chronic, progressive disease with well-known neurological symptoms. However, the psychiatric manifestations are often overlooked. MS is thought to be an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks the myelin sheath that protects nerve fibers, resulting in inflammation and damage, which eventually leads to a loss of function. The psychiatric manifestations of MS can be just as debilitating as the physical symptoms and can significantly reduce quality of life. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach between specialists in psychiatry and neurology is often necessary to provide the most appropriate medical care for patients.",

      "abstract": "he classic features of the clinical picture in Parkinson's disease (PD) are the motor disorders: akinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability.However, non-motor symptoms (NMS) are frequently present.Therefore, patients with PD can present, besides the typical parkinsonian motor syndrome, a wide arrow of NMS, mainly neuropsychiatric manifestations (as depression and cognitive impairment), sleep disorders (as rapid eye movement behavior disorder), autonomic dysfunctions (as intestinal constipation, postural hypotension and miccional disorders) and others, as fatigue and pain.In their various combinations, NMS may eventually become the main complaints of patients with PD.NMS may be related to the neurodegenerative changes affecting several neural systems and/or caused by drugs employed in the treatment of PD.The mainly neural systems related to NMS are: non-motor frontostriatal circuits, serotoninergic nuclei of median raphe, noradrenergic nuclei (locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus), autonomic centers (hypothalamus and dorsal motor of vagus) and olfactory system.The clinical picture of PD has been compared with an iceberg.The visible part represents the motor symptoms, and the larger non-visible part represents the several NMS, often underecognized in clinical practice.The study of Cosentino et al. 1 published in this issue of Arquivos de Neuropsiquiatria was performed aiming to determine the prevalence of NMS in 300 PD outpatients seen at the Movement Disorders Unit of the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Neurológicas in Lima, Peru.The patients completed the Spanish validated version of the Non-motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest).This questionnaire was developed by Chaudhuri et al. 2 to address the need for a quantitative and validated instrument to measure NMS in PD.The NMSQuest is a simple self-completed tool and it is comprised of 30 items grouped according to 9 NMS domains.The results of this study show the high prevalence and the variety of NMS in PD: at least one NMS was present in 99.3% of the patients evaluated and the mean total NMS (NMSQ-T) was 12.41 ranging from 0 to 27 of a maximum of 30.These data confirm those from previous similar studies.performed a multicentric, international, cross-sectional study involving 545 PD patients (mean disease duration: 6.96 year) using the same questionnaire (NMSQuest) and reported 10.3 as the mean total NMS, and such symptoms were present in 98.4% of the patients evaluated.The PRIAMO study (Barone et al. 4 ) is another important one to be compared to the Cosentino et al. 1 study.This Italian multicenter survey using a semi-structured interview in 1,072 consecutive patients with PD was performed to assess the prevalence NMS in 12 domains, their association with cognitive impairment and the impact on patients' quality of life.They found that 98.6% of patients with PD reported the presence of NMS and the mean number of NMS per patient was 7.8 ranging from 0 to 32.The NMS in PD may be present in all the clinical phases of the disease: pre-motor phase, the initial phase (when the motor symptoms appear and the diagnosis is made), the moderate phase and in the advanced phase.In the pre-motor phase, the most common NMS symptoms are: hyposmia, depression, intestinal constipation and rapid eye movement behavior disorder.Along the initial and moderate phases, several autonomic and neuropsychiatric manifestations may be present, and in the advanced one the most important NMS is dementia of PD.Consentino et al. 1 observed that the mean total NMS increased significantly with disease duration.Mean total NMS was 10.74 in patients with less than 5 years of disease, 13.71 between 5 and",

With increasing experience and recognition of this complication of diabetes, a broader appreciation of its clinical manifestations has taken place. Unfortunately, however, a basic confusion in diagnosis still exists. This results from the fact that the neurological syndromes are so numerous that almost any condition may be simulated. Nervous system involvement is frequently diffuse and disseminated and may present a bizarre picture. Further, the etiology, pathology, and treatment remain essentially unknown. The symptoms may indicate involvement of the peripheral nerves, the spinal roots, the spinal cord, the cerebrum, or any combination thereof.

Este sindrome se considera dentro del extremo del Sindrome Apatico o Sindrome frontalcingular y suele ser secundario a lesiones en el giro cingulado de ambos hemisferios o despues de un dano bilateral en los lobulos frontales. El diagnostico representa un reto para los clinicos ya que suele confundirse con algun tipo de afasia, apraxia o estados de alteracion de la conciencia. Los estudios han sido muy lentos y escasos, por lo que apenas se ha podido caracterizar a la enfermedad y no se han establecido pautas para su evaluacion e intervencion. El presente estudio expone el caso de un paciente con mutismo acinetico causado por un Evento Vascular Cerebral frontal bilateral, en el cual se le otorga relevancia principal a las pautas de evaluacion neuropsicologica asi como a su abordaje neuropsicologico. Los resultados sugieren que las pruebas estandarizadas son utiles para conocer el perfil cognitivo del paciente, sin embargo, se recomienda que la evaluacion se complemente a traves de la observacion y la recopilacion de datos de familiares y cuidadores; y la intervencion que sea realice sea integral y personalizada, especifica a las necesidades, etiologia y a comorbilidades presentadas por el paciente, teniendo en cuenta que el objetivo principal es permitirle alcanzar un nivel optimo de bienestar y mejorar la calidad de vida.",

The main clinical features are new weakness, muscular fatigability, general fatigue, and pain. The primary criteria necessary for the diagnosis of PPS are a history of paralytic poliomyelitis, partial or complete recovery of neurological function followed by a period of stability (usually several decades), persistent new muscle weakness or abnormal muscle fatigability, and the exclusion of other causes of new symptoms. The cause of PPS remains unclear, but is likely due to a distal degeneration of enlarged post-poliomyelitis motor units. Contributing factors to PPS may be aging (with motor neuron loss), overuse, and disuse. PPS is usually a slowly progressive neuromuscular disease. Although there is no specific treatment for PPS, an interdisciplinary management program can be useful in controlling symptoms. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Muscle Nerve 2005",

      "title": "Autoimmune Encephalopathies",
      "abstract": "Background: Evaluation of patients with recent onset of progressive cognitive and behavioral problems can be challenging. Psychiatric disorders, metabolic derangements, toxins and infections are generally considered in the differential diagnosis along with prion disorders (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) and rapidly progressive degenerative dementias. Some subacute encephalopathies are caused by autoimmune or inflammatory mechanisms, recognized by the association with autoantibody markers and/or clear response to immunomodulatory treatment. This review describes the clinical features of these potentially reversible autoimmune encephalopathies. Review Summary: Morvan syndrome, paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (PLE), and nonparaneoplastic autoimmune limbic encephalitis have characteristic clinical and serological features. Limbic encephalitis is characterized by short-term memory impairment, complex partial temporal lobe seizures and psychiatric symptoms. Signal abnormalities in the mesial temporal lobes without contrast enhancement are the typical MRI findings. Morvan syndrome presents with behavioral changes, hallucinations, severe insomnia, autonomic hyperactivity and neuromyotonia (spontaneous muscle activity). Corticosteroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with evidence of thyroid autoimmunity (sometimes called Hashimoto encephalopathy) has a broad range of clinical presentation. Cognitive impairment with tremor, seizures, stroke-like events (including transient aphasia) and normal thyroid hormone levels is a common scenario. In the absence of diagnostic serological findings, clinical improvement with corticosteroids may be the only evidence of autoimmune encephalopathy. Conclusions: Autoimmune encephalopathies are an important cause of rapidly progressive cognitive and behavioral decline that probably remain under recognized. Electroencephalography, brain MRI, cerebrospinal fluid examination and serological tests are useful diagnostic tools. With increased clinical suspicion, these diseases may be diagnosed and treated successfully.",

Then a focused history of patient to harbor a peripheral nerve tumor (PNTs) should be directed towards the onset, duration, and growth alterations of the mass. A family history of NF-1 or NF-2 or other predisposition syndromes is of special importance, since majority of PNTs are linked with these syndromes. Presence or absence of symptoms and signs such as pain, numbness, weakness, the overlying skin temperature and color, fl uctuance, along with the patients general health inquiry including immune status, pre-existing malignancy are of importance in the differential diagnosis. However, many peripheral nerve tumors present without any neurological symptoms due to their slow growth rate or origin from a superfi cial small sensory branch. Several features of the examination that suggests a peripheral nerve origin: 1. PNTs are mobile perpendicular but not along the longitudinal axis of a known peripheral nerve. 2. Palpation or percussion (Tinel’s sign) of a PNT may elicit sensory stimuli radiating along the distribution of the nerve of origin. 3. A mass in the presence of a patient with a genetic predisposition such as neurofi bromatosis (NF) most likely represents a peripheral nerve tumor.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Apathy is a common condition that involves diminished initiative, diminished interest and diminished emotional expression or responsiveness. It is highly prevalent in the context of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders and is related to poor health outcomes. Presence of apathy is associated with cognitive and functional decline in dementia. Despite its negative impact on health, there is no definitive treatment for apathy, a clinical reality that may be due in part to lack of knowledge about assessment, neuropsychological features and neurobiological underpinnings. Here, we review and synthesize evidence from clinical, epidemiological, neuropsychological, peripheral biomarker and neuroimaging research. Apathy is a common feature of depression and cognitive disorders and is associated with impairment in executive function. Neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies point to dysfunction of brain circuitry involving the prefrontal cortex, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex circuit, the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex circuit, and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex circuit. However, inconsistent findings, particularly in neuroimaging may be due to heterogeneity of apathy symptoms (with a need to better elucidate subtypes), neuropsychiatric comorbidities, the severity of cognitive impairment and other factors. These factors need to be accounted for in future studies so that biomarker research can make progress. On the whole, the literature on apathy has identified likely neurocognitive, peripheral biomarker and neuroimaging targets for understanding apathy, but also points to the need to address methodological issues that will better inform future studies. In turn, as we learn more about the underpinning of apathy and its subtypes, subsequent research can focus on new neurally based interventions that will strengthen the clinical management of apathy in the context of its comorbidities.",

The placebo effect in Parkinson’s disease is mediated by dopamine release in the striatum and is associated with changes in activity of neurons in the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra pars reticulata, and motor thalamus. Deceptive verbal instructions about changes in drug dosage can affect the pharmacological effect of levodopa in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation are powerfully modulated by placebos. Migraine is another disease of the nervous system that shows very high rates of improvement in patients who received placebo, although the mechanisms are little understood. Other neurological diseases, like epilepsy, show improvements in placebo groups, but the mechanisms are not known.",

      "abstract": "In Parkinson disease patients who receive long-term antiparkinsonian medication, their original symptoms of rigidity, tremor and related motor disturbances markedly improve or disappear. However, the condition is still far from satisfactory in terms of maintaining independence in daily life activities even in these patients in whom the drug treatment is for improving motor disturbances. The reason is that they show abnormal behavior characterized by \"spending the entire day in an idle state, which is perceived as laziness.\"This behavior is very annoying for the patient and the family. Despite the excellent effectiveness of drug treatment, this propensity toward idleness in mental and motor functions is not improved. Despite the denial of the depressive state and the absence of obvious cognitive disorder, such patients lack ambition and spend their time idly. However, although their motor function remains subliminal, such patients can carry out motor activities when the situation requires, but usually they do not have the drive to move. If we use the current nosological descriptions, the former is called \"bradyphrenia\" or psychic akinesia or slowness of thinking and the latter is called \"akinesia\". Akinesia is composed of two cardinal elements \"bradykinesia\" and \"hypokinesia\". Bradykinesia is the evaluation of quality of appeared motor behavior, and hypokinesia is the poverty of movement behavior. These two symptoms differ essentially. Hypokinesia is much more essential and is a cardinal element of akinesia. It indicates that the current drug treatment is ineffective for the improvement of hypokinesia and bradyphrenia. That is, these symptoms are a result of a dysfunction different from that causing residual motor symptoms or a result of other additional dysfunctions developing during the pathophysiological course of the disease. The dopamine (DA) system of the dorsal striatal pathway projecting from the substantia nigra pars compacta (A9) to the dorsal part of the striatum (motor striatum) functions in the control of speed and dexterity of movement. On the other hand, the DA system through the medial forebrain bundle projecting from the ventral tegmental area (VTA-A10) to the nucleus accumbens, ventral striatum (limbic striatum) and the cortex is associated with hypokinesia and bradyphrenia. This association can be confirmed by a long-term follow-up of Parkinson disease patients and experimental animal models lesioned in the ventral DA pathway (mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways).",

      "abstract": "Niemann-Pick C disease (NP-C) is a neurovisceral atypical lysosomal lipid storage disorder with an estimated minimal incidence of 1/120,000 live births. The broad clinical spectrum ranges from a neonatal rapidly fatal disorder to an adult-onset chronic neurodegenerative disease. The neurological involvement defines the disease severity in most patients but is typically preceded by systemic signs (cholestatic jaundice in the neonatal period or isolated spleno- or hepatosplenomegaly in infancy or childhood). The first neurological symptoms vary with age of onset: delay in developmental motor milestones (early infantile period), gait problems, falls, clumsiness, cataplexy, school problems (late infantile and juvenile period), and ataxia not unfrequently following initial psychiatric disturbances (adult form). The most characteristic sign is vertical supranuclear gaze palsy. The neurological disorder consists mainly of cerebellar ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and progressive dementia. Cataplexy, seizures and dystonia are other common features. NP-C is transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner and is caused by mutations of either the NPC1 (95% of families) or the NPC2 genes. The exact functions of the NPC1 and NPC2 proteins are still unclear. NP-C is currently described as a cellular cholesterol trafficking defect but in the brain, the prominently stored lipids are gangliosides. Clinical examination should include comprehensive neurological and ophthalmological evaluations. The primary laboratory diagnosis requires living skin fibroblasts to demonstrate accumulation of unesterified cholesterol in perinuclear vesicles (lysosomes) after staining with filipin. Pronounced abnormalities are observed in about 80% of the cases, mild to moderate alterations in the remainder (\"variant\" biochemical phenotype). Genotyping of patients is useful to confirm the diagnosis in the latter patients and essential for future prenatal diagnosis. The differential diagnosis may include other lipidoses; idiopathic neonatal hepatitis and other causes of cholestatic icterus should be considered in neonates, and conditions with cerebellar ataxia, dystonia, cataplexy and supranuclear gaze palsy in older children and adults. Symptomatic management of patients is crucial. A first product, miglustat, has been granted marketing authorization in Europe and several other countries for specific treatment of the neurological manifestations. The prognosis largely correlates with the age at onset of the neurological manifestations.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, and verbal and nonverbal communication as well as limited and repetitive behaviours. Although symptomatology of autism may be noticed around early months, diagnosis generally occurs around 24-36 months, however in some cases diagnosis may be delayed to adulthood [1]. Since behavioural symptoms and the degree of functional impairment are variable, the au‐ tistic disorder is described as a heterogenous symptom cluster of varying etiological and pathological basis [2]. Described as a multifactorial disorder created by interaction of neuro‐ logic, immunologic, environmental, and genetic factors, autistic disorder has no definite cause [3, 4]. In many cases in whom the etiology remains unclear are diagnosed as idiopath‐ ic autism or non-syndromic autism [5, 6]. Seventy percent of cases with idiopathic autism have basic symptoms without physical abnormalities whereas 30% have complex autism in which dysmorphic features are detected such as microcephaly and/or structural brain mal‐ formations [7]. Autism is associated with other syndromes such as Fragile X syndrome, Down Syndrome, and tuberosclerosis in 5-25% of the cases ([8, 9]. Although phenotypic het‐ erogeneity is the biggest challenge for research efforts directed to identify autism etiology [10], currently it is widely accepted that environmental and genetic factors play essential role in genesis of autistic disorder thanks to a recent advance in research techniques related to biological factors and widespread studies in this field [11, 12].",

      "abstract": "Fatigue is a common complaint in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). More than half of all patients with PD rank fatigue among their three worst symptoms. Fatigue has been variously hypothesized to be caused by dysfunction of the striato-thalamo-cortical loop, abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, inflammatory processes, and neurotransmitter abnormalities within the central nervous system. However, there is no firm evidence that any of these proposed etiologies explain the fatigue experienced by patients who have PD or other diseases. Fatigue may be associated with depression, sleep disorders, and medication-induced adverse effects, but it also remains a distinct symptom that can occur independently from these other disorders and problems. Fatigue is a persistent symptom in individual patients, and it is unrelated to disease severity. Fatigue is difficult to define and even more difficult to measure. Several questionnaires are available to measure fatigue, but many of these are disease-specific and do not apply to patients who have PD. Some questionnaires measure general overall fatigue, whereas others measure different aspects of fatigue, including mental, physical, emotional, motivational, and exertional fatigue. Often fatigue is confused with sleepiness, a related but distinct construct. Clearly, fatigue has a significantly negative impact on the quality of life and physical function of patients with PD. Currently, there is no proven effective treatment for this problematic nonmotor symptom of PD. Additional research is needed to provide a better understanding of this complex problem.",

Tourette syndrome can be diagnosed if a child has multiple motor tics and at least one phonic tic for more than 1 year with onset before age 18 years. Children with Tourette syndrome may have symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or behavioral disorders. Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Transient and developmental movement disorders include benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, jitteriness in neonates, shuddering, and stereotypies.",

Dementia is one consequence of brain aging, with con -comitant behavioral deficits in motor and cognitive function. Therefore, there is a need to improve neuronal communication in the brain in aging, which is habitually destabilized by enhanced oxidative stress, inflammation and toxic protein accumula -tion. These factors can ultimately lead to death of neurons, disease pathologies and behavioral deficits.Neurodegeneration is highly debilitating in nature, and the underlying brain pathol -ogy may go undetected prior to the presen -tation of symptoms or diagnosis",

All types of epileptic seizures can be seen in patients with cerebral palsy. Complex partial and secondary generalized ones are the most frequent seizure types. In persons with cerebral palsy and mental retardation, the diagnosis of epilepsy presents unique difficulties. Generally they are not able to describe the epileptic events themselves, parents are not able to describe them without fear and persons trained in epilepsy witness the events only rarely. Some syndromes, such as infantile spasms. West and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, are particularly frequent, whereas children with cerebral palsy are rarely free of epilepsy. It has been observed that epileptic seizures in children with cerebral palsy tend to have an earlier onset; they often appear in children with cerebral palsy and mental retardation; they are more severe in patients with a more severe degree of cerebral palsy. The overall outcome of seizures in children with cerebral palsy is poor, requiring prolonged course of antiepileptic medications, polytherapy with higher incidence of refractory seizures and hospital admissions for status epilepticus. The presence of a neurological deficit, as well as cerebral palsy, does not necessarily mean a poor prognosis after the discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs, but the risk of a relapse in persons with cerebral palsy is high.The objective of the paper was to show the relationship between cerebral palsy and epilepsy and to determine the occurrence, associated factors, nature and prognosis of epilepsy in children with cerebral palsy.",

The diagnostic problem of progressive bilateral visual loss is usually solvable with a clear understanding of the knowledge of the visual pathways, patterns of visual symptoms and careful examination. Chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy is appropriately treated with long-term immunosuppression and steroid-sparing agents. Optical coherence tomography and angiography have become two of the most important imaging modalities in neuro-ophthalmology. Optic neuritis is one of the most common causes of subacute unilateral visual loss in young adults. Ophthalmic involvement is a result of direct fungal infiltration or ischaemic infarction and this leads to acute ophthalmoplegia, proptosis, periorbital oedema and blindness from central retinal artery occlusion or an optic neuropathy. Supranuclear eye movement abnormalities result when the cerebral, cerebellar and brainstem afferent inputs to the ocular motor nuclei are disrupted.",

The diagnosis is based on clinical manifestations and lumbar puncture finding. Treatment consists of intravenous antibiotics for a period of three to four weeks. Patients who receive early treatment usually have an excellent prognosis, with very few patients developing post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome.

      "title": "[Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease].",
      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common finding in Parkinson's disease (PD), even in the early stages. The concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD was recently formalized with diagnosis being reached after impairments in neuropsychological tasks become significant in at least one domain. The brain profile of cognitive deficits involves executive functions (e. g., planning, set shifting, set maintenance, problem solving), attention and memory function. Memory deficits are characterized by impairments in delayed recall, temporal ordering and conditional associate learning. PD patients demonstrate relatively preserved recognition. Visuospatial dysfunctions have also been reported, while language is largely preserved. The existence of two distinct mild cognitive syndromes has also been suggested. One of these affects mainly the frontostriatal executive deficits that are modulated by dopaminergic medications and by a genetically determined level of prefrontal cortex dopamine release. The other affects the more-posterior cortical abilities, such as visuospatial and memory functions, and is suggested to be associated with an increased risk for conversion to dementia. Cross-sectional studies have commonly reported dementia in 20-30% of PD patients, although the 8-year cumulative incidence of dementia may be as high as 78%. Factors associated with dementia in PD are age at onset, age at the time of examination, akinetic-rigid form PD, depression, hallucination, rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorder and severe olfactory deficits. Clinical features generally involve the same type of deficits as those found in MCI patients, which are more severe and more extensive. The phenomenology of the dementia syndrome is similar to that seen in dementia with Lewy bodies, and clinicopathological correlation studies have revealed varying results with regard to neurochemical deficits and the pathological substrate underlying cognitive impairment and dementia. Early cognitive impairment, particularly in the form of executive dysfunction, is indicative of mainly fronto-striatal pathologic changes and might originate during nigrostriatal and subsequent mesocortical dopamine denervation. A potential parallel noradrenergic deficit and cholinergic deficit disturbance in patients without dementia might also contribute to MCI. Extensive pathological changes in Lewy bodies lead to widespread cortical and subcortical degeneration and profound cholinergic deficits, and might lead to the development of dementia. Several studies have revealed a significant correlation between dementia and Alzheimer-type pathology.",

Unlike stroke, encephalitis or head injury, which lead to relatively circumscribed and stable brain damage, degenerative disorders often affect many regions of the brain. The widespread changes in brain structure and the multiple signs of cognitive impairment that result from such changes have led to a conceptualization of the degenerative dementias, and especially of Alzheimer's disease, as 'diffuse' pathological processes, but this is not strictly true. The degenerative dementias, including Alzheimer's disease, do not affect the entire cerebral cortex equally. Instead, the degenerative dementias are associated with varied profiles of anatomic involvement, which can be tracked by quantitative histopathological and neuroimaging techniques. Association and limbic regions suffer the brunt of the damage.",

      "title": "Ψυχωσικές εκδηλώσεις στην ιδιοπαθή νόσο του Πάρκινσον",
      "abstract": "Η ιδιοπαθής νόσος του Πάρκινσον αποτελεί μια σποραδικής εμφάνισης, αγνώστου αιτιολογίας, προιούσα κινητική νευροεκφυλιστική διαταραχή η οποία νευροπαθολογικά χαρακτηρίζεται από την απώλεια κυρίως ντοπαμινεργικού αλλά και άλλων νευρωνικών πληθυσμών στην περιοχή του μεσεγκεφάλου και από τη παρουσία σωμάτιων του Lewy σε συγκεκριμένες εγκεφαλικές περιοχές. Η νόσος όμως εμφανίζει και σημαντικότατες μη κινητικές κλινικές όψεις. Τα νευροψυχιατρικά συμπτώματα της νόσου – και ιδίως οι ψυχωσικές εκδηλώσεις, αποτελούν σημαντικότατο παράγοντα επιβάρυνσης της κινητικής συμπτωματολογίας, περαιτέρω έκπτωσης της λειτουργικότητας των παρκινσονικών πασχόντων και επιδείνωσης της ποιότητας ζωής τους, ενώ συντελούν σε μεγάλο βαθμό στην εξουθένωση των φροντιστών των πασχόντων και έχουν ενοχοποιηθεί – ιδίως οι ψυχωσικές εκδηλώσεις, για αυξημένους δείκτες νοσηρότητας αλλά και θνητότητας. Οι παρκινσονικοί πάσχοντες εμφανίζουν υψηλούς επιπολασμούς συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης και άλλων διαταραχών της διάθεσης, κόπωσης και απάθειας, αγχωδών συμπτωμάτων, συμπτωμάτων διαταραχών του ύπνου, διαταραχών του ελέγχου των παρορμήσεων και συνδρόμου δυσρύθμισης της ντοπαμίνης, συμπτωμάτων γνωσιακής έκπτωσης ή και άνοιας. Ο ακριβής αιτιοπαθογενετικός μηχανισμός της ψύχωσης στη νόσο του Πάρκινσον, παραμένει άγνωστος. Η κυρίαρχη προτεινόμενη ερμηνευτική υπόθεση για τη ψύχωση της νόσου του Πάρκινσον αφορά στη διαταραχή της μεσολιμβικής ντοπαμινεργικής οδού από την προοδευτική νευροεκφυλιστική διεργασία της νόσου. Η χορήγηση υποκαταστασιακής θεραπείας, προκαλεί ντοπαμινεργική διέγερση, η οποία επικαθήμενη στην «υπερευαισθησία από ελάττωση» των μεσολιμβικών και μεσοφλοιωδών υποδοχέων μπορεί να οδηγήσει σε ντοπαμινεργική υπερδιέγερση, επιτρέποντας έτσι την ανάδυση «θετικών» ψυχωσικών συμπτωμάτων, συνηθέστερα οπτικών ψευδαισθήσεων. Στο μηχανισμό συμβάλουν διαταραχές σε όλα τα βασικά νευροδιαβιβαστικά συστήματα, αλλά και διάφοροι ενδογενείς και εξωγενείς παράγοντες όπως συγκεκριμένοι παράγοντες κινδύνου και γενετική ευαλωτότητα. Ως παράγοντες κινδύνου για την ανάπτυξη ψύχωσης στη νόσο του Πάρκινσον αναφέρονται: χαρακτηριστικά της προνοσηρής προσωπικότητα, η γνωσιακή έκπτωση/άνοια, η μεγάλη ηλικία, η διάρκεια και η βαρύτητα της νόσου του Πάρκινσον, οι διαταραχές του ύπνου, η καταθλιπτική διαταραχή, οι οπτικές διαταραχές και η ίδια η ντοπαμινεργική υποκαταστασιακή θεραπεία. Οι ψυχωσικές εκδηλώσεις αφορούν σε ψευδαισθήσεις, παραληρητικές ιδέες και ελάσσονα ψυχωσικά φαινόμενα. Για τη διάγνωση της ψυχωσικής διαταραχής στη νόσο του Πάρκινσον απαιτείται η παρουσία τουλάχιστον ενός από τα παραπάνω συμπτώματα για διάστημα τουλάχιστον ενός μήνα ή κατά τη στιγμή της εξέτασης, εμφάνιση των συμπτωμάτων μετά από τη διάγνωση της νόσου του Πάρκινσον και αποκλεισμός άλλων διαταραχών. Η παρούσα μελέτη αφορά στην αναζήτηση, εντοπισμό και καταγραφή των ψυχωσικών εκδηλώσεων σε ένα πληθυσμό 150 παρκινσονικών πασχόντων καθώς επίσης και στη διερεύνηση πιθανών συσχετίσεων αυτής της συμπτωματολογίας με συγκεκριμένα χαρακτηριστικά και συγκεκριμένους προδιαθεσικούς παράγοντες για την ανάπτυξη ψύχωσης. Ψυχωσικές εκδηλώσεις ανευρέθησαν στο 24,6% του δείγματός μας (ψευδαισθήσεις στο 24,6%, παραληρητικές ιδέες στο 20,6% και ελάσσονα ψευδαισθητικά φαινόμενα στο 12,6%). Η εναισθησία των ψυχωσικών πασχόντων διατηρούνταν ανέπαφη σε ποσοστό 24,3%, επηρεασμένη σε ποσοστό 45,9%, ενώ δεν υπήρχε στο 29,7% των ασθενών. Στο 67,5% του δείγματός μας παρατηρήθηκε συννοσηρότητα με άλλες ψυχιατρικές διαταραχές. Η παρουσία ψυχωσικών εκδηλώσεων στους ασθενείς της μελέτης μας συσχετίστηκε, ως προς τα κλινικά χαρακτηριστικά των ασθενών, με τη βαρύτητα της κινητικής τους συμπτωματολογίας και το κλινικό στάδιο της νόσου του Πάρκινσον, με την ηλικία έναρξης της νόσου και την τωρινή ηλικία των πασχόντων. Ως προς το γνωσιακό status των πασχόντων η παρουσία ψύχωσης συσχετίστηκε με γνωσιακή έκπτωση και ιδίως με διαταραχές της οπτικοχωρικής αντιληπτικής ικανότητας, της στοχοκατευθυνόμενης δραστηριότητας και της εκτελεστικής λειτουργικότητας. Η παρουσία ψυχωσικών εκδηλώσεων συσχετίστηκε επίσης με διαταραχές της διάθεσης, με αγχώδη συμπτώματα και με άρση αναστολών, αλλά και με αυξημένη ψυχολογική επιβαρύνση των φροντιστών των πασχόντων. Τέλος οι διαταραχές του ύπνου των ψυχωσικών παρκινσονικών πασχόντων φαίνεται να συνδέονται με το στάδιο της νόσου και τη βαρύτητα των κινητικών συμπτωμάτων. Σε μοντέλο λογιστικής παλινδρόμησης, από μια σειρά προβλεπτικών παραγόντων (ηλικία, διάρκεια νόσου, στάδιο νόσου, αγωγή, διαταραχή REM ύπνου, γνωσιακή έκπτωση), μόνο το στάδιο της νόσου αναδείχθηκε ως σημαντικός παράγοντας για την παρουσία ψύχωσης. Τέλος, με βάση τα ευρήματα της διερευνητικής και επαληθευτικής παραγοντικής ανάλυσης, προτείνεται μια συστοιχία κλινικών (UPDRS, στάδιο νόσου) και ψυχομετρικών (DRS&lt; PANSS, PPRS, ερωτηματολόγιο ύπνου).",

      "abstract": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) can occur in the absence of any other obvious asso- ciated neurologic disorder or in association with a neurodegenerative disease, in which case it is considered as symptomatic RBD. RBD is frequently associated with Parkinson's disease (PD), Lewy body dementia or multiple system atrophy (MSA), and in several cases may even antedate the occurrence of motor symptoms by decades. When no neurologic disorder is obvious, RBD can be considered as idiopathic (iRBD). Several studies have looked at neurophysiologic and neuropsychological functions in iRBD and have found evidence of CNS dysfunc- tion during both wakefulness and sleep in a variable proportion of these patients, challenging the concept of iRBD. Identifying subjects with a high risk of developing a neurodegenerative process may be crucial in order to develop early intervention strategies. Some prospective results in iRBD showed that potential markers of neuro- degeneration are the following: 1) marked EEG slowing on spectral analysis; 2) decreased striatal 123I-FPCIT; 3) impaired color vision.",

The occurrence of vertigo may nonetheless represent the onset of an underlying neurological disease, even without other neurological signs. The paper presents the case of a teenager with acute/subacute onset of vertigo and nausea; the examination revealed horizontal nystagmus with clinical features suggesting a peripheral form and minimal coordination defect. However, the clinical picture and persistence of symptoms led to perform brain imaging (MRI), which showed inflammatory demyelinating lesions with no signs of chronicity. These signs allowed a clinically isolated syndrome belonging to the spectrum of multiple sclerosis related disorders to be diagnosed.",

      "abstract": "Vascular brain diseases are one of the leading causes of death and disability in developed countries. Along with acute disorders of cerebral circulation, chronic cerebrovascular disorders are of great medical and social importance, one of the main clinical manifestations is vascular cognitive impairments. The article discusses the pathogenetic and clinical variants of vascular cognitive impairments, presents their modern classification and approaches to diagnosis. The importance of the earliest possible diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairments is due to the fact that they can be one of the first manifestations of cerebrovascular insufficiency, before the development of clinically obvious strokes or cardiovascular diseases in general. Early diagnosis of vascular cognitive impairments is necessary both for the prevention of vascular and neurodegenerative dementia and for the prevention of strokes and other acute vascular episodes. A clinical example of non-stroke formation of mild vascular cognitive impairment is presented. Signs of cognitive impairments typical of chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency, such as a slowdown in the rate of mental activity and disorders of frontal executive functions in combination with behavioral and emotional disorders, are described. The article discusses the issues of treatment of vascular cognitive impairments, which should be comprehensive and include the correction of the underlying vascular disease, non-drug (regular physical activity, smoking cessation, cognitive training) and drug treatment methods aimed at improving cognitive functions. Possibilities of modern neuroprotective and symptomatic therapy of cognitive disorders, the place of EGb 761 ® in the treatment of vascular cognitive impairments are shown.",

      "abstract": "Актуальність. Сепсис, як реакція організму на інфекцію, включає такий етап розвитку, як синдром поліорганної недостатності (СПОН). Мозкова дисфункція в 70 % випадків є одним з перших симптомів сепсис-асоційованого СПОН, ще до клінічних проявів в інших системах життєзабезпечення. Сепсис-асоційована енцефалопатія — мультифокальне порушення функцій головного мозку за умови наявності інфекції, що супроводжується проявами системного запалення, але без клінічних і лабораторних доказів прямої причетності інфекції до пошкодження головного мозку. Залежно від критеріїв, покладених в основу діагностики, церебральна дисфункція-недостатність може бути виявлена в усіх хворих із сепсисом. Ступінь її вираженості корелює зі зростанням тяжкості септичного процесу. Сепсис-асоційована дисфункція-недостатність може бути незалежним предиктором летального кінця. Тяжкість церебральної дисфункції-недостатності коливається від летаргії і/або дезорієнтації до коми. Мета: вивчення впливу терапії відповідно до головних положень «Міжнародного керівництва з інтенсивної терапії сепсису та септичного шоку: 2016» із додатковою нейропротекцією Гліатиліном на перебіг септичного процесу й вираженість енцефалопатії в структурі синдрому поліорганної недостатності. Матеріали та методи. За період 2010–2015 рр. нами проведено контрольоване проспективне рандомізоване когортне дослідження на клінічній базі кафедри анестезіології та інтенсивної терапії ДЗ «Дніпропетровська медична академія МОЗ України» і на базі відділення інтенсивної терапії сепсису КП «Дніпропетровська обласна клінічна лікарня ім. І.І. Мечникова» ДОР». У дослідження було включено 22 пацієнти. У всіх хворих було проведено рутинні лабораторні дослідження для визначення рівня клінічних і біохімічних маркерів системного запалення й органних дисфункцій за шкалами SOFA і LIFE. Для оцінки стану свідомості використовували шкалу коми Глазго. Концентрацію цитокінів (фактор некрозу пухлини α, інтерлейкін-1, інтерлейкін-4, інтерферон α) у сироватці крові вивчали імуноферментним методом. Базисна інтенсивна терапія здійснювалася відповідно до основних положень «Міжнародного керівництва з інтенсивної терапії сепсису та септичного шоку: 2016» з додатковим використанням нейропротекторного препарату Гліатиліну (холіну альфосцерат) 1000–3000 мг на добу внутрішньовенно, розчиненого в 0,9% розчині натрію хлориду, протягом 5–10 днів. Дослідження показників проводилося в чотири етапи: на 1-шу, 3-тю, 5-ту, 7-му добу. Результати. Узагальнюючи результати дослідження, можливо сказати, що на п’яту й сьому добу були відсутні клінічні прояви синдрому системної запальної відповіді в понад 75 % хворих; зменшилася тяжкість стану за APACHE II на 72,5 і 74,5 % (p &lt; 0,001) і ступінь вираженості синдрому поліорганної недостатності за SOFA в 9 разів (p &lt; 0,001) відповідно до етапів дослідження. Церебральна недостатність, оцінена за шкалою коми Глазго, становила 15 балів на п’яту й сьому добу дослідження, що відповідало стану ясної свідомості в понад 75 % хворих. Зазначене спостерігалося на тлі тенденції до збалансованості активності прозапальних і протизапальних ланок цитокінової системи, про що свідчили максимальні значення фактора некрозу пухлини α та інтерферону α на п’яту добу спостереження при зниженні концентрації інтерлейкіну-1 на 55,8 % щодо фону. Прогнозована летальність у пацієнтів другої групи становила 51 %, фактична летальність — 7,5 %. Отже, шляхом проведення даного варіанта інтенсивної терапії вдалося знизити передбачувану летальність на 43,5 %.",

      "abstract": "One of the most common co-morbidities of cerebrovascular disorders is neuroinflammation, a hallmark and decisive contributor to many central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Although neuropathological conditions differ in etiology and in the way in which the inflammatory response is mounted, cellular and molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammation are probably similar in aging, hypertension, depression and cognitive impairment or after cerebral insult such as stroke. Moreover, a number of highly prevalent risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and atherosclerosis are increasingly understood to act as “silent contributors” to neuroinflammation – not only establishing the condition as a central pathophysiological mechanism, but also constantly fuelling it. Mild, but continuous neuroinflammation can provide the ground for disorders such as cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) and subsequent dementia. Acute neuroinflammation, often in the context of traumatic or ischemic CNS lesions, aggravates the acute damage and can lead to depression, post-stroke dementia and neurodegeneration. All of these sequelae impair recovery and provide the ground for further cerebrovascular events.",

In addition to the most commonly studied disorders of dementia, depression, and psychosis, other relatively common and clinically significant psychiatric complications include impulse control disorders, anxiety symptoms, disorders of sleep and wakefulness, and apathy. These problems may be underrecognized and are frequently undertreated. The emergent focus on nonmotor aspects of Parkinson's disease over the past quarter of a century is highlighted by a nonlinear increase in the number of articles published devoted to this topic. Although the development of newer antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics, and cholinesterase inhibitors in recent years has had a positive benefit on the management of these troublesome and distressing symptoms, responses are frequently suboptimal, and this remains an area of major unmet therapeutic need. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most common psychiatric complication associated with pregnancy and childbirth with debilitating symptoms that negatively impact the quality of life of the mother as well as inflict potentially long-lasting developmental impairments to the child. Much of the theoretical pathophysiology put forth to explain the emergence of PPD overlaps with that of major depressive disorder (MDD) and, although not conventionally described in such terms, can be seen as neurodegenerative in nature. Framing the disorder from the perspective of the well-established inflammatory theory of depression, symptoms are thought to be driven by dysregulation, and subsequent hyperactivation of the body's immune response to stress. Compounded by physiological stressors such as drastic fluctuations in hormone signaling, physical and psychosocial stressors placed upon new mothers lay bare a number of significant vulnerabilities, or points of potential failure, in systems critical for maintaining healthy brain function. The inability to compensate or properly adapt to meet the changing demands placed upon these systems has the potential to damage neurons, hinder neuronal growth and repair, and disrupt neuronal circuit integrity such that essential functional outputs like mood and cognition are altered. The impact of this deterioration in brain function, which includes depressive symptoms, extends to the child who relies on the mother for critical life-sustaining care as well as important cognitive stimulation, accentuating the need for further research.",

Some view depression as reactive to the physical disability inherent to Parkinson's disease; however, others view the depressive disorder as the direct result of underlying biochemical changes caused by the disease process. Abnormalities within the serotonin metabolic pathway have been observed in depressed patients with Parkinson's disease and may help to explain why this form of depressive disorder is so common and persistent. Other forms of depression share this biochemical alteration. Attempts to alleviate depression with serotonin agonists have proven successful. Current research efforts are exploring biological aspects of depression in Parkinson's disease and the epidemiology of this disorder as a model of depression in the elderly, medically ill patient.",

Mild cognitive impairment is a clinical state, sometimes prodromal to fully symptomatic AD, where cognitive deficit can be delineated by psychometric testing. AD pathogenesis is associated with progressive accumulation of a toxic and hydrophobic As peptide in the brain, which starts a number of years prior to the onset of clinical symptoms (yellow dotted line). This preclinical stage of the disease is dubbed the “brain AD stage”. Progressive accumulation of As in the brain results in a number of secondary pathological processes including neurofibrillary degeneration, inflammation, synaptic loss, and neuronal dropout, whose severity correlates with clinical symptoms of the disease (magenta dashed line).",

The extended definition includes interventions that slows or halt the progression of neuronal degeneration. This book will describe the natural mechanisms of neuroprotection, agents used as neuroprotectives and therapeutic neuroprotection in all neurological disorders where there is danger of progression of neurological damage regardless of the pathological process or clinical features. Prophylactic neuroprotection during anesthesia and surgery is also discussed. Neuroprotection may also be used for prevention of progression of a disease if it can be identified at a presymptomatic stage. The term neuroprotective, although an adjective, will be used as a noun in preference to neuroprotectant.",

Leur point commun est l'apparition d'une diminution de la force musculaire, notamment des muscles respiratoires conditionnant le pronostic vital. La survenue d'une insuffisance respiratoire est en general progressive et insidieuse. Son diagnostic repose sur des examens cliniques et para-cliniques. Pour la plupart de ces pathologies, il n’existe aucun traitement curatif.

Son indication au long cours peut se poser de differentes manieres : soit au decours d'une decompensation respiratoire aigue revelatrice de la maladie ou survenant en l'absence de suivi, soit de facon programmee (le cas le plus frequent) dans le cadre d’un suivi pluridisciplinaire. Les criteres d'indication retenus sont l’existence d’au moins un signe clinique evoquant une atteinte respiratoire, associee a une PaCO2 > 45 mmgH ou a une CV < 50% ou a une desaturation nocturne. Toutefois ces indications sont a nuancer en fonction de la pathologie et de la clinique.

      "abstract": "Context: Cerebral malaria, acute malarial encephalitis due to Plasmodium falciparum: is an acute brain injury whose outcome may be fatal can lead to polymorphic neurological sequelae: hemiplegia / hemiparesis, speech disorders (motor aphasia de Broca, Sensory aphasia of Wernicke), behavioral disturbances, cognitive impairment, blindness, secondary epilepsy. In Africa Sub-Saharan, and more particularly in the DRC, Neuropalaria, knows a high frequency of neurological lesions with a very high lethality and the seriousness of their repercussions on the fate of the children who are victims of it. The neuropathological severity of acute malarial cerebral aggression is correlated with the high parasite density, with the phenomena of sequestration and cytoadherence, the inflammatory process, the presence of the factors of bad prognosis or ACSOS, the diagnostic and therapeutic delay; and the antimalarials, do not modify the evolutionary process of neurological lesions and those of sequelae. An approach Neuroadapted therapy (Citicholine and neuroregulators) introduced in our patients, from the acute phase (from D0: in first 24 hours / first 6 hours +++ to 7 days), until the stabilization phase (D0- 30 days), allowed us to: Improve perfusion of the areas of ischemic brain suffering, regulation of cerebral metabolism (aerobic glycolysis +++) and reduction of cerebral edema (vasogenic, cytotoxic +++); delay the evolution of the destruction of the neuronal membrane and neuronal degeneration; limit and block ischemic cascades leading to neuronal necrosis; Improve the prognosis and dramatic rapid recovery, speech recovery and significant reduction in other neurological sequelae, but also death-mortality. To date, acute malarial encephalitis should be considered in mind as a normotensive ischemic stroke. post-infectious, until proven guilty, in the light of the neuroanatomo-clinical correlation, of the neurophysio- pathologies induced in acute and secondary cerebral aggression. Goal: Management of acute malarial encephalitis and its acute complications, and to propose a Neuroadapted therapeutic approach, by demonstrating the action of Citicholine and neuroregulators on Broca's area. Methodology: A serial study of cases admitted to the Emergency and Neuropediatrics Department for acute malarial encephalitis complicated by aphasia de Broca and other neurological sequelae. Results: In the absence of certain medical files available and in the insufficiency of clinical and para-clinical data found in certain records, of the 30 patients registered for acute malarial encephalitis complicated by neurological deficits during the period of March 2021, we describe that two cases of Broca's Aphasia on Acute Malarial Encephalitis in two patients born and residing in DRC, Kinshasa. The first case; a 9-year-old male child admitted to the neuropediatric emergency room for tonic-clonic seizures and headaches, in his antecedents, no notion of previous seizure episode, no convulsors and epileptics in the family. Treatment received elsewhere, Quinine, Ciprofloxacin and Diazepam; In whom we note mainly at physical examination, Heart rate at 140 bpm, Respiratory rate at 40 cpm, Temperature at 38 ° C, Coma with convulsions Tonic-clinical, febrile on palpation, colored eyelid conjunctivae and anicteric bulbar conjunctiva, an abdomen not bloated, sensitive to medium ureteral points and without organomegaly, Deep coma, Soft neck and no signs of neuro-irritations meningeal, isocoric and reflective pupils. On paraclinical examination, Hb at 12 g / l, occasional glycemia at 109 mg / dl, GE: Tropho +++, GB: 16000 elt and FL: N60% L40%; Widal (TH: 1/160, TO: 1/160), Blood ionogram, CT-brain scan and emergency EEG not performed, a treatment was initiated: made of injectable Artesunate (H0-H72), Oritaxim, Amikacin, Ciprofloxacin, a maintenance infusion :( SG5% + electrolytes + Nootropyl + Azantac) and feeding by gavage. The evolution would be marked on D5-D7 by an awakening initiated with Brocas motor aphasia, right hemiparesis, CT scan of the brain, performed: Left frontal hypodensity zone. Under Citicholine(Somazina) and Neuroregulators (Gamalate B6, Surmenalite), resumption of language 24 hours later, with end of tremors (impairment of central gray nuclei) under Artane ½ tablet for 7 days with a good spectacular development. File close and exit authorized with Trausan, Surmenalite and Gamalate B6 for 1 month; an appointment in 1 month with a cerebral CT-scan control. The second case; she is a 27-year-old patient, admitted for temporo-spatial disorientation and headache. contributory, in whom the clinical examination notes a BP: 158/87 mm Hg, HR: 112bpm, FR: 24 cpm, patient with temporal disorientation spatial, EG altered by suffering mine, Colored eyelid conjunctiva and bulbar anicteric, on normal gynecological examination, on neurological examination; flexible neck and no signs of neuro-meningeal irritation, isocoric and reflective pupils. At the exam paraclinical; GE: Tropho +; incidental blood sugar: 112 mg / dl, Hb: 12 g / l, ESR: 60mm / H, GB: 12200elt, FLN62% L38%, Urinary sed (GB: 5-10 / elt, EC: 5-10 / elt), treatment with Artesunate, promethazine, ceftrin plus. The evolution was marked by a motor aphasia of Broca, a few hours after admission, a cerebral CT scan was urgently requested, not carried out given the financial situation patient, and she was on citicholine (Somazina) as a continuous infusion with antioxidants (VIT C, VIT E) in emergency, neurosedation with phenobarbital. On day 1 of hospitalization, i.e. 24 hours of hospitalization later, we observed the resumption of speech with temporo-spatial orientation, and vital signs in physiological norms. File close and exit authorized with Somazina tablet, Gamalate B6, Overmenalitis for 1 month. Conclusion: Before any case of acute malarial encephalitis (cerebral malaria), it is of interest to add the neuroregulatory therapeutic regimen; improving the prognosis (rapid recovery), preventing the occurrence of neurological complications often irreversible and reduced morbidity and mortality. And Antimalarials, do not modify the evolutionary process of destruction neuronal and neurological sequelae.",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

There seems to be a predisposition for involvement of groups of muscles innervated by cranial nerves. The causation is unknown, but it is believed that there is such an insufficiency of acetylcholine or some like substance at the myoneural junction that the neuromotor impulse is not transmitted across the junction. It has been postulated that this fault is caused either by underproduction of the choline-like substance at the motor end plates or by an accelerated disposal of it by an overabundance of acetylcholine esterase, a substance whose normal function is to destroy acetylcholine. 2 This disease is no regarder of sex, approximately equal numbers of males and of females being affected.",

      "title": "Evaluating a Child with Partial Developmental Delay (ParDD), Global Developmental Delay (GDD)/Mental Retardation (MR): Clinical Expertise Based or Evidence-Based?",
      "abstract": "Developmental delay (DD) is a commonly encountered clinical problem. Nearly most children with neurodevelopmental disorders present with developmental delay. The ultimate diagnosis may take months or even years to be confirmed. The final verdict may be purely developmental with a benign outcome, or there might be slow deterioration ending up in a more sinister cause like neurodegenerative diseases. At times, the developmental course might plateau off with the final developmental outcome underachieved. With standardized assessment at a later age, these children could then be labeled as suffering from \"mental retardation (MR) or \"intellectual disability\" (ID). Thus, the crucial issue during the process of making the final diagnosis for any child presenting with developmental delay is when can one decide that an etiological diagnosis can confidently be made during the phase of development. When can one be really sure that there is no underlying organic cause to account for the developmental delay. Often than not, the clinician is faced with the dilemma of how exhaustive one should persue in investigating a case of DD, and when to stop investigating further. It is very important for us to develop a logical and practical approach in managing these DD children at the \"first\" presentation and to establish ones clinical judgment to find the \"Best timing\" for referral or diagnostic workup. The first step to the approach is the awareness and the differentiation of Partial Developmental Delay (ParDD) from Global Developmental Delay (GDD). We aim to provide the readers an understanding of a practical and evidence based approach for the diagnostic evaluation of a child with DD/MR. We hope this approach can help to improve the diagnostic yield of DD/MR.

      "abstract": "Status epilepticus (SE) is defined as a condition characterized by an epileptic seizure that is so frequently repeated or so prolonged as to create a fixed and lasting condition. Any type of epileptic seizure can develop into SE. Status epilepticus can be classified as generalized convulsive, non-convulsive and simple partial. Generalized convulsive SE includes tonic clonic seizures with either a partial or a generalized onset. Generalized tonic clonic status is defined when consecutive seizures occur without recovery of consciousness between them. Generalized tonic clonic SE is a medical emergency associated with a high morbidity and mortality if untreated. The most common etiology of SE is non-compliance to antiepileptic drugs. Other causes include alcohol withdrawal, cerebrovascular lesions, drug intoxication, central nervous system infections, neoplasms and acute metabolic derangements. The metabolic-biochemical complication of SE includes respiratory and metabolic acidosis, anoxia, hyperazotemia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia and autonomic and endocrine dysfunctions. Prognosis of SE depends on the duration and etiology of SE. Vigorous treatment of SE is recommended. Effective medical treatment of SE includes Benzodiazepines, Phenytoin, Barbiturates and several other new antiepileptic drugs. In this presentation, we discuss the updated management of SE and propose a protocol for management of convulsive SE.",

      "abstract": "Partial seizures, the most frequent type of epilepsy at all ages, remain a distinct yet relatively understudied disorder in early life. Their true incidence has not been defined, despite an extremely unfavorable long-term prognosis. They differ from partial seizures presenting later in life in several important aspects and are prone to misdiagnosis because of the difficulties inherent in recognizing subtle seizure manifestations and in assessing level of consciousness in very young patients. Most seizures are symptomatic of assorted prenatally acquired hemispheric insults; perinatal damage and tumors are less common. Video-electroencephalographic studies indicate that the majority of ictal events consist of behavioral arrest, stereotyped automatisms, and motor phenomena. Oroalimentary and gross motor automatisms are frequent, whereas highly organized gestural and behavioral sequences are extremely rare. Lateralized or asymmetric tonic, clonic, and occasional myoclonic motor manifestations characterize the majority of episodes. Pure behavioral arrest is much less common. These seizure patterns imply immaturity of systems responsible for inhibiting access to motor pathways and for organizing motor expression. Ictal and interictal epileptiform discharges are often focal or lateralized but lack age-specific features. Although as a rule partial seizures persist, some individuals display generalized or mixed seizure disorders in later life.",

The classical motor symptoms of PD include bradykinesia, rest tremor, muscular rigidity and postural impairment. Apart from the typical motor symptoms, PD is characterized by a wide range of different non-motoric symptoms like depression, dementia, speech disorders, sleep disorders and autonomic dysfunction. Clinical diagnosis of PD is based on the presence of parkinsonian motor features and dopaminergic imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are used to confirm the diagnosis and to distinguish PD from other similar diseases. Available medications for PD only treat symptoms of the disease trying to control motor features and to improve the quality of life of patients.\r\nParkinson’s rating scales have an important role in clinical practice. They are used to assess the degree of disease-related disability, for monitoring and predicting further progression of the disease and to help to evaluate the efficiency of the therapeutic procedures. Generally, they can be divided into those related to motor manifestations and to those evaluating non-motoric symptoms. However, the best results and an accurate insight into the patient's health condition can only be obtained by their combination. The most well established and widely used rating scale is the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale – UPDRS, which combines elements of both motor and nonmotor scales. Many clinical trials have proven that the UPDRS demonstrates high internal consistency and reliability, shows moderate to good validity and has a stable factor structure. The second two most used rating scales are the Hoehn-Yahr Scale (HY) and Schwab and England Scale (SE-ADL), which demonstrate similar validity and reliability as the UPDRS.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Motor restlessness, characterised by an irresistible urge to move about, can be a manifestation of many underlying disorders. Unfortunately, it is often poorly recognised and underdiagnosed in clinical practice, possibly because patients do not seek medical attention, or their complaints were thought to be secondary to anxiety. While the two major conditions to consider are restless legs syndrome and neuroleptic‐induced akathisia, there are many other differential diagnoses. We provide a concise review of the clinical features and diagnostic pitfalls of these conditions. A proper detailed clinical history and examination can often help clinch the diagnosis, as most of these conditions have their unique clinical features.",

Wśród dzieci i młodzieży rozpowszechnienie PLE prawdopodobnie zależy od wieku i jest większe wśród osób młodszych niż u starszych adolescentów. Zaburzenia podobne do psychotycznych bywają traktowane jako element poszerzonego fenotypu psychozy – według niektórych badań czynniki ryzyka występowania PLE są zbliżone do czynników ryzyka rozwoju schizofrenii. Inne prace sugerują, że występowanie PLE jest związane z ryzykiem występowania innych objawów psychopatologicznych, między innymi objawów depresyjnych, tendencji suicydalnych i nieprawidłowego funkcjonowania w różnych obszarach. Niewykluczone, że PLE są związane z ryzykiem rozwoju psychozy, dotyczy to jednak niewielkiego odsetka osób badanych; wydaje się natomiast, że występowanie PLE jest również czynnikiem ryzyka rozwoju innych zaburzeń psychicznych. U większości dzieci i adolescentów doświadczających PLE doznania te ustępują w toku obserwacji. PLE prawdopodobnie są zjawiskiem heterogennym, obejmującym zarówno podtyp związany z ryzykiem rozwoju psychozy, objawy wynikające z innym zaburzeń psychicznych jak i doznania mieszczące się w obszarze normy.

This is not surprising, because just the words “infectious disease” tend to conjure up ideas ranging an average flu to more extreme symp- toms such as open sores or epidemics like the Black Death that swept through medieval Europe. A less common category of symptoms that often stem from these diseases are neurological complications, which can be far more serious and often deadlier than the rest if the disease is left to develop without treatment. Neurological components of infectious disease are symptoms that result when the disease attacks the brain or central nervous system. These symptoms vary in severity; they can cause headaches due to swelling of brain tissue and increased pressure, mental psy- chosis and atypical behavior, or an overall decrease in will we be able to prevent their spread and the ostra- cism of victims. T uberculosis : T he W hite P lague Although it is usually the unique and characteris- tic complications of each infectious disease that cause illness and eventually death, neurological symptoms have been historically perplexing as they are not read- ily apparent at the first signs of infection. Tuberculosis can present such seemingly unexplainable symptoms. The disease was previously and popularly known as “Consumption” because it seemed to consume the body from within, in addition to being coined the “White Plague” due to the pallor of victims’ faces. Spread through the air by coughs and sneezes, it is caused by mycobacterium and primarily affects the lungs in 75% of cases. Children or immunosuppressed individuals, however, may become infected in other areas, including the central nervous system (Golden and Vikram 2005). A common manifestation of the disease in these populations is meningitis, or inflammation of the meninges, which is the protective covering of the brain and spinal cord. The mycobacteria that cause Tubercu- losis travel to the brain and attack the tissues of the meninges, caus- ing them to swell as an inflamma- tory response. The most common symptoms are severe headache and fever, but if not treated quickly with antibiotics, epilepsy, deafness, and cognitive deficits can develop due to the pressure of the swelling inside the skull (Saez-Llorens and McCracken 2003). Tuberculosis became known as the major killer during the Industrial Revolution and was cited by fa- mous authors such as Edgar Allen Poe, who suffered many familial losses from the disease. The neurologi- cal symptoms were often overlooked during the era because the disease itself was poorly understood and no treatment had yet been discovered. Tuberculosis victims were thought to be crazed vampires, prey- B S J “Tuberculosis victims were thought to be crazed vampires, preying on their infected family members one by one and coughing up their blood. They often suffered from epileptic attacks and amnesic symptoms.” brain function due to the deterioration of brain tissue by disease-infected cells. In some cases, neurological symptoms are quite rare, as they present themselves years after infection. However, these complications are quite serious and especially prevalent in particu- lar diseases. Throughout history, there have been epi- sodes of contagious diseases causing mass hysteria not only due to their rapid spread and deadliness, but also to the resulting extreme mental and behavioral changes that were so poorly understood.

      "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop a range of non-motor symptoms (NMS). Sleep disturbance is one of the common NMS of PD and the onset of sleep disorders often precede the onset of motor symptoms of PD. Motor symptoms of PD often receive the main clinical focus and the sleep disturbances often go unnoticed in clinical practice. Given that the prevalence of PD is higher in the elderly population, primary care physicians, geriatricians, and gerontologists are usually the first point of contact for a majority of patients with PD. Because of this, it is important that they have a clear understanding about the diagnosis and management of the sleep disturbances in PD. This review provides an overview of the full spectrum of sleep disturbances in PD that includes insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movements, and obstructive sleep apnea. Although these sleep disorders may be primarily associated with PD, it is crucial to delineate the other treatable causes of sleep disturbances such as side effects of medications and physical symptoms not related to PD. This review highlights the major sleep disorders observed in patients with PD and succinctly discusses their management aspects. In addition, we have briefly described the effect of deep brain stimulation on the natural course of several sleep disorders in PD in this article.",

      "abstract": "Polyneuropathies can be classified as either primarily demyelinating or axonal, and further as hereditary or acquired. It is important to recognize acquired neuropathies because some are amenable to treatment. Clinical findings and electrophysiology are used in the routine diagnosis of these conditions. Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is a helpful supplementary diagnostic tool. This article discusses the typical clinical findings, electrophysiology findings, and MRN appearances of common hereditary or acquired neuropathies such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, and postsurgical neuropathy.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Psychotic symptoms could be first presentation of neurological disorder before the appearance of cognitive and motor disturbance. This can lead to diagnosis of psychiatric illness in early phase and later appearance of motor disturbances could be seen as a side effect of anti-psychotic medications, leading to the delayed diagnosis of primary neurological disorder. The objective of this case to present a patient diagnosed initially with schizophrenia but careful consideration of pattern of motor abnormality and cognitive decline resulted in final diagnosis of Huntington disease behind schizophrenia.  Methods: A patient of schizophrenia with cognitive decline and motor disturbance was investigated for the possibility of an undiagnosed neurological disorder.  Results: Decline in patient’s cognitive functions appeared to be rapid and severe as compared to relatively short duration of diagnosed psychiatric illness. Also motor abnormality of ataxia and choroeathtoid movements after improvement in features suggestive of antipsychotic induced parkinsonism, ie. bradykinesia, rigidity and tremors do not appear to be explained by psychotic illness only. Later, genetic testing for CAG trinucleotide repeats resulted in a primary diagnosis of Huntington disease. Conclusion: The index case suggests the need for analysis of motor abnormality and cognitive decline in a patient with a diagnosis of psychotic illness before attributing them to be the consequence of psychiatric illness. Whenever there is suspicion, further assessment for a neurological disorder should be performed, which may provide the opportunity for early diagnosis and accurate treatment of both entities.

Due to the anatomical complexity and the functions of the nerve, both sensory, motor, and autonomic, other alterations can be added to pain in any of the innervated territories. Thus, it can present only with pelvic pain or accompanied by urinary symptoms, alterations to defecation or sexual dysfunction. The diagnosis is mainly clinical, supported by the Nantes and Bautrant criteria. The best treatment scheme is sequential and comprises the following stages: stage 1 or self-care and pharmacological, stage 2 or perineural injections, and stage 3 or pudendal nerve decompression surgery. The most common cause of damage to PN is traumatic in origin. Endometriosis has been described as a possible cause of sacral radiculopathy.

Parkinson biasanya terjadi pada usia 65 hingga 70 tahun. Kasus sebelum usia 40 tahun terjadi kurang dari 5%. Patologi pada PD ditandai oleh hilangnya intervasi neuron dopaminergik di subsantia nigra. Neurodegerasi PD tidak terbatas hanya pada neuron dopaminergik di substantia nigra, namun juga melibatkan sel-sel yang berlokasi di area otak lain yang saling terkoneksi. Gangguan motorik terjadi pada PD. Namun, seiring dengan perkembangan penyakit, dapat terjadi gangguan non-motorik seperti penurunan indra penciuman, disfungsi otonom, nyeri, kelelahan, gangguan tidur, gangguan kognitif dan psikiatrik. Penurunan kognitif, dalam bentuk penurunan fungsi eksekutif, visuospasial dan memori, serta demensia, merupakan aspek gangguan non-motorik dari penyakit parkinson. Hal tersebut berefek secara signifikan terhadap kualitas hidup penderita PD. Pemahaman terkait patologi yang mendasari penurunan kognitif pada PD memungkinkan dilakukannya intervensi dini dalam pencegahan perkembangan PD yang mengarah pada gangguan non-motorik. Neuropatologis utama PD adalah keberadaan Lewy bodies yang mengandung α-synuclein dan hilangnya neuron dopaminergik di substantia nigra, yang bermanifestasi penurunan fasilitasi gerakan sadar. Sejalan dengan perkembangan PD, patologi Lewy bodies menyebar ke daerah neokortikal dan kortikal. Neurodegenerasi daerah kortikal dan limbik yang luas, deposisi Lewy bodies, neuroinflamasi, small vascular disease (SVD), dan faktor genetik terlibat dalam penurunan fungsi kognitif pada PD.",

Peripheral nerves are not invariably involved in patients with this disease, but as they are involved in thiamine‐deficiency states it is conjectured that the presence or absence of peripheral neuropathy in patients with subacute necrotising encephalopathy may distinguish those with thiamine triphosphate deficiency from those in whom the disease is due to other causes. RÉSUMÉ Neuropathie périphérique dans l'encéphalomyélopathie de Leigh L'auteur rapporte le cas d'un nourrisson présentant une encéphalopathie nécrosante subaigue chez qui des vitesses de conduction lentes dans les nerfs moteurs suggéraient l'existence d'une neuropathie périphérique. Les nerfs périphériques ne sont pas obligatoirement atteints dans l'affection envisagée, mais comme ils le sont dans les états de déficience en thiamine, il est supposé que la présence ou l'absence de neuropathie périphérique chez les malades atteints d'encéphalopathie nécrosante subaigue peut différencier les cas liés à une déficience en thiamine triphosphate de ceux dûs à une autre cause. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Periphere Neuropathie bei der Leigh'schen Enzephalopathie Es wird über einen Säugling mit subakuter nekrotisierender Enzephalopathie berichtet, bei dem eine verlangsamte Nervenleitgeschwindigkeit auf eine periphere Neuropathie hinwies. Die peripheren Nerven sind bei Patienten mit dieser Erkrankung nicht immer betroffen, aber da sie betroffen sind bei Fällen mit Thiamin Mangel wird vermutet, daß das Vorliegen bzw. nicht Vorliegen einer peripheren Neuropathie bei Patienten mit subakuter nekrotisierender Enzephalopathie die Fälle mit einem Thiamintriphosphat Mangel gegen solche abgrenzt, bei denen die Erkrankung andere Ursachen hat. RESUMEN Neuropatia periférica en la encefalomielopatia de Leigh Se describe un niño con una encefalopatia necrotizante subaguda, en que la reducción en la velocidad de conduction sugirió la presencia de una neuropatía periférica. Los nervios periféricos no están invariablemente afectados en pacientes con esta enfermedad, pero como lo están en estados de deficiencia de tiamina, se piensa que la presencia o ausencia de neuropatía periférica en pacientes con encefalopatía necrotizante subaguda puede distinguir los casos con deficiencia de trifosfato de tiamina de aquellos debidos a otras causas.",

Although PD is associated with a variety of Non-motor symptoms (NMS) in virtually all patients including hyposmia, constipation, pain and sleep disturbances. It is age related disorder and affects more than 6 million population every year. It is associated with neuronal degeneration in substantia nigra and to lesser extent, in the globus pallidus, putamen and caudate nucleus. The degeneration of the neurons of the substantia nigra that send their axons to the corpus striatum results in reduction in the release of neurotransmitter dopamine with in corpus striatum. This leads to hypersensitivity of the dopamine receptors in the post synaptic neurons in the striatum. Individuals have characteristics signs and symptoms tremors, bradykinesia, postural instabilities, rigidity. Neither loss of sense nor muscle power is usually seen in such cases. Deep tendon, Superficial and Abdominal reflexes are well retained on evaluation. There has been various types of classification in Parkinsonism which are described later. Together with aging, genetics, environment and the role of biological sex as important factor in development of PD has been widely discussed in the past decade. Investigations in PD remains a challenge, recent studies included 7 Tesla MRI, PET and SPECT have proved to be confirmatory in diagnosis of PD. Parkinsonism disease treatment includes increasing the levels of dopamine in brain by giving its immediate precursor L-dopa which can easily cross blood brain barrier unlike dopamine. Evidence of slowing the process of degeneration has been seen with drug selegiline. Other than drugs surgical options include pallidotomy",

These non-motor symptoms affect large population of patients and can appear sometimes before the motor disorders. The non-motor symptoms include mainly neuropsychological difficulties, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and autonomic disorders, but involve also pain and sleep disturbances for example. Depression may occur at any stage of the disease, and consists in major depressive disorder, minor depressive disorder, and dysthymia. During the course of the disease, 50% of patients experience anxiety. Apathy is present in up to 30-40% of patients, due to loss of motivation, appearing in emotional, intellectual and behavioral domains. Dopamine dysregulation syndrome and impulse control disorders are not rare, and in relation with dopaminergic therapies. Impulse control disorders include pathological gambling, hyper sexuality, compulsive shopping, and eating disorder. Visual hallucinations can occur in 30% of patients, mostly induced by dopaminergic therapies. Often, they have deeper impact on the quality of life than the motor symptoms themselves, which stay the focus of attention during consulting. Identifying those can help in providing better care with a positive impact on the quality of life of the patients.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases affecting peripheral nerves. The causes are multiple: hereditary, metabolic, infectious, inflammatory, toxic, traumatic. The temporal profile includes acute, subacute and chronic conditions. The majority of peripheral neuropathies cause mainly muscle weakness and sensory loss, positive sensory symptoms and sometimes pain. When pain is present, however, it is usually extremely intense and among the most disabling symptoms for the patients. In addition, the neurological origin of the pain is often missed and patients receive inadequate or delayed specific treatment. Independently of the disease causing the peripheral nerve injury, pain originating from axonal pathology or ganglionopathy privileges neuropathies affecting smaller fibres, a clinical observation that points towards abnormal activity within nociceptive afferents as a main generator of pain. Natural activation of blood vessels or perineurial nociceptive network by pathology also causes intense pain. Pain of this kind, i.e. nerve trunk pain, is among the heralding symptoms of inflammatory or ischemic mononeuropathy and for its intensity represents itself a medical emergency. Neuropathic pain quality rekindles the psychophysical experience of peripheral nerves intraneural microstimulation i.e. a combination of large and small fibres sensation temporally distorted compared to physiological perception evoked by natural stimuli. Pins and needles, burning, cramping mixed with numbness, and tingling are the wording most used by patients. Nociceptive pain instead is most often described as aching, deep and dull. Good command of peripheral nerve anatomy and pathophysiology allows timely recognition of the different pain components and targeted treatment, selected according to intensity, type and temporal profile of the pain.",

Parkinson hastalığı ortalama 55-60 yaşlarında başlamakta, görülme sıklığı 15-250/100.000 arasında değişmektedir. Türkiye'de yapılan çalışmalarda görülme sıklığı 202/100.000 olarak belirtilmiştir. Başlıca belirtileri bradikinezi, istirahat tremoru, rijidite ve postüral instabilite olan Parkinson hastalığında serotonerjik, noradrenerjik, kolinerjik ve otonomik sistemin de etkilenmesi hastada nöropsikiyatrik semptomlara, otonom bozukluklara, uyku bozukluklarına ve duyusal belirtilere yol açmaktadır. Bu durum postür, denge ve yürüyüş bozukluklarına neden olmaktadır. Parkinson hastalığına özgü yürüyüş bozuklukları kas zayıflığı, aktivite limitasyonu, fiziksel inaktivite ve fonksiyonel açıdan kısıtlılık meydana getirerek bireylerin yaşam kalitesini olumsuz yönde etkilemektedir. Parkinson hastalığında hasta merkezli rehabilitasyonu sağlamak için hasta tercihlerine cevap veren tedavi yaklaşımını hedeflemek gerekir. Bu nedenle günlük yaşam aktivitelerinde algılanan zorlukların değerlendirilmesi aşamasında performansa yönelik ve hasta bildirimli sonuç ölçümlerinin bir arada ele alınması büyük önem taşımaktadır. Bu çalışmanın amacı, Parkinsonlu bireylerde aktivite limitasyonu ve fonksiyonel mobiliteyi değerlendiren en uygun hasta bildirimli sonuç ölçümleri ve performansa yönelik sonuç ölçümleri ile ilgili literatür bilgisini derlemek ve ileride yapılacak klinik ve araştırma çalışmalarına ışık tutmaktır.",

      "abstract": "Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) usually progresses insidiously with lower motor neuron-type weakness, minimal or no sensory symptoms. Diagnostic criteria include motor conduction block (CB) at sites not exposed to compression or entrapment. CBs may persist or reverse irrespective of clinical outcome. Acute onset with generalized weakness is uncommon. We report four patients who presented acutely areflexia, pure motor deficits without sensory disturbances, multifocal CBs persisting at the same motor nerves on serial electrophysiological studies. Three patients had preceding infections; two showed IgM reactivity against the ganglioside GM1. Intravenous immuneglobulin (IVIg) improved or stabilized symptoms. Patients 2,3,4 receive maintenance therapy with IVIg for years. Acute-onset MMN (AMMN) should be differentiated from other immune-mediated neuropathies such as acute inflammatory polyneuropathy either demyelinating (AIDP) or axonal (AMAN), acute motor conduction block neuropathy (AMCBN), acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). The correct diagnosis deserves implications for patient long-term treatment and prognosis. Moreover, the authors address the problem of defining the spectrum of MMN particularly in the acute setting.",

Cognitive impairment is frequently linked to the presence of lacunes and white matter changes. The cognitive impairment consists mainly of disturbances of executive functions sometimes leading to dementia. It is mainly due to interruption of the frontal-subcortical neuronal circuits. Seizures are also observed in patients with lacunes and white matter changes. Although lacunes cannot be considered as the cause of the seizures, there is a relationship between the occurrence of cognitive impairment and seizures. Repeated seizures promote further cognitive decline. However, the development of dementia in patients with late-onset epilepsy is most probably not directly due to the lacunes but rather due to Alzheimer's disease or to cortical cerebrovascular lesions. The development of lacunes should only be the aggravating factor for the cognitive decline as demonstrated in the Nun study.",

      "title": "Mild Parkinsonian signs: An overview of an emerging concept",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mild Parkinsonian signs (MPS) include gait and balance changes, rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. MPS can occur commonly during the clinical examination of older people who do not have known neurological disease, with prevalence estimates for MPS as a whole ranging from 15% to 95%. MPS are generally progressive and they are coupled with functional difficulties, impaired gait and balance, and increased risks of mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and mortality. The mechanistic basis for these signs is unclear, but is likely to be multifactorial, with possible factors including an age‐associated decline in dopaminergic nigrostriatal activity, the early development of neurodegenerative (Lewy body or Alzheimer's type) pathologies in the basal ganglia, or the accumulation of vascular pathology in the brain. It would be valuable to identify those individuals with MPS who are at increased risk for the development of future Alzheimer's disease, full‐blown Parkinson's disease, or strokes, and to develop therapeutic strategies to intervene to lessen the likelihood of MPS‐related morbidity and mortality. © 2007 Movement Disorder Society",

The four main phenotypes of motor neuron disease, based upon the site of origin and the severity of neurological involvement, are as follows: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy, progressive muscular atrophy, and primary lateral sclerosis.Other systems used for the classification of this disease have used the site of onset (spinal or bulbar onset), degree of adherence to the El-Escorial (and Airlie house) criteria, and pattern of heritability (sporadic versus familial) as criteria for characterizing this neurodegenerative illness with a complex genetic basis. MND has been shown to be a disease of middle age with a mean age of 58 to 63 years at the time of onset for sporadic Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and 40-60 years of age for familial ALS. There has been a growing ethical debate along with pleas to formulate policies pertaining to the provision of Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide by the families of patients and their advocates, which has brought the discussion surrounding this disease into the public domain.",

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

Etiologija bolesti jos uvijek nije poznata, ali se pretpostavlja da je Parkinsonova bolest rezultat utjecaja razlicitih kombinacija genetskih i okolisnih cimbenika. Dijagnoza bolesti postavlja se na temelju klinicke slike. Glavni, motoricki znakovi bolesti su tremor u mirovanju, rigor, bradikinezija i posturalna nestabilnost koji uzrokuju poteskoce za osobu koja se sa njima susrece u svakodnevnim aktivnostima. Napredovanje intenziteta simptoma i same bolesti razlicito je kod svake osobe. Bolesnici hodaju sitnim koracima, nagnuti prema naprijed, bez spontanih kretnji ruku tijekom hoda, osiromasene mimike lica, tesko zapocinju određenu kretnju, pojavljuju se neželjena ubrzanja u govoru i kretanju sto dovodi do cestih padova. Iznimno je važno na vrijeme otkriti bolest, kako bi se sto prije zapocelo lijecenje i ucinkovitije smanjili simptomi bolesti. Fizioterapijska intervencija, koja zapocinje kvalitetnom procjenom, mora sadržavati sve komponente koje ce kroz intervenciju donijeti boljitak za pacijenta. Nakon procjene izrađuje se plan fizioterapijske intervencije koja treba biti individualno prilagođena svakom pacijentu. Vježbe disanja, vježbe koordinacije i balansa, vježbe izdržljivosti i vježbe povecanja mobilnosti, te medicinska masaža neke su od oblika fizioterapijske intervencije u lijecenju Parkinsonove bolesti. Osim standardnog terapijskog tretmana pacijenti oboljeli od Parkinsonove bolesti služe se i komplementarnim metodama lijecenja od kojih veliku važnost imaju akupunktura, Bowen tehnika, Shiatsu masaža, Tai Chi, joga, muzikoterapija, terapija plesom i osteopatija. Iako velik broj takvih postupaka bilježi dugacku povijest koristenja, znanost do danas nije uspjela odgonetnuti mehanizme djelovanja i sa sigurnoscu potvrditi njihovu ucinkovitost.",

      "abstract": "Recent investigations of cognitive and behavioral function in myotonic dystrophy appear to counter a number of the prevailing notions regarding this disorder. Myotonic dystrophy is characterized neither by intellect outside the range of normal (except in those infrequent cases of neonatal myotonic dystrophy) nor by intellectual deterioration. Apparent cognitive deficits more likely result from reversible neuroamine dysfunction associated with a biological depressive illness that may be an intrinsic part of the disorder of myotonic dystrophy. Much of the purported emotional problems, “personality disturbances and social deterioration”, represent symptomatology of this biological depressive illness. This depressive component seems to be responsive to tricyclic antidepressant treatment; such pharmacotherapy also provides additional benefit to other symptoms including gastrointestinal dysfunction, hypersomnia, myotonia, and muscular weakness. It seems probable that the basic genetic defect (possibly involving membrane structure) in myotonic dystrophy results in abnormal aminergic and peptidergic receptors and that dysfunction of the limbic system of the brain is only one of many disturbances caused by the receptor abnormalities.",

The first symptoms shown by the alcoholic polyneuropathy are symmetric sensory disturbances with loss of tendon reflexes and of vibration sense in the peripheral segments of the lower extremities. At the beginning one almost always finds pressure pain in the calves. Important differential clues in diagnosis compared to the diabetic neuropathy, are the age at which the disease begins, the degree to which the autonomic nerve fibres and the cranial nerves are affected, as well as the form of manifestation. Pathogenetically, a direct toxic alcohol effect can above all be suspected in accordance with the typical electrodiagnostic findings with a neurogenic pattern in the EMG in the case of normal or slightly diminished conduction velocity, and in agreement with the morphological finding of an axonal degeneration in most of the biopsies. Possibly, in a small number of cases a vitamin deficiency or a malabsorption can play a causal role. The prognosis is good by complete abstinence from alcohol.",

Mania may be diagnostically central to all mood illnesses, including depressive conditions. Mania enhances creativity, and in its milder forms, such as cyclothymic or hyperthymic temperaments, has many positive aspects, reflected in social benefits and historical achievements. Lack of insight impairs the self-understanding of the person with manic symptoms, and is an important clinical problem.

Le debut partiel est quasi systematique chez le sujet âge mais des crises de toutes sortes, voire plus souvent generalisees sont observees chez le patient dement. Faire un diagnostic d'epilepsie et typer une crise, dans cette population, reste un exercice difficile et se heurte a plusieurs obstacles : l'interrogatoire n'est pas fiable, l'absence de temoin est frequente, la clinique est extremement variee, conduisant a passer a cote de nombreuses crises. Ces dernieres peuvent etre prises pour des problemes d'autres origines, notamment cardiaques, ou pour des symptomes de la demence sous-jacente et vice-versa. Le pourcentage important de crises liees a une situation pathologique, telle qu'un accident vasculaire cerebral a la phase aigue ou la survenue de troubles metaboliques ou toxiques, impose de realiser un bilan etiologique, pour rechercher un facteur intercurrent permettant alors de classer l'evenement en crise symptomatique. Ce n'est pas tant la frequence des crises qui pose probleme generalement, que les consequences medico-sociales nefastes. A moins d'etre en presence d'une crise symptomatique (liee a une cause identifiable) et surtout si la crise se repete au moins une fois, le traitement est conseille. Deux antiepileptiques classiques, la carbamazepine et l'acide valproique, et deux nouveaux, le gabapentin et la lamotrigine, sont consideres comme des monotherapies de premiere intention chez le sujet âge dement ; et notamment ces deux derniers pour leur bonne tolerance cognitive.",

Often it is difficult to treat NP because of its resistance to many drugs, and it is accompanied by side effects against effective pharmacotherapy.",

The authors report 5 patients with psychotic mood disorders and long-standing antipsychotic drug therapy. As they reached 50 to 60 years of age, they unexpectedly developed hypersensitivity to these medications, with rigidity, muteness, or the neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Nearly coincident with this reaction, they developed progressive cognitive deficits consistent with frontotemporal dementia. These patients illustrate emergent neuroleptic hypersensitivity as an early manifestation of other dementias. The predisposition to neuroleptic hypersensitivity could result from depleted nigral dopaminergic neurons suggested by “smudging” of the substantia nigra pars compacta on magnetic resonance imaging.",

First, the hyperexitability in the brain is recognized even in the stage between attacks in migraineurs according to findings of transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques, MRI-BOLD studies or 31P SPECT examinations. Second, cortical spreading depression originating in the occipital cortex is more likely to be related to the aura. Third, sensitization of the trigeminal nerve system is substantially involved in process of headache pain in migraine. Fourth, clonic dysfunction of the priaqueductal gray matter in the brain stem may underlie the migraine pathogenesis. Thus, current concept of susceptibility of migraine is attributed to certain dysfunction of the deep brain structures such as the brain stem rather than the blood vessels in the brain or dura mater.",

      "abstract": "El termino Paralisis Cerebral describe un grupo de trastornos permanentes del movimiento y la postura que provocan limitacion de la actividad y que son secundarios a un dano puntual y no progresivo en el cerebro en desarrollo. Los trastornos motores de la Paralisis Cerebral se acompanan con frecuencia de alteraciones sensitivas, perceptivas, cognitivas, de la comunicacion y el comportamiento, epilepsia y problemas secundarios a nivel del sistema musculoesqueletico. La baja densidad mineral osea en relacion a la edad, es un problema prevalente en la poblacion infantil y de adultos jovenes con paralisis cerebral con afectacion neurologica moderada o severa.En ausencia de enfermedad, la dotacion final de masa o pico de masa osea viene determinada geneticamente aunque, la capacidad para alcanzar el propio potencial genetico depende de varios factores extraesqueleticos. Los agentes mas importantes que regulan la mineralizacion del esqueleto durante la infancia, adolescencia y vida adulta son una alimentacion adecuada, hormonas y factores locales de crecimiento asi como una adecuada actividad fisica; algunos de los cuales estan alterados en a PCI. Mediante la determinacion de los valores de densidad osea en ninos y adolescentes con afectacion moderada y severa por paralisis cerebral de nuestra area de referencia podemos, no solo comparar estos valores con las referencias de densidad mineral osea existentes en la literatura para pacientes sanos en funcion de la edad y sexo, sino tambien, analizar la relacion que las diferentes variables clinicas y antropometricas estudiadas tienen sobre la densidad osea. Nuestros resultados muestran que los valores de DMO en un momento puntual del crecimiento en los pacientes con paralisis cerebral pertenecientes a los grupos IV y V de la clasificacion GMFCS, son comparativamente mas bajos que en pacientes sanos de la misma edad y sexo.En esta poblacion de pacientes con paralisis cerebral con severa afectacion neurologica y motora, hemos identificado que una mayor dificultad para la alimentacion, la ingesta de farmacos antiepilepticos, la disminucion en los parametros nutricionales como el pliegue tricipital o la circunferencia del miembro superior asi como la no participacion en programas de bipedestacion influyen de forma negativa sobre la densidad mineral osea medida a nivel de femur distal.",

Without objective biomarkers, concussion must be diagnosed clinically, and the symptoms that clinicians rely on are non-specific and may result from non-concussion disorders. The push to develop objective biomarkers has accelerated during the past several years. Objective biomarkers include evaluations of blood products that indicate nervous system injury or inflammation, brain imaging studies, and head accelerometry. At present, there is no identified correlation between measured head impact and development of a concussion.",

      "title": "Essential tremor and its variants",
      "abstract": "Essential tremor is the commonest of movement disorders. Although sometimes prefaced with the term 'benign’, it often causes significant disability. Diagnosis is based on the clinical finding of a postural tremor, predominantly affecting the upper limbs, that is absent at rest and not associated with extrapyramidal or cerebellar signs. There are, as yet, no specific anatomical, physiological, biochemical or genetic markers for the condition. Postural limb tremors, clinically indistinguishable from essential tremor, may occur in patients who have, or will later develop, other neurological conditions; whether such patients have essential tremor is a matter of controversy that will only be resolved with a better understanding of the pathophysiology of essential tremor. Positron emission tomography in patients with essential tremor reveals increased cerebellar activity even at rest, a finding that is consistent with the cerebellum having an important role in the generation of tremor. Abnormal cerebellar function has also been invoked to account for the abnormal manner in which patients with essential tremor perform rapid voluntary wrist movements. Molecular genetic studies in hereditary essential tremor have been initiated, but with negative results so far. Several new drug treatments have been tried, but with limited success; the role of thalamic stimulation and botulinum toxin in the treatment of essential tremor remains to be judged.",

      "abstract": "The term Parkinson's disease has been changed in 'Parkinson's diseases' to describe different clinical entities observed in several studies investigating the existence of PD subtypes. PD patients could be grouped based on clinical features. By considering only motor symptoms, we can classically distinguish two groups: \" the tremorigen-form\" and \"akinetic- rigidity-form\" where resting tremor and akinesia/bradikynesia and rigidity are the most motor predominant symptoms, respectively. Non-motor symptoms (NMSs) are practically always present during the course of the disease and some of them (constipation, depressive status, hyposmia and anxiety) could even exist before the onset of classical motor symptoms. Many other NMSs and in particular hallucinations, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders and difficulty in swallowing strongly affect the advanced stage of disease, and represent a real therapeutic challenge when these symptoms are simultaneously present with different severity. If not adequately treated, they can increase the risk of hospitalization and admissions in nursing home, and profoundly and negatively influence the quality of life and participation in social activity of these patients. PD subtypes according to the combination of motor and non-motor symptoms have been recently proposed. This classification derives from cluster analysis which permits to identify statistically distinct subtypes of Parkinsonian patients according to the relevance of both motor and non-motor symptoms. In this point of view, we propose a schematic therapeutic approach of motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease according to cluster symptoms presentation (motor and non-motor symptoms) and using medications that act on multiple domains of PD symptoms.",

      "title": "Neuromuscular Disorders of the Urinary Tract in Children",
      "abstract": "Neuromuscular disease of the urinary tract results from a variety of congenital and acquired conditions. It is usually complicated by infection and obstruction. Because of the lack of clearly defined diagnostic criteria, it is often neglected in differential considerations or is reserved as a final “wastebasket.” The importance of the roentgen examination has given the pediatrician and the radiologist the opportunity of being among the first to be in a position to suspect the diagnosis. Examination of several cases at the Childrens Hospital (Denver) in the past few years has stimulated the present review. A few of the cases are reported, with a brief summary of the concepts, in the hope that radiologists especially will contribute more to this subject. Neuromuscular disease may be congenital or acquired, extrinsic or intrinsic. Among the congenital extrinsic causes are: cerebral palsy, neurovertebral malformations, meningocele, amyotonia, and congenital syphilis. Acquired extrinsic causes include syringomyelia, poliomyelitis, muscular atrophy, cord injury, and cord tumors (1). In most of these conditions the urinary tract is not affected without easily recognized signs of general involvement being apparent. Intrinsic neuromotor disorders may be present without visible congenital defect and without extraurinary signs. They may, however, be found in conjunction with other neuromotor abnormalities, such as megacolon (2, 3), small bowel aganglionosis, regional ileitis (4), or achalasia (5). Cases with involvement of the urinary tract alone are the most difficult to diagnose and treat. Abnormal Physiology The Ureters Present concepts indicate that urinary neuromuscular disease involves the bladder primarily and seldom the ureters alone. These are often abnormal from the mechanical and inflammatory effects of bladder dysfunction. The normal renal pelves partially empty by peristaltic activity every two to three minutes (1). Ureteral peristalsis occurs more frequently. Although this activity will continue after denervation (7) parasympathetic stimulation increases it (the reason for poor urographic results following use of parasympathomimetic drugs). Excessive mechanical dilatation after a time will inhibit peristalsis. Ureteral atony may be considered primary only when complete urological study, often including a long period of observation, reveals no bladder abnormality (8). This is the true megaloureter (9). It shows gaping orifices, absence of peristalsis, dilatation, and reflux on cystography. Tortuosity, which is characteristic of mechanically obstructed ureters, is minimal (10, 11). Pathologically, megaloureter may be due to absence of the myenteric (Auer-bach's) plexus. Probably the most significant evidence for this condition is the association of megaloureter with megacolon, arguing for a common parasympathetic defect.",

Even rarer, and the focus of this article, is what has been referred to as diffuse electrical injury where there are diffuse symptoms, both ‘path related’ and remote to the theoretical current pathway (the linear path of the electrical current from entry point to exit point).

Understanding the neuroanatomical, biochemical and genetic basis of motor abnormalities, together with recent neuroimaging findings, have changed the designation to 'movement disorders'. In particular, there is increasing neuropatho-logical and clinical evidence that many of these diseases also affect brain regions beyond the basal ganglia. For example, non-motor features have been recognised in Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive decline, behavioural changes, pyramidal signs and autonomic failure are also frequently observed in various forms of movement disorders, suggesting widespread involvement of different functional systems. Therefore, we will use the term 'movement disorders', as it is used in routine clinical practice. Conditions that present predominantly with ataxia or motor neuron disorder are discussed in separate chapters (Chapters 22 and 23, respectively).",

Anoxic episodes (Chapter 17) and prematurity (Chapter 13) are important considerations.

      "title": "Understanding Visual Disorders through Correlation of Clinical and Radiologic Findings",
      "abstract": "Patients presenting with visual disturbances often require a neuroimaging approach. The spectrum of visual disturbances includes three main categories: vision impairment, ocular motility dysfunction, and abnormal pupillary response. Decreased vision is usually due to an eye abnormality. However, it can also be related to other disorders affecting the visual pathway, from the retina to the occipital lobe. Ocular motility dysfunction may follow disorders of the cranial nerves responsible for eye movements (ie, oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves); may be due to any abnormality that directly affects the extraocular muscles, such as tumor or inflammation; or may result from any orbital disease that can alter the anatomy or function of these muscles, leading to diplopia and strabismus. Given that pupillary response depends on the normal function of the sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways, an abnormality affecting these neuronal systems manifests, respectively, as pupillary miosis or mydriasis, with other related symptoms. In some cases, neuroimaging studies must complement the clinical ophthalmologic examination to better assess the anatomic and pathologic conditions that could explain the symptoms. US has a major role in the assessment of diseases of the eye and anterior orbit. CT is usually the first-line imaging modality because of its attainability, especially in trauma settings. MRI offers further information for inflammatory and tumoral cases. ©RSNA, 2024 Test Your Knowledge questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.",

      "abstract": "The term sleep disorder (somnipathy) simply means a disturbance of an individual’s normal sleep pat­tern. Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

La afeccion principal ocurre en los troncos nerviosos que, usualmente, estan engrosados y en cuyo trayecto se presenta hipoestesia o anestesia, y si el nervio es mixto, atrofia y perdida funcional de los musculos inervados. Los nervios mas comunmente afectados son el cubital, el ciatico popliteo externo, el auricular y el mediano. El diagnostico clinico es dificil y la enfermedad puede pasar desapercibida durante anos, con dano neural cada vez con mayor discapacidad. El tener criterios clinicos, epidemiologicos, histopatologicos, inmunologicos, biomoleculares y electromiograficos sobre la enfermedad es de gran ayuda para su diagnostico preciso.En este articulo, basado en nuestra experiencia, en la revision de literatura sobre el tema y en la atencion de pacientes en el Sanatorio de Agua de Dios (Cundinamarca), presentamos aspectos que cubren estas areas del conocimiento de la lepra neural, los cuales son utiles para su manejo y accesibles de ser implementados en el Programa Nacional de Control de la Lepra.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging in Epileptic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic disorders, and affects about 50 million people around the world. It is a heterogeneous condition characterized by recurrent spontaneous epileptic seizures. There are no age, sex or race discriminations, although incidence of the first epileptic seizure has a bimodal distribution, with peaks in childhood and after 60 years of age (Engel & Pedley, 2008). According to their localization, epilepsies and epileptic seizures should be classified as focal (or partial) and generalized. Partial seizures begin in a restricted portion of cerebral cortex. Partial seizures are associated with a restricted area of the of the cerebral cortex and are clasified as either simple or complex, depending on the level of conscious awareness. Simple partial seizures are characterized by brief specific neurologic dysfunction, contingent upon the localization of the epileptogenic focus. By definition, they do not compromise consciousness during the event, and might manifest as motor signs (with a focus involving the primary motor area), sensitive symptoms (focus in the primary somatosensory area), autonomic or psychic signs (mesiobasal areas). Complex partial seizures affect the patient’s consciousness from the onset of the event. Both simple and complex partial seizures can propagate to the whole brain and become secondarily generalized seizures. Examples of primary generalized seizures are absence seizures, tonic-clonic generalized seizures, and myoclonic seizures. All those three seizure types are generated by epileptic discharges involving both cerebral hemispheres from their onset. By extension, focal epilepsies are characterized by recurrent spontaneous partial seizures, and generalized epilepsies have generalized seizures as their main seizure type. Epilepsies can be idiopathic (without an identifiable structural cause), symptomatic (due to a structural lesion), or cryptogenic (with a presumed lesion, not detectable by current available neuroimaging methods). Broadly, idiopathic epilepsies (partial or generalized) begin in the childhood years, have a good prognosis, and go into remission during adolescence. The symptomatic generalized epilepsies encompass a group of epileptic syndromes with very poor prognosis, characterized by extremely refractory seizures and accompanied by neurodevelopmental delay. The symptomatic partial epilepsies depict a large spectrum of epileptic disorders caused by several types of brain lesions. A significant percentage of patients who have seizures not responsive to antiepileptic drugs is affected by this type of epilepsy. Surgical treatment becomes a good therapeutic option for these patients, and the identification of the structural cortical lesion causing their epilepsies is primordial for a good postsurgical prognosis (Panaiyotopoulos, 2010).",

      "title": "Restriktive Valvulopathie im Rahmen einer Behandlung mit Dopaminagonisten",
      "abstract": "Das Parkinson-Syndrom, benannt nach seinem Entdecker, dem Londoner Arzt Dr. James Parkinson, ist klinisch durch die motorischen Kardinalsymptome Rigor, Tremor, Akinese und posturale Instabilitat gekennzeichnet. Den motorischen Symptomen liegt neuropathologisch eine Degeneration der dopaminergen Neurone der Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) des Mittelhirnes zu Grunde, die zu einem Dopaminmangel im Striatum fuhrt. \nDas idiopathische Parkinson Syndrom (IPS) ist die haufigste Form des Parkinsonsyndroms und gehort zu den haufigsten Erkrankungen des zentralen Nervensystems und ist nach dem Morbus Alzheimer die zweit haufigste neurodegenerative Erkrankung (McDonald et al., 2003). Das Manifestationsalter liegt zwischen 50 und 79 Jahren, mit einem mittleren Alter bei Krankheitsbeginn zwischen 58 und 62 Jahren, wobei Frauen und Manner annahernd gleich haufig betroffen sind (Muller, 2002). \nDie Ursache des IPS ist weitgehend ungeklart. Es konnten verschiedene Risikofaktoren definiert werden. Steigendes Alter ist als groster Risikofaktor fur die Entwicklung des IPS anzusehen. Es ist bekannt, dass mit zunehmendem Patientenalter immer mehr Neurone im ZNS untergehen, somit auch in der SN. Dabei handelt es sich jedoch nicht ausschlieslich um dopaminerge Neurone der SNc. McGeer konnte zeigen, dass mit steigendem Alter die Tyrosinhydroxylase-Aktivitat als limitierender Faktor bei der Umwandlung von Tyrosin zu Dopamin vermindert ist, wodurch Dopamin in geringerer Konzentration zur Verfugung steht (McGeer, 1971).\nTrotz Einfuhrung der Therapie mit L-Dopa und der damit verbundenen steigenden Lebenserwartung der betroffenen Patienten ist die Uberlebenszeit von IPS Patienten gegenuber gleichaltrigen Kontrollpersonen signifikant vermindert (D'Amelio et al., 2006).\n\nIn der Therapie der motorischen Defizite des idiopathischen Parkinsonsyndroms (IPS) finden unterschiedliche Dopaminagonisten (DA) Anwendung im klinischen Alltag. Chemisch differenziert werden zwei Klassen von Dopaminagonisten: zum Einen die Ergotalkaloide, zu denen insbesondere die Substanzen Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, Bromocriptin und α-Dihydroergocryptin zahlen. Zum Anderen die Non-Ergotalkaloide mit den Wirkstoffgruppen Apomorphin, Pramipexol, Ropinirol, Rotigotin und Piribedil. \nAktuell werden verschiedene DA in der Therapie des IPS eingesetzt. Bislang konnten mindestens 5 Rezeptorsubtypen der Dopaminrezeptoren beschrieben werden (D1-5). Die pharmakologische Einteilung erfolgt auf Grund der Struktur in zwei Hauptfamilien: Typ D1 (D1, D5) und D2 (D2-D4). DA wirken vorwiegend auf D2-Rezeptoren. Die Zusammenhange zwischen Rezeptorsubtyp, DA und klinischem Nutzen werden kontrovers diskutiert, ferner wirken manche DA auch auf andere Rezeptoren.\n\nDie genannten DA wirken als hochpotente Agonisten auf den Serotonin-Rezeptorsubtyp 5-HT2B. Dieser Rezeptorsubtyp wird unter anderem in groser Zahl auf Herzklappen exprimiert. Eine Aktivierung induziert die Mitogenese mit konsekutiver Myofibroblastenproliferation, wobei es zu einer Fibrosierung der Herzklappen bei intakt bleibender Klappenstruktur kommen kann (Fitzgerald et al., 2000, Rothman et al., 2000). Zu den Medikamenten, die uber diesen Mechanismus die Herzklappen schadigen konnen, gehoren auch die Migranemittel Ergotamin und Methylergonovin, sowie die Anorektika Fenfluramin und Dexfenfluramin (Fitzgerald et al., 2000). Daruber hinaus sind die fibrotischen Veranderungen identisch mit denen, die bei einem serotonin-produzierenden Karzinoid-Tumor beobachtet werden konnen (Moller et al., 2003).\n\nIn der vorliegenden retrospektiven Studie wurden die transthorakalen Echokardiographien von insgesamt 66 Patienten mit bekanntem IPS nach den Kriterien der „American Society of Echocardiography“ ausgewertet und ausgewahlte klinische Parameter, wie Alter, Krankheitsverlauf, sowie Medikamente erhoben. Alle transthorakalen Echokardiographien wurden mit einem Siemens-Sequoia-Gerat von einem Facharzt fur Kardiologie durchgefuhrt.\n\nDie Haufigkeit der restriktiven Valvulopathie wurde bei 66 Patienten mit einem IPS mittels transthorakaler Echokardiographie untersucht. Die Patienten wurden dabei mit Pergolid (n=23), Cabergolin (n=22), Pramipexol (n=4), Ropinirol (n=6) oder L-Dopa (n=11) behandelt. In der Pergolidgruppe wurde bei funf Patienten (22%), in der Cabergolingruppe bei vier Patienten (18%) eine restriktive Valvulopathie diagnostiziert. Kein Hinweis fur eine restriktive Valvulopathie fand sich bei den 21 Patienten, die entweder mit L-Dopa oder mit einem Non-Ergot-Dopaminagonisten behandelt wurden. Der Unterschied zwischen der Kumulativdosis und der Expositionsdauer der betroffenen und nicht betroffenen Patienten war lediglich hinsichtlich der Expositionsdauer in der Pergolidgruppe statistisch signifikant. Es gab keinen Unterschied hinsichtlich des Alters der betroffenen und nicht betroffenen Patienten. Herzklappeninsuffizienzen waren in der Pergolid- und Cabergolingruppe haufiger nachweisbar. Die Mitralklappe war in der Ergot-Gruppe haufiger betroffen als in der Non-Ergot- und L-Dopa-Gruppe. Eine Herzklappeninsuffizienz zweiten oder dritten Grades trat in der Non-Ergot-Gruppe haufiger als in der L-Dopa-Gruppe auf. Die Beobachtung, dass restriktive Valvulopathien lediglich bei den Ergot-Dopaminagonisten Pergolid und Cabergolin in Erscheinung traten, konnte durch die Tatsache zu erklaren sein, dass beide Substanzen hochpotente Agonisten des Serotonin-Rezeptorsubtyp 5-HT2B sind. 5-HT2B-Rezeptoren werden insbesondere auf Herzklappen exprimiert, wobei deren Aktivierung eine Mitogenese mit konsekutiver Myofibroblastenproliferation bewirkt, was pathophysiologisch eine Fibrosierung der Herzklappen bewirken kann.\n\n\nDiese Ergebnisse weisen im Einklang mit bisher publizierten Studien auf ein erhohtes Risiko einer restriktiven Valvulopathie bei Patienten mit einem idiopathischen Parkinsonsyndrom hin, die mit Cabergolin oder Pergolid behandelt wurden.",

      "abstract": "In the neonatal period, the majority of seizures are acute reactive events provoked by injury. Some etiologies require immediate diagnosis and treatment. Many of these acute, symptomatic seizures resolve once the underlying etiology is corrected or the acute neurological disruption of the causal event subsides. The electroencephalogram (EEG), amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), or quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) may aid in rapid diagnosis and treatment of clinical and subclinical seizures. The new ILAE classification for neonatal seizures emphasizes the need for EEG for accurate diagnosis. Most EEG patterns in the neonate are non-specific to the etiology of seizures. However, even while non-specific, certain patterns can help direct the diagnostic evaluation. In many cases neuromonitoring may have specific characteristics that are helpful to direct further workup. This chapter discusses neuromonitoring in neonatal seizures due to acute causes, including vascular injury (stroke or hemorrhage), infection, acute metabolic disturbance, brain injury of prematurity, and neonatal abstinence syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the main form of dementia in the elderly and affects greater than 47 million people worldwide. Care for AD patients poses very significant personal and economic demands on individuals and society, and the situation is expected to get even more dramatic in the coming decades unless effective treatments are found to halt the progression of the disease. Although AD is most commonly regarded as a disease of the memory, the entire brain is eventually affected by neuronal dysfunction or neurodegeneration, which brings about a host of other behavioral disturbances. AD patients often present with apathy, depression, eating and sleeping disorders, aggressive behavior, and other non-cognitive symptoms, which deeply affect not only the patient but also the caregiver's health. These symptoms are usually associated with AD pathology but are often neglected as part of disease progression due to the early and profound impact of disease on memory centers such as the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Yet, a collection of findings offers biochemical insight into mechanisms underlying non-cognitive symptoms in AD, and indicate that, at the molecular level, such symptoms share common mechanisms. Here, we review evidence indicating mechanistic links between memory loss and non-cognitive symptoms of AD. We highlight the central role of the pro-inflammatory activity of microglia in behavioral alterations in AD patients and in experimental models of the disease. We suggest that a deeper understanding of non-cognitive symptoms of AD may illuminate a new beginning in AD research, offering a fresh approach to elucidate mechanisms involved in disease progression and potentially unveiling yet unexplored therapeutic targets.",

Diagnosing Meige syndrome is challenging due to its similarities with various movement disorders and psychiatric conditions. Functional neurological disorder (FND) refers to a condition characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with recognized neurological or medical conditions. Symptoms may include motor or sensory disturbances such as weakness, tremors, paralysis, or seizures. Importantly, these symptoms cannot be fully explained by another medical condition or by the direct effects of a substance. Instead, they are believed to stem from psychological factors. This case demonstrates the diagnostic dilemma of Meige syndrome. It was initially misdiagnosed as a functional neurological disorder in a 42-year-old female. The difficulties in differentiating between these disorders highlight the necessity of a thorough evaluation and increased clinical suspicion in cases of movement disorders. For treatment outcomes to be optimized and to resolve patient distress, prompt and accurate diagnosis is essential.",

U znanstvenoj literaturi poznat je kao pseudobulbarni afekt, emocionalna labilnost, afektivna labilnost, emocionalna inkontinencija i patoloski plac ili smijeh. Javlja se kod razlicitih neuroloskih i psihijatrijskih bolesti i stanja kao sto su moždani udar, demencija, amiotroficna lateralna skleroza, Parkinsonova bolest, multipla skleroza, traumatska moždana ostecenja. Neuropatofiziologija sindroma nije razjasnjena. Pretpostavlja se da neurostrukturalno ostecenje narusava koordinaciju između doživljenih osjecaja i motorne ekspresije. Ovaj sindrom je rijetko prepoznat u klinickoj praksi i cesto se pogresno dijagnosticira i lijeci kao depresija, bipolarni afektivni poremecaj, generalizirani anksiozni poremecaj, poremecaj licnosti ili parcijalna epilepsija. Lijecenje je za sada simptomatsko, koriste se triciklicki antidepresivi, selektivni inhibitori ponovne pohrane serotonina (SIPPS), NMDA-agonisti. Nedavna istraživanja pokazuju da bi lijekovi koji smanjuju ekscesivnu glutamatergicnu aktivnost kao npr. dekstrometorfan hidrobromid mogli biti ucinkoviti u lijecenju PNEE-a.

According to the underlying physiological mechanism, myoclonic spasms can be classified as cortical, subcortical, spinal or peripheral. Myoclonic spasms appear in a wide range of neurological diseases. So-called symptomatic myoclonus is the type that occurs secondary to an identifiable disorder; it is usually accompanied by other neurological signs and is the most frequent kind. Epileptic myoclonus is that which forms part of an epileptic syndrome with a genetic or idiopathic cause, or that is due to static encephalopathy. Essential myoclonus is the least frequent type and includes palatal myoclonus and dystonia-myoclonus syndrome. The main therapeutic objective consists in treating the underlying cause of the myoclonus if possible and in using symptomatic treatment when this is not the case. Antiepileptic drugs that enhance the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid are still the most effective medication. Among the non-antiepileptic drugs, piracetam and 5-hydroxytryptophan stand out above the rest. Botulinum toxin has proved to be effective in palatal myoclonus. In dystonia-myoclonus syndrome, research has been conducted on the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation on the internal globus pallidus. In the most severe forms of myoclonus, monotherapy is not usually effective.Progress has been made in furthering our knowledge of the neurophysiology of myoclonus, although no very effective forms of treatment have been reported for this motor disorder, which can be extremely disabling.",

La raison est liee au fait que les fonctions executives sont difficiles a apprehender, tant au niveau de leur modelisation cognitive qu'anatomo-fonctionnelle ou neurochimique. Ici, nous nous appuyons sur des avancees theoriques et methodologiques recentes pour revisiter ces troubles executifs. Nous nous interessons a une fonction, recemment mise en evidence, destinee a verrouiller par anticipation le declenchement de toute action en situation d'incertitude : le controle proactif de l'inhibition non selective de l'action. Notre hypothese directrice est que son dysfonctionnement est susceptible de generer une grande variete de troubles executifs. Nous avons : 1) recherche les liens entre marqueurs cliniques et troubles du controle proactif ; 2) identifie les dysfonctionnements cerebraux associes au moyen de methodes electroencephalographiques innovantes combinees a l'enregistrement des effets de la stimulation du noyau sous-thalamique ; et 3) sonde l'origine neurochimique de cette fonction. Nos resultats suggerent qu'un dysfonctionnement de l'inhibition proactive n'engendre pas uniquement des troubles impulsifs mais explique egalement des comportements hypo-productifs comme l'akinesie. Ils indiquent que ces troubles ne sont pas d'origine dopaminergique et qu'ils sont lies au dysfonctionnement de l'activite du cortex frontal median et du noyau sous-thalamique.

      "abstract": "There is little written in the geriatric literature about the concept of psychological frailty which encompasses cognitive, mood, and motivational components. The concept is intended to consider brain changes that are beyond normal aging, but not necessarily inclusive of disease, that result in decreased cognitive or mood resilience in the presence of modest stressors, and may eventually lead to negative health outcomes in a manner parallel to physical frailty, an entity well known to clinicians. Most work exploring the interface between cognition, mood, and physical frailty has demonstrated a bidirectional association between the two domains. Psychological symptoms or deficits have been described as either worsening the degree of physical frailty, or physical frailty has been viewed as a risk to a worsening cognition or depression. However, psychological frailty, a consequence of age-altered brain function, has not been studied for itself. By what possible mechanism does the brain reveal its loss of resiliency under modest stress and how can this be visualized? Are there markers that predate a psychological decline that might permit a preventive intervention which could delay the appearance of negative health outcomes such as reduced functional capacity or increased dependency? The present review will explore these concepts and possibilities.",

The differential diagnosis of patients with medically unexplainable symptoms includes conversion disorder, somatic symptom disorder, and illness anxiety disorder among others. Conversion disorder is a mental disorder with pseudo-neurological symptoms that are not due to an organic abnormality. For its diagnosis it is necessary to show that the symptoms and findings are not compatible with neurological diseases. Conversion disorder and any neurological diseases can coexist, in which cases neurologists and psychiatrists should cooperate when treating the patient. However, it is difficult to clearly distinguish individual symptoms by their mechanism. Patients complaining of physical symptoms, including those with conversion disorder, require careful explanation that takes into account the patient's explanatory model. Clinicians must switch from an acute disease model to a chronic disease model. These patients are more likely to concentrate consciously on their physical condition and clinicians should help patients avoid ruminating on their physical symptoms. Because it is not simple to completely exclude physical disorders and prove that the symptoms are psychogenic, confirming a diagnosis should be performed carefully.",

      "title": "A Case Series of Unilateral Peripheral Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background and Aims Peripheral neuropathy may present with a variety of phenotypes depending on the pattern of weakness and sensory loss, the neurophysiological characteristics (axonal or demyelinating) and additional features such as involvement of the autonomic nervous system or the cranial nerves. The most common phenotype is a symmetrical length‐dependent sensory and motor neuropathy. Other phenotypes include non‐length‐dependent forms such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) or a sensory neuronopathy or ganglionopathy. Asymmetric forms of neuropathy are mostly represented by mononeuritis multiplex and Lewis‐Sumner syndrome or focal CIDP. Unilateral weakness or sensory loss respecting the midline is mainly due to pathology in the central nervous system and is unusual in peripheral neuropathy. Methods We evaluated the clinical and genetic features of three unrelated individuals with a peripheral neuropathy affecting one side of the body. Results We describe three unrelated patients (two female and one male) with a slowly progressive peripheral neuropathy restricted to one side of the body. Each case is marked by onset in early childhood with the absence of a family history or a structural lesion of the central nervous system. Neurophysiology demonstrated an axonal type of neuropathy in two cases and conduction slowing supportive of a demyelinating neuropathy type in one. Genetic testing was performed in the three cases, specifically looking for variants in genes associated with Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMT) but none were identified in DNA extracted from blood. Interpretation A unilateral, slowly progressive peripheral neuropathy is a rare phenomenon, and we propose the cause of this unusual phenotype to be due to a mosaic or chimeric form of Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth disease (CMT).",

It involves the neighboring regions such as the insula, the suprasilvian opercular cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex and the temporo-parieto-occipital junction. The objective of this review is to provide an update in temporal plus epilepsy. A previous history of brain trauma, a history of tonic clonic seizures, and previous central nervous system infection are risk factors. They likely allowed the generation of complex hippocampal and extrahypocampic neural networks. Clinical manifestations will depend on the location of the epileptogenic zone as well as the rapid propagation into temporal mesial structures. Video-electroencephalography usually shows involvement of the temporal lobe, with rapid propagation into the perisilvian, orbitofrontal or temporo-parieto-occipital regions. The magnetoelectroencephaography has lesser muscle contamination and could be considered as a biomarker of early states in the diagnosis process. Brain MRI is usually negative or shows non-specific mesial temporal abnormalities. Stereoelectroencephalography is the invasive method of choice. Temporal plus epilepsy is considered to be the most common cause of temporal lobe epilepsy surgery failure and represents up to 30%.Epilepsia del lóbulo temporal plus: revisión.La epilepsia del lóbulo temporal plus se define como la epilepsia en la cual la zona epileptógena primaria se localiza en el lóbulo temporal y se extiende a regiones vecinas, como la ínsula, la corteza opercular suprasilviana, la corteza orbitofrontal y la unión temporoparietooccipital. El objetivo de esta revisión es proveer una actualización de la información en la epilepsia del lóbulo temporal plus. La historia de traumatismo craneoencefálico, infección cerebral (meningitis-encefalitis) o crisis epiléptica tonicoclónica generalizada está involucrada en su etiología, y permite la generación de redes neuronales complejas hipocámpicas y extrahipocámpicas. Las manifestaciones clínicas dependen de la zona epileptógena involucrada y de su rápida proyección a las estructuras temporales mesiales. El videoelectroencefalograma evidencia actividad interictal extensa e ictal en el lóbulo temporal, pero con rápida propagación perisilviana, orbitofrontal o temporoparietooccipital. La magnetoelectroencefalografía tiene menos contaminación muscular y podría considerarse como un biomarcador de estados tempranos en el proceso diagnóstico. La resonancia cerebral generalmente es negativa o muestra una ligera alteración de señal en la zona mesial temporal en grado variable.

      "title": "Phenomenology and psychiatric origin of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES) is a sudden change in a person's behavior, perception, thinking, or feeling that is usually time limited and resembles, or is mistaken for, epilepsy but does not have the characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that accompanies a true epileptic seizure [1]. It is considered that PNES is a somatic manifestation of mental distress, in response to a psychological conflict or other Stressors [2]. A wide spectrum of clinical presentation includes syncope, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, simple and complex partial seizure, myoclonic seizure, frontal lobe seizures and status epilepticus [3]. Coexistence of epilepsy and PNES is seen in approximately 9% of cases [5]. Between 25-30% of patients referred to tertiary centers and initially diagnosed as refractory epilepsy were on further examination diagnosed as PNES [6,7]. In DSM-IV [12] PNES are usually categorized under conversion disorder with seizures or convulsions. However, psychiatric basis of PNES may be anxiousness (panic attack), somatization or factitious disorder, simulation, dissociative disorders and psychosis [1]. AIM The aim of the study was to establish clinical phenomenology and EEG characteristics as well as basic psychiatric disorder in patients with PNES. METHOD In a retrospective study covering the period from January 1st 1999 till April 31 st 2003, 24 patients (22 female, 2 male) treated at the Institute of Neurology in Belgrade were analyzed. PNES were defined as sudden change in behavior incoherent with epileptiform activity registered on EEG. Possible PNES were determined on the basis of history data and clinical examination during the attack but definitive confirmation was established only by the finding of no ictal EEG changes during typical seizure of each patient. Patients with coexisting epilepsy were included in the study, too. At least two standard EEG (range 2-6, median 4) were performed at the beginning of diagnostic evaluation. Demographic data, clinical presentation (apparent loss of consciousness, type of convulsion and associated clinical signs) and placebo-induced seizures (administration of saline near the cubital vein) with EEG or video-EEG monitoring were analyzed. Basic psychiatric disorder was classified according to DSM IV classification criteria. RESULTS Duration of PNES was 4.7 years (range from 2 months to 30 years). The time from onset to the diagnosis of PNES was 4.5 years. Epilepsy comorbidity was diagnosed in 9 patients (37.5%). The average time of use of antiepileptic drugs (AED) in the group of isolated PNES was 2.4 years and 20% of patients were treated with two or more AED. The vast majority of patients presented with bilateral convulsions (54.16%) with apparent loss of consciousness found in 91.6% of cases. Ictal iwury (16.7%), tongue bite (4.2%) and premonition of the seizure (17.4%) were uncommon. Variability in clinical presentation of seizures was found in over half of patients (57%). Psychological trigger could be determined in over 60% of patients. EEG findings in a group with isolated PNES suggesting the existence of epileptiform activity was found in one case. EEG monitoring of placebo-induced seizure was performed in 20 patients, of whom 19 (95%) showed typical habitual attack with no electroclinical correlate. In 70% of cases conversion disorder DSM-IV criteria were fulfilled. Somatization disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder were found in 3 patients. The diagnosis of factitious disorder was made in one case and only two patients were undiagnosed according to DSM-IV. DISCUSSION Average delay from onset to diagnosis of PNES in larger studies was estimated to be approximately 7 years [8]. Even though diagnostic delay in our study was shorter, organizational reasons for this could not be found. Longer duration of a typical attack (compared to the epileptic seizure), apparent loss of consciousness, bilateral convulsion behavior and significant clinical variability in absence of typical epileptic elements such as tongue bite and ictal iwury could be the main clinical manifestation of PNES. We found rare interictal abnormalities (6.7%) in the group with isolated PNES and significant percentage (77.7%) in patients with coexisting epilepsy which is coherent with other reports [8]. The latest could lead to prolonged delay in appropriate diagnosis and suitable treatment. Clear psychological trigger wasn't noted in whole group of patients (61 %). This, however, is not unusual since PNES represents a chronic disorder with repeated triggering that could lead to less significant role of the same psychological trigger in developed PNES. Even insufficiently resolved in ethical terms, placebo-induced procedure was of huge sensitivity. In clinical practice conversion disorder is hard to differ from malingering or implementation of secondary gain. One could make the conclusion only on the basis of detailed and careful estimation of the symptoms developing context Conversion disorder is more prevalent among women (from 2:1 to 10:1) [4, 13] but modest percentage of affected men could be explained only by limited sample in this study. CONCLUSION PNES is often replaced with epilepsy and in number of cases clinical differentiation is not easy. One should be acquainted with clinical presentation of PNES as well as its psychiatric origin in order to adequately recognize and treat the disorder.",

NPH is associated with a classical triad of symptoms: dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence. Enlargement of the ventricles of the brain as seen on imaging studies is essential to making the diagnosis of NPH. NPH is most common in the elderly population. Making the diagnosis of NPH can be challenging, especially in elderly patients who may have other causes for their various symptoms. Once the diagnosis is made, tests can help to identify patients who are most likely to respond to the surgical placement of a shunt. Most cases of NPH are considered to be idiopathic as they have no identifiable, contributing cause. In other instances, NPH is said to be secondary; these individuals have a history of meningitis, encephalitis, cerebral hemorrhage, or head trauma.",

      "abstract": "Since even the paralysis caused by the mechanical spinal lesion has been included therein, the concept of myelitis is thought to contain various spinal disturbances of multiple etiologies. Besides the metabolic and nutritional conditions, etiology has already been clarified in poliomyelitis, epidemic encephalitis, cerebral or spinal syphilis as well as in encephalomyelitis following epidemic or tuberculous meningitis, vaccination and various infections, and in ascending myelitis by peripheral neuritis. Most of encephalomyelitis, however, remains yet of unknown etiology. They have usually diverse manifestations. Most of them show the symptoms of transverse myelitis, while some show those of disseminated encephalomyelitis and some complicate optic neuritis, resembling multiple sclerosis or Devic disease. Though discussions have been repeated concerning the problem that they should belong to a clinical entity or not, the inclusive term of \" non-specific encephalomyelitis \" seems to be given to these, diseases of quite unknown etiology. Recently not few patients were reported in Japan, who had been noticed diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms in their prodromal stage and then followed by the myelopathy or encephalomyelopathy. Here, it will be the aim of this symposium to answer the question whether they could be thought to be a independent disease entity or not. First of all, the chairman thought, that it would be important to make inquiries, as to the epidemiology of this disorder in all parts of Japan. Besides our own 371 patients containing 15 autopsied cases, 452 patients containing 9 autopsied were collected through enquête by the speakers and discussers, from the medical school hospitals and other main hospitals of all over Japan.",

Pessoas acometidas com a referida doenca podem ter dificuldades com a degluticao e geralmente tem um desequilibrio muscular e amplitude de movimento pode ser reduzida em varias articulacoes do corpo devido a rigidez muscular. As habilidades funcionais e limitacoes irao variar de uma pessoa para outra, em decorrencia da extensao da area lesionada. Algumas pessoas mostram funcao intelectual normal, ao passo que outras podem apresentar deficiencia intelectual. Epilepsia, cegueira ou surdez sao condicoes que podem estar presentes. Os pacientes podem ser classificadas de acordo com a caracteristica clinica mais dominante em espastica, discinetico e ataxico. A espastica e caracterizada pela presenca de rigidez muscular e dificuldade de movimento. Ocasionada por uma lesao no Sistema piramidal, Objetivou-se relatar um estudo de caso de uma adolescente com diagnostico de paralisia cerebral. Trata-se de um relato de experiencia realizado a partir, das vivencias dos dias de estagios de neurologia do Curso de Fisioterapia do Centro Universitario Catolica de Quixada-CE, durante as atividades realizadas no periodo de 31/07/2019 a 10/10/2019 Para a coleta dos dados utilizou-se a investigacao por meio da anamnese, exame fisico e avaliacao que observou-se uma lateralizarao notavel para o lado esquerdo, encurtamento dos musculos isquiotibiais, alteracao na marcha, tonus frequente, contratura no musculo ECOM, dificuldade na abducao de quadril, escoliose, deficit na coordenacao motora, foi observado um inicio de uma paralisia facial. As condutas realizadas foram tecnicas para diminuir a hipertonia muscular, minimizar os problemas secundarios como encurtamentos e contraturas, aumentar a amplitude de movimento e minimizar o controle motor seletivo, forca muscular e coordenacao, O tratamento foi realizado uma vez por semana. A adolescente apresentou melhoras no decorrer dos atendimentos, apresentou grandes avancos em relacao as funcoes como mobilidade, equilibrio, forca, coordenacao e amplitude. Os resultados demonstraram que a fisioterapia neurologica proporciona melhora na sua qualidade de vida. Verificou-se que a indicacao da fisioterapia neurologica deve estar pautada no tempo e gravidade da doenca, porem deve ser levado em conta que a intervencao fisioterapeutica e iniciada imediatamente apos o diagnostico, afim de proporcionar e minimizar os efeitos indesejaveis da patologia. Deste modo conclui-se que o acompanhamento fisioterapeutico e essencial no manejo de pacientes portadores de paralisia cerebral, avaliando os aspectos do paciente notou-se uma evolucao consideravel no seu quadro clinico.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is manifested clinically by bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and sometimes rest tremor. The pathological hallmark of PD is the degeneration of dopaminergic cells within the substantia nigra-pars compacta (SNc) and the subsequent dopamine depletion of the striatum. Besides disturbances in motor performance, other symptoms like REM sleep behavior disorder, autonomic dysfunction, depression, and cognitive deficits can play a role in PD. It can be difficult to distinguish PD from other neurodegenerative brain diseases, but early diagnosis is important because prognosis and treatment options differ. Structural imaging is in general not helpful at early disease stages. However, nuclear imaging methods not only can display striatal dopaminergic activity in PD but also visualize brain perfusion and glucose metabolism to show disease-related changes in local brain function or identify cholinergic deficits associated with cognitive dysfunction. Presynaptic dopaminergic imaging either with PET or SPECT is the gold standard to differentiate between patients with parkinsonian features associated with and without a presynaptic dopaminergic deficit. In order to differentiate between PD and other neurodegenerative brain diseases, specific disease-related metabolic patterns identified with FDG-PET imaging could be of great assistance in the individual clinical diagnosis.",

Se presenta el caso de un paciente de 78 años de edad con diagnóstico de enfermedad de Parkinson desde hace 17 años, en manejo médico convencional por especialistas en neurología, con pobre respuesta al tratamiento , con deterioro clínico y con alteración importante de su calidad de vida, que al momento de su valoración inicial, aplicando la escala de calidad de vida Euroqol 5D mostraba un puntaje 6.74 % , y en el termómetro de calidad de vida de esta misma escala 20 puntos % , con una severidad según la escala Hoehn y Yahr tambien de calidad de vida , en estadio 5, indicando (necesita ayuda para todo permanece sentado o acostado) , y por el índice de Katz que evalúa la independencia de un enfermo para realizar actividades de la vida diaria por calculadora virtual registrando los items obtenidos . 5 puntos ( incapacidad severa) , se inicio tratamiento desde la medicina biorreguladora de sistemas, aplicando como conceptos la detoxificación básica y central , la inmunomodulación y la regulación del eje hipotálamo hipófisis adrenal (HHA) con medicamentos como Galium Heel, Cerecomp Compositum, Traumeel S , Neurexan entre otros. por vía oral y endovenosa; después de 3 meses de tratamiento se logra evidenciar en el paciente una mejoría notable de sus síntomas clínicos siendo muy evidente en el temblor , rigidez , agitación psicomotora , demostrado por cambios en los resultados de las escalas ;en la escala Euroqol 5D mejorando en un 62.43 % en su calidad de vida , 50 puntos % en el termometro de calidad de vida de esta misma escala y ; pasando a un estadio 3 en la escala de Hoehn y Yahr (alteración bilateral leve o moderada con cierta inestabilidad postural), y obteniendo en el índice de Katz un puntaje de 3 puntos ; además se logro reducir la dosis de medicación antihipertensiva .Con este caso clínico podemos sugerir que el uso de medicamentos biorreguladores en dosis bajas multiobjetivo y multicomponente favorecen el proceso de autorregulación de redes desreguladas en la Enfermedad de Parkinson como son el sistema linfático \" glinfático\", la red neuroendocrina ,mitocondrial y modulando la inflamación crónica de bajo grado; logrando disminuir la severidad de los síntomas , la limitación funcional y mejorando la calidad de vida .",

This pain generator can be a cause of debilitating neuropathic pain if not properly addressed. The clinical hallmarks of neuroma include the presence of a scar in close proximity that causes substantial pain in the distribution of the involved nerve. This chapter discusses the definition, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of neuroma. It also reviews common neuromas encountered in clinical practice. A treatment algorithm is presented to guide clinicians as a plausible approach to managing this complex pain syndrome. Painful neuroma following a peripheral nerve injury maybe refractory to treatment. Hence, prevention is the key to neuroma management.",

Neurological involvement in RPC is still rarer and is presumed to be the result of a vasculitic process, although this is seldom confirmed in the literature. We present two cases of RPC complicated by cognitive dysfunction with contrasting clinical trajectories. Our findings suggest that there are two clinical phenotypes of cognitive dysfunction in RPC. The first is a fulminant, multisystem presentation with sub-acute cognitive decline mimicking central nervous system vasculitis, and we provide histopathological evidence of this process occurring. The other is an insidious cognitive decline without associated constitutional or systemic symptoms.",

      "title": "Delirium in Elderly People: A Review",
      "abstract": "The present review aims to highlight this intricate syndrome, regarding diagnosis, pathophysiology, etiology, prevention and management in elderly people. The diagnosis of delirium is based on clinical observations, cognitive assessment, detailed family history, physical and neurological examination. Clinically, delirium occurs in hyperactive, hypoactive or mixed forms, based on psychomotor behaviour. As an acute confusional state, it is characterized by a rapid onset of symptoms, fluctuating course and an altered level of consciousness, global disturbance of cognition or perceptual abnormalities and evidence of a physical cause. In spite of pathophysiological mechanisms of delirium remaining unclear, current evidence suggests that disruption of neurotransmission, inflammation or acute stress responses might all contribute to the development of this ailment. It usually occurs as a result of a complex interaction of multiple risk factors, such as cognitive impairment/dementia, current hip fracture and presence of severe illness. Despite all of the above, delirium is frequently under-recognized and often misdiagnosed by health professionals. In particular, this happens due to its fluctuating nature, its overlap with dementia and the scarcity of routine formal cognitive assessment in general hospitals. It is also associated with multiple adverse outcomes that have been well documented, such as increased hospital stay, function/cognitive decline, institutionalization and mortality. In this context, early identification of delirium will be essential. Timely and optimal management of people with delirium, should be performed with identification of possible underlying causes, dealing with a suitable care environment and improving education of health professionals. All these can be important factors, which contribute to a decrease in adverse outcomes associated with delirium.",

      "title": "Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is characterized by a slowly progressive peripheral sensorimotor and/or autonomic neuropathy as well as non-neuropathic changes of cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, vitreous opacities, and CNS amyloidosis. The disease usually begins in the third to fifth decade in persons from endemic foci in Portugal and Japan; onset is later in persons from other areas. Typically, sensory neuropathy starts in the lower extremities with paresthesias and hypesthesias of the feet, followed within a few years by motor neuropathy. In some persons, particularly those with early-onset disease, autonomic neuropathy is the first manifestation of the condition; findings can include: orthostatic hypotension, constipation alternating with diarrhea, attacks of nausea and vomiting, delayed gastric emptying, sexual impotence, anhidrosis, and urinary retention or incontinence. Cardiac amyloidosis is mainly characterized by progressive cardiomyopathy. Individuals with leptomeningeal amyloidosis may have the following CNS findings: dementia, psychosis, visual impairment, headache, seizures, motor paresis, ataxia, myelopathy, hydrocephalus, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features, amyloid deposits identified on biopsy that bind to anti-TTR antibodies, and identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TTR by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Therapeutic approach based on the characteristics of each therapy and the affected individual's severity of amyloidosis, general condition, and social environment. Pharmacotherapeutics (e.g., TTR tetramer stabilizers, gene-silencing therapies) are first-line therapy for all individuals with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. Limited indication for orthotopic liver transplantation, which is highly invasive and does not address non-neuropathic forms of ATTR amyloidosis. Surgery indicated for carpal tunnel syndrome, vitrectomy for vitreous involvement, and surgical treatment for glaucoma. In those with sick sinus syndrome or second-degree or third-degree AV block, a cardiac pacemaker may be indicated. Surveillance: Serial nerve conduction studies to monitor polyneuropathy; serial electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide levels to monitor cardiomyopathy and conduction block; follow modified body mass index to monitor nutritional status. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Local heating appliances, such as hot-water bottles, which can cause low-temperature burn injury in those with decreased temperature and pain perception. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the family-specific pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing ensures early diagnosis and treatment. If the familial variant is not known, clinical evaluations ensure early diagnosis and treatment. Genetic counseling Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Each child of an affected individual (who is heterozygous for one TTR pathogenic variant) has a 50% chance of inheriting the TTR variant. For affected individuals homozygous for TTR pathogenic variants: Each sib is at a 50% risk of inheriting one TTR pathogenic variant and a 25% risk of inheriting two TTR pathogenic variants; All offspring will inherit a pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in the family. Requests for prenatal testing for adult-onset conditions that (like hereditary ATTR amyloidosis) do not affect intellect and have some treatment available are not common.",

Patients are hypotonic and areflexic from birth, with abnormal facial features and atrophic muscles. Progressive peripheral neuropathy eventually confines them to a wheelchair in the second decade of life, and death occurs by the fourth decade. We here define the neuropathologic features of the disease in autopsy tissues from eight cases. Both developmental and neurodegenerative features were found. Hypoplasia or absence of the major telencephalic commissures and a hypoplasia of corticospinal tracts to half the normal size, were the major neurodevelopmental defects we observed. Despite being a neurodegenerative disease, preservation of brain weight and a conspicuous absence of neuronal or glial cell death were signal features of this disease. Small tumor-like overgrowths of axons, termed axonomas, were found in the central and peripheral nervous system, indicating attempted axonal regeneration. We conclude that the neurodegenerative deficits in HMSN/ACC are primarily caused by an axonopathy superimposed upon abnormal development, affecting peripheral but also central nervous system axons, all ultimately because of a genetic defect in the axonal cotransporter KCC3.",

Despite its prevalence and progression made in neuroimaging, incidence of idiopathic cases continues to rise. Case presentation We report a young adult male with no previous illnesses, who presented with sudden onset of binocular diplopia and headache and was later diagnosed with an isolated ipsilateral abducens nerve palsy secondary to an unknown cause and treated with steroids. The palsy and diplopia had resolved in 2-month time but the patient still continued to suffer from a migraine, such as headache. Conclusion Although, we labelled the patient as idiopathic initially, another plausible cause for this kind of presentation could be recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy (RPON) owing to the nature of the presentation. Cases labelled as idiopathic could be attributed to a defined pathogenesis with detailed history and follow-up. Follow-up is vital for all patients, especially those labelled as idiopathic as recurrence of the illness have the chance of changing the diagnosis if supported by the detailed history and physical examination findings.",

The pathologic findings included lesions of the optic nerve in the case with available material and established the diagnosis of Leigh's subacute necrotizing encephalopathy. This disorder is thought to result from inhibition of a thiamine-dependent enzymatic process and may be modified by greatly increased thiamine intake. Suspicion of the diagnosis in a child with ophthalmoplegia or other ocular abnormalities may lead to earlier recognition and more successful treatment of the disease.

The common causes of these headaches involve extracranial infection due to viral illness, migraine and trauma. Headache with vomiting, fever and meningeal signs suggests meningitis. Taking blood pressure is necessary, even though headache caused by hypertension is rare in children. Neuroimaging should be performed with abnormal neurological findings, atypical headache pattern, or significant change of preexisting headache. Serious underlying diseases, such as brain tumor or intracranial hemorrhage, are uncommon, however they should be diagnosed immediately using neuroimaging because of their urgency.",

Primary mutations of mtDNA include point mutations, as is the case in MERRF and MELAS syndromes, and single large deletions of mtDNA (as observed in Kearns-Sayre syndrome). Secondary abnormalities of mtDNA (such as multiple deletions or depletion of mtDNA) may be found in affected tissues (muscle, nerve, liver …) and generally result from a defect in mtDNA maintenance due to mutations in nuclear genes. In the majority of mitochondrial disorders, the peripheral neuropathy is mild or moderate in severity, with little effect on patient disability but in some instances it can be the first manifestation and/or the main disabling symptom of the disease.",

To prove that the myoclonias are but syndromes, their occurrence even in organic spinal affections such as myelitis and poliomyelitis is cited. However this may be for types of pseudomyoclonia, the pathogenesis of essential myoclonus is now known, in the majority of cases, to develop on a basis of neuropathy from which many other types of the spasmophilia may coincidentally also take their origin, either in the myoclonic's own family or in collateral branches",

      "abstract": "About one-third of people with major depressive disorder (MDD) fail at least two antidepressant drug trials at 1 year. Together with clinical and experimental evidence indicating that the pathophysiology of MDD is multifactorial, this observation underscores the importance of elucidating mechanisms beyond monoaminergic dysregulation that can contribute to the genesis and persistence of MDD. Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are mechanistically linked to the presence of neurovascular dysfunction with blood-brain barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability in selected neurological disorders, such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and Alzheimer's disease. In contrast to other major psychiatric disorders, MDD is frequently comorbid with such neurological disorders and constitutes an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality in disorders characterized by vascular endothelial dysfunction (cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus). Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are implicated in the neurobiology of MDD. More recent evidence links neurovascular dysfunction with BBB hyperpermeability to MDD without neurological comorbidity. We review this emerging literature and present a theoretical integration between these abnormalities to those involving oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in MDD. We discuss our hypothesis that alterations in endothelial nitric oxide levels and endothelial nitric oxide synthase uncoupling are central mechanistic links in this regard. Understanding the contribution of neurovascular dysfunction with BBB hyperpermeability to the pathophysiology of MDD may help to identify novel therapeutic and preventative approaches.",

He developed gait disturbance and weakness of lower limbs at age 52 years. Because of progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, he became bed‐ridden at age 65. At age of 68, he died. His neurological findings presented slight cognitive disturbance, slight manic state, severe muscle weakness, atrophy of four limbs and no extrapyramidal signs and symptoms, and cerebellar ataxia. Neuropathologically, mild neuronal loss and abundant lipid deposits were noted in the neuronal cytoplasm throughout the nervous system, including peripheral autonomic neurons. The most outstanding findings were marked neuronal loss and distended neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, which supports his clinical symptomatology of lower motor neuron disease in this case. The presence of lipofuscin, zebra bodies and membranous cytoplasmic bodies ( MCB ) and the increase of GM 2 ganglioside by biochemistry led to diagnosis of GM 2 gangliosidosis.",

There is considerable overlap between these entities. The mildest cases of acute cerebellar ataxia represent a benign condition that is characterized by acute truncal and gait ataxia, variably with appendicular ataxia, nystagmus, dysarthria, and hypotonia. It occurs mostly in young children, presents abruptly, and recovers over weeks. Neuroimaging is normal. Severe cases of cerebellitis represent the other end of the spectrum, presenting with acute cerebellar signs often overshadowed by alteration of consciousness, focal neurological deficits, raised intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus, and even herniation. Neuroimaging is abnormal and the prognosis is less favorable than in acute cerebellar ataxia. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis may be confused with acute cerebellitis when the clinical findings are predominantly cerebellar, but lesions on neuroimaging are usually widespread. Paraneoplastic opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome is often initially misdiagnosed as acute cerebellar ataxia, but has very specific features, course, and etiopathogensis.",

Autonomic failure is reported in approximately 65 % of patientswith GBS and usually follows extensive motor involvement. In this case our patient presented with syncope and other signs of autonomic failure before the motor weakness developed. Few cases in the literature have reported features of autonomic failure before established weakness in GBS; to our knowledge, syncope has not been described previously as a presenting feature of GBS.",

The personality defect or constitutional inferiority is probably an inherited defect and can be demonstrated in the behavior disturbances and reaction patterns that distinguish epileptic children. 1 These children in the early stages of the disease are usually mentally precocious; they are excitable, highly emotional and self-centered, and they lack power of concentration. It is only later in the disease, after repeated seizures have definitely injured the brain, that the mental deterioration and apathy become manifest. The opinion regarding the inheritance of the personality defect is based on a study of more than 500 histories of epileptic children. In these a family history of migraine, nervous instability, epilepsy, insanity, syphilis and alcoholism",

Elle recouvre probablement des pathologies variées : infections virales, blocages microcirculatoires, processus auto-immuns, ruptures membraneuses. Les diagnostics différentiels principaux sont le neurinome de l'acoustique et les dissections artérielles vertébrobasilaires qui peuvent se présenter avec une surdité brutale. Les principaux éléments du pronostic sont : l'importance de la surdité, le type de la courbe audiométrique (ascendante, plate ou descendante) et la présence de vertiges. Il est difficile de prouver l'efficacité des traitements en raison de la fréquence des régressions spontanées précoces. Il a été proposé d'associer corticoïdes et traitements à visée vasculaire. D'autres traitements ont été proposés : carbogène, antiviraux, etc. Les surdités fluctuantes ont une nosologie mal établie. Certaines évoluent vers une importante surdité, parfois bilatérale. La cause la plus fréquente est la maladie de Ménière avec vertiges paroxystiques présents soit d'emblée, soit secondairement dans un délai de 6 mois. Lorsqu'elles sont bilatérales, il faut penser à la syphilis, aux malformations cochléaires, aux maladies auto-immunes. Souvent la cause reste inconnue. Leur traitement reste incertain. Idiopathic sudden hearing loss may be isolated or associated with vertiginous symptoms. The pathophysiologic mechanism is unclear. Probably it represents the common end point of numerous and various pathologic processes: viral infection, microcirculatory disorders, autoimmune disorders, intralabyrinthine membrane ruptures. Acoustic neuromas and vertebrobasilar dissection are rare cause of sudden hearing loss but should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The treatment is nihilistic (no therapy) or based on the use of blood flow promoting drugs with steroids. A number of other treatments have been advocated including antiviral drugs and carbogen. The principal factor that makes the analysis of treatment efficacy difficult is the high rate of early spontaneous resolution. Principal prognosis factors are: the severity of the loss, flat or downsloping audiograms, and the presence of vertigo that all must be taken into account when trying to ascertain the benefit of any treatment. Fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss is a poorly defined clinical entity with the potential for progressive serious hearing impairment. While the aetiology includes syphilis, cochlear malformations, autoimmune and perilymphatic fistulas, the most common origin is Meniere disease. In the early stage, episodic vertigo may be absent but appears within 6 months. Very often, the origin remains unknown. Any specific treatment may be advised.",

Clinical signs of neurological damage develop gradually and include excitability, circling or staggering gait, ataxia, frequent vocalization, head pressing, stargazing (upward lift of the head and neck, staring at the sky), fixed and dilated pupils, apparent blindness, and muscle trembling. The typical PEM macroscopic change is loss of the gray matter of the neocortex.

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a prevalent non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which can result in significant disability and distress for patients and caregivers. There is a marked variation in the timing, characteristics and rate at which cognitive decline occurs in patients with PD. This decline can vary from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Cognitive impairment is associated with several pathophysiological mechanisms, including the accumulation of β-amyloid and tau in the brain, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunctions are commonly observed in patients with PD. These dysfunctions play a role in the progression of cognitive impairment, the incidents of falls and even in mortality. The majority of symptoms of dysautonomia arise from changes in the peripheral autonomic nervous system, including both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Cardiovascular changes, including orthostatic hypotension, supine hypertension and abnormal nocturnal blood pressure (BP), can occur in both the early and advanced stages of PD. These changes tend to increase as the disease advances. The present review aimed to describe the cognitive changes in the setting of cardiovascular dysautonomia and to discuss strategies through which these changes can be modified and managed. It is a multifactorial process usually involving decreased blood flow to the brain, resulting in the development of cerebral ischemic lesions, an increased presence of abnormal white matter signals in the brain, and a potential influence on the process of neurodegeneration in PD. Another possible explanation is this association being independent observations of PD progression. Patients with clinical symptoms of dysautonomia should undergo 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, as they are frequently subtle and underdiagnosed.",

Neuronal depletion in the ventral tegmental area frequently is associated with similar cell loss in the adjacent substantia nigra and in the locus ceruleus.

      "abstract": "The prevalence of dementia increases with age. In rare cases, people younger than 65 years old are also affected, with substantial consequences for the professional life. The symptoms depend on the form of dementia and can vary individually. Impairment of short-term memory is not always in the foreground and other neurocognitive domains, such as the disturbance of executive functions can have a significant impact on the ability to cope with everyday life. Pathophysiologically, neurodegenerative dementias with the major forms of Alzheimer's dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia are distinguished from vascular dementias. Mixed forms are common. There is no curative treatment, but progression can be slowed by nonpharmacological measures and, especially in Alzheimer's dementia, by pharmacological treatment. Appropriate measures can promote independence and autonomy for as long as possible; however, in the course of the disease restrictions in the extended activities of independent living will initially occur, such as banking transactions, use of means of transport and, in the further course, also in the basic activities of daily living. Legal capacity and the ability to consent to health interventions are restricted sooner or later; however, this must always be evaluated for the specific situation and is not generally the case with the diagnosis of dementia. Instruments such as living wills, identification of a health care proxy, and advanced care planning should be used at an early stage. To decrease family caregiver burden with the increased risk of developing depression, supportive, accompanying measures and education are of great importance.Demenzen treten mit zunehmendem Lebensalter vermehrt auf. In seltenen Fällen sind auch jüngere Menschen betroffen, mit erheblichem Einfluss auf die Berufstätigkeit. Die Symptome hängen von der Demenzform ab und können individuell unterschiedlich ausgeprägt sein. Nicht immer steht die Störung des Kurzzeitgedächtnisses im Vordergrund, vielmehr können andere neurokognitive Domänen wie die Störung der Exekutivfunktion sich erheblich auf die Alltagsfähigkeit auswirken. Pathophysiologisch werden die neurodegenerativen Demenzen mit den wichtigsten Formen Alzheimer-Demenz, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz und frontotemporale Demenz abgegrenzt von den vaskulären Demenzen. Mischformen sind häufig. Eine kurative Therapie besteht nicht, die Progression kann jedoch durch nichtpharmakologische Maßnahmen und, insbesondere bei der Alzheimer-Demenz, auch durch pharmakologische Therapie abgebremst werden. Es gilt, die Selbstständigkeit und Autonomie betroffener Patienten zu fördern. Im Verlauf kommt es jedoch zunächst zu Einschränkungen in den erweiterten Aktivitäten der selbstständigen Lebensführung wie Bankgeschäften, Nutzung von Verkehrsmitteln und im weiteren Verlauf auch den basalen Funktionen der Selbsthilfefähigkeit. Geschäftsfähigkeit und Einwilligungsfähigkeit in Bezug auf gesundheitliche Eingriffe sind früher oder später eingeschränkt. Dies muss jedoch immer wieder für die konkrete Situation evaluiert werden und liegt nicht grundsätzlich mit der Diagnose Demenz vor. Frühzeitig sollten Instrumente wie die Patientenverfügung, Vorsorgevollmacht oder vorausschauende Gesundheitsplanung („advance care planning“) genutzt werden. Pflegende Angehörige sind häufig stark belastet und haben ein erhöhtes Risiko, an einer Depression zu erkranken. Daher sind unterstützende begleitende Maßnahmen von großer Bedeutung.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia-Like Psychoses in Young Children",
      "abstract": "The immature psyche of the child is at least as easily upset by both organic and psychological factors as is that of the adult. The slightest fever or digestive upset may, in a child, lead to bad temper, lack of appetite and sleeplessness. In spite, however, of the ease with which minor psychological disorders are brought about, the severe mental disturbances constituting the psychoses are very infrequently met with. Those to be described occur in the early years of life. Some of them resemble serious behaviour and personality disorders; some would seem to be of organic ætiology. Common to all are regressive changes leading especially to loss of recent attainments, and to some disorganization of the personality following a hitherto normal development.",

      "title": "Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus in Acute Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "Whether or not nonconvulsive status epilepticus produces permanent brain damage is a source of controversy. Contributing to the controversy is the lack of clarity for classifying the clinical and electrographic phenomena that constitute nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus commonly occurs in the context of an acute brain injury. For example, it commonly persists in generalized convulsive status epilepticus after convulsive activity has stopped, and it is not uncommonly associated with acute cerebral ischemia. Its clinical characteristics are ambiguous, subtle, and nonspecific making the diagnosis difficult. In the absence of EEG testing, it is likely to be missed or delayed. When acute brain injury and nonconvulsive status epilepticus occur concurrently, the severity of acute brain injury has traditionally been accepted as determining patient outcome. However, increasing evidence suggests that the two conditions are synergistically detrimental and increase brain injury. Guidelines remain to be established for the intensity and duration of anticonvulsant therapy in these patients. Evidence suggests that, in the absence of extreme and irreversible acute brain injury, early intensive intervention is necessary to improve the otherwise poor outcome of these patients.",

Each of these symptom types is probably related to different brain processes that are altered in the depressed state. A further line of investigation is in the exploring of these brain processes. Even if the symptoms presenting in the patients are not able to discriminate between the underlying aetiologies, it is possible that associated neurocognitive deficits do. Depression is a disorder of mood, cognition, and behaviour with associated disturbance of brain structure and function. Psychomotor retardation reflects ventral striatum-cortico-thalamic network dysfunction and is associated with severe depression. There is decreased hippocampal volume and disturbed memory and learning in depression. Amygdala–anterior cingulate networks normally responsible for emotion regulation are disturbed in depression. Cognitive distortions seen in depression have associated abnormalities in prefrontal regions. Neurocognitive characteristics can distinguish between unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders.",

      "title": "Improvement of negative symptoms: concepts, definition and assessment",
      "abstract": "The development of new medications for the treatment of schizophrenia is closely tied to the concept of the disorder and its characteristic symptoms. In recent years, the symptoms have been divided into two broad categories: positive and negative. Positive symptoms tend to command clinical attention and to be treatment-responsive, while negative symptoms are more insidious and disabling, but less spectacular. Negative symptoms, which are similar to the core symptoms of schizophrenia defined by Krapaelin and Bleuler, have not received much attention until recently because of concern about reliability. However, rating scales with good reliability are now available for use in clinical and neurobiological studies. Clinical drug trials are also meeting the challenge of documenting the response to carefully rated negative symptoms. In addition, they are exploring the effects of medication on negative symptoms that are primary rather than secondary to reduced extrapyramidal side effects, or of medication that lowers levels of depression or decreases the demoralizing effects of positive symptoms. One ideal strategy for identifying the effects of medication on primary negative symptoms is to study patients with high levels of negative symptoms and low levels of positive symptoms, who are in the early stages of the illness and have been given minimal treatment with classical neuroleptics. Such samples are highly informative, but difficult to collect. Alternatively, when all confounders cannot be eliminated, the effects of medication can be explored using statistical techniques to examine covariance",

Porphyric neuropathy is an acute to subacute motor predominant axonal neuropathy with a predilection for the upper extremities and usually preceded by a predominantly parasympathetic autonomic neuropathy. The rapid progression and associated dysautonomia mimic Guillain‐Barré syndrome but are distinguished by the absence of cerebrospinal fluid albuminocytologic dissociation, progression beyond 4 wk, and associated abdominal pain. Spot urine test to assess the porphyrin precursors delta‐aminolevulinic acid and porphobilinogen can provide a timely diagnosis during an acute attack. Timely treatment with intravenous heme, carbohydrate loading, and avoidance of porphyrinogenic medications can prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

      "title": "Pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease: From clinical neurology to basic neuroscience and back",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor and nonmotor (cognitive and limbic) deficits. The motor signs of PD include hypokinetic signs such as akinesia/bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of normal postural reflexes, and hyperkinetic signs such as tremor. Dopamine depletion in the striatum is the hallmark of PD and of its animal models, still the pathophysiology of the parkinsonian symptoms and especially of parkinsonian tremor are under debate. The most extreme hypotheses argue about peripheral versus central nervous system origin, intrinsic cellular oscillator versus network oscillators, and basal ganglia-based pathophysiology versus cerebellar–thalamic based pathophysiology. Recent studies support the view that parkinsonian symptoms are most likely due to abnormal synchronous oscillating neuronal activity within the basal ganglia. Peripheral factors do only play a minor role for the generation, maintenance, and modulation of PD tremor and other signs. The most likely candidates producing these neuronal oscillations are the weakly coupled neural networks of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops. However, the present evidence supports the view that the basal ganglia loops are influenced by other neuronal structures and systems and that the tuning of these loops by cerebello–thalamic mechanisms and by other modulator neurotransmitter systems entrain the abnormal synchronized oscillations. Neurosurgical procedures, such as lesions or high-frequency stimulation of different parts of the loop, might resume the normal unsynchronized activity of the basal ganglia circuitry, and, therefore, ameliorate the clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease. © 2002 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "At the onset, differentiation between abnormal non-epileptic movements, and epileptic seizures presenting in early life is difficult as is clinical diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of the various seizure disorders presenting at this age. Seizures starting in the first year of life including the neonatal period might have a favorable course, such as in infants presenting with benign familial neonatal epilepsy, febrile seizures simplex or acute symptomatic seizures. However, in some cases, the onset of seizures at birth or in the first months of life have a dramatic evolution with severe cerebral impairment. Seizure disorders starting in early life include the \"epileptic encephalopathies\", a group of conditions characterized by drug resistant seizures, delayed developmental skills, and intellective disability. This group of disorders includes early infantile epileptic encephalopathy also known as Ohtahara syndrome, early myoclonic encephalopathy, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures, infantile spasms syndrome (also known as West syndrome), severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (also known as Dravet syndrome) and, myoclonic encephalopathies in non-progressive disorder. Here we report on seizures manifesting in the first year of life including the neonatal period. Conditions with a benign course, and those with severe evolution are presented. At this early age, clinical identification of seizures, distinction of each of these disorders, type of treatment and prognosis is particularly challenging. The aim of this report is to present the clinical manifestations of each of these disorders and provide an updated review of the conditions associated with seizures in the first year of life.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common movement disorder associated with considerable disability. The clinical syndrome of parkinsonism is based on the presence of core clinical features of rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and impaired postural reflexes or gait. Parkinsonism is most often caused by Parkinson's disease, but can also be caused by other disorders, including cerebrovascular disease, multiple-system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and other disorders. Parkinsonism can be identified by questionnaires and confirmed in person or by videotaped clinical examinations. The identification of presymptomatic cases remains problematic but is motivated by the hope for treatment before symptoms appear. Quantitative approaches to the diagnosis of parkinsonism based on the measurement of the cardinal features are available. Clinical approaches should include identification of features atypical for Parkinson's disease, which exclude the diagnosis, and documentation of a response to dopaminergic medications, which support a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Loss of smell and visual dysfunction are found in early patients and may be useful in screening protocols. In addition, behavioral changes, including depressive symptoms, may be detected in presymptomatic cases. Cognitive changes, such as impaired set shifting, have been observed in early Parkinson's disease, but can be seen with other causes of parkinsonism. Neuroimaging techniques, including positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography, are available to quantify dopaminergic neurons, while magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in differentiating other forms of parkinsonism from Parkinson's disease. There are numerous approaches available to the identification of parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease. The gold standard remains a clinical diagnosis, confirmed by autopsy.",

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

In childhood, EE could manifest as tonic head drop seizures, generalized seizures, or late-onset epileptic spasms. However, in teenagers or adults, seizures are often preceded by aura and commonly manifest as focal seizures with or without impaired awareness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities are seen in less than half of the reported cases. Posterior or multifocal interictal discharges can be seen in patients with EE.

Examination limitations, complex comorbidities, and technical difficulties associated with electrodiagnostic testing in an ICU setting also create unique challenges during evaluation of patients with possible neuromuscular disorders. Respiratory failure may occur as an initial sign of an underlying neuromuscular disorder, as a chronic respiratory insufficiency, or as an inability to wean the patient from mechanical ventilation. Respiratory function is often closely related to dysphagia, which may also lead to aspiration and sudden worsening of respiratory function. In addition to weakness, progressive cardiomyopathy associated with myopathies can precipitate cardiac failure and arrhythmias and even necessitate heart transplantation. This chapter reviews clinical manifestations of neuromuscular disorders in the ICU.",

Most treatments are geared toward the management and relief of motor symptoms in Parkinson's patients; however, as the disease progresses, various complications can be observed. Non-motor symptoms (NMS) may arise simply from the disease itself and are highly destructive to quality of life. These symptoms include mood disorders, cognitive dysfunction, pain, sensory dysfunction, and dysautonomia. Though it is undisputed that many NMS may appear years or even decades prior to the clinical diagnosis of PD, the focus of this review will be the overt motor phase of the condition. As such, the focus of this paper is to review the major NMS found in PD patients status post-diagnosis, their etiology, as well as treatment options available for the individual NMS.",

Parkinson's ailment (PD) takes place due to the deficiency of dopamine hormone that regulates various activities of the human body. Researchers have diagnosed that voice defect is the major and early symptom of PD affected persons. Machine Learning (ML) has helped in detecting Parkinson's early with the aid of the usage of computer vision, natural language processing [8], speech recognition and so on. There may be no one unique symptom for the Parkinson's ailment not like the alternative neuro issues. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is critical to forestall or sluggish down the progression of the ailment in its tracks. The primary signs of the PD encompass tremors or shaking of fingers, palms, legs, jaw or head, stiffness of palms and trunk and in the end sluggish movement. The signs of Parkinson's ailment range from one individual to the subsequent and there may be no unique remedy for Parkinson's ailment however its impact can be lessened with the aid of early detecting and taking right medicine. Here, detecting the PD with the aid of the usage of LightGBM classifier is proposed. LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that makes use of tree primarily based studying set of rules. LightGBM is more efficient and accurate compared to the alternative algorithms like XGBoost, CatBoost [13]. So, the performance of detecting the PD may be extended with the aid of the usage of this Classifier.",

Dementia in PD is nor responsive to dopamine replacement therapy, and is associated with a high morbidity, poor prognosis, and rapid progression. PD is characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra associated with accumulation of the synaptic protein α-synuclein, forming the pathological hallmark Lewy bodies (LB). However, advanced stages of PD are associated with other factors which may contribute to dementia, such as neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, vascular changes, and normal ageing processes. The literature reviewed in this chapter suggests that LB pathology appears to be the central pathology in PD-D but other factors also contribute.",

Manifestations of myelinolysis usually evolve several days after correction of hyponatremia. Typical features are disorders of upper motor neurons, spastic quadriparesis and pseudobulbar palsy, and mental disorders ranging from mild confusion to coma. Death may occur. The motor and localizing signs of myelinolysis differ from the generalized encephalopathy that is caused by untreated hyponatremia. Experiments have duplicated the clinical and pathologic features of myelinolysis by rapidly reversing hyponatremia in animals.Myelinolysis is more likely to occur after the treatment of chronic rather than acute hyponatremia and is more likely to occur with a rapid rate of correction. The exact pathogenesis of myelinolysis has not been determined. Optimal management of hyponatremic patients involves weighing the risk for illness and death from untreated hyponatremia against the risk for myelinolysis due to correction of hyponatremia.Experiments in animals and clinical experience suggest that correction of chronic hyponatremia should be kept at a rate less than 10 mmol/L in any 24-hour period.",

Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

Degenerative disease of the motor nerves or muscles is usually evident and, in contrast to other causes, sensory changes are usually absent. Frequently, however, the etiology of the ulnar nerve dysfunction remains obscure despite careful history, examination, and x-rays. Therefore, two cases of ulnar nerve dysfunction caused by a rather unusual mechanism will be described.

Although the major neuronal migrations that form the cortical plate occur by the 16th week of gestation, late migrations from the germinal matrix into the cerebral cortex continue until five months postnatally. The external granular layer of the cerebellar cortex continues to migrate until 1 year of age. Ample opportunity thus exists for disturbances of these migratory processes in the postnatal period. Focal zones of imperfect cortical lamination, small hamartomas, and microscopic subcortical heterotopia are often encountered during postmortem examination of infant brains. These focal structural anomalies are usually dismissed as incidental findings.

      "abstract": "Psychic disturbances are frequently present in patients with Parkinson's disease. They increase the disability and handicap, contribute to poor quality of life and often make the treatment of motor symptoms more difficult. Cognitive impairment may be restricted to subtle changes on neuropsychological testing, but the evolution towards a dementia appears more frequent than previously thought. Depression, anxiety and hallucinations are common but may be underestimated. During recent years, new psychiatric aspects have been described such as apathy and the so-called syndrome of dopamine dysregulation.",

      "abstract": "The neurologic examination begins with the signalment and a thorough history, including information regarding age, sex, breed, previous medical history, age at onset of neurologic signs, and any treatments administered. The neurologic examination should include a complete physical examination, as systemic diseases that involve the central nervous system (CNS) are common in the foal. The gait of the foal should be examined for weakness or ataxia. The newborn foal often has a choppy, springy, dysmetric gait. Signs of weakness include stumbling, knuckling, dragging a toe, or trembling. Further evaluation of weakness is performed by pushing or pulling from side to side and/or backing. Meningitis is a bacterial, viral, or protozoal disease of the meningeal structures, with bacterial meningitis being the most commonly diagnosed. The condition occurs more commonly in young foals than in neonates or older foals. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy should be considered for the prevention of secondary infection in the compromised patient.",

      "title": "Differentiating Multifocal Motor Neuropathy from Entrapment Neuropathy—A Diagnostic Challenge",
      "abstract": "Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare, treatable neuropathy, but good long-term outcomes are dependent on early treatment. Appropriate diagnostic criteria exist for MMN, but it has a heterogeneous clinical presentation, and, when confined to a small group of nerves, its clinical presentation can overlap with entrapment neuropathies. Electrodiagnosis is a useful diagnostic technique but occasionally MMN can be misdiagnosed as entrapment neuropathies. Misdiagnosis should rarely occur since the nerve involvement in MMN is usually not at sites of common nerve entrapment, and the impact of misdiagnosis can be substantial. The treatments of these conditions differ significantly: intravenous immunoglobulin is the standard therapy for MMN, while treatment options for entrapment neuropathies include conservative treatment, such as splinting, corticosteroids, or surgery. Such treatment in MMN may worsen symptoms, potentially leading to progressive motor symptoms, including muscle weakness, atrophy, and significant motor disability. Two exemplary cases are presented, which highlight the importance of differential diagnosis of these conditions. Emerging technologies, such as high-resolution sonography and magnetic resonance neurography, will aid in defining future diagnostic criteria of MMN.",

      "abstract": "Facial weakness, slurred speech, and difficulty swallowing are closely related in the neurology patient as these are common symptoms in disorders such as stroke, with or without direct cranial nerve involvement. In the otolaryngology patient, there are usually other diagnoses to consider for these three disorders, where specific cranial nerves or target muscles are usually the etiology. The differential etiologies are nevertheless important from both disciplines, and a standardized approach to evaluation and treatment is necessary for interdisciplinary care.",
