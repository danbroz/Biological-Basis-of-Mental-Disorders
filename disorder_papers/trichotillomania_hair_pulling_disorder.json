      "title": "Making sense of the role of sense organs in trichotillomania",
      "abstract": "Hallopeau, a French dermatologist, coined the term trichotillomania to describe alopecia (baldness) caused by self-traction of the hair, but the term now encompasses the entire syndrome of pathological hair pulling.[1] In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5),[2] the major change for trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) is the fact that it and related disorders now have their own chapter in the obsessive–compulsive disorder section. Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) includes recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss, repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling, and the hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Furthermore, the hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a dermatological condition), and the hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder). There has been lot of debates and discussion if trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder, obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorder, or should be classified as a category of body-focused repetitive behavioral disorder.[3] Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) has been moved to obsessive–compulsive and related disorders in DSM 5; however, in International Classification of Diseases-10, it is classified under habit and impulse control disorders.[4] Lifetime prevalence rates of trichotillomania have been estimated to vary from 0.6% to 3.6%. Trichotillomania often begins or is recognized in late childhood or early adolescence with an average age of onset around 13 years and displays a chronic but fluctuating course.[5] It involves an individual recurrently pulling hair, generally one hair at a time from any part of his/her body, the head, eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, genital area, underarms, chest, legs, or other area. The scalp is the most common area. Pulling typically is done with the fingers, but tools such as tweezers, brushes, or combs may also be used.[6] Trichotillomania is associated with a significant functional impairment and psychiatric comorbidity across the developmental spectrum. As trichotillomania usually strikes during the sensitive developmental years, it can be especially disabling. Young adults with trichotillomania report impaired school, work, and social functioning, lowered career aspirations, and missed work days. Pulling can also negatively impact family functioning, contributing to family arguments, and secrecy, which in turn can increase stress and exacerbate trichotillomania symptoms. Adults also report that spending considerable financial resources on concealment methods and on treatments.[7] POINT OF VIEW The majority of literature and definitions focus on the act of pulling the hair, the preceding tension, and the relief of anxiety following the act. A variety of factors such as a sensation of itch, boredom, mood changes, stress, and negative emotions serve as triggers to pull the hairs.[8] Pre- and post-pulling activities are documented in literature but are mentioned just as activities surrounding the hair pulling. They receive little or no attention in the whole diagnosis, understanding and management of the disorder. There are lack of satisfactory explanations provided for majority of the postpulling activities and behaviors. An article by Woods and Houghton[5] mentions \"Rituals and behavioral patterns often precede pulling, such as combing through the hair, feeling individual hairs, tugging at hairs, and visually searching the scalp and the hairline. Pre- and post-pulling behavior are also clinically relevant. Although some individuals simply discard pulled hairs, others may play with the hair between their fingers, inspect the hair, bite the hair between the teeth, or ingest all or parts of the hair\". Activities surrounding the hair pulling provide pleasure to the persons with trichotillomania which probably acts a positive reinforcement to pull the hair. The pleasure may come through various sensory modalities which may vary from person to person. If hair pulling is only the primary goal, the patients should just pull the hair one by one and throw which hardly happens. They are involved in varied activities seeking pleasure involving all the sense organs which may vary from person to person. Antecedent activities such as feeling the texture of the hair, twirling, curling, grooming, combing, desire to have an even hairline, identifying the right hair, and then, the particular hair is pulled, all involve the touch sensation. The pulled hair is actually visualized for its characteristics such as length and color which involves the visual modality. The hairs are rubbed against each other, the snap pulling sound involves the hearing modality; at times, patients do even smell the hairs mixed with sweat to experience pleasure (Olfaction). Swallowing, tasting, the whole hair or a part of the hair is widely reported in literature which may be a way of experiencing the hair or else why should a person interested in only pulling the hairs swallow it. Oral behavior using pulled hair is present in half the patients and 5%–18% ingest their hair.[9] Trichophagia is a condition where persons swallow hair. Few patients swallow only the root of the hair called trichorhizophagia. Trichobezoar is a condition wherein swallowed hair starts accumulating in the stomach over a period to form a concretion which presents later with features of malnutrition and intestinal obstruction.[10] In a study by Grant et al.,[11] the rate of trichophagia in 68 individuals with DSM-IV-TR trichotillomania was approximately 1 in 5 (20.6%). CONCLUSION All the sense organs are involved in the varied pre-/post-pulling activities which vary from person to person and serve to maintain the behavior by reinforcements. It is also possible that in a subset of people, the pleasure-providing behaviors are these surrounding acts and hair pulling is just the modality of fulfilling it. Our diagnostic guidelines focus only on the hair pulling act. The behaviors surrounding the hair pulling problem will further help in the psychological management and also bring new insights into this poorly understood illness.",

      "abstract": "Trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder characterized by repetitive self-pulling of hair, usually from the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, and/or other body areas, which results in hair loss. The clinical aspect of trichotillomania is variable. Classically, it is characterized by single or multiple, ill-defined patches of incomplete alopecia displaying short and broken hairs of varying lengths. However, in some cases the alopecic patches may be well-delimited simulating alopecia areata, whereas in other cases hair pulling may determine diffuse alopecia. Histopathology is rarely performed in trichotillomania. The most frequent findings are catagen and telogen hairs without evidence of inflammation associated with empty anagen follicles. The diagnosis of trichotillomania is often challenging and is mainly based on history and clinical examination. Dermoscopy is very useful in doubtful cases. Trichotillomania is very difficult to treat because of the psychological stress behind it. Trichotillomania may result in prominent hair loss and significant distress and/or functional impairment.",

Hair pulling as a symptom has been reported to occur in association with many conditions, including normal development, personality and developmental disorders, and psychosis (2). In contrast, the syndrome of trichotillomania appears to arise de novo and is characterized by urge-driven, repetitive hair pulling, increased tension when pulling is resisted, and a sense of relief after pulling (DSM-IV). Substantial distress and noticeable hair loss are also diagnostic; the condition is frequently chronic and unremitting (2).

More than one-third of individuals with BDD compulsively pick their skin to try to make it look better; however, because the picking can be time consuming and involve use of sharp implements such as pins, needles, or razor blades, it can cause considerable skin damage, which may require sutures or surgery to repair. Trichotillomania (TTM) is characterized by recurrent pulling out of one's hair. Hair is most commonly pulled from the scalp, eyebrows, or eyelids, but it may be pulled from axillary, facial, or pubic areas, or from any area of the body where hair grows.

      "abstract": "Trichotillomania is categorized as an Impulse-Control Disorder. The following article brings to light that this disorder man not be as rare as some clinicians think. The following discussion delineates Trichotillomania in terms of its descriptive characteristics, onset and course, associated disorders, relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and treatment. Research indicates a combination of psychopharmacology and cognitive-behavioral therapy as the choice of treatment for this disorder. Following the content discussion of Trichotillomania is a transcript of an interview with one of the authors (K. A.) who was previously diagnosed with Trichotillomania. INTRODUCTION Trichotillomania is categorized as an Impulse-Control Disorder and is defined by the following five criteria listed in the DSM-IV (1994): a) recurrent pulling of one's hair resulting in noticeable hair loss, b) an increasing sense of tension immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the behavior, c) pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the hair, d) the disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder and is not due to a general medical condition, e) the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. (p. 621) This article seeks to provide an overview of Trichotillomania in terms of its history and descriptive characteristics, onset and course of illness, associated disorders, its relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and the treatment of choice for Trichotillomania. HISTORY AND DESCRIPTIVE CHARACTERISTICS History In 1889 a French dermatologist, Hallopeau, described a man who pulled out his hair in large amounts (Swedo, 1993). Hallopeau used the term trichotillomania to describe this behavior. Before Hallopeau's encounter with his client, references to hair-pulling had already been documented. In 1779, Baudament reported on a 16-year-old boy who pulled out his hair and actually ate it. Eventually, this ingestion of hair led to gastrointestinal problems because the boy developed hair balls in his stomach (Christenson & Mackenzie, 1994). Once thought to be rare, this disorder is far from uncommon. It has been estimated that approximately eight million Americans are afflicted with this disorder (Azrin & Nunn, 1978). A survey conducted by Rothbaum, Shaw, Morris, and Ninan (1993) revealed that of the 490 college freshman respondents, 10% reported compulsive hair-pulling. Despite these statistics, the literature is very scarce regarding this disorder. Characteristics Trichotillomania is predominately found in the female population. Christenson, Mackenzie, and Mitchell (1991) found that 93% of 60 adult chronic hair-pullers were women. Likewise, Swedo and Leonard (1992) found that 70% of 43 sampled children, adolescents, and adults who were chronic hair-pullers were female. Christenson and Mackenzie (1994) found a more equal sex ratio in children under the age of six. Hair-pulling can occur from many body locations. A study done by Swedo and Leonard (1992) found that the most common area from which hair is pulled is the scalp, followed by eyelashes, eyebrows, pubis, body (arm/leg), and face (beard). Most individuals pluck hair from at least two sites, with sites varying over time. Those diagnosed with this disorder typically think that the hair that is pulled is somehow different from other hair. For example, chronic hair-pullers may pluck kinky or course hair so that they may feel right about their hair, thus reducing anxiety (Swedo & Rapoport, 1991.). After the hair is pulled, other ritualistic acts can follow. For instance, some individuals will play with or twirl their extracted hair, while others may brush it against their cheeks or lips. Some individuals will even go as far as ingesting their hair (trichophagia), possibly leading to gastrointestinal difficulties or even death (Swedo & Leonard, 1992). …",

This is a non-systematic review article focusing on the psychopathological features of hair pulling. It is speculated that hair pulling may function to provide short-term relief from stress and other unwanted emotional states, thus serving as a method of emotion regulation. The prevalence of trichotillomania ranges from 1 to 3%. The most targeted site is the scalp, and other common areas include pubic hair and facial regions such as the eyebrows, eyelashes, and beard. Individuals suffering from this disorder tend to avoid social environments due to embarrassment regarding their appearance and fears of being judged by peers. Trichotillomania is associated with significant functional impairment and increased risks of comorbid psychiatric disorders such as other body-focused repetitive behaviors, depression, anxiety, and addictive disorders. This article reviews the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, and psychopathology of trichotillomania with an emphasis on psychopathology and psychiatric comorbidity.",

      "abstract": "Hair loss is often distressing and can have a significant effect on the patient's quality of life. Patients may present to their family physician first with diffuse or patchy hair loss. Scarring alopecia is best evaluated by a dermatologist. Nonscarring alopecias can be readily diagnosed and treated in the family physician's office. Androgenetic alopecia can be diagnosed clinically and treated with minoxidil. Alopecia areata is diagnosed by typical patches of hair loss and is self-limited. Tinea capitis causes patches of alopecia that may be erythematous and scaly and must be treated systemically. Telogen effluvium is a nonscarring, noninflammatory alopecia of relatively sudden onset caused by physiologic or emotional stress. Once the precipitating cause is removed, the hair typically will regrow. Trichotillomania is an impulse-control disorder; treatment is aimed at controlling the underlying psychiatric condition. Trichorrhexis nodosa occurs when hairs break secondary to trauma and is often a result of hair styling or overuse of hair products. Anagen effluvium is the abnormal diffuse loss of hair during the growth phase caused by an event that impairs the mitotic activity of the hair follicle, most commonly chemotherapy. Physician support is especially important for patients in this situation.",

      "abstract": "Acute telogen effluvium refers to sudden onset of scalp hair loss occurring 2 to 3 months after a triggering event such as a high fever, surgical trauma, sudden starvation, or hemorrhage. While emotional stress is often linked to this condition, evidence supporting this connection is weak, and there is no indication that the stress of daily life alone can cause widespread hair loss. The primary mechanism behind hair loss is the immediate release of anagen hairs. Patients may notice increased hair loss during brushing, combing, or shampooing, with daily losses ranging from under 100 to over 1,000 strands. If shedding occurs at lower rates and for a short duration, baldness may not be apparent, but higher rates can lead to a diffuse reduction in hair density. Spontaneous and complete regrowth typically occurs within 3 to 6 months unless the triggering event is repeated. Abrupt-onset telogen effluvium is often linked to a specific event or trigger 6 to 16 weeks earlier. In acute telogen effluvium, the hair pull test is positive, with normal club hairs, and there is usually a strong positive presence of telogen hairs at the vertex and the scalp margins.[1]",

The diagnosis of trichotillomania is excluded when there is a preexisting skin disorder or when the behavior results from underlying psychosis.

Trichotillomania has been documented in the medical literature since the 19th century. Prevalence studies suggest that trichotillomania is a common disorder (point prevalence estimates of 0.5%–2.0%). Although grouped with the obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-5, trichotillomania is distinct from OCD in many respects. For example, the treatment of trichotillomania generally employs habit reversal therapy and medication (n-acetylcysteine or olanzapine), both of which are quite different from those used to treat OCD. Conversely, some first-line treatments used for OCD (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) appear ineffective for trichotillomania. This article presents what is known about trichotillomania and the evidence for a variety of treatment interventions.",

Although it is classified under Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders in the DSM-5, there is ongoing debate about this classification due to its unique features. The disorder often co-occurs with other psychiatric conditions, such as depression and anxiety, necessitating comprehensive psychiatric evaluations for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Behavioral therapy, particularly habit reversal therapy (HRT), is the most effective treatment, though its benefits are often temporary, lasting only 3 to 6 months, highlighting the need for sustained management. Additionally, trichotillomania can lead to severe physical complications, such as gastrointestinal obstructions (trichobezoars) in those who ingest pulled hair, making physical health screenings critical. Despite the disorder's impact, many patients do not seek treatment due to shame or the belief that healthcare providers lack sufficient knowledge about the condition, pointing to a significant gap in awareness and the need for better education among professionals. Given the significant psychological and physical impacts of trichotillomania, healthcare providers must prioritize early recognition, comprehensive care, and ongoing management to treat patients effectively.",

After detection of trichotillomania, her head was shaved by her parents in order to avoid pulling of the hair, but triggered additional psychiatric problems and isolation. Trichotillomania usually can be seen in children aged 10 to 13 years but in this case occurred at the young age of 4.5 years. Conclusions: Trichotillomania may also be seen in preschool-aged children and may be associated with separation anxiety disorder. Improper and late treatment can be associated with a worsening of the disorder.",

Our understanding of the neurobiological basis of TTM is limited. However, the condition in all likelihood involves multiple pathways and a complex interaction between various genetic, psychological, and social factors. Vitamin D deficiency is thought to be linked to rickets in children and to a range of different diseases in adults, including osteoporosis, osteomalacia, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, dermatological diseases, and psychiatric disorders. We report a case of a 4-year-old girl with TTM triggered by vitamin D deficiency resolving dramatically with vitamin D therapy.",

It can be caused by a number of factors, such as genetics, hormonal fluctuations, illness or external stressors. The five typical types of hair loss are male pattern baldness, which is typically hereditary and hormonal, characterized by receding hairline and thinning of the crown, then female pattern baldness, which usually causes general thinning without noticeable receding of the hairline, especially the crown. Genetic and hormonal factors are involved. Next comes Alopecia Areata, which results in round bald spots caused by sudden patchy hair loss that the immune system has targeted in the hair follicle. Then there is Telogen Effluvium, which denotes temporary hair loss is caused by illness, stress or hormonal fluctuations, resulting in hair loss especially in the seam and hairline area. Finally, there is Traction Alopecia, which causes the hair to gradually fall out and results in tight combs or constant pulling. This study aims to utilize the AI-related methods to predict these above mentioned hair loss patterns.",

D'une facon generale, ces consequences seront Influencees par les strategies d'adaptation developpees et par les traits de personnalite preexistants. Toutes pathologies confondues, la souffrance engendree par la chute de cheveux est similaire a celle du psoriasis severe. Elle atteint essentiellement l'estime de soi. L'importance de cet impact semble soustendu par un manque de securite dans l'attachement lors de la prime enfance. Les strategies d'adaptation en seront modifiees et rigidifiees. Deux syndromes psychiatriques sont d'abord mentionnes: le syndrome dysmorphique (defaut imaginaire de l'apparence) et la trichotillomanie. L'alopecie androgenetique entraine une souffrance Importante chez la femme principalement. La chute de cheveux induite par la chimiotherapie altere la confiance en soi qui ne se recupere pas totalement avec la repousse. C'est l'effet secondaire vecu comme le plus traumatisant. Une strategie de prise en charge cosmeto-oncologique a ete elaboree dans notre service pour repondre a cette souffrance. La pelade etendue est associee a une comorbidite psychiatrique importante: anxiete, depression principalement. Elle semble liee a des evenements traumatisants anciens et revele donc plutot un stress chronique. Ces patients sont caracterises par une difficulte a exprimer leurs emotions (alexithymie) ce qui, en lecture systemique, est interprete comme un devoir inconscient de proteger la famille de tout conflit. Celui-ci stimule en effet une angoisse fantasmatique de rupture liee a des pertes et deces precoces dans les generations precedentes. Un travail psychotherapeutique familial permet de faire evoluer ces croyances inconscientes.",

We also discuss main treatment approaches (drug treatments and behavior therapy) and review research on their efficacy. Results show that behavior therapy (habit reversal) has consistently been shown to be effective, SSRIs seem not to work, but preliminary data suggest that other drugs (e.g. N-acetylcysteine) may benefit some patients.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Trichotillomania is a mental disorder in which the patient persistently and recurrently pulls out his own hair, which results in varying degrees of hair loss. This causes considerable suffering and impairs quality of life, but patients rarely seek specialist help. It affects 0.5–3% of the general population, but data may be underestimated due to low reporting. Aim of the study: The aim of our study is to summarize the current state of knowledge on the treatment of trichotillomania. Materials and methods: The literature available in the PubMed and Google Scholar database was reviewed using the following keywords: \"trichotillomania\", \"trichophagia\", \"trichobeozar\", \"trichotillomania treatment\". Results: Treatment of TTM is difficult and involves many methods. The division of therapeutic methods focuses mainly on psychotherapy and pharmacological treatment. The greatest effectiveness is attributed to cognitive-behavioral therapy, especially habit reversal training. Medications can help reduce symptoms, especially in the presence of other disorders, e.g. depression, anxiety disorders. Conclusions: Trichotillomania contributes to significant suffering and negatively affects functioning in social and professional life. The basis of its treatment is psychotherapy, but there are many reports on the effectiveness of selected drugs (SSRIs, clomipramine, antipsychotics, N-acetylcysteine, naltrexone, lamotrigine, bupropion, dronabinol, inositol), but they require further research on a larger group of patients.",

Likewise, Temporo-Mandibular Jaw and Joint disorder(s) – or simply TMD – is a multifactorial etiological condition, regularly encountered in the dental office. Whether due to malocclusion, bruxism, stress and/or trauma, TMD destabilizes the whole cranio-mandibular system structurally and functionally, via affecting mastication, teeth, supporting structures, comfort and aesthetics, and thus, QoL, again. While several treatment regimens do exist for such conditions, some of which have been standardized for use over the years, most continue to lack proper evidence-based literature support. Hence, (1) caution is to be exercised; and (2) the need for alternative therapeutic strategies is amplified, subsequently, the door for innovation is wide open. Indeed, neuromuscular electrical stimulation or “NMES”, is perhaps a fine example. Herein, we present the interested oro-dental health care provider with an up-dated revision of this therapeutic modality, its potential benefits, risks and concerns, to best handle the dysphagic patient: an intra-disciplinary approach or strategy bridging contemporary dentistry with speech and language therapy; a rather obscure and un-discovered yet critical allied health profession . A pre-clinical and clinical prospectus on employing inventive NMES-based regimens and devices to manage TMD is also highlighted.",

      "abstract": "The author is looking to the psychological consequences of chronic hair diseases through a review of the recent literature. In general those consequences are depending on the coping skills and on the personality traits. The effect of hair loss on the quality of life is similar to that of a severe psoriasis. The most important effect is a loss of self-confidence. This is enhanced by an insecure or ambivalent attachment pattern. The coping skills will therefore be different and less flexibles. Two psychiatric syndromes are first mentioned: the body dysmorphic syndrome (very slight or imaginary defect in appearance) and trichotillomania. Androgenetic alopecia leads to an important suffering in women mostly. Alopecia induced by cancer chemotherapy has been reported to cause changes in self-concept and body image. This does not return to the previous state after regrowth of hair for a majority of patients. A cosmeto-oncologic care strategy is developed in our department to improve the quality of life of the patients during this difficult coping period. Alopecia areata has an important psychiatric comorbidity: mostly anxiety and depression. Old stressful life events are frequently reported at the onset of the disease revealing a chronic stress. Those patients have difficulties to express their feelings (what is called alexithymia). With a systemic vision this is interpreted as an unconscious task of avoiding family conflicts. This conflicts are raising the anxiety of family splitting coming from early loss or death in the previous generations. A cautious family therapy helps to change those unconscious myths.",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), previously known as battle fatigue syndrome or shell shock, is a severe mental disturbance condition that is normally triggered by the experience of some frightening/scary events or trauma where a person undergoes some serious physical or mental harm or threatened. PTSD is a long-life effect of the continuous occurrence of traumatic conditions, leading to the production of feelings of helplessness, intense fear, and horror in the person. There are various examples of events that can cause PTSD, such as physical, mental, or sexual assault at home or working place by others, unexpected death of a loved one, an accidental event, war, or some kind of natural disaster. Treatment of PTSD includes the removal or reduction of these emotional feelings or symptoms with the aim to improve the daily life functioning of a person. Problems which are needed to be considered in case of PTSD like ongoing trauma, abusive or bad relationships. Various drugs which are used for the treatment of PTSD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, etc.); tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and isocarboxazid); mood stabilizers (Divalproex and lamotrigine); atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole and quetiapine), etc. In this review, we have covered the different risk factors, case studies related to various treatment options with different age group of peoples with PTSD and their effects on them. We have also covered the symptoms and associated disorders which can play a key role in the development of PTSD.",

      "abstract": "The author is looking to the psychological consequences of chronic hair diseases through a review of the recent literature. In general those consequences are depending on the coping skills and on the personality traits. The effect of hair loss on the quality of life is similar to that of a severe psoriasis. The most important effect is a loss of self-confidence. This is enhanced by an insecure or ambivalent attachment pattern. The coping skills will therefore be different and less flexibles. Two psychiatric syndromes are first mentioned : the body dysmorphic syndrome (very slight or imaginary defect in appearance) and trichotillomania. Androgenetic alopecia leads to an important suffering in women mostly. Alopecia induced by cancer chemotherapy has been reported to cause changes in self-concept and body image. This does not return to the previous state after regrowth of hair for a majority of patients. A cosmeto-oncologic care strategy is developed in our department to improve the quality of life of the patients during this difficult coping period. Alopecia areata has an important psychiatric comorbidity : mostly anxiety and depression. Old stressful life events are frequently reported at the onset of the disease revealing a chronic stress. Those patients have difficulties to express their feelings (what is called alexithymia). With a systemic vision this is interpreted as an unconscious task of avoiding family conflicts. This conflicts are raising the anxiety of family splitting coming from early loss or death in the previous generations. A cautious family therapy helps to change those unconscious myths.",

The present case study investigates about the causes that may lead to the occurrence of impulse control disorders in adolescence and also discusses about the applications of Habit Reversal Training (HRT) through the case of an adolescent boy presenting with complaints of hair pulling, taking out weird sounds from the throat and jerking the neck repeatedly. He was being managed using pharmacotherapy but with little improvement and hence was referred for psychotherapy. As the therapy progressed, a drop in symptom severity was observed. Academic and emotional diiculties may contribute signiicantly towards anxiety and agitation in adolescence leading to various forms of psychopathology.

This is due to negative emotions associated with inability to satisfy certain needs or achieve a particular purpose, which leads to frustration or deprivation in animals. This condition can lead to the emergence of compulsive behaviors, which are often a form of coping with stress. Compulsive behaviors in fur animals are usually stereotypical: animals walk along the cage, catch their own tail, gnaw fur (trichotilomanie), or bite the trellis or the claws. The environmental factors resulting from the maintenance conditions and social relations of the animals in the group play an important role in the emergence of this type of behavior. Another factor that is equally important in causing compulsive behavior is mental strain resulting from disease..",

      "abstract": "Trichotillomania (TTM) also known as a hair-pulling disorder is a debilitating psychiatric condition characterized by the recurrent pulling out of one's own hair, leading to hair loss and functional impairment. If untreated, TTM may lead to life-threatening medical problems. In DSM-5-TR, TTM is kept under the category of “Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders.” As there is no established treatment in contemporary medicine for TTM, many patients seek other interventions such as Ayurveda (traditional Indian system of medicine). There is no clarity regarding ayurvedic diagnosis and management of TTM. This has created a major diagnostic and management dilemma in clinical ayurvedic psychiatry practice while approaching a patient of TTM. The aim of the present study is to understand TTM according to Ayurveda and to propose an ayurvedic diagnosis and treatment protocol for it. The present study has explored the similarity between Bhutonmada/Grahonmada (psychiatric condition having idiopathic manifestation) and TTM. Although some references related to hair-pulling behavior are available in ayurvedic texts, they may not represent TTM exactly as an independent disease entity. There is some similarity between Bhutonmada and TTM in terms of etiology, pathology, course and prognosis, and clinical features. Hair-pulling behavior and other self-injurious behaviors can be understood as Bhutonmada with the intention of Himsa . Spiritual or divine therapies, ayurvedic psychotherapy, and virtuous code of conduct, along with ayurvedic medicines, may provide relief to TTM patients. The present study provides new insights for diagnosing and managing the patients of TTM according to Ayurveda.",

TE is defined as a non-scarring, diffuse, hair loss that occurs around 3 months after a triggering event and lasting for about 6 months. The diagnosis of TE indicates an increased loss of hair, acute or chronic, which can be the consequence of five different pathogenetic mechanisms, according to Headington's classification. The diagnosis of TE includes two separate entities, distinguished in acute and chronic, with different causes, onset, symptoms, and outcome. Chronic TE is characterized by increased hair shedding lasting for more than six months.

It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

We present a rare case of 28-year-old male having TTM with antisocial personality disorder and discuss difficult management issues with this comorbidity. Our patient improved with a combination of fluoxetine and sodium valproate.",

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "As a contribution to the differential diagnosis of ambiguoug \"loss of hair\" we forward a report on 24 children and 2 adolescents with trichotillomania. Patients with this pathological habit tear out hair from their own head -- sometimes eyelashes or eyebrows as well -- mostly in unobserved moments. Therefore the diagnosis is frequently delayed for months or even years. Most of these patients have normal intelligence are motorically overactive, and sensitive. They suffer from a lack of selfne assurance, and an inhibition to establish initial social contacts or to give expression to their aggressive tendencies. The manipulation of their own body serves as an outlet for the inner and outer strain resulting form the pressures of a permanent conflict-situation. The calming effect, combined with the apparently highly satisfying physical experience, induced repetition and the development of a fixed habit. In early childhood the factors contributing to the emotional strain are almost always found in a conflicting mother-child relationship, very often against the background of a general deficiency in family interaction. Moreover at school level the symptom occurs most frequently as a result of pressure on the child to achieve more. Trichotillomania has to be considered in children with focal or diffuse alopecia in areas of normal scalp, where almost no hair is lost by combing or gentle pulling. The trichogram gives specific results. Diagnosis must be based on a behaviour analysis and psychodiagnosis of the child. In addition, personal interactions within the family must be investigated. The first goal of therapy is the elimination of the emediate causes through counselling the parents. The improvement of the child's ability to communicate is essential. Depending on the age of the child the approach to the treatment of the social disturbances through psychotherapy or medical pedagogy should be combined with a symptom--centered treatment through behaviour therapeutical techniques with the aim of eliminating this fixed habit.",

Trichotillomania is the compulsive urge to pull out one’s own hair persistently and leading to noticeable hair loss. Contrary to what is expected, it is a more frequently detected disorder characterized by compulsive hair pull-outs and of great importance not only due to physical appearance but also due to its associated psychosocial problems. Metabolic functions of N-acetylcysteine are effective either as antioxidant (forming up glutathione which is an endogenous antioxidant) or as glutamatergic agent. Due to these effects, N-acetylcysteine was administrated in as oxidative stress related schizophrenia and bipolar disorders as well as trichotillomania characterized by compulsive symptoms and in eating nail. Administration of N-acetylcysteine in cases with psychiatric disorders was reported in clinical researches such as case report and open label studies. In the literature, the efficiency of N-acetylcysteine in the treatment of trichotillomania was demonstrated in 3 studies as case report, double blind and placebo controlled researches. N-acetylcysteine may be a promising and ideal treatment option in the mono or combined treatment of diseases such as trichotillomania due to its efficiency, and cost affectivity, but it also does not lead to adverse effects.

Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs.

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: - Fatigue can be defined as an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained exhaustion that makes it harder to carry out activities and function Fatigue describes a state of tiredness or exhaustion. Fatigue is an important symptom in academics due to its association with physical, psychological and social problems and the employee health, performance, safety and general workability continues to grow. Research has shown that fatigue may result from some health and work-related factors, particularly a poor health status, long work hours and extended-duration work shifts. INTRODUCTION: - Fatigue is a state of physical or mental weariness, often accompanied by a reduced capacity to perform tasks effectively. It is characterized by a sensation of tiredness, exhaustion, and a lack of energy, which can result from various factors, including prolonged physical or mental exertion, insufficient rest or sleep, illness, stress, and other physical or psychological conditions. The need for a study aimed to investigate the prevalence of fatigue in female academicians by using a reliable self-completion tool that can measure subjective condition, either in extreme clinical cases or in routine day-to-day functioning, has never been greater. METHODOLOGY: - An observational study was conducted in Ahmadabad city. This study was approved by the Ethical Committee. The Chalder Fatigue Scale was used to assess symptoms of fatigue. Questioner method was used to collect data. Each question was scored by female academicians. Sample size of hundred participants including the female academicians. RESULT: - The result was carried out by using Microsoft excel 2016. Out of hundred sample size 38% middle aged female academicians had fatigue. The mean age was 34.43 years. CONCLUSION: - This study concludes that there is need to reduce fatigue among the female academicians. Clinical implementation: - There is a need to plan a proper treatment protocol and advice for female academicians to reduce the fatigue.

The disease affects mainly female patients, who often deny the habit, and it usually presents with a bizarre pattern nonscarring patchy alopecia with short hair and a negative pull test. Trichoscopy can reveal the abnormalities resulting from the stretching and fracture of hair shafts, and biopsy can be necessary if the patient or parents have difficulties in accepting the self-inflicted nature of a trichotillomania diagnosis. Trichotillomania requires a comprehensive treatment plan and interdisciplinary approach. Physicians should always have a nonjudgmental, empathic, and inviting attitude toward the patient. Behavioral therapy has been used with success in the treatment of trichotillomania, but not all patients are willing or able to comply with this treatment strategy. Pharmacotherapy can be necessary, especially in adolescents and adult patients. Options include tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glutamate-modulating agents. Glutamate-modulating agents such as N-acetylcysteine are a good first-line option due to significant benefits and low risk of side effects. Physicians must emphasize that the role of psychiatry-dermatology liaison is extremely necessary with concurrent support services for the patient and parents, in case of pediatric patients. In pediatric cases, parents should be advised and thoroughly educated that negative feedback and punishment for hair pulling are not going to produce positive results. Social support is a significant pillar to successful habit reversal training; therefore, physicians must convey the importance of familial support to achieving remission. This is a review article that aims to discuss the literature on trichotillomania, addressing etiology, historical aspects, clinical and trichoscopic features, main variants, differential diagnosis, diagnostic clues, and psychological and pharmacological management.",

A tree may decline because of damage by secondary agents after an injurious event such as defoliation or major wounding. The same agents would not cause decline in an uninjured tree, and the injury alone would not cause decline. 3. Chronic irritation by one or more agents may diminish the tolerance or resistance of a tree to another agent that then incites decline. Various factors including those that predisposed the tree and incited decline may then contribute to further decline. 4. Trees of similar age growing in groups tend to display group behaviour including premature senescence (synchronous cohort senescence) in response to stress.",

      "abstract": "Spasticity is defined clinically as ‘a motor disorder characterised by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) with exaggerated tendon acts resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome’.1 Spasticity is a common feature of cerebral palsy (CP) as well as spinal cord and traumatic brain injury.\n\nThe most common cause of spasticity in childhood is CP which affects between 2 and 3 of every 1000 live births in industrialised countries.2 Other causes of spasticity include traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, central nervous system tumour or infarct, metabolic disorders and hydrocephalus.\n\nDystonia is defined as ‘a movement disorder in which involuntary sustained or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures or both’.3 Dystonia may be either acute (eg, an oculogyric crisis secondary to drug administration) or chronic. Chronic dystonia can occur either locally (eg, writer's cramp, blepharospasm) or systemically as part of CP or other neurological syndromes.\n\nThe management of spasticity and chronic dystonia in children requires multidisciplinary management including neurologists, paediatricians, surgeons, GPs, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and pharmacists. Pharmacotherapy forms one aspect of this management and will be the focus of this review article, but other interventions, such as physical therapy, orthopaedic surgery and procedures, such as selective dorsal rhizotomy, play a major role too. Fundamental knowledge of pharmacologic properties and toxicities of these medications is required for safe and appropriate use, and should be part of an integrated therapeutic approach in which patients, carers, therapists, physicians and surgeons have open and clear communication about the overall rehabilitation process of the patient.\n\n### Oral/enteral drugs\n\nOral, or enteral medication, can provide systemic treatment for the relief of generalised spasticity via different pharmacological mechanisms.

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "title": "Mental and Psychological Problems and Therapeutic Measure of Patients with Alopecia",
      "abstract": "Many alopecia /hair loss diseases were chronic and refractory,resulting in cosmetic problems leading to psychologic issues. There are primary and secondary disorders in this field. Primary psychosomatic / psychological disorders refer to psychiatric disorders involving hair loss,such as trichotillomania,secondary disorders are caused by psycho-emotional stress result from hair loss diseases. Psycho-emotional stress can be a primary inducer and an aggravating factor of hair loss,and as a secondary problem in response to hair loss. Therefore,apart from medication,psychological approach is also a useful tool in management of hair loss disorders. This paper focuses on clinical features and options in management of psychiatric disorders involving hair loss and psycho-emotional stress,including consultation,patient group activity,follow ups,and to develop good coping strategies in patients with hair loss disorders.",

Policisti v Evropi in njihove policijske organizacije so se vedno podvrženi razlicnim predsodkom, izvirajocim iz policijske subkulture, ki je vecinoma povsod po svetu zelo podobna. Policisti in njihovi vodje imajo policista za posameznika, ki je nadpovprecno hraber in posten, ki sam resuje svoje težave in ne potrebuje drugih oseb, da bi jim morebiti zaupal svoje težave. Izražanje stiske, prevec emocionalno odzivanje in izkazovanje custev niso zaželeni, psihicne motnje ali celo bolezen pa so sramota. Prav tako je sramotno iskanje strokovne pomoci v primeru stiske in psihicnih težav, ki je velikokrat celo na nek nacin sankcionirano z omalovaževanjem takega posameznika kot slabica ali »motene« osebe, nesposobne opravljati odgovorne policijske naloge ter nosenja in rokovanja s službenim orožjem. \r\nNamen raziskave samomorov v slovenski policiji je bil prouciti skupne komponente in ugotovitve vec locenih raziskav in izvesti skupen sklep, na podlagi katerega bi laže in potrjeno dognali vzroke in skupne znacilnosti samomorov v slovenski policiji in policiji kot stanovski organizaciji nasploh.\r\nRaziskovalno nalogo smo razdelili na teoreticni in empiricni del ter povzeli skupne ugotovitve posameznih analiz, ki smo jih primerjali med seboj. Na koncu smo pripravili sklepne misli s priporocili za izboljsanje stanja na podrocju boja proti samomorilnosti v policiji. \r\nTeoreticni del obsega splosne doslej znane znacilnosti in vrste samomora skozi zgodovino ter gibanje na podrocju samomorilnosti v državah Evropske unije in sirse. Predstavimo tudi dosedanje že izvedene analize na temo samomorov v policiji primerljivih držav in slovenski policiji, saj so bili podatki doslej že proucevani v diplomskih nalogah diplomantov Fakultete za varnostne vede Univerze v Mariboru in Medicinske fakultete Univerze v Ljubljani. Se posebej podrobno predstavimo podrocje pojava samomorilnosti v avstrijski policiji ter izvedemo primerjavo s podatki o samomorilnosti v slovenski policiji. Obenem primerjamo nacin izvedbe psiholoskega presejevanja kandidatov za policiste obeh policij in izpeljemo zakljucke, ki kažejo, da je ogroženost zaradi samomorilnosti v slovenski policiji manjsa od tiste v avstrijski policiji in policiji drugih primerljivih držav, da pa bi veljalo izboljsati sistem presejevanja kandidatov za policiste po vzoru avstrijskega modela. Podrobno predstavimo tudi izvedene teoreticne osnove znanstvenih analiz, opravljenih na Psihiatricni kliniki Ljubljana v casu po drugi svetovni vojni in po osamosvojitvi, in ugotovimo, da je trend samomorilnosti med slovensko splosno populacijo in med slovenskimi policisti podoben ter da se glede vzrokov, znanih indikatorjev in ugotovitve glede »kriticne« in najbolj ogrožene skupine posameznikov podatki iz ugotovitve izvedenih studij deloma prekrivajo. \r\nV empiricnem delu izvedemo primerjavo podatkov, pridobljenih v že izvedenih podobnih analizah samomorilnosti med splosno populacijo v Republiki Sloveniji, in rezultatov analiz raziskav, ki smo jih izvedli med policijsko populacijo v Republiki Sloveniji. Nekaj analiz je bilo opravljenih tudi s pomocjo zgodovinskega gradiva, ki smo ga na podlagi dovoljenja Arhivske komisije RS zbrali v Arhivu RS v Ljubljani. Pri zbiranju podatkov smo uporabili statisticne podatke Svetovne zdravstvene organizacije, podatke Evropskega statisticnega urada EUROSTAT, podatke, pridobljene v Statisticni upravi RS (SURS), na Institutu za varovanje zdravja (IVZ) oziroma Nacionalnem institutu za javno zdravje (NIJZ), Ministrstvu za notranje zadeve (MNZ) in Policiji ter v Arhivu Republike Slovenije.",

Revisão bibliográfica: O TEPT é uma doença psicológica que pode surgir depois que uma pessoa experimenta um ou mais eventos traumáticos, como combate militar, trauma físico devido a lesão ou outros acidentes, como violência doméstica, estupro, trauma de infância, negligência ou abuso. Este se manifesta com sintomas dramáticos de hiperexcitação, lembranças memoriais intrusivas, pesadelos e flashbacks somatossensoriais. É frequentemente acompanhado por comorbidades psiquiátricas, como depressão, abuso de substâncias ou transtornos de ansiedade, o que leva a um alto nível de incapacidade funcional. Considerações finais: O TEPT consiste no desenvolvimento de sintomas relacionados ao estressor após um ou mais eventos traumáticos. Seus sintomas geralmente são classificados em três grupos: intrusão, evitação, e excitação com efeitos preponderantes no sono com insônia e pesadelo. O tratamento farmacológico é feito com Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Serotonina ou Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Norepinefrina, cujos efeitos colaterais são bem tolerados. Nesse sentido, é essencial um diagnóstico precoce e um tratamento multidisciplinar com um médico psiquiatra e um psicólogo a fim de minimizar os impactos do transtorno.",

      "title": "[Hypothyroidism--clinical findings, diagnosis, therapy. Thyroid tests should be performed on broad indications].",
      "abstract": "Hypothyroidism is a clinical entity resulting from deficiency of thyroid hormones or, more rarely, from their impaired activity at tissue level. It is a common condition, with a prevalence of 1.9 per cent in women, and the prevalence increases with age. Hypothyroidism may be congenital or acquired, primary or secondary, chronic or transient. Primary hypothyroidism is caused by disease or treatment which destroys the thyroid gland or interferes with thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Autoimmune thyroiditis is the predominant cause of primary hypothyroidism in countries such as Sweden where severe iodine deficiency is non-existent. Another cause of primary hypothyroidism, chronic or transient, is previous radio-iodine or surgical treatment of hypothyroidism. In secondary or central hypothyroidism, which is very rare, there is a lack of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) or TSH activity, due to a pituitary or hypothalamic cause. The clinical features of hypothyroidism are dependent on the patient's age, the presence of other disease, and the rate at which hypothyroidism develops. As thyroid hormones are universal determinants of organ function, there may be a multiplicity of symptoms. Particularly in the elderly, the clinical features may be atypical, and the diagnosis easily missed. First line tests for hypothyroidism are analyses of the concentrations of free thyroxine (T4) and TSH in serum. In primary hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH high. In central hypothyroidism, the serum content of T4 is low and that of TSH generally low or normal, though slightly increased levels of biologically inactive TSH may also occur. Subclinical hypothyroidism is characterised by a normal serum level of T4, an increased level of TSH, and the absence of clinical symptoms. When a diagnosis of chronic hypothyroidism is confirmed, treatment with laevothyroxine is started, the initial dose being adjusted to the age and general condition of the patient, and the duration and severity of hypothyroidism. As a rule, full thyroxine replacement therapy should bring the serum TSH level into the normal range. In central hypothyroidism, laevothyroxine treatment is similar, but pituitary function must be evaluated and, if necessary, corticosteroid replacement be instituted before laevothyroxine treatment is started.",

      "title": "Femoral Neck Stress Fracture Complicated by Deep Venous Thrombosis and Complex Regional Pain Syndrome: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Stress fractures occur when repeated forces on a bone exceed its repair abilities. There are 3 situations in which stress fractures can arise: when an abnormal load is placed on normal bone, when a normal load is placed on abnormal bone, or when an abnormal load is placed on abnormal bone. When a stress fracture occurs in a female athlete, one needs to be suspicious of the female athlete triad: low bone density (osteopenia and osteoporosis), disordered eating, and menstrual dysfunction. The female athlete triad occurs when pressure to perform and maintain a low body mass leads to increased training and decreased caloric intake. Stress hormones produce hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction and menstrual irregularities. Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea leads to decreased estrogen production, which causes decreased bone mineral density, osteopenia, and increased risk of stress fractures [1]. When stress fractures occur, they can normally be treated nonoperatively with relative rest and slow, pain-free return to activity. This process typically takes 3-18 weeks. Bone growth stimulators, which use either an electrical current or ultrasound, can facilitate bone healing. Possible complications secondary to stress fractures include delayed union, nonunion, avascular necrosis, and progression to complete fracture. To heal a stress fracture, patients must limit their activity. Because most patients with a stress fracture are not placed on strict bed rest or hospitalized, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis is generally not indicated. Patients with Virchow triad of venous stasis, vessel wall injury, and hypercoagulable state are at greater risk for DVT formation. Other risk factors for DVT include advanced age, cancer, history of previous clots, and use of oral contraceptives or estrogens. Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) can arise secondary to immobilization, a noxious event, neurological disease, or even after very minor injuries or microtrauma. CRPS is characterized by pain that is out of proportion to the injury, as well as allodynia and hyperalgesia. CRPS type 2 occurs after a nerve injury, whereas CRPS types 1 does not have an associated nerve injury. Physical examination findings of CRPS include edema, changes in skin blood flow, and abnormal sudomotor activity in the region of pain. Additional changes from CRPS include atrophy of skin and nails, changes in hair growth, and loss of function. The International Association for the Study of Pain has developed a set of 4 criteria for the diagnosis of CRPS type 1: the presence of a noxious event or immobilization; continued pain, allodynia, or hyperalgesia disproportionate to the event; evidence at sometime of edema, changes in skin blood flow, or abnormal sudomotor activity in the area of pain; and the diagnosis is excluded by the presence of another condition that would account for the symptoms. The pathogenesis of CRPS remains unclear. It is hypothesized that CRPS is sympathetically mediated pain. This is supported by trend that patients often improve with sympatholytic procedures. A stress fracture complicated by DVT and CRPS is an unusual clinical presentation. To the authors' knowledge, this constellation of conditions has not been reported in the literature. This report details a female athlete with a femoral stress fracture complicated by DVT and CRPS. The patient is a 37-year-old female triathlete with osteopenia and a T score of −2.2 standard deviations in the left femoral neck who is being treated with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Secondary amenorrhea of several years duration was recently treated with oral contraceptives. Her body mass index was 20.1, and she had clinical depression. The patient is very active, running 12 miles per week, biking 30 miles per week, and swimming. While doing sprints, she felt a \"pop\" and developed acute onset of severe left hip pain. Radiographs obtained showed abnormal sclerosis of the femoral neck (Figure 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an incomplete fracture line from the medial cortex (compression side) to the femoral neck measuring 1 cm with adjacent periosteal edema (Figure 2). She was given crutches and instructed to remain non–weight bearing on the left lower extremity. Plain radiograph shows mild sclerosis throughout the femoral neck (arrows). Magnetic resonance imaging of the left hip without contrast performed at the onset of pain shows bone marrow edema in the left femoral neck extending to the medial cortex. There is also an incomplete fracture line measuring 1 cm that extends from the medial cortex to the femoral neck. Three days after initiation of the non-weight bearing status, the patient developed left lower extremity edema. A Doppler ultrasound study showed a DVT and the patient was started on anticoagulation. The patient was also treated with a bone stimulator to accelerate bone healing and electrical stimulation to the muscles in her left lower extremity to maintain muscle bulk. The patient returned to clinic for follow-up 6 weeks later. At this time, her left lower extremity from the knee to her foot felt cool and her left foot had a purplish discoloration. The patient reported being compliant with her home exercise program of isometric muscle contractions. Venous and arterial Doppler Studies were repeated and showed resolution of the DVT. MRI repeated to monitor for bone healing and exclude another condition that could be the cause of the new leg symptoms showed an incompletely healed left medial side femoral neck stress fracture. The patient was diagnosed with CRPS type I based on the criteria established by the International Association for the Study of Pain. The patient was instructed on desensitization techniques and prescribed gabapentin and nortriptyline. After transitioning off of warfarin, the patient received a series of 3 lumbar sympathetic plexus blocks. After a third injection, she reported experiencing less discomfort and the color and temperature of her foot had started to normalize. MRI performed 4 months after the diagnosis of the stress fracture showed healing with minimal fracture line and subcortical edema. The patient remained toe-touch weight bearing for 7 months secondary to pain and incomplete bone healing. This patient has the female athlete triad consisting of osteopenia, menstrual irregularities, and disordered eating. Before the stress fracture, the patient had been evaluated and treated by an endocrinologist. Her work up included a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, which was completed 4 months before the fracture and showed a T score of −2.2 standard deviations. Her vitamin D level was checked 4 months before the fracture; this was found to be within normal limits. The patient was instructed to take calcium 1500 mg per day and vitamin D supplementation as well as oral contraceptives; however, she was not given a bisphosphonate medication secondary to the desire to become pregnant in the near future. Although she was being treated for her osteopenia and amenorrhea, the patient sustained a stress fracture after intensive training for a triathlon. This case stresses the importance of treating osteopenia and the female athlete triad with a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach. The treatment of a stress fracture varies based on its location. Compression side femoral neck stress fractures, like in this patient, are generally treated nonsurgically. On the contrary, tension side stress fractures may require surgical pinning. The patient was prescribed a bone stimulator to aide bone healing as these have been suggested to be effective and safe for healing fractures and non-unions in animal and human studies [2, 3]. The patient was also prescribed electrical stimulation to her left leg muscles to help maintain muscle bulk while her activity was limited by weight bearing restrictions. This patient remained toe-touch weight bearing for 7 months while awaiting resolution of her pain and healing of the fracture. This is an unusually long time; most stress fractures will heal in 3-18 weeks. The patient received surgical evaluation for possible pinning in week 11 of her course. She was not a surgical candidate secondary to the numerous complications that had arisen and the fact that her repeat MRIs continued to show improvement. The development of a DVT in an outpatient after 3 days of non–weight bearing is unusual. There are reports in the literature of DVT formation after lower extremity fractures including hip [4] and ankle fracture [5], but, no other reported cases in the literature of DVT formation after treatment of a stress fracture in the outpatient setting could be identified. A hypercoagulable workup did not reveal any factor or genetic abnormality that could account for the formation of a DVT. Despite the occurrence of a DVT, the patient continued to take oral contraceptives. The patient developed CRPS type I after femoral neck stress fracture, non–weight bearing, and DVT formation. There are reports of CRPS after minor lower extremity musculoskeletal injuries including ankle sprains and stress fractures of the foot [6]. Although the exact mechanism of why CRPS occurs is unclear, in this patient, DVT, protected weight bearing, and femoral neck stress fracture were sufficient insults to produce temperature changes, color changes, and pain in the distal lower extremity, typical of CRPS. Normally, early, active mobilization of the affected area is recommended treatment for CRPS. However, in this situation, weight bearing and exercise of the left lower extremity was limited by a healing stress fracture. It was challenging to find a balance between treating the stress fracture, the CRPS, and DVT. Physical therapy, isometric exercises, desensitization techniques, electrical stimulation of the leg muscles, and medications were of limited efficacy in treating this patient's CRPS. As a compromise, the authors advised her in toe-touch weight bearing precautions to help treat the CRPS while still allowing the stress fracture to heal. The patient also responded positively to sympathetic blocks. The development of a DVT after stress fracture is rare. DVT prophylaxis is likely not indicated for patients with stress fractures. However, clinicians should have an index of suspicion for DVTs in a patient who is non–weight bearing while healing a stress fracture, especially when he or she has risk factors for DVT formation. In addition, recognition and subsequent treatment of the female athlete triad can help to prevent stress fractures from occurring. Finally, sympathetic blocks are an effective treatment modality for patients with CRPS secondary to femoral neck stress fracture and DVT, a situation in which weight bearing and mobilization are contraindicated.",

At 3 months of age, the normal infant holds the head steady when held upright by the physician. Failure to hold the head up usually indicates poor motor development. Head nodding may be normal, but it is usually seen in children who have emotional issues or are mentally retarded or who have spasmusnutans. Note the amount, color, and texture of the hair. The newborn infant usually has hair that is fully replaced beginning at about 3 months of age, though substantial new hair growth may not be observed until 9 – 24 months. Lack of hair (alopecia) may be a familial characteristic or a manifestation of ectodermal dysplasia, hyperthyroidism, or progeria. Localized alopecia (alopecia areata) is seen in ringworm or other infections of the scalp and in acrodynia, but in infants it is most commonly caused by rubbing of localized areas when the infant lies in one position for a long time. Rarely, alopecia areata is seen in children with syphilis or hypervitaminosis A or in children who pull out the hair or occurs after severe systemic disease (e.g., typhoid fever).",

Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen.

      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state.

      "abstract": "Hypothyroidism is the clinical picture that one sees when the thyroid is unable to produce enough thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), to keep blood levels normal and to satisfy the needs of peripheral tissues. Most patients have primary hypothyroidism, a result of disease in the thyroid that destroys its ability to produce adequate thyroid hormones. Hypothyroidism is occasionally secondary, caused by disease in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus resulting in inadequate production of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). This chapter discusses primary hypothyroidism. The clinical presentation of hypothyroidism is variable, but often includes symptoms such as cold intolerance, fatigue, constipation, hair loss, dry skin, and other symptoms of a sluggish metabolism. As previously discussed, these symptoms are nonspecific and the diagnosis is often missed for months or even years. The clinical picture varies from mild symptoms early in the disease to very severe symptoms, such as confusion, lethargy, and even coma in the later stages. Physical findings may include goiter, slow speech and thinking, very dry skin, and slow relaxation of deep tendon reflexes (“hung up” reflexes). As the patient’s mentation slo more severe disease, the patient is often unaware of how bad things are. This is partially the result of the slow and insidious onset of this disease in many people. Also, the nonspecific nature of the symptoms leads the physician to consider other diagnoses, such as depression, before a thyroid etiology is considered.KeywordsThyroid DiseaseTruck DriverPrimary HypothyroidismThyroid AntibodySerum Glutamic Oxaloacetic TransaminaseThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "abstract": "TEMA: sendo o sono necessário para termos energia, o ronco e a apneia do sono tornam-se obstáculos que acarretam problemas de saúde, como também problemas sociais, conjugais, escolares, entre outros. OBJETIVO: contribuir para um maior conhecimento do profissional fonoaudiólogo sobre as causas, consequências, diagnóstico e formas de tratamento da apneia obstrutiva do sono (AOS), a fim de favorecer a definição da conduta por este profissional, seja ela, encaminhar para um diagnóstico, tratar (por meio de fonoterapia) essa patologia ou indicar o tratamento médico, seja ele, cirúrgico ou conservador. CONCLUSÃO: as possíveis alterações fonoaudiológicas encontradas nestes pacientes são: língua alargada apresentando hipotonia, palato mole com volume aumentado, dificuldade na alimentação devido ao aporte insuficiente de ar e ao bruxismo, possivelmente causado pela tensão e ansiedade decorrentes das noites mal dormidas. Outras alterações podem ser encontradas decorrentes do tratamento cirúrgico empregado em alguns casos, como a disfagia ou até mesmo alterações na fala e na ressonância da fala decorrente de uma uvulopalatoplastia. O enfoque do tratamento fonoaudiológico é a mioterapia dos músculos envolvidos, priorizando a musculatura palatal. Percebe-se que o fonoaudiólogo pode contribuir para amenizar os sintomas encontrados nestas patologias, proporcionando uma qualidade de vida melhor aos seus portadores.",

Although tic symptoms have been reported since antiquity, systematic study of individuals with tic disorders dates from the nineteenth century. In addition to tics, individuals with tic disorders may present with a broad array of behavioral difficulties including disinhibited speech or conduct, impulsivity, distractibility, motoric hyperactivity, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Leckman and Cohen, 1998). Alternatively, a sizable portion of children and adolescents with tics will be free of coexisting developmental or emotional difficulties. Scientific opinion has been divided on how broadly to conceive the spectrum of maladaptive behaviors associated with Tourette’s syndrome (TS) (Comings, 1988; Shapiro et al., 1988).",

      "abstract": "Trichotillomania, or hair-pulling disorder, is one of a family of disorders called body-focused repetitive behaviours (BFRBs), which also include disordered skin-picking (dermotillomania) and nail-biting (onychophagia). The disorders affect 1%–2% of the population, cause high levels of distress and have high levels of comorbidity with other psychiatric diagnoses. The key facts and figures are briefly reviewed and some important points are further explored: (1) BFRBs are associated with psychological distress, but are distinct from other diagnoses, (2) The pathological behaviours mirror excessive self-grooming behaviours in other species, and may relate to immune-system mediated feedback loops, and (3) The resulting behaviours are stigmatised and cause intense shame and isolation for those who suffer, which might in itself maintain the feedback loop. These observations lead to the hypothesis that the core disorder is one of pathological grooming, which may have a basis in an immune response, with shame being both a consequence and a maintainer of the disorder. The major barrier to testing the hypotheses and potential interventions remains the stigma that keeps these disorders, and those who suffer from them, in the shadows.",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

Case reports and case series are the majority of the scientific literature on TTM in childhood and the true prevalence is not known; however it is well known that TTM frequently occurs in younger childhood. In the literature, it is reported that trichotillomania can be a manifestation of conflicting situations such as disturbed mother-child relationship, inadequate communication with family members or constant stress in school, sibling rivalry, raised inner psychic aggression against parents, overindulgence by parents, or inadequate emotional satisfaction. Studies show that symptoms of depression and anxiety may be pervasive among youth with TTM and likely impact functional impairment. The aim of this article is to present two very early onset trichotillomania cases which are thought to be associated with anxiety and family stress, especially with maternal stress and impaired affective interpersonal communication between mother and child.",

According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

Professional burnout is a state of emotional and physical exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. As the stress continues, you begin to lose the interest or motivation of job, additionally burnout reduces your productivity or energy. That's why it's important to recognize the early signs of burnout. Discriminate three phases of professional burnout: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and reduced personal accomplishment. The risk of professional burnout involve especially people who suffer from psoriasis. The aim of this study was to discuss the problem about burnout among people suffer from psoriasis.",

A simplified interpretation of this definition is presented in Figure 91.1. Alcohol abuse is defined as a pattern of pathological use for at least month that causes impairment in social and occupational functioning.Few definitions in medicine have incited as much discussion as that of alcoholism, mainly because excessive drinking may manifest as medical problem (e.g., withdrawal seizures), psychiatric problem (e.g., depression), or social problem (e.g., involvement in an automobile accident). On the other hand, person with single episode of an alcohol-related problem is not necessarily an alcoholic; in such case, the condition may be better termed alcohol abuse.",

Currently classified in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders (DSM-5) under the heading of the \"Obsessive-compulsive spectrum and related disorders.\" The estimated prevalence data suggest that 0.5-2% of the general population suffers from this disorder. Stress and anxiety are directly correlated to the production of trichotillomania symptoms. The psychosocial aspects of trichotillomania are greatly underestimated, but recent literature suggests an increased interest in this neglected area. Although no FDA approved medications are available for the treatment of trichotillomania, a variety of medications including N-acetylcysteine have shown benefit in case reports. Combined liaison clinics, with an interdisciplinary approach, are highly advisable in the treatment of these cases.",

Such forces disrupt normal cellular processes in the brain. Concussions are seen in all age, gender and ethnic groups but, because they are commonly sustained during sports and recreational activities, they have frequently been described in children. The estimated incidence of sports-related concussions in the USA ranges from 300000 to 3.8 million annually. 2 Estimating incidence is difficult because sports-related concussions frequently go undetected due to a lack of recognition of symptoms or intentional underreporting of symptoms. 34 Symptoms include physical complaints (eg, headache, fatigue, dizziness, noise intolerance), behavioural changes (eg, mood swings, depression, anxiety, irritability) and cognitive impairment (eg, inability to concentrate, decreased memory). While initial symptoms typically resolve in several days to occasionally several months after the injury, 5e8 in 10e15% these symptoms can persist much longer. Because of the heterogeneity of these injuries and their recovery, as well as the recognition that the length of time until symptoms resolve is more important clinically than the type of symptoms, grading scales and classification schemes have been abandoned. Of primary concern is determining when it is safe for the concussed patient to return to normal activities. Such activities mayincludemorephysicallystrenuousgameplayforathletes,but also simply the cognitive exercise of classwork for students or work for adults. Currently accepted guidelines indicate that return should not occur until the concussed patient can accomplish a stepwise progression of increased activity while remaining symptom free. 9 The risks of premature return to activities has",

The symptoms were most marked in infancy, but ameliorated with time, becoming milder than in the average acquired case.

Telogen effluvium can occur in both men and women, although women have a greater tendency to experience this condition due to postpartum hormonal changes and also women experience hair loss more often than men. In children, TE was reported to be responsible for only a minority of cases with hair loss (2.7%). The symptom of acute and chronic TE is increased hair loss. Usually, the hair will fall out at an increasing rate. The remaining hair will feel less dense. Acute telogen effluvium can heal itself by eliminating the triggering factor which is done by providing education to the patient while treatment for chronic TE can be done by giving Minoxidil.&#x0D; &#x0D; Keywords: Telogen effluvium acute and chronic; hair loss; minoxidil.",

Onset in childhood or adolescence appears to be the norm, yet the research literature involving pediatric samples is particularly sparse. Efficacious treatments have been developed, in particular cognitive–behavioral interventions involving procedures collectively known as habit reversal training, yet relapse in adults appears to be common. Recent developments in pharmacotherapies for TTM and in combining cognitive–behavioral therapy approaches with medication hold promise, and efforts to examine their relative and combined efficacy are needed. Dissemination of information about TTM and its treatment is a critical next step in the field, since many affected individuals and families cannot find local treatment providers with sufficient knowledge to deliver interventions known to reduce hair pulling behavior.",

Although, the importance of emotional ventilation can never be understated in order to manage mental health, according to the WHO, depression is a mental disorder that is identified by a loss of pleasure or interest in daily activities for a long period of time, the causes of which may vary from physical or emotional abuse to severe losses in life.

The need for psychotherapeutic intervention related to childbearing is discussed and some special features of psychotherapy with pregnant women are described, including common phase-related themes, unusual therapeutic structure, transference/counter-transference issues for both individual and group work. Key therapeutic situations are indicated by delineating three somewhat overlapping subgroups of women, who may be particularly at risk during pregnancy due to factors in their current or past experience which constitute stressors when interacting with resensitized areas of intrapsychic vulnerability. Risk-indicators specified are: Conflicted pregnancies - including unplanned, untimely and 'wrong' (such as those resulting from incest or rape). Emotional sensitization - expectant mothers who for a variety of predisposing reasons (own or maternal obstetric history, previous stillbirth or neonatal loss) or neurotic disorders, are prone to emotional difficulties such as over-or undervaluation of foetus/baby, pregnancy and/or birth. Complicated pregnancies - examining some of the possible concurrent physical conditions (maternal illness, substance abuse or eating disorders, AIDS-imperilled babies, threatened miscarriage or maternal disability), life-events (bereavement, eviction, negative test results), socioeconomic difficulties (unemployment, housing problems, poor social support), emotionally impoverished marital relationship and unsupported women on their own.",

      "abstract": "Psychological reactions to negative life events have been among the most interesting subjects to researchers for a long time. In recent years post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in particular, has been the focus of numerous studies. This disorder is defined as a reaction to an event that is accepted as traumatic by almost everyone, to an extraordinary life-threatening event, or to a disaster. Psychological reaction to events, which are not directly life threatening, is classified as adjustment disorder and is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice. As a result of experiencing such non-life threatening events, PTSD is claimed to be an adjustment disorder as well. Immigrants frequently report a depressive state in which physical symptoms are in the foreground accompanied by social withdrawal and diminished energy. Negative life events, which are not life threatening and are not experienced everyday, can impair mental health so that the above state may worsen and an immigrant may have a reduction in his performance at work. This state, which is accompanied by such symptoms as embitterment, feelings of injustice, repeated intrusive memories of critical events (injustice at work place, loss of a job, discrimination in a public office, etc.), phobic symptoms, and avoidance behavior towards the place or persons related to the event, might best be described by the term, posttraumatic embitterment disorder (PTED). This disorder, which was initially described in immigrants from East Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall, and which does not exactly match the diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder or PTSD, is presented in a case vignette and its differential diagnosis is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability (1, 2). Sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, are very common following traumatic brain injury and have been reported in frequencies from 40% (3) to as high as 84% (4). Sleep disruption can be related to the TBI itself but may also be secondary to neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression) or neuromuscular (e.g., pain) conditions associated with TBI or to the pharmacological management of the injury and its consequences. Post-TBI insomnia has been associated with numerous negative outcomes including daytime fatigue, tiredness, difficulty functioning: impaired performance at work, memory problems, mood problems, greater functional disability, reduced participation in activities of daily living, less social and recreational activity, less employment potential, increased caregiver burden, greater sexual dysfunction, and also lower ratings of health, poor subjective wellbeing. These negative consequences can hamper the person’s reintegration into the community, adjustment after injury, and overall QOL. (5) The connection between depression and insomnia has not been investigated within the post TBI population to a great extent. For the general population, clinically significant insomnia is often associated with the presence of an emotional disorder (6). Fichtenberg et al. (2002) (7), in his study established that the strongest relationship with the diagnosis of insomnia belonged to depression. Given the high prevalence of depression during the first 2 years following TBI (8), a link between depression and insomnia among TBI patients makes innate sense. The present study aims at assessing role of sertralline in post TBI insomnia associated with depression.",

      "title": "Changes in Muscles and Tendons Due to Neural Motor Disorders:Implications for Therapeutic Intervention",
      "abstract": "Patients with an upper motor neurone syndrome (CP) suffer from many disabling primary symptoms: spasms, weakness, and loss of dexterity. These primary 'neurogenic' symptoms often lead to secondary disabilities, muscle contractures, and tertiary effects, bone deformations. A common symptom of CP is hypertonia, with the consequence that the involved muscles remain in an excessively shortened length for most of the time. As a normal reaction of the muscle tissue, the number of sarcomeres is reduced and the muscle fibers shorten permanently: a contracture develops. A possible second type of contracture is that normal muscle lengthening along with bone growth is affected. Current treatments for the secondary effects include (1) reduction of muscle force, (2) lengthening of the muscle fibers by serial plaster casts, and (3) surgical lengthening of tendons or aponeurosis. The choice of treatment depends on the cause of the functional deficit. Bone tissue also adapts itself to abnormal forces, especially in the growth period. The hypertonias or contractures of CP so may give rise to bone malformations that interfere with function (e.g. femur endorotation) or may reduce the action of muscles by changing the lever arm (e.g. ankle varus). Although prevention should always be preferred, a timely surgical intervention cannot always be avoided. The differences in treatment for the various groups require and justify an extensive laboratory investigation, including EMG recordings in gait, measurement of passive elastic properties, and long-term observation of the hypertonia.",

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with divorce, alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-estimated because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see “Definition and deviations”).",

      "abstract": "Hair loss is a common clinical condition connected with serious psychological distress and reduced quality of life. Hormones play an essential role in the regulation of the hair growth cycle. This review focuses on the hormonal background of hair loss, including pathophysiology, underlying endocrine disorders, and possible treatment options for alopecia. In particular, the role of androgens, including dihydrotestosterone (DHT), testosterone (T), androstenedione (A4), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and its sulfate (DHEAS), has been studied in the context of androgenetic alopecia. Androgen excess may cause miniaturization of hair follicles (HFs) in the scalp. Moreover, hair loss may occur in the case of estrogen deficiency, appearing naturally during menopause. Also, thyroid hormones and thyroid dysfunctions are linked with the most common types of alopecia, including telogen effluvium (TE), alopecia areata (AA), and androgenetic alopecia. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis hormones (corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol) in stress-induced alopecia. This article also briefly discusses hormonal therapies, including 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride), spironolactone, bicalutamide, estrogens, and others.",

In addition to these pathognomonic symptoms, however, many individuals with TS also suffer from various other psychological difficulties, including obsessions, compulsions, impulsivity, attentional difficulties, depression or mood lability, various anxiety symptoms, and a range of neuropsychological deficits (King et al., 1999a). For many individuals, these comorbid difficulties may be a greater source of impairment or distress than the tics per se.",

      "abstract": "Summary Diffuse hair loss is a common complaint and cause of significant emotional distress particularly in women. The best way to alleviate the anxiety is to effectively treat the hair loss. It is paramount to address the symptom systematically. In addition to its psychological impact, hair loss may be a manifestation of a more general medical problem. The diagnosis can be established with a detailed patient history focussing on chronology of events, examination of the scalp and pattern of hair loss, a pull test with examination of bulbs of shed hairs, trichoscopy, and few pertinent screening blood tests. In selected cases a scalp biopsy may be required. The most important differential diagnoses include acute and chronic telogen effluvium, female pattern hair loss, and diffuse alopecia areata. Occasionally, patients seeking advice are not necessarily losing hair. In the absence of convincing evidence of hair loss, they are suffering of psychogenic pseudoeffluvium, and thought should be given to an underlying psychological disorder. Once the diagnosis is established, treatment appropriate for that diagnosis is likely to control the hair loss. Finally, appropriate psychological support and education about the basics of the hair cycle, and why considerable patience is required for effective cosmetic recovery, are essential to help limit patient anxiety.",

However, the diagnosis of dementia does not mean an immediate or complete cessation of sexuality in the person, or a loss of the ability to consent to sexual activity with a partner. A discussion of sexuality in dementia occurs infrequently in clinical care for several reasons. These include (a) a discomfort in discussing sexuality in older adults, (b) the fear of causing social or cultural offense, and (c) the assumption that the cessation of the reproductive period implies the end of sexual life in older adults. There is also a tendency to focus on the preservation of cognition and independence, with relative neglect of the need for physical and emotional intimacy or quality of life. Patients with dementia are more likely to be sexually active than not. The most common change is a lack or loss or sexual desire. Inappropriate sexual behaviors occur in a minority of patients (28%) and can be usually managed with behavioral measures, with the use of pharmacotherapy for symptomatic management in refractory cases. Other clinical and ethical concerns in dementia include the capacity to consent to sexual intimacy, the formation of new relationships, sexuality in long-term residential facilities, and vulnerability to sexual abuse. Dementia care guidelines recommend a low threshold of suspicion for abuse, with a focus on patient safety. These must, however, be counterweighed by respect for patient autonomy and wishes.",

      "title": "A Comparative Analysis of Psychiatric Profile, Depression andBody Dysmorphic Disorder in patients with Amputation and PostStroke.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nAmputation is defined as the removal of extremities of body part by trauma or by\r\nSurgical procedure. Amputees may feel empty, and mutilated. Amputation due to\r\nTrauma is a catastrophic injury and causes major disability in most of the cases\r\n(Wald 2004)1. Loss of limb is associated with low self-esteem, body image\r\nDisturbance, social isolation and also a sense of stigmatization (William et al.\r\n2004). In many conditions amputation is unavoidable. Irrespective of the aetiology,\r\nAmputation is considered as a mutilating surgery and it definitely affects the lives\r\nOf the patients (De Godoy et al. 2002). Limb amputation is a more commonly\r\nOccurring event in the present society.\r\nThe loss of a limb distorts the individual’s body image leading to the thought of\r\nNot being a complete human being. The loss of the functions performed with that\r\nLimb renders him helpless for sometime. The amputee not only loses physical\r\nFunctioning, he also loses hope and future aspirations, his plans and ambitions get\r\nShattered. Thus, he loses not only a limb but also a part of his world and future.\r\nMost of them remain anxious and worried about their interpersonal relationship in\r\nThe social, vocational, familial and marital milieu. Individuals having an overt\r\nMental breakdown will need active psychiatric intervention whereas careful\r\nPsychiatric interview is necessary for the ones whose mental symptoms are not so\r\nObvious.\r\nLimb loss is a major event that can severely impact the psychological health of the\r\nIndividual concerned. Studies show that 20-60% of the amputees attending follow\r\nUp clinics are assessed to be clinically depressed. Individuals with traumatic\r\nAmputation irrespective of the age are likely to suffer from body image problems,\r\nBut these findings are more common in younger individuals. The psychological\r\nReactions to amputation are clearly diverse ranging from severe disability at one\r\nExtreme; and a determination to effectively resume a full and active life at other\r\nEnd. In adults the age at which an individual receives the amputation is an\r\nImportant factor. Studies by Bradway JK et al (1984)2, Kohl SJ Et al (1984)3,\r\nLivneh H (1999)4, on the psycho-social adaptation to amputation has led to a\r\nPlethora of clinical and empirical findings. Kingdon D et al 1982 equated\r\nAmputation with loss of one’s perception of wholeness, while (Parkes CM 1976)5\r\nWith loss of spouse and (Block WE et al (1963)6 with symbolic castration & even\r\nDeath. The individual’s response to a traumatic event is influenced by personality\r\nTraits, pre-morbid psychological state, gender, peri-traumatic dissociation,\r\nProlonged disability of traumatic events, lack of social support and inadequate\r\nCoping strategies. Previous studies on amputation mainly focused on demographic\r\nProfile, coping skills and outcome; with there being a scarcity of literature on\r\nPrevalence of various specific psychiatric disorders in the post-amputation period.\r\nMost patients with a limb loss irrespective of whether due to traumatic injury or\r\nSurgical procedures go through a series of complex psychological reactions\r\nReported by Cansever et al (2003)8. Most people try to cope with it, those who\r\nDon’t succeed develop psychiatric symptoms Frank et al (1984)7. Shukla et\r\nAl9 noted that psychological intervention in some form is needed in about 50% of\r\nAll amputees, and Shukla et al9 reported depression to be the most common\r\nPsychological reaction following amputation.\r\nThe three major problems faced by many amputees are anxiety, depression and\r\nPhysical disability (Green 2007)\r\nHorgan & maclachlan (2004)10 found that anxiety is associated with depression,\r\nLow self esteem, poorer quality of life and higher level of general anxiety. Both\r\nAnxiety and depression are associated with higher disability as age increases.\r\nBody image is the combination of psychosocial adjustment and attitude of the\r\nIndividual that are related to the function and appearance of one’s own body which\r\nCan be influenced by the individual and his environmental factors (Horgan &\r\nMaclachlan 2004)10. Each person has an idealized body image, which he uses for\r\nMeasuring perceptions and concepts of his or her own body (Fishman, 1959)11.\r\nFrom another perspective, Flannery & Faria (1999) body image is viewed as a\r\nDynamic, changing phenomenon occurring in a person and it is formed by the\r\nConstantly changing perceptions about his body. According to Newell (1991)13,\r\nAttractive people after amputation will receive less reinforcement from others\r\nLeading to low self-esteem and reduced positive self-image. Jacobsen et al (1997)\r\nSupports this stating i.e. Amputation leads to disfigurement which in turn leads to a\r\nNegative body image and greater loss of social acceptance. The relationship\r\nBetween disability experience and stigma are interwoven and inter-dependent. The\r\nReason for the amputee’s subjective perception of being unfit for the society\r\nProbably is that body image provides a sense of ‘’self’ ’and also affects the\r\nPersons thinking (Wald 2004)1. According to Kolb (1975)14, changes in body\r\nImage may cause series of psychological reactions.\r\nThe psychiatric aspect of amputation has received scant interest in our country, in\r\nSpite of accidental injuries being common (Shukla et al., 1982)9. The commonest\r\nPsychiatric disorder seen in amputees is major depression. Randall et al. (1945)15\r\nHave reported an incidence of 61 % in non-battle casualties, while Shukla et al.\r\n(1982)9 found depressive neurosis (40%) and psychiatric depression (22%) to be\r\nThe leading psychiatric disorders in amputees; only 35% of the total sample in the\r\nLater study had nil psychiatric disorders. The paucity of literature in this field has\r\nPrompted us to study about amputation and its co morbid psychiatric conditions so\r\nThat proper care & management for the patients can be planned. The present study\r\nWas undertaken with the aim of studying the psychiatric problems especially\r\nAnxiety, depression and Body Dysmorphic Disorder which may be associated with\r\nDisability or changed life circumstances in the immediate post-amputation period.\r\nA comparison was made with Stroke patients, as these patients often experience\r\nPhysical and social handicaps similar to amputees.\r\nDepression is the most common mood disorder to follow stroke (Starkstein &\r\nRobinson, 1989), with major depression affecting around one quarter to one third\r\nOf patients (Hackett16)..\r\nDepression hampers functional recovery in a post stroke individual. In Diagnostic\r\nAnd statistical manual (DSM) IV Post Stroke Depression classified under “mood\r\nDisorder due to general medical condition (i.e. Stroke)” with the specific depressive\r\nFeatures, major depressive-like episodes, manic features or mixed features. Studies\r\nDescribe that cerebral ischemia is associated with two types of depressive disorder.\r\nIncidence of major and minor depression is 25% and 30% respectively. Prevalence\r\nMay vary over time with an apparent peak 3months after the stroke and\r\nSubsequently decline in prevalence at 1 year. Robinson and colleagues studies\r\nShowed a spontaneous remission in the natural course of major depression\r\nOccurring post stroke in the first to second year following stroke. However in few\r\nCases depression may become chronic and persist for a longer period.\r\nWhile some propose that post stroke depression is due to stroke affecting the\r\nNeural circuits concerned with mood regulation (thereby supporting a primary\r\nBiological mechanism), others in the scientific community claim it to be due to the\r\nEnsuing psycho-social stressors occurring as a result of stroke. Though an\r\nIntegrated bio- psycho- social model is warranted, most studies clearly suggest\r\nBiological mechanism to have an upper hand in the later post stroke period than in\r\nThe immediate phase.\r\nIn the same way Anxiety is also common in post stroke individuals with the\r\nIncidence rate being 20%, and it is most common in first three to four months after\r\nThe stroke.\r\nStudies and literatures on post stroke anxiety are very few still remain in its\r\nInfancy. Studies have concentrated on socio-demographic variables, cognitive\r\nFunctions and laterality as examined for post stroke depression. Many studies show\r\nThat there is correlation between anxiety and right hemisphere lesions and also that\r\nCo-morbid post stroke anxiety and depression are associated with left hemisphere\r\nLesions [Astrom, (1996)17]. Many studies have shown the relationship between post\r\nStroke anxiety, age and gender. Women and younger individuals are more\r\nVulnerable to develop post stroke anxiety (Morrison, walter et al 200069), while\r\nAnother study reports no such relationship (Schultz et al).19",

The bidirectional connection between alopecia areata (AA) and psychological/psychiatric factors has recently gotten a lot of attention. Stress is considered a very common cause of telogen effluvium (TE), which often develops after major life events such as mourning or divorce. The stress and emotional burden of chemotherapy-induced alopecia prompts some patients to choose less effective chemotherapeutic agents in hopes of avoiding hair loss as a side effect. Hair loss can result from various causes and take different shapes and forms. It was previously thought that one of the causes of hair loss is a preexistent psychological/psychiatric illness.",

Khalitya is primarily a Pitta dominant Tridoshjanya Vyadhi i.e., Vata, Pitta, Kapha with Rakta Dosha. Hair adds beauty and the personality of a human being. In present era, falling of hair is a commonly found cosmetic problem affecting young people. Healthy and good looking hair makes person good looking and enthusiastic. It is due to changing lifestyle, unhealthy dietary habits, sleep disturbances, systemic diseases, medications and stressful life. Khalitya has been described in Ayurveda under the heading of Kshudra Roga (minor disease) or Shiroroga (diseases of head &amp; scalp). It is progressing disorder people living in sedentary life, stress induced hectic schedules along with indiscriminate dietary habits result in many disturbances and deficiencies in the body which directly reflect in loss of hair. Most of the research studies conducted are on Nasya, Raktamokshana and Lepa. Various drugs like Bhringraja Taila, Malatyadi Tailam, Tila Taila, Asthiposhak Vati and Rasayana drugs are used for hair loss.",

      "title": "Silent Stroke -a Drag on Quality of Life",
      "abstract": "A stroke is a condition because of something blocking blood supply to part of the brain or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts disrupting the blood supply to a particular portion of the brain. In either case, parts of the brain become damaged or die, manifesting as lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. Symptoms include dizziness, numbness, weakness on one side of the body, and problems with talking, writing, or understanding language. Most of us have heard or seen of a case of a stroke, with symptoms like slurred speech, loss of balance, difficulty speaking, and so on - but not many know that one can have a stroke without even knowing it? known as a silent stroke or Mini-stroke or asymptomatic cerebral infarction. A silent stroke refers to a stroke that doesn't cause any noticeable symptoms. It is recognized by a brain (CT scan or an MRI) imaging that will show white spots or lesions where your brain cells have stopped functioning. Brain scans can detect one or multiple silent strokes. Most silent strokes are caused by a clot that blocks a blood vessel in the brain. The blockage prevents blood and oxygen from reaching that area, causing nearby brain cells to die. While in the middle-aged people with no apparent signs of stroke about 10% have brain damage from one and this rate increases to 25% among people over 80 years. The damage that happens is permanent, but therapy might help stimulate other parts of the brain so you regain abilities that may have weakened. Common Silent Stroke Symptoms include sudden lack of balance, temporary loss of basic muscle movement slight memory loss and sudden changes in mood or personality and issues with cognitive skills and ability. As different parts of our brain control different parts of our body, our symptoms will depend on the part of our brain affected and the extent of the damage but usually begin suddenly. Therefore, it is critical to seek diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. The chances of getting a stroke go up among elderly, diabetes, hypertensives, persons with heart disease, vascular disease, or atrial fibrillation. The management of silent strokes involves prescribing medications for blood thinning, to lower blood pressure, blood sugar, and serum cholesterol medications to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The significant burden of stroke on the mortality rates in India, is well-documented, but robust data regarding the aggregates of evidence on the quality of life (QOL) of stroke survivors is limited. Therefore, it is critical to seek diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. Material &amp; Methods: This manuscript is based on a real case study in last 15 months. Chidambar a male of 70 years with history of Diabetes for over 15 years and Hypertension for 10 years, both poorly controlled. He had left sided hemiparesis following a stroke in January 2022, that resulted in left sided hemiparesis, speech, and cognitive signs. Since early 2023 he is suffering frequent falls, vomiting, urinary incontinence, changing moods and worsening memory and dementia indicative recurrent silent strokes, that have worsened his quality of life. Review of literature and published articles have added value to this article.",

It is characterized by the occurrence of irregular fascicular twitching of the muscles. It is observed most frequently in neurotic persons, in those in debilitated states and in the elderly. The patients complain of a crawling sensation in the skin of the calves and thighs and occasionally of other parts of the body. This is most disturbing when the patient is fatigued and is relaxing, as on retiring. The sensation of crawling under the skin is often accompanied by an unpleasant fatigued aching of the muscle. The twitching tends to disappear during the night, to reappear shortly after waking and to increase during the day. It is intensified by exercise, nervous tension or cold.

Indeed, it could be dismissed in a few words: the object in treating hypothyroidism is to replace the deficit of thyroid hormone in the body, and this is simply, inexpensively, and effectively accomplished by the feeding of desiccated thyroid. What is left to be said, if the subject is to hold any interest, revolves around other questions, such as what causes hypothyroidism, what is the thyroid hormone, and how does it work? Inquiry into these problems in recent years has led to interesting and important discoveries. Accordingly, it appears worthwhile to point out how these advances may be helpful to the physician in the therapy of hypothyroidism. <h3>Causes of Hypothyroidism</h3> Any mechanism, physical, biological, or chemical, which brings about a diminished or absent supply of thyroid hormone will induce hypothyroidism.

      "title": "Non-thyroidal Illness Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Non-thyroidal illness is the term used to describe the changes in thyroid hormone and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with acute illness not caused by an intrinsic abnormality of thyroid function. In children, non-thyroidal illness is most commonly seen in acutely ill patients admitted to pediatric or neonatal intensive care units (ICUs). The characteristic decrease in thyroid hormone levels also can be seen with starvation, trauma, or surgical procedures. Non-thyroidal illness probably occurs with any severe illness, and the pattern of changes in thyroid hormones correlates with the severity of illness. Typically, the first changes are a decrease in serum triiodothyronine (T3) and a rise in reverse T3 (rT3) levels. This disorder has been referred to as the low-T3 syndrome or the euthyroid sick syndrome. However, as there is disagreement about whether patients truly are \"euthyroid,\" non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) is the term preferred at present. The changes in thyroid hormone and TSH concentrations with NTIS are believed to be an adaptive mechanism, in that they protect the body from high metabolic demands in the face of starvation or acute illness. However, there are certain clinical situations where this concept has been challenged, with the belief that the changes are maladaptive and clinical improvement may be seen with treatment with triiodothyronine (l-T3) or levothyroxine (l-T4). In particular, there is some evidence that preterm babies <27 weeks' gestation may show improvement in IQ scores with l-T4 treatment and that infants and children undergoing cardiac surgery may show improved post-op cardiac function with l-T3 treatment. Further research is needed to resolve these issues.",

Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

PTSD is characterized by three symptom clusters: (1) reexperiencing of the traumatic event; (2) avoidance of reminders of the traumatic event and emotional numbing; and (3) hyperarousal symptoms (1). PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

Unlike the term “disease,” the term “personality” doesn’t describe a condition that a person has. Rather, it describes what a person is. In defining personality disorder and demarcating this diagnosis from “normal” personality, one can use either a categorical approach (i.e., personality disorder is distinct from normal personality) or a dimensional approach (i.e., personality disorder differs from normal personality only in the degree to which it deviates from what is average in the population, similar to variations in height or weight). As might be expected for a group of disorders defined by variation along a dimensional continuum, the personality disorders are extremely common in the general population, with a prevalence of between 10% and 18% in various surveys. The prevalence is even higher in the clinical setting: 30%–50% of psychiatric outpatients have a personality disorder and 15% of inpatients are hospitalized primarily for problems attributable to personality disorder (with as many as half of the remaining inpatients having a comorbid personality disorder). Comorbid personality disorders are important to recognize, as they increase the likelihood that the other psychiatric illness will be more refractory to treatment.",

These processes include a wide range of space-occupying lesions such as tumor, hematoma, and abscess. (2) Destructive lesions cause coma by direct damage to the ascending arousal system or its forebrain targets. To cause coma, lesions of the diencephalon or brainstem must be bilateral, but can be quite focal if they damage the ascending activating system near the midline in the midbrain or caudal diencephalon; cortical or subcortical damage must be both bilateral and diffuse. Processes that may cause these changes include tumor, hemorrhage, infarct, trauma, or infection. Both destructive and compressive lesions may cause additional compression by producing brain edema.",

Estima-se que no Brasil existam 17 mil novos casos por ano, sendo considerado problema social e de saúde pública. A hemiparesia se caracteriza por espasticidade no hemicorpo contralateral ao hemisfério cerebral afetado. A marcha hemiparética não apresenta o toque do calcâneo no iní­cio do apoio bipodal pela incapacidade do músculo tibial anterior em produzir tensão suficiente para realizar o movimento de dorsiflexão. A fase de impulsão também fica comprometida em decorrência da fraqueza do músculo trí­ceps sural, constituindo fator limitante para a marcha. Estudos morfológicos sugerem que a fraqueza do músculo parético é mais incapacitante que a espasticidade, ela ocorre devido ao desuso, perda de unidades motoras, alteração na ordem do recrutamento, tornando-se necessário o fortalecimento desta musculatura para melhorar a capacidade de geração de força e habilidade motora.

      "abstract": "Trichotillomania (TTM) is a psychiatric disorder involving chronic, recurrent urges to pull out one’s own hair, arising frequently in childhood and early adolescence. This disorder predominantly affects women and has a high co-morbidity with many other psychiatric conditions. Currently, the etiology is unknown, which makes treating TTM extremely difficult. While the epidemiology and proposed causes will be discussed briefly, the primary purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive, updated summary of the psychological and pharmacological management options for patients diagnosed with TTM, as new clinical trial data for previously studied and novel treatments have become available within the last decade. Of the behavioral interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and habit reversal training (HRT) have demonstrated the greatest improvements in hair-pulling severity, with HRT showing the most efficacy for long-term maintenance of progress. Pharmacological therapies with the most success include Olanzapine, Clomipramine, and N-Acetylcysteine, though larger replication studies are needed. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have yielded inconsistent results in clinical trials, yet they are frequently prescribed for TTM. Naltrexone, Dronabinol, and Inositol are emerging as potential treatments, but the results suggest that additional studies are needed. Future research directions include larger placebo-controlled pharmacological trials, exploring the efficacy of combined behavioral and pharmacological approaches compared to monotherapy, and delving into the potential genetic and neurochemical contributions that may underlie TTM.",

      "title": "Shoulder pain: to image or not to image?",
      "abstract": "1. INTRODUCTION Imaging findings should be interpreted within the broader context of an individual's shoulder symptoms (1). While imaging is valuable in identifying specific structural pathologies, findings are often equivocal. Defining what imaging changes constitute \"normal\", \"abnormal\", \"unrelated\", \"solely causative\" findings, and which are, \"contributory\", or \"associated\" with symptoms is a clinical minefield. Although a naive interpretation might equate \"normal\" with the absence of pathological features (e.g., no rotator cuff tears, calcification, or labral lesions), this is an oversimplification. For example, rotator cuff tendon tears are frequently observed in individuals without symptoms, who function for years at a very high level of performance. Rotator cuff tendon tears increase asymptomatically with increasing age, suggesting, like wrinkles and grey hair, the tears are likely to be a normal non-noxious senescent change (2). Furthermore, individuals may exhibit full mobility, exceptional muscle performance, no symptoms, and above average function despite observable labral tears, tendon irregularities commonly termed tendinosis, or partial/full-thickness rotator cuff tears (3-7). Moreover, non-sinister and non-traumatic soft tissue imaging considered to be abnormal cannot reliably distinguish currently symptomatic shoulders, previously symptomatic, or those that have never been symptomatic, as the prevalence of \"abnormal\" findings is often similar across these groups (3, 8, 9). It is arguable that many so called \"abnormalities\" have been labeled as such because they represent deviations in structure from idealized and flawless anatomical drawings. The equivocal association between imaging changes and symptoms has lead researchers and clinicians, to question a biomechanical role in symptom causation and/or perpetuation. This is evident in the arguments such as nociception is not needed to experience pain (10), and that pain should be considered a perception and not a sensation (11). These arguments, commonplace in pain science, are not supported by definitive research and should still be regarding as hypotheses and not \"fait accompli\". Without doubt, psychosocial factors and the social determinants of health play a seismic role in the experience, perpetuation, and prognosis of symptoms for those living with shoulder pain (12, 13). However, arguments have been made to reframe the relevance of 'bio' in shoulder symptoms, and recently a strong case has been made to consider bio-chemical factors in the development and perpetuation of rotator cuff related shoulder pain (14). The appropriate utilization and necessity of shoulder imaging is also equivocal. Guidelines offer inconsistent recommendations and conflicting advice concerning the prescription of radiographs for diagnosing rotator cuff tendinopathy, as some guidelines recommend radiographs during the initial evaluation (e.g., routinely), although others suggest that radiographs might be considered, especially when conservative treatment fails (15). Notably, one high-quality guideline did not recommend radiographs for the initial management (15). Lastly, International Consensus suggests using certain dynamic imaging techniques as complementary to medical history and physical examination for the clinical assessment of dysfunctional disorders (e.g., subluxation, instability). This approach could aid clinicians in perceiving \"functional\" disorders rather than solely anatomical or structural injuries (16). As a consequence of this ambiguity, a significant number of clinicians were responsible for referrals for \"low-value\" imaging, especially for those without a traumatic onset (17). To promote consideration for the role of \"bio\" in shoulder symptoms and encourage debate among clinicians and researchers, this opinion paper aims to stimulate discussion on the value of imaging in management of musculoskeletal shoulder pain. We sought to capture diverse perspectives from various health disciplines by incorporating input from clinicians, researchers, educators, physiotherapists, physicians, and nurses working within the musculoskeletal field, aimed at providing a comprehensive perspective to our manuscript. 2. PROS AND CONS OF IMAGING USE IN SHOULDER PAIN MANAGEMENT Although the judicious requests of imaging may improve clinician understanding of a specific clinical scenario, between 20–50% of imaging requests are inappropriate or of \"low-value\" (e.g., a service offering no or minimal benefit to patients). Primum non nocere (first, do no harm) is a core principal in healthcare practice. Unnecessary imaging has the potential to cause harm (e.g. unnecessary risk due to exposure to ionizing radiation) (18), prolong waiting times, and further negatively impact of spiraling healthcare costs (17). Conversely, strategies aimed at reducing low-value imaging have the potential to decrease costs by as much as 95% without compromising patient well-being (17). How patients interpret the imaging report findings will influence their beliefs about appropriate management, (e.g. \"I have a tear, I need surgery\") (19). When writing an imaging report, pathoanatomical labelling without reference to the incidence and prevalence of findings in people without symptoms could lead to \"medical overuse\" as unnecessary injections, surgical and nonsurgical procedures (20), as well as healthcare-seeking behavior reinforcing maladaptive beliefs about damage (21). A further concern in the interpretation of shoulder imaging is the observed fair to moderate inter-rater agreement among different examiners when reporting on identical scans (9, 22), a factor that is also influenced by the experience of the individual professional and which can potentially result in patient disorientation, unhelpful guidance, and unwarranted subsequent investigations (23). Studies investigating this issue, question the clinical utility of routine imaging for treatment planning, given the high prevalence of anatomical variations in asymptomatic shoulders (1, 8, 9, 24). Indeed, while imaging may identify tissue pathology, it often cannot reliably determine the clinical significance of these findings or their correlation with specific symptoms. For instance, routine plain radiographs in individuals with atraumatic shoulder pain altered the diagnosis based on medical history and physical examination in fewer than 15% of cases, and clinical management was modified in only 1.7% of cases (25). Furthermore, in individuals with frozen shoulder, additional pathologies were identified via magnetic resonance imaging in 22% of subjects. However, a modification in the treatment plan based on these findings was observed in only 2.7% of cases, and 37 resonance scans were required to identify one patient with frozen shoulder necessitating surgery due to the additional imaging findings (26). In conclusion, acceptance of imaging findings (i) without defining what abnormal is based upon and (ii) without stating the prevalence of such findings in people without symptoms, may lead to over medicalization and detrimentally impact on healthcare sustainability. Getting the balance right The thoughtful application of imaging strategies may confer several advantages. Firstly, imaging may identify relevant structural pathologies when serious pathology is a primary concern (27). In complex, traumatic, or suspicious cases, where differential diagnosis is challenging due to the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms, the selection of the appropriate imaging modality may help prevent delays in management (28). Moreover, imaging may corroborate structural healing following surgical intervention. For instance, in rotator cuff repair, an ultrasound scan or magnetic resonance imaging can confirm the secure placement of bone anchors, demonstrating the technical success of the surgery. Although importantly, from a clinical standpoint, tendon to tendon, and tendon to bone healing is not a prerequisite for a reduction in pain and improvement in function after repair (29, 30). When indicated based on a suspicion of clinically significant structural failure, imaging will be invaluable for a detailed assessment of tissue biology (e.g., a bony Bankart lesion following trauma-related anterior shoulder instability). This information will guide targeted and shared treatment decisions and facilitate specialist involvement (e.g., surgical consultation) as necessary, promoting a positive multidisciplinary approach involving specialists capable of accurate, evidence-based interpretation of structural details. Lastly, in cases where non-surgical management does not result in the expected clinical improvement, the contribution of traumatically and non-traumatically acquired structural variations warrants evaluation, facilitated by the wise selection of imaging for changing the path of care (27). In Table 1, we presented scenarios taken from everyday clinical practice to stimulate discussion on pro-and cons-for imaging use in shoulder pain management, while Figure 1 (Supplementary material), details a SWOT -strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threat-analysis for the use of imaging in shoulder pain management. Lastly, we have included a clinical decision-making diagram (Figure 2, Supplementary Material) to illustrate the authors' proposed method for integrating clinical and imaging findings. This diagram is designed to simplify the decision-making process for determining when imaging is necessary, unnecessary, or a borderline case. 3. IMPLICATIONS Prior to, or during attendance at out-patient shoulder orthopedic clinics routine imaging (usually radiographs) is common practice. This may help identify rare conditions requiring urgent management, such as osteosarcomas. However, in-depth interview practice and appropriate safety netting would reduce the need for blanket imaging and lessen the potential harms associated with being informed of tendon and/or bone changes that may, and equally may not be associated with symptoms and in the main will respond equally well to non-surgical management. \"Low-value\" imaging equates to billions of dollars of wasted resources. For example, within magnetic resonance imaging, a primary cohort receiving imaging referrals discordant with guidelines included orthopedic patients and patients referred by general practitioners (17, 31). Additionally, atraumatic pain was identified as a specific clinical condition where the use of \"low-value\" imaging was particularly evident (17). Measures for reducing \"low-value\" imaging and to promote reasonable use and recommendation of it are needed at all levels of healthcare, for promoting interprofessional collaboration and networking, thereby improving patient care and perceived support by the patient. Clinical guidelines recommend judicious use of imaging in people with shoulder pain, discouraging routine imaging, but fully utilize their use in probable red flag presentations (27, 32). Imaging should also be considered in non-improving (possibly at 12 weeks), or earlier, with worsening symptoms (27, 32). The appropriate utilization of imaging for a comprehensive understanding of clinical scenarios holds significant implications for both clinical practice and research. Clinicians (e.g., physicians, chiropractors, physiotherapists) bear the responsibility to justify the need to image and if a decision to image is made, determine the appropriate timing and type of imaging studies. This must be done within a shared decision making framework, and to recognize when multidisciplinary consultation is necessary to address patient needs effectively (33). Shared decision making requires consideration of the benefits and potential harms of imaging. It needs to be framed within comprehensive patient education, encompassing the current clinical status and patient wishes for management. For example, in the absence of red flag concerns is imaging necessary for a patient who wishes to focus on non-invasive, non-surgical management (34)? This opinion paper aims to stimulate a mature, balanced discourse that empowers less experienced clinicians to make informed decisions with individual patients, considering all pertinent factors contributing to their well-being. Within a proper application of the bio-psycho-social model of care, biological variables must be acknowledged, and in-depth analysis through imaging modalities can serve as a valuable strategy. As showed in the six clinical cases in Table 1, people presenting with painful shoulder conditions, particularly when specific anamnesis and predisposing factors were present, imaging may: • Confirm the presence of structural abnormalities requiring multidisciplinary consultation (e.g., expert opinion(s)). • Guide clinicians towards targeted interventions addressing specific structural pathologies, thereby enhancing treatment efficacy (e.g., calcific tendinopathy). • Prevent adverse outcomes resulting from misdiagnosed conditions (e.g., instability with rotator cuff tear). • Facilitate accurate differential diagnosis, mitigating the risk of overlooking clinically significant comorbidities (e.g. frozen shoulder). 4. CONCLUSION Clinical practice frequently lacks balance and frequently is conducted at the ends of a spectrum. With one end being rigid reliance on structural imaging and the other its rejection in favor of a psychosocial narrative. Yet clinical reality is rarely binary, and practicing at the end of any spectrum, as is in most situations in life, leads to cognitive distortion, and blind adherence to one belief over another. Recent medical examples include the discourse on vaccination, and in physiotherapy, the -often-toxic debate relating to touch therapy. The Latin phrase, in medias res (the solution lies in the middle) is very apt. To promote a judicious, resourceful, and evidence-based utilization of imaging, research should emphasize a comprehensive bio-psycho-social care pathway. Within this framework, all relevant domains should be engaged and weighted according to the specific clinical context. Educational curricula for all health professions should incorporate formative modules designed to enhance expertise in imaging strategies, including their clinical applicability and utility, strengths and limitations, and potential benefits and drawbacks. Moreover, receiving individualized written audit and feedback on imaging request rates —including the benefits of addressing imaging overuse, links to educational resources, and guidance on limiting imaging requests— could significantly decreased overall rate of musculoskeletal imaging requests (35-37), and could be a widely strategy for enhancing professional practice. A balanced, context-driven use of imaging, grounded in clinical reasoning and embedded in a biopsychosocial model, can enhance diagnosis, inform treatment, and support shared decision-making. Imaging is a valuable tool when used wisely: the question is not whether to use it, but when, why, and for whom. Table 1. Clinical practice scenarios to stimulate discussion on pro-and cons-for imaging use in shoulder pain management CLINICAL SCENARIO CASE DISCUSSION Suspected red flag conditions A 56-year-old housewife woman presented via direct access with atraumatic right shoulder pain. The patient reported concurrent right thoracic pain (in the region of the 7th rib) and exacerbation of shoulder pain with vigorous housework. She also reported a spontaneous cough of two weeks' duration. Notably, her night pain lessened when lying on her right side. No deficits in strength or sensation were reported, and the clinical shoulder examination was unremarkable Key Clinical Features: The initial screening allows physiotherapists to guide their decision to either treat, treat and refer for further imaging or consultation, or directly refer the patient for external medical evaluation if the issue are suspected to fails outside the scope of physiotherapy (33, 38). The patient presents with shoulder pain, a concurrent cough, and pain that worsens with exertion but is not reproducible during a physical shoulder examination. The pain is relieved by lying on the affected side. Decision Point & Rationale: The combination of symptoms—especially the presence of a cough and pain that doesn't originate from the shoulder joint itself—raises red flags for a non-musculoskeletal cause (39). These signs suggest a potential underlying pulmonary issue, such as pneumonia, pleuritis, or a Pancoast tumor. This suspicion prompts an immediate referral for medical consultation. In fact, shoulder pain can often be referred from various thoracic and visceral pathologies, mimicking a direct shoulder issue (28, 38, 40, 41). Imaging & Management Impact: An X-ray is the appropriate initial imaging modality to rule out lung involvement. This timely imaging and referral are crucial for ensuring the patient receives a prompt and accurate diagnosis, leading to appropriate medical treatment rather than ineffective physiotherapy. Post-traumatic painful shoulder A 48-year-old male lawyer presented to a private physiotherapy practice with left shoulder pain. He reported a fall from a height of one meter one week prior. He did not seek emergency department care initially as the pain was not severe; however, the pain has since intensified and is now present at night. Shoulder Key Clinical Features: The patient has a history of trauma, and over the course of a week, their shoulder pain and loss of function have progressively worsened, with notable nocturnal pain. A significant risk factor is their 20-year history of corticosteroid use, which increases fracture risk. The patient also presents with limited external rotation and abduction, which could indicate a posterior shoulder dislocation. Decision Point & Rationale: The combination of trauma, progressive pain (especially nocturnal), and the risk factor of long-term steroid use raises a strong suspicion for a fracture (such as an impacted greater tuberosity fracture) or a posterior shoulder dislocation, which movements, particularly abduction, were reported as painful. The patient has a history of smoking since the age of 20 years and rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed at age 28, managed with corticosteroids during symptom flare-ups can be easily missed (73.2% of cases). Given that these injuries require specific management and can worsen with a delay in diagnosis, immediate imaging is warranted over conservative care. Imaging & Management Impact: Imaging is crucial for a definitive diagnosis, and is mandatory when the bone profiles of the clavicle or acromion raise concerns about bone integrity. It is also necessary when the patient experiences severe pain that doesn't decrease even after pharmacological therapy, or when a large hematoma (Hennequin sign) is evident in the anterolateral part of the shoulder and arm. Notably, some fractures like an impacted greater tuberosity fracture, might not cause intense immediate pain and could be not easily recognizable. In this particular scenario, imaging helps to either confirm a fracture or identify a posterior shoulder dislocation, when clinical examination is not enough. In fact, while observable signs like a posterior protuberance, a flattening of the anterior shoulder profile, and coracoid prominence (42) along with anterior and posterior shoulder pain and limited external rotation and abduction (possibly due to an associated McLaughlin lesion (43)) can raise suspicion; these signs might be absent in more corpulent patients. In this case, true antero-posterior and Y-view X-ray projections are mandatory for assessing humeral head position relative to the glenoid (44) and identify this pathology, as it often requires a different course of treatment (e.g., immobilization or surgery) to restore function. Rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy A 54-year-old office worker female presented to a private physiotherapy practice reporting a sudden onset of intense and intolerable pain (Numeric Rating Scale for Pain 8/10) in her shoulder, experienced since the previous day, and an inability to abduct her arm. The patient reported significant nocturnal pain disruption. Her medical history included diabetes and hypothyroidism, but no history of trauma\". Key Clinical Features: Given the clinical features collected during the medical history reporting - middle-aged woman with a history of metabolic/endocrine comorbidities, presenting with sudden, severe nocturnal shoulder pain and restricted active motion-rotator cuff calcific tendinopathy should be considered (45). Decision Point & Rationale: The presence of calcific deposits doesn't always correlate with symptoms, as only about half of individuals with calcifications report shoulder pain (46), and the resorption phase of calcification is often linked to increased symptom severity. Clinical examination alone may not reveal the calcification phase (47-49). however, imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide a treatment plan (50). Imaging & Management Impact: Ultrasound with Power Doppler is the imaging modality of choice. It can confirm the presence of calcification, determine its size and location, and help assess if it is in an active, painful phase. Moreover, a combination of ultrasound and power Doppler can help determine if calcification is the source of pain, significantly influencing management (46). This information is critical for management, as it allows for specific interventions like extracorporeal shockwave therapy or percutaneous lavage, which are highly effective for this condition. The resulting treatment plan can be precisely tailored to the individual, potentially providing faster relief and better long-term outcomes than general conservative care (48, 51-53). Moreover, since calcific deposits can occur in various anatomical locations, they could necessitate diverse conservative or interventional approaches depending on the specific pattern of calcific tendinopathy (54). Consequently, a rehabilitation program tailored to the individual, integrating both clinical and sonographic findings, is vital for optimizing care and enhancing the patient's quality of life (53). It's worth noting that the relationship between calcification resorption and improved clinical outcomes (pain, function, or treatment success) remains debated and it is still a controversial topic. (52). Antero-inferior glenohumeral dislocation A 57-year-old male automotive mechanic presented to a private physiotherapy practice following 20 days of immobilization for a traumatic anteroinferior glenohumeral dislocation. Emergency department physicians confirmed reduction via radiography and recommended physiotherapy after three weeks of brace immobilization. The patient's medical history included a 15-year history of diabetes and a 10-year history of smoking (10 cigarettes/day); in family history, a rotator cuff repair was reported for the patient's mother and brother Key Clinical Features: In patients over 40 who have experienced a traumatic shoulder dislocation, a rotator cuff tear is a plausible concern that requires careful investigation. Post-immobilization pain and stiffness can be significant challenges, as they may mask identifiable strength deficits, potentially leading to a missed diagnosis. Key predisposing factors, such as smoking history (quantity and time) (55), diabetes (56), and genetics (57, 58) should also raise suspicion and warrant further assessment. Decision Point & Rationale: The main decision point is whether to consider imaging when clinical limitations (like pain or stiffness) prevent a reliable strength test or when predisposing risk factors are present. A delayed diagnosis can compromise rehabilitation outcomes and lead to larger rotator cuff tears. Therefore, evidence-based physiotherapy practice necessitates a proactive approach to screening in these specific patient populations. Imaging & Management Impact: Imaging should be considered whenever a rotator cuff tear is suspected, particularly when clinical assessments are unreliable. A comprehensive understanding of the clinical situation, obtained through imaging, is crucial for preventing a missed or delayed diagnosis. Identifying a tear early allows for a more effective and tailored management plan, which can prevent the tear from worsening and significantly improve rehabilitation outcomes. Frozen shoulder A 58-year-old female architect presented with a 4-month history of daily and nocturnal shoulder pain, unresponsive to pharmacotherapy. The patient reported severe sleep disruption and an inability to Key Clinical Features: It's crucial to consider the differential diagnosis of frozen shoulder, as several pathologies can mimic it. Conditions like neoplasms of the proximal humeral head, glenohumeral arthritis, and avascular necrosis can present with similar symptoms and can't be reliably differentiated through a medical history or physical exam alone (59). A patient's predisposing factors, such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, a history of malignancy, or abduct or rotate her arm. Passive range of motion was also limited, with an empty end-feel due to intractable pain. Her medical history included diabetes, dyslipidemia, a rheumatological pathology (i.e. lupus erythematosus), and a history of uterine carcinoma three years prior. lupus erythematosus, can be risk factors for both frozen shoulder and these other serious conditions. In this particular case, diabetes and dyslipidemia were recognized predisposing factors for frozen shoulder development (60-62), but diabetes and lupus erythematosus are also risk factors for avascular necrosis (63-65). Moreover, the patient's history of malignancy warrants careful consideration (66). Decision Point & Rationale: The main decision point revolves around when to order imaging. While some experts don't support routine imaging for every patient, arguing it's unnecessary without a history suggestive of a serious disease, others believe it's essential, especially when predisposing risk factors are present (67). The rationale is to either confirm a diagnosis of frozen shoulder or to identify a potentially life-threatening or debilitating condition that requires different, and often more urgent, management. Therapists should remain vigilant and re-evaluate the diagnosis if a patient doesn't improve with treatment or if their symptoms worsen [67]. Imaging & Management Impact: Imaging is a critical tool in these scenarios. If a neoplasm is identified, it could be life-saving. If avascular necrosis is diagnosed, prompt and appropriate treatment can significantly improve the patient's quality of life. A recent international consensus suggests that if a patient with a presumed frozen shoulder doesn't respond to initial therapy and an intra-articular injection, imaging should then be performed to rule out other pathologies (68). Rotator cuff-related shoulder pain A 53-year-old male middle school educator presented at a private physiotherapy clinic with a two-week history of anterolateral shoulder pain on the dominant side, representing the first such episode in his lifetime. The patient reported no history of trauma. The individual does not smoke or participate in regular exercise. He has a high body mass index Recent medical history included a relocation to a new residence three weeks prior to presentation. This involved considerable lifting and carrying. Key Clinical Features: The patient presents with shoulder pain but without a history of trauma or intense sporting activity. Key findings include a high body mass index, a history of overuse, minimal restriction in passive range of motion, a painful arc, and reported weakness with abduction. Such factors increase the suspicion of rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (69, 70). Decision Point & Rationale: Given the patient's history and symptoms, imaging is not immediately necessary. Instead, the focus should be on a trial of conservative care. Contrariwise, early referral for imaging here, could be disadvantageous. Imaging findings have demonstrated a weak association with symptom perception and are unlikely to alter the treatment trajectory. Moreover, a lay interpretation of imaging reports by non-experts —without adequate education regarding the prevalence and incidence of tendon structural abnormalities in asymptomatic individuals (6, 9)— could be detrimental to engagement in rehabilitation and adherence to therapeutic exercise. Additionally, this could foster expectations for more invasive treatments (19, 21), increase \"medical overuse\" and Clinical examination revealed a painful arc of motion during shoulder abduction; however, a full range of motion was otherwise preserved. Furthermore, strength assessment of external and internal rotation demonstrated comparable mean values bilaterally, while isometric resisted elevation at 90° of arm flexion exhibited diminished strength on the affected side. reinforce maladaptive beliefs (20, 21). Finally, imaging has not consistently shown prognostic value (12, 13). Imaging & Management Impact: A well-structured rehabilitation program is the primary management strategy. This includes patient education on their condition, therapeutic exercises, and lifestyle modifications (e.g., improving sleep, diet, and physical activity) (71-73), delivered through patient-centered communication and incorporating behavioral change strategies into the educational component (74). Exercise is frequently effective, expected, and generally well-received by individuals with rotator cuff-related shoulder pain (75, 76), and lifestyle modifications represent a promising group of interventions for enhancing clinical outcomes in shoulder tendinopathy, (20, 72, 73, 77). Imaging should be reserved for cases where the patient's symptoms don't improve with conservative care or if there's an unexpected worsening of symptoms within a reasonable timeframe (27, 32). This approach avoids \"medical overuse,\" reduces maladaptive beliefs about the condition, and promotes patient engagement in a proven, effective treatment plan.",

      "title": "Family Stress and Counseling",
      "abstract": "Stress is a continually growing concern in our society. The impact of stress on mental health and physical illness can be significant and a major factor in healthcare costs in the United States. A large percentage of Americans report feeling moderate-to-high stress levels on a daily basis [1]. When stress extends to include family and social aspects of one's life, complexities can exist beyond just individual coping of a situation or event. Stress has been seen by both patients and physicians as influencing health outcomes. However, stress is often difficult to define and study, in relation to both physical symptoms and external causes [2]. Family stress can be viewed as a disturbance in the ongoing state of a family system. This disturbance can occur both outside of the system (e.g., war, unemployment, natural disaster) and inside the family system (e.g., death, divorce, chronic illness). This systemic stress creates a change in the family's routine functioning [3]. Normative stressors (e.g., birth of a child, job transition, loss of an older adult) in families are considered to be common and predictable sources of stress. Nonnormative family stressors (e.g., early widowhood, job loss, natural disaster) are uncommon and unexpected and may occur at times other than those expected in the life cycle of the family or its members [4, 5]. How well the family unit copes with these two types of stressors largely impacts both the short-term and long-term adjustments and well-being of both the unit and the individuals in it.",

      "title": "Evaluación de la intervención psicooncológica mediante Counselling en pacientes con cáncer diferenciado de tiroides en tratamiento con radioyodo.",
      "abstract": "El hecho de recibir un diagnostico de cancer y el tratamiento del mismo causan habitualmente una profunda herida emocional a las personas que lo padecen y a su familia. Por esto, el paciente diagnosticado de cancer debe ser tratado de forma que mantenga la mejor calidad de vida (CV) y bienestar psicologico posibles, cuidando de manera especial todos los factores que originen problemas emocionales (ansiedad y/o depresion) y alteraciones de la vida social, laboral y familiar. Los pacientes con patologias tiroideas sufren alteraciones hormonales que requieren diversos tratamientos para regular las funciones propias de la glandula. Dichos tratamientos pueden provocar oscilaciones drasticas en los niveles hormonales, debidas al tratamiento en si mismo o a los controles necesarios para el seguimiento de la patologia. Estas alteraciones hormonales se asocian a sintomas psicologicos tales como cambios en el estado de animo, falta de concentracion, inestabilidad emocional y/o perdida de memoria entre otros. El cancer de tiroides (CT) afecta a una de las areas mas visibles del organismo, la porcion anterior del cuello. Cualquier modificacion en ella esta expuesta a la vista de terceros, lo que puede aumentar el estigma social para los pacientes y en algunos casos, el aislamiento por la enfermedad. Ademas, someterse a un tratamiento con un medicamento radiactivo (que requiere el aislamiento del paciente durante el ingreso y unas medidas de radioproteccion para su entorno los dias siguientes al alta) supone un estres adicional para el paciente, tanto por su propia seguridad como por los riesgos que la radiacion pudiera ocasionar a su entorno familiar. Cualquier procedimiento medico en el que intervengan radiaciones ionizantes obliga al profesional a alertar sobre riesgos muy infrecuentes, pero potencialmente graves, que atemorizan al paciente y que inconscientemente se asocian en primer lugar con los efectos nocivos conocidos de la radiacion (armamento nuclear, accidentes en centrales nucleares, uso de isotopos radioactivos con fines criminales, etc.) y no con los efectos beneficiosos para la salud derivados de su uso medico controlado. El objetivo de la intervencion psicooncologica es ayudar a los pacientes a soportar mejor su tratamiento, disminuir los sentimientos de alienacion, aislamiento, indefension y desesperanza, reducir la ansiedad en relacion a los tratamientos y clarificar percepciones e informaciones erroneas. Estas intervenciones tienen ademas la ventaja de facilitar que el paciente adopte una postura de responsabilidad en su recuperacion y colabore con los tratamientos medicos. Por todo ello, con el objeto de prevenir problemas de desadaptacion y deficit en la CV es necesario llevar a cabo un protocolo adecuado de evaluacion e intervencion psicologica que permita un mejor control de los efectos psicologicos asociados, fomentar estilos de afrontamiento activos, y facilitar la adherencia terapeutica a los tratamientos medicos. Existen abundantes referencias en la literatura sobre la eficacia de las intervenciones psicooncologicas para fomentar la CV y el bienestar psicologico del paciente en todos sus parametros. Tambien hay referencias sobre los trastornos psicologicos derivados de las alteraciones hormonales tiroideas. No obstante, llama la atencion la escasez de referencias sobre la eficacia de la intervencion psicologica en el caso particular de enfermos con CT, donde concurren cuatro aspectos potencialmente generadores de estres emocional: el diagnostico de cancer, la cirugia, las alteraciones hormonales originadas por la patologia tiroidea y el derivado del uso de radiaciones ionizantes. El proposito principal de esta investigacion es demostrar los beneficios de la intervencion psicooncologica en el estado de animo, la CV y el bienestar del paciente con cancer diferenciado de tiroides (CDT) tras tiroidectomia y en tratamiento con terapia con radioyodo 131I (TRI), mediante la aplicacion de tecnicas basadas en el Counselling.",

We present three female adolescents who developed an acute psychosis a few days before menstruation, which resolved completely upon bleeding or several days later, only to reappear in the same form in subsequent cycles. The clinical presentation was not in line with that of the typical functional psychoses. An extensive medical work-up did not show any significant disturbances, with the exception of anovulatory cycles in one youngster. Psychotropic treatment had no effect on the course of the psychosis. Treatment with progesterone in the second half of the cycle in one case, and with a combined progesterone/estrogen contraceptive agent in another, resulted in full recovery within several cycles. The third girl showed a spontaneous remission within four cycles. Remission continued in all cases after discontinuation of the hormonal treatment, and with no need to reintroduce any psychotropic agent, for a period of 2-4 years. We discuss several possible etiologic mechanisms for cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle, including it being a cycloid non-specific affective disorder, and its association with a temporary functional hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, and with anovulation. We also discuss the role of psychotropic and hormonal treatment in this disorder.",

This case is interesting as the whole scalp hair matted immediately after using coconut oil and castor oil following washing. Growing long hair and taking oil bath are cultural and religious customs in South India. The high viscosity of castor oil and long hair had contributed to sudden felting of hair.

      "abstract": "About 35% of subjects with head injury (HI) suffer from postconcussion syndrome (PCS). These disturbances can be chronic or even permanent. Such patients are discharged from hospital without any apparent problems, but it is often the case that their families, and sometimes even they themselves, start to notice the emergence of new problems. They may exhibit affective changes, such as thinking that they are worthless, alone and without any future perspectives. When they are left without the help of specialists and/or family and friends, their problems gain even greater significance. PCS includes subjective physical complaints (i.e. headache, dizziness) and cognitive, emotional and behavioral changes. PCS influences all areas of the patient's life. Subjects who have sustained head injury often have problems with marital relationships, maintaining of independence, employment, leisure activities and other functions which are related to social adjustment. Various studies have attempted to predict the post-injury status of HI patients from information available, such as data on the severity of head injury, the duration of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) and the results of neuropsychological assessment. This kind of prediction is important in planning of rehabilitation services and thus improving the kind of help available to survivors of HI. Early prediction of post-injury psychological status may also help the patient and his family in coping with the difficulties related to the trauma. We know a great deal about head injury and its consequences, but many questions still need to be answered. Among these are issues such as: the role of neurobehavioral data in the prediction of outcome for HI patients, the identification of variables determining the extent of PCS and the search for reliable factors which may influence future employment or school status. The assessment of patients for invalidity and other social security benefits also requires a more rational approach, based on the data available.",

In Japan, a number of psychopathological and psychotherapeutic studies have been performed since the 1930s on a pathological condition similar to SAD, known as Taijin-kyofu (TK). TK, especially the convinced subtype of TK (c-TK; also known as the offensive subtype of TK), is described as a culture-bound syndrome similar to SAD. In proposed DSM-5 draft, it is suggested to add \"offending others\" to fear of being humiliating or embarrassing which were indicated in DSM-IV. It is interesting that fearing of making another person uncomfortable or \"offending others\" is consistent with symptom which has been investigated through c-TK in particular.

Disorders developing later in life after exposure to some medications give a picture similar to TS and are called ‘tardive Tourettisms’. Because ‘dystonic’ movements can be seen in TS, dystonia may be mistaken for TS. Because a patient can have jerky movements with myoclonic epilepsy, the two disorders are sometimes confused.

      "abstract": "조현병(정신분열병)은 망상, 환각, 와해된 언어와 행동 그리고 사회적 직업적 기능상의 심각한 어려움을 초래하는 증상 등의 특징을 지닌다. 정신장애의 진단 및 통계편람 제5판인 DSM-5에서는 조현병의 범주에서 몇 가지 중요한 변화를 보여주고 있다. - 진단기준의 하위유형(subtypes) 폐지: 하위유형은 평가 당시의 두드러진 증상으로 정의되었지만, 종종환자의 증상이 하나의 유형에서 다른 유형으로 변화되고 또한 하위유형 간 중복되는 증상을 드러내 하위유형간 구분이 분명하지 않아 이는 유형간 타당도를 저하시키는 원인이 되어 임상가에게 유용하지 않았다는 점이 그 이유이다. 한편 catatonia(운동부동증과 혼미 등)는 보다 세부적인 진단을 돕기 위한 세부진단(specifier)이 되었다. 예로, 조현병과 분열정동장애 같은 기타 정신병적 장애의 specifier specifier로 로사용되고, 양극성장애나 주요우울장애 같은 다른 장애에서도 사용될 수 있다. - 증상의 심각도(severity): 증상의 심도를 평정하는 증상의 역치(symptom threshold)는 특정 증상에서 적어도 2이상을 드러내야 한다(DSM-IV의 증상역치는 1).- 추후 연구영역: DSM-5의 Section III에 포함된 약한 정신병 증후(Attenuated psychosis syndrome)는 공식적인 장애로 고려되기 이전 더 많은 연구를 필요로 하는 조건이다. 이 잠정적 진단범주는 만개된정신병적 장애를 보이지는 않지만 가벼운 관련 증상들을 드러내는 개인들을 포함하고 있다. 추후 정신병적 장애를 드러낼 위험성이 높은 개인을 밝히는 것은 조기의 효율적인 개입에 중요한 시사점을 지닌다. 성격장애는 다양한 생활영역에서 개인의 기능에 영향을 미치는 자신과 타인에 대한 감정과 사고방식과 관련된다. DSM-5에서는 DSM-IV와 동일한 10가지 성격장애의 범주적 접근을 유지하고 있다. 한편DSM-5의 Section III에는 차원-범주 혼합모형(hybrid dimensional-categorical model)이 제안되었다. 이로써 임상가는 개인의 성격기능에서의 어려움과 성격의 병리적 특질패턴에 근거하여 성격장애의 진단과 성격을 평가할 수 있다.",

Somewhat confusingly, the term \"dystonia\" has been used to designate a specific type of abnormal movement or posture, a syndrome that occurs secondary to a number of underlying neurologic disorders, and a primary disorder known as \"idiopathic torsion dystonia.\" Dystonic movements can be either slow or rapid and are usually more stereotyped and patterned than movements in chorea (random and unpredictable), myoclonus (brief and shocklike), and tremor (rhythmical and not associated with alterations in posture). Dystonia is characterized by failure of normal reciprocal inhibition, which causes co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles accompanied by excessive contraction of other regional muscles. This chapter is limited to conditions characterized by continuous rather than intermittent dystonia and therefore does not include discussion of the paroxysmal dystonias. Psychogenic dystonia is discussed in Chapter 35 together with other functional movement disorders.",

Survivors often face lifelong impairments affecting functional status, cognition, and mood. Depression, the most common mood disorder affecting TBI survivors, most likely is underdiagnosed and presents differently than primary depression or depression after other brain insults. Unfortunately, few studies have been reported that advance theoretical perspectives on post-TBI depression. Currently, there is some evidence that neurochemical and anatomical changes contribute to post-TBI depression. Interpersonal factors, such as sense of belonging and social support, may contribute to the incidence of post-TBI depression. Because of limited theoretical viewpoints, advances have not been made in cost-effective and efficient interventions for this mood disorder, which prolongs rehabilitation and contributes to family suffering.",

The symptoms may vary from discomfort and pain to decreased body function and invalidity. Although it is not clear to what extent MSDs are caused by work, their impact on working life is huge. MSDs can interfere with activities at work and can lead to reduced productivity, sickness absence and chronic occupational disability [1].",

In recent years,1 a diagnosis of insomnia has also included a report of decreased daytime function associated with the poor sleep at night to differentiate a patient with insomnia from an individual who simply requires less sleep. Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks. Chronic insomnia may begin after an acute episode, if conditioning factors are involved, but typically presents as a long-standing complaint despite varied attempts at treatment.",

      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and progressive neurological disease, with an important socio-economic burden. Over time, an increased incidence of headaches like migraines and tension headaches has been observed among these patients. Headaches have not been considered as multiple sclerosis-related symptoms, even representing a red flag for multiple sclerosis diagnosis. It is uncertain whether the headache–multiple sclerosis association could be explained by the presence of common triggers or a common physiopathological mechanism (involvement of tertiary B-cell follicles). An important differential diagnosis is between multiple sclerosis attacks and migraines with aura, which can also be associated with neurological deficits. Another important aspect is the occurrence or exacerbation of the cephalalgic syndrome after the initiation of therapy for multiple sclerosis (DMTs), or the improvement of headache after the initiation of certain DMT drugs. In addition to headaches, individuals diagnosed with multiple sclerosis often report experiencing diverse pain syndromes, contributing to an additional decline in their overall quality of life. These syndromes are frequently neglected, the focus being on slowing down the progression of neurological deficits. This review aims to evaluate the characteristics of multiple-sclerosis-related headaches (frequency, possible correlation with attacks, and disease-modifying therapies) and the key distinctions in imaging characteristics between demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis and those observed in cases of primary headaches.",

Refusal to consider a low-paid job may be considered a result of negativism, grandiose aspirations or lack of insight into one's true functional ability. Squandering one's disability income long before the end of the month might be regarded as an example of poor judgement secondary to psychosis. Liebow's (1967) study of the inner-city poor, however, illustrates that these problems are not specific to people with mental illness but are common responses to poverty and to the work opportunities available to poor people.",

Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

      "abstract": "Note that the terms ‘syncope’ and ‘loss of consciousness’ are not interchangeable as loss of consciousness can be due to either syncopal or non-syncopal causes. Syncope is a form of loss of consciousness in which hypoperfusion of the brain is the cause (from the Greek syn (together) and kopein (to cut), referring to the fact that the blood flow that joins the brain together with the rest of the body has been cut). Syncopal causes can be subdivided by mechanism as follows: • ‘Reflex’: this is believed to involve activation of a primitive reflex that leads mammals to ‘play dead’ when faced with danger. Their heart rate slows and their blood pressure drops temporarily, reducing cerebral perfusion and leading to syncope. Some people appear to have a low threshold for activating this reflex in specific situations—for example after standing still for a long time, after seeing something frightening (e.g. blood, needles), or when straining (micturition, defecation). • ‘Cardiac’: pathologies causing a reduction in cardiac output (such as arrhythmias or outlet obstruction) can also lead to syncope. • ‘Orthostatic’: orthostatic hypotension basically means low blood pressure on sitting or standing (as opposed to lying flat). When we stand up there is a sudden drop in blood pressure that we compensate for by vasoconstriction, particularly of the ‘capacitance’ veins in the legs. This reduces the intravascular space, enabling us to maintain the pressure. However, this vasoconstriction takes a few seconds, so to prevent a transient fall in blood pressure every time we stand, there is a temporary increase in heart rate. Patients with reduced intravascular volume (e.g. from dehydration) and/or in whom the normal autonomic response (transient tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) to standing is blunted (e.g. due to drugs or autonomic neuropathy) are vulnerable to blackouts. • ‘Cerebrovascular’: these are non-cardiac structural causes of reduced cerebral perfusion, i.e. obstructions to the blood flow between the heart and the brain. They are relatively uncommon. The main causes of a transient loss of consciousness are summarized in Figure 3.1, with the most common in large font. You should also remember that patients may believe they have lost consciousness when in fact they haven’t.",

      "abstract": "Plusieurs considerent le traumatisme crânien comme une « epidemie silencieuse » : « Epidemique » par le nombre eleve de cas, ayant des repercussions socio-economiques importantes ; « silencieuse » car le manque de sensibilisation et de connaissances du phenomene fait que ce probleme passe quasiment inapercu. Le traumatisme craniocerebral (TCC) implique un coup plus ou moins violent a la tete et il peut se produire a divers moments et dans divers lieux : accident de la route ou au travail ou encore lors d'une activite de loisir ou d'une activite sportive. Il y a trois niveaux : le TCC leger, modere et grave. Les deux dernieres categories (TCC modere et grave) impliquent un coma plus ou moins long et le reveil est souvent compare a une deuxieme naissance ou l'on doit tout reapprendre. Souvent, le TCC est caracterise par des sequelles persistantes qui ont la particularite d'etre invisibles. Ainsi, les proches et les ami(e)s et aussi les autres personnes rencontrees peuvent avoir de la difficulte a saisir les changements causes par le TCC ; ceci peut laisser place a de la stigmatisation. Nous avons fait des entretiens semi-diriges avec des personnes ayant survecu a un TCC modere ou grave pour pouvoir les questionner sur leur experience de vie a leur retour a la vie « normale ». Le handicap est le theme central de notre recherche, et a l'aide du modele du Processus de production du handicap (PPH) propose par Fougeyrollas et al. (1998), nous avons observe l'importance du role des facteurs personnels (sequelles) et surtout de l'impact des facteurs environnementaux (famille, ami(e)s, organismes et institutions, etc.) sur la reduction ou l'augmentation des habitudes de vie (situation de handicap). Pour faire la demonstration que la personne ayant survecu a un TCC n'est pas un acteur passif face a sa situation de handicap, nous avons utilise le concept « d'agir » propose par Hurtubise et Roy (2007). Cela a permis d'illustrer les diverses strategies qu'utilise une personne vivant avec un TCC pour faire face aux differents obstacles. Nous avons identifie cinq types d'actions : l'evitement, la paralysie, la contrainte, le bricolage et la tactique. Toutes les personnes de notre recherche n'ont pas fait un retour a leur vie d'avant l'accident mais ils ont tous trouve de nouvelles habitudes de vie adaptees a leur situation ; plusieurs doivent et devront faire face a des obstacles en lien avec le TCC.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : traumatisme crânien, handicap invisible, liminalite, agir, stigmatisation",

      "title": "Commentary on Schotte et al. “Development of temporal lobe epilepsy during maintenance electroconvulsive therapy: A case of human kindling?”",
      "abstract": "Kindling is a phenomenon whereby repeated subthreshold stimulations for inducing a particular initial behavior eventually produce that behavior, and with further stimulations additional behaviors are observed.1 It is a model of learning, memory, and epileptogenesis/epilepsy; the latter is because the measured behavior is most often a seizure that becomes progressively more severe. For example, in kindling of the limbic structures in adult rodents, the Racine scale is used.2 These seizures are initially focal and then become bilateral clonic3-5 and eventually tonic (Table 1).2 In experimental studies, kindling can be induced by a variety of electrical or chemical stimuli.3, 4, 6-16 Another form of kindling is the progressive intensification of bilateral (probably generalized) seizures triggered by repeated administration of chemoconvulsants such as flurothyl with associated decrease in the latencies of the onset of the convulsions.17 In almost all the studies, the data suggest that focal seizures eventually become bilateral or the bilateral seizures become more severe. There is only one observation that with repeated audiogenic stimulation in one strain of rats (genetically epilepsy prone rats [GEPR-3]), after a series of bilateral seizures (which are presumed to be of brainstem origin), focal electroencephalography (EEG) discharges appeared in the amygdala with seizure types reminiscent of the Racine stages 1-3.18, 19 The notion that kindling may occur in human epilepsies has been proposed and debated since the first description of the phenomenon by Graham Goddard in 1967.1 There are several excellent reviews on the topic describing the pros and cons of the available studies5, 20 and the evidence is at best scant. This may be due, in part, to the greater number of stimulations needed to elicit kindling, the higher the animal is on the phylogenetic scale.5 Schotte et al21 presented a 67-year-old right-handed woman with no family history of epilepsy or febrile seizures, who had been receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) sessions for medically refractory bipolar disease. She received weekly bilateral temporal ECT for 9 years before being switched to right temporal ECT (weekly initially; then reduced to every other week), due to concerns of cognitive deterioration. In parallel, she had been receiving valproate, among other medications, for management of her bipolar disorder. After 17 years and 800 sessions of bilateral or unilateral ECT, and after reducing the sessions from weekly to every other week, she started manifesting epileptic seizures consisting of hyperventilation, tachycardia, impaired awareness, oral and left hand automatisms, and postictal aphasia. Her video-EEG monitoring captured left more than right temporal epileptic discharges and ictal seizure patterns with bilateral onset, although lateralizing electroclinical signs were suggested (reported as starting at or rapidly propagating to the left temporal, although electrographic onset remains unclear). Subtraction ictal SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) coregistered with MRI (SISCOM) showed left hyperperfusion, and interictal fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) with anatomy-corrected asymmetry index analysis showed bilateral but greater on the left hemisphere hypometabolism. No obvious association between the timing of ECT sessions and her seizures was observed. The authors propose that this presentation may be a form of ECT kindling of the development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in humans. In this case, this will resemble the studies in the GEPR-3 audiogenic-prone rats and one would have to assume that the ECT seizures are of brainstem origin. Prior reports of epilepsy diagnosed after many episodes of ECT included focal or bilateral onset seizures, while epileptic activity after bitemporal ECT or ipsilateral temporal onset seizures have been reported after unilateral ECT22, 23 and often subside after ECT discontinuation. However, as was the case in the patient described by Schotte et al, ECT discontinuation may not always be possible due to the severity of depression. However, there is an alternative hypothesis that should be considered. The 800 ECT seizures recorded prior to clinical seizure onset could have produced hippocampal injury, and the observed seizures may be a reflection of this injury. The observed cognitive deterioration, reported before the onset of clinical seizures, is supportive evidence. It is also possible that this injury may have been exacerbated by the focal delivery of ECT via a right temporal lobe electrode. This hypothesis could be considered in the interpretation of the data. Of interest, although bilateral temporal pathologies were observed, the interictal pathology (FDG-PET) as well as the lateralizing signs on the ictal SISCOM and electroclinical manifestations showed a preponderance of left temporal pathology, that is, contralateral to the right temporal ECT sessions. If ECT is indeed implicated in the development of TLE in this patient, whether directly by kindling or indirectly as a result of the ensuing temporal lobe pathology, what are the mechanisms responsible for the greater pathology and epileptogenesis at a contralateral focus? Paradoxical lateralizing signs (eg, postictal expressive and receptive aphasia with or without right gaze deviation and right-sided motor signs) have been reported very rarely after right unilateral ECTs of right-handed patients, either immediately after the ECT or postrecovery (“tardive seizures”).24, 25 These have been postulated to reflect “stunning” of eloquent regions after ECT seizure generalization, although it is also likely that underlying predisposing conditions or coadministered drugs may render some patients more vulnerable to manifesting persisting or reactivated seizure foci, contralateral to the ECT. Certainly, the frequency of these paradoxical associations is too low to confirm causality. Furthermore, pre-ECT data on neuroimaging or video-EEG monitoring to determine preexisting pathologies at the contralateral site are missing. The chronic concomitant use of valproate or benzodiazepines for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in some of these patients,21, 25 may have masked or delayed the onset of the clinical manifestations of prior epilepsy. On the contrary, could the unilateral ECT have protected the ipsilateral temporal lobe from injury or propensity to manifest or sustain ictal activity?21, 24, 25 Electroconvulsive seizures result in a period of postictal refractoriness to seizures or epileptic activity26, 27 that may contribute to apparent antiseizure effects. Bilateral ECT has been used to stop superrefractory status epilepticus,28-30 although most studies have been retrospective or case reports, thus warranting further confirmation with prospective studies before recommending its use. Unknowns and possible confounders include the ECT effects on blood-brain barrier permeability and its potential effects on seizure activity or the brain penetration of coadministered drugs (including antiseizure drugs), vascular and cerebral blood flow changes after ECT, direct effects of (unilateral or bilateral) ECT on seizure propensity, comorbidities, and the reciprocal influences of the concomitant brain pathologies due to psychiatric and other comorbidities. Additional factors potentially controlling outcomes are the impact of ECT electrode placement and stimulation protocol on the function of and connectivity patterns within a network that has already been altered by the comorbid conditions and individual factors that may modify the effects of all these interactions. We commend the authors for reviving these interesting and clinically important questions through their “concept and hypothesis” manuscript prompted by their case report. Despite certain, and often unavoidable, practical limitations, inherent to everyday clinical practice, that prevent definitive conclusions, the implications for future systematic research in this area are important. To date the evidence that kindling occurs in humans is still at best questioned. Time will tell.

      "title": "The relationship between Stigma and Self-Efficacy in individuals with epilepsy or nonepileptic attack disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract\r\nStigma is when a certain characteristic (such as weight or race) causes an individual or group to be treated negatively based on a feature that differentiates them from other members of society. Stigma can be considered in different ways; Stigma can be ‘enacted’, when the individual is directly discriminated against, and ‘perceived’, when individual believes the negative actions of others to be linked to an undesirable characteristic of their self. Stigma can have serious consequences, such as reduced quality of life, lower rates of employment and less overall life satisfaction. \r\nEpilepsy is a reasonably common neurological disorder where individuals experience seizures. Over 500,000 UK residents are estimated to be affected by Epilepsy. It can be caused by a number of different factors, such as brain lesions, but there may be no known cause for up to two-thirds of individuals with epilepsy. Historically, seizures have been associated with negative factors, such as demonic possession, and have experienced stigma. There is also evidence that stigmatising attitudes towards seizures continue to be prevalent. Non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) is a condition whereby an individual experiences seizures that are outwardly similar to epileptic seizures. These seizures, however, are not associated with the neurological correlates of epilepsy. NEAD is a fairly common disorder with an estimated 15 000 UK residents receiving a diagnosis. The causes of NEAD are often considered psychological rather than physical and, as such, NEAD is often considered a mental health disorder. \r\nThe causes and manifestations of stigma in NEAD are unclear. This project aimed to extend the current understanding of stigma in NEAD by first: reviewing the literature on the experiences of stigma for NEAD and second: investigating the possible underlying factors that may cause perceived stigma in NEAD compared to epilepsy.\r\nPart I describes the outcomes of a systematic narrative review that identified 22 papers investigating the experiences of stigma by individuals diagnosed with NEAD. The results indicate that individuals with NEAD experience stigma from healthcare professionals, the public, and family and friends. Some evidence suggests that individuals with NEAD experience higher rates of stigma than epilepsy. \r\nPart II presents a cross-sectional study that investigate the relationship between perceived stigma and self-efficacy, depression, anxiety and seizure symptom severity in 2 groups (epilepsy and NEAD). The study found individuals with NEAD report more perceived stigma than those with epilepsy and higher, clinical, levels of depression. The severity of symptoms was not associated with perceived stigma for NEAD but it was with epilepsy. Depression was significant predictive factor for perceived stigma in both epilepsy and NEAD.\r\nThese studies develop the current understanding of stigma in NEAD and epilepsy. The findings suggest individuals with NEAD experience more stigma than those with Epilepsy and that depression predicts perceived stigma for other groups. The findings also suggest that stigma may be a useful target for future interventions for individuals with NEAD.",

      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

Androgenetic alopecia, one of the most common forms of hair loss, usually has a specific pattern of temporal-frontal loss in men and central thinning in women. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved topical minoxidil to treat men and women, with the addition of finasteride for men. Telogen effluvium is characterized by the loss of \"handfuls\" of hair, often following emotional or physical stressors. Alopecia areata, trichotillomania, traction alopecia, and tinea capitis have unique features on examination that aid in diagnosis.

      "title": "Syncope: an overview of diagnosis and treatment",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Syncope is a syndrome in which a relatively sudden-onset, brief loss of consciousness results from a temporary self-terminating period of total cerebral hypoperfusion (1-4). In this regard, it is important to note that other conditions (e.g., epilepsy, concussions, metabolic disturbances and intoxications) may also cause a temporary loss of consciousness (TLOC) but nonetheless are not ‘syncope’ (3-5). Each of these differ from syncope either by the need for medical intervention to reverse the process (e.g., hypoglycemia) or by the underlying mechanism of the loss of consciousness (e.g., electrical disturbance in epilepsy, trauma in head injury, etc.) or both. Other conditionsmayalsomimic syncope. These are often termed ‘syncope mimics’ or ‘pseudosyncope’, but differ from syncope inasmuch as they do not cause true loss of consciousness (e.g., conversion reactions, malingering, and cataplexy). In itself, ‘syncope’ is not a complete diagnosis. Identifying the cause is important, since syncopemay be amarker of increasedmortality risk in some cases, but even more often may lead to physical injury resulting from falls or accidents, diminished quality-of-life, and possible restriction from employment or avocation. The goal should be to determine the cause of syncope with sufficient confidence to provide a reasonable assessment of prognosis, recurrence risk, and treatment options. The initial step is always the documentation of a comprehensive and detailed medical history (3-7). LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS Consciousness and ‘loss of consciousness’ (LOC) are complex concepts, but most physicians have a working understanding of what ismeant (8). Essentially, LOC implies not only loss of awareness and appropriate responsiveness to external stimuli, but also loss of postural tone. Occasionally, however, symptoms may suggest that ‘syncope’ is imminent, but the full clinical picture does not evolve at that time; such cases are often termed ‘near-syncope’. In such instances, the patient may experience near loss of vision (‘grey-out’ due principally to transient loss of blood supply to the retina), diminution of hearing, and feeling ‘out-of-touch’ with their surroundings and/or confused. On the other hand, many times patients complain of less well defined symptoms such as “dizziness” or “lightheadedness”. These latter complaints (especially in the elderly)may be due to an illdefined functional cerebral dysfunction triggered by transient hypotension (perhaps not severe enough to cause TLOC), but in most cases it is believed that such symptoms are not related to either ‘syncope’ or ‘nearsyncope’, and shouldnot be reported as such.",

      "title": "Cancer-Related Fatigue: Nursing Assessment and Management",
      "abstract": "Cancer-related fatigue (CRF), the most common side effect of cancer and cancer treatment, is unlike the acute fatigue we experience from working all day in our jobs and with our families. It is an unpredictable, intense, overwhelming sense of tiredness or energy depletion. Fatigue is also defined as exhaustion, lethargy, lack of concentration and motivation, weakness, and depression. 1 It can occur suddenly and may not end when treatment ends but last months or even years. Patients with advanced colo-rectal cancer, lung and breast cancers, and lymphoma, all of which are managed under a variety of treatment regimens, report fatigue. 2 The onset, duration, and intensity of CRF have variable patterns, most notably in people receiving chemotherapy. Many report fatigue during the first few days after treatment, with a peak in fatigue when blood counts reach their lowest (nadir) and a decrease in fatigue before the next chemotherapy cycle. 1,3 Several studies have examined patterns of fatigue from radiation. 3–5 Findings suggest that fatigue may be cumulative over four to six weeks of treatment, with an increase in the presence of other physical symptoms, mood disturbances, and changes in usual activity. 3 For people receiving biologic therapies, fatigue is cumulative and related to dose and schedule. 6,7 With more types of cancer being treated with a combination of these therapies, the number of people affected by CRF is rising. People receiving cancer treatment can best describe CRF’s effect on their quality of life and thereby provide insight into its definition. A 76-year-old woman with lung cancer stated, “The morning after my treatment I could not get out of bed. When I finally did, I could only walk as far as the bathroom, then back to bed. I did not dare walk into the kitchen to prepare breakfast. My legs felt like lead.” A 52-year-old man with colon cancer described his fatigue. “I tried to work while taking my treatments, but I was exhausted by noon. I decided to work at home with my computer, but found it hard to focus. I tried to nap, but I never felt rested.” On the initiation of her second chemotherapy regimen, a 37-year-old woman with breast cancer recalled, “The first round of treatment made me so tired. My body ached. For the last three treatments, I found myself in bed most of the time. I could not be a wife or a mother to three small children.” A variety of patterns and multiple factors influence an individual’s experience of CRF. 1,8 With the interactions of multiple physiologic and psychological factors, CRF remains difficult to describe, and subsequently, manage. 9 Cancer-related fatigue has long been a misunderstood side effect of cancer treatment, and unfortunately the message often conveyed to patients and their families is that it’s unavoidable and needs to be tolerated. ASSESSING CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE The etiology of CRF cannot always be determined. 10 Several contributing factors have been identified: cancer and cancer treatments, anemia, neutropenia, sleep disturbance, depression, nutritional disturbance, and coping with other side effects of cancer treatment such as pain and nausea. 8 Along with complaints of unusual tiredness or weakness, people with CRF have decreased physical stamina, withdrawal from social activities, and decreased motivation. They may express irritability or impatience. 2 CRF’s cognitive manifestation ranges from sluggish thought process to inability to concentrate, forgetfulness, decreased short-term memory, and shortened attention span, 11 which may interfere with the person’s ability to fully participate in work, family, and social activities. Given that the contributing factors of CRF may be multicausal, and those interrelationships are the subject of many research questions, the current approach to assessment and nursing intervention needs to be multifaceted. Fatigue may present a challenge for nursing assessment because of the inherent difficulty in measuring a subjective symptom. Here are some guidelines to consider in assessing fatigue: Assess CRF as one would pain.1 First, allow patients to describe their fatigue in their own words by using open-ended questions such as, “Tell me about your fatigue.” Afterward, it’s useful to refer to the symptom by using the patient’s own words which hold significant meaning. More specific responses may be prompted by questions related to the patient’s functional mobility and ability to participate in leisure activities. Use a scale. A 0-to-5 or 0-to-10 response scale helps determine the patient’s perception of the severity of his fatigue. Select a scale that’s familiar to other care providers in the clinical setting, and use the same scale for other subjective symptoms such as pain or nausea. Having a consistent rating system helps everyone interpret a patient’s symptom patterns more quickly. Determine aggravating and alleviating factors. Ask the patient what makes his fatigue seem more severe, and what has worked and not worked in the past to prevent or reduce fatigue. Document assessment findings. This is critical for communication among health care providers. One initial assessment strategy is to track hemoglobin counts and fatigue scores on a graph (vital signs or treatment flowsheet) so that the nurse can convey to the physician how the patient is experiencing fatigue in reference to other symptoms, treatments, and lab values. The information also may be useful for individualizing fatigue management. SUGGEST AN ACTIVE APPROACH People experiencing CRF may make adjustments in their lives long before they seek guidance from health care providers. The usual fatigue self-management strategies, such as sleep and rest, which are more appropriate for healthy persons managing acute fatigue, are passive approaches. 9 In managing CRF, strategies need to be targeted toward maintaining sufficient energy to participate in the most meaningful life activities as defined by the person experiencing fatigue. 12 Because of the multicausal and multidimensional nature of CRF, 7 more than one management strategy may be necessary to provide relief. From a review of theoretical and research literature on CRF, Emma Ream and Alison Richardson identified three core activities to reduce the effect of fatigue: effective management of associated symptoms, enhancement of activity balanced with rest, and management of emotional stress. 9 Although more investigation is necessary to identify and test successful strategies for minimizing fatigue, several approaches for managing CRF have been supported by nursing research: preparatory education, physical activity, psychosocial support resources, and attention-restoring activities. Following are self-management strategies that can be incorporated into nursing practice: Acknowledgment of fatigue. Acknowledgment of the existence of CRF is a crucial first step toward assessment and management. Its recognition by the health care provider identifies CRF to be as important as nausea and vomiting, pain, peripheral neuropathy, or other treatment-related symptoms that affect quality of life. People with cancer report that having a health care provider simply inquire about their fatigue is meaningful because it indicates that their fatigue is worthy of intervention. 13 Preparatory information. By providing patients with information on fatigue, what’s known about it, and how it can be managed, the nurse validates not only its presence, but expresses her interest in working with the patient to manage it. A study of people receiving radiation therapy reported that those who prepare themselves for impending fatigue experience it less than those who receive no preparatory information. 14 With realistic expectations, people experiencing CRF can adjust and adapt to this symptom. 2 Prioritizing and pacing activities. Discuss with your patient how to prioritize and pace activities, including rest. 15 In setting priorities, it’s important to include a family member so that the choices for rest and activity reflect the needs of patient and family. As a man receiving chemotherapy explained, “I try to work three days a week—Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. I need one day off to recuperate from eight hours of work. My wife thinks I’m lazy because I have no energy to do what she wants me to do.” Encourage the person with CRF to review his usual weekly activities and identify low, moderate, or high priorities. Eliminate the low-priority activities and negotiate the moderate-priority activities into a daily schedule. Suggest assigning low-or moderate-priorities activities that are essential to other family members. If prioritizing and planning activities are energy depleting for the patient, assign a job broker, a family member or friend who can organize and assign tasks such as grocery shopping and meal preparation. There are certain tasks that may be obligatory to the patient’s role in the family. For example, a mother of three school-age children was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer. She felt it was her role to complete her usual to-do list of household chores, although she knew it took much of her energy. Her nurse helped her identify realistic expectations and develop new strategies. For this family, the task of doing laundry was divided into smaller activities for each family member. Her husband brought the hamper into the living room where his wife could sort the dirty laundry. She taught the older children to use the washer and dryer in the basement. The children brought the clothes upstairs for their mother to fold and put away. By breaking down household chores, the patient was able to participate and maintain her role in the family. Balancing activity and rest. In addition to prioritizing activities, a balanced schedule of activity and rest is important. 15 One woman in a cancer support group referred to her experience with fatigue as “living with the toddler effect.” She described pushing herself like a toddler who moves from one activity to another before finally collapsing. She stated, “I didn’t know another way to manage my fatigue.” Often, the balance between activity and rest is difficult. For some people, rest means sleeping for an extended time. Whereas lying down and shutting one’s eyes may be appropriate for a short time, sleeping on and off throughout the day interrupts sleep cycles at night and creates more symptom distress. To alleviate CRF, rest is more effective when used as a respite from activity. Short, frequent periods of inactivity, such as sitting quietly or lying down, strategically planned throughout the day, are more beneficial than long periods of sleep. 15 Physical activity. The nurse may need to help a person with CRF develop an incremental plan to increase physical activity. Even normally physically active people can and do exercise during treatment. However, the intensity and duration of the activity may need to be modified. 16 Although regular physical activity is an important component of a healthy lifestyle, Anna Schwartz confirmed that many health care providers do not provide information about it or encourage people with cancer to exercise. 16 Several studies of women receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy for breast cancer and who participated in moderately intense aerobic exercises or a walking program reported that participants had less fatigue and emotional distress than those in usual care groups. 17–19 Patients report that physical activity is most effective when symptoms like fatigue are at their worst. 20 Of all the physical activities studied that have been used by people experiencing fatigue (walking, riding a stationary bicycle, low-impact aerobics, and swimming), walking is the most convenient, low cost, and low risk, regardless of age. In addition, walking may provide distraction, socialization, and attention-restoration. One young man, after his third cycle of treatment for lymphoma, had been hospitalized for an extended period of time. Upon returning home, he needed an incremental plan for increasing his physical activity. The first few days he focused on getting out of bed, getting dressed, and moving about his house. The plan also included activities beginning with sitting on the front porch and progressing toward walking down the driveway, to the end of the street, around the block, and continuing until he was able to choose his own physical activities. When he returned to the clinic, he shared with the staff a rediscovery of what he enjoyed most in life: socializing with friends, hiking, biking, and running. More study is necessary to determine specific recommendations for the appropriate type and amount of exercise. Overall, physical activity needs to be initiated at a comfortable level. Gradually, the intensity and duration may be increased to three to four days per week. 20 Energy conservation. Encourage the person experiencing fatigue to perform tasks that expend the least amount of energy. A collaborative approach among physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurses, and physicians supports the integration of energy-conserving strategies into planning daily activities and adapting the home environment. Eileen Donovan described several energy-conserving strategies for self-care, meal preparation, housekeeping, shopping, child care, and work. 21 Simple strategies, such as sitting rather than standing, or moving items closer within reach, decrease the amount of energy used. A breast cancer survivor, who had experienced fatigue, described her energy-conservation strategy for grocery shopping to her support group. She prepared the grocery list the day before and organized it by aisle. She planned her trip to a familiar neighborhood market at a time when it was less congested. She supported herself with a grocery cart as she moved from aisle to aisle, and took a 15-minute break halfway through on a bench in front of the store. After she paid the bill, she always asked for assistance with carrying the groceries to her car. Psychosocial support resources. People receiving radiation treatment and chemotherapy find it affects many aspects of their lives: their ability to work, their physical and emotional well-being, their ability to enjoy life in the moment, and their intimacy with their partner. 22 People with a history of chemotherapy indicated that CRF made it more difficult to participate in social activities, and to maintain relationships with family and friends. 23 A nurse referral to psychosocial resources, such as support groups, can help the patient cope with the effect of fatigue on quality of life. Through support groups, patients learn new self-management strategies that they can share with others. The selection of a specific psychosocial resource needs to be individualized. 9 Some people with CRF may be open to support group activities and benefit from a group, while others may prefer one-to-one counseling. Attention-restoring activities. People with CRF are often overwhelmed by an overstimulating environment. Their attention is diverted by the many sights, sounds, and objects in the health care environment—alarms, the fast-paced movement of staff, and painful procedures. Consequently, the patient, overburdened by information and environmental distractions, may not understand what’s being said. Bernadine Cimprich pioneered research in attentional fatigue, 1 the decreased capacity to concentrate or direct attention. 24 Natural environments or scenes such as a waterfall, a garden, or a sunrise may restore the patient’s ability to concentrate and comprehend. Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer, who participated in individualized, attention-restoring activities for 30 minutes three times a week, experienced significant improvements in attentional capacity compared to a control group. 11 Following participation in attention-restoring strategies, the person with fatigue may think more clearly and participate more actively in personal care and activities. The implications of Cimprich’s research are significant for providing information and education to people with fatigue and designing more supportive environments for them. Nurses are increasingly aware that the number of people experiencing CRF is rising. Cancer-related fatigue permeates every aspect of daily life: work, family, and social activities. Although more research is required to determine the effectiveness of proposed strategies to prevent and alleviate fatigue, the profound physical, psychological, emotional, and spiritual effect of fatigue demands that nurses intervene now. Nurses can be instrumental in identifying, evaluating, and aiding patients with fatigue to make the transition from passive to more active self-care strategies. Fortunately, more than a trial-and-error approach exists for fatigue management in current clinical practice. CRF theories direct nurses to management strategies such as providing preparatory information, assisting the patient to establish a balance of activity and rest, encouraging use of psychosocial support resources, and recommending attention-restoring activities. Managing CRF effectively requires nurses to thoughtfully and thoroughly pursue strategies that prevent physical deconditioning and allow people with fatigue to continue engaging in meaningful activities.",

      "abstract": "Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a severe chronic pain syndrome characterized by an excruciating, brief electric shock like paroxysmal pain in one or more divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The pain, also known as “tic douloureux”, is paroxystic and very severe. It can be triggered by a light cutaneous stimulus on a much localized spot on the face (the so called “trigger zone”). An early and accurate diagnosis is mandatory, as therapeutic interventions can reduce or eliminate pain attacks. Treatment of this painful condition may be varied, ranging from medical management to surgical interventions. This article deals with the etiopathogenesis, clinical characteristics, diagnosis and drug treatment strategies for trigeminal neuralgia.",

Der Klinikarzt ist gefordert, bei einem anhaltenden Erschöpfungszustand, für welchen er keine alleinige somatische Ursache findet, differenzialdiagnostisch an ein Burnout-Syndrom zu denken. Das gezielte Erfragen von wenigen arbeitsbezogenen Stressoren ist diagnostisch zielführend. Weitere, außerberufliche Stressoren und körperliche und psychische Begleitkrankheiten, können die Burnout-Symptomatik verstärken oder auch als Folge eines Burnout-Syndroms auftreten. Die Übermittlung der \"Verdachtsdiagnose Burnout-Syndrom\" an den Patienten bezweckt eine Chronifizierung mit länger dauerndem Ausfall am Arbeitsplatz und Folgekrankheiten abzuwenden. Für die fachspezifische Therapie sollen Patienten gegebenenfalls in die ambulante oder stationäre psychosomatische Versorgung überwiesen werden.",

      "title": "BURNOUT SYNDROME AS A MANIFESTATION OF TEACHER'S PROFESSIONAL DEFORMATION",
      "abstract": "Professional deformation is the destruction that occurs during work activity and negatively affects its performance. In addition, the destructions generate professionally undesirable qualities changing both professional and personal behaviour. Furthermore, professional deformation has the greatest impact on the personal characteristics of representatives of those professions whose work relates to people (teachers, psychologists, social and medical workers, officials, leaders, police officers, etc.). One of the significant signs related to professional deformation of teachers is the emotional burnout syndrome. Burnout syndrome is viewed as a process of gradual loss of emotional, cognitive and physical energy, which is characterized by the symptoms of emotional and mental exhaustion, as well as physical fatigue, personal isolation, depersonalization, and reduced satisfaction in performance. It is mainly regarded as the result of stress which has not been successfully dealt with at the workplace. Above all, there are three main symptoms of emotional burnout syndrome: extreme exhaustion, detachment from clients (patients, pupils, students) and from work, a sense of inefficiency and lack of achieving high-performance goals. Recent research suggests five key groups of symptoms regarding burnout syndrome. These include both physical, emotional, behavioural, social symptoms and intellectual state. As a result, scientists came to the conclusion that personal, role and organizational factors play an essential role in professional burnout. This paper gives an overview of diagnostic criteria and methods of prevention for burnout syndrome, which are of primary importance for representatives of all professions, especially those who are at risk.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

Yet, excessive daytime sleepiness is not only common, and it often goes unrecognized.

The spectrum of common sleep disorders includes circadian rhythm changes, shiftwork requirements, obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep, also known as insomnia. In many cases, however, sleep deprivation is the choice of the patient, chosen in response to long commutes, academic rigor, or occupational matters. Regardless of the sleep disorder that a patient has, good sleep behavior or \"sleep hygiene\" is essential.",

One might argue that the seven eponymous syndromes of the DSM (Alzheimer's, Asperger's, Creutzfeld-Jakob's, Huntington's, Pick's, Rett's, and Gilles de la Tourette's) require a bit of study before their nature is clarified, but all the others either stem from common English roots (gambling, binge-eating, sleep disorder) or are decipherable from their Greek or Latin origins (trichotillomania: pathological pulling of hair; insomnia: absence of sleep, etc.). Borderline, when used adjectivally, suggests something that is in close proximity to something else. Indeed, in its first uses in psychiatry, borderline designated either (a) a condition that approximated another, already well-established disorder, or (b) a condition that occupied a region in between two rather indistinctly boundaried levels of mental functioning. As we shall see, the borderline of our current BPD is derived from both these usages.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Blunt injuries are caused by mechanical force resulting in damage to the affected tissues mainly due to compression, traction, torsion, and shear stresses. The impact is induced either by a moving blunt object hitting the body or the victim's movement against an obstacle having a hard surface. In forensic practice, injuries from blunt force are often seen after criminal assaults where they may be inflicted, for instance, by fist blows or kicking. They not only occur in physical child abuse and other kinds of domestic violence, in traffic, sports, and industrial accidents but also in falls brought about by the victims themselves for various reasons (e.g., in drunken, infirm, or sick persons or in suicides jumping from a height). On skin, blunt traumatization produces abrasions, contusions (bruises), and lacerations. In some cases, a patterned configuration helps to determine characteristic features of the causative instrument. Within the body, blunt traumatization may be followed by bone fractures and laceration/rupture of vessels and organs with concomitant blood loss and potential failure of vital functions. The article shortly describes and illustrates the most important manifestations of blunt force injuries (including head trauma) under reconstructive aspects and from the medicolegal point of view.",

      "title": "Neurodevelopmental and psychosocial aspects of Turner syndrome",
      "abstract": "Turner syndrome (TS) is the complex phenotype of human females with complete or partial absence of the second sex chromosome, or monosomy X. A characteristic neurocognitive and psychosocial profile has also been described in TS females. Typically, specific deficits in visual-spatial/perceptual abilities, nonverbal memory function, motor function, executive function, and attentional abilities occur in TS children and adults of varying races and socioeconomic status. TS-associated psychosocial difficulties occur in the areas of maturity and social skills. We hypothesize that a subset of the neurocognitive deficits (visual-spatial/perceptual abilities) are genetically determined and result from abnormal expression of one or more X chromosome genes. In addition, a different subset of these neurocognitive deficits (memory, reaction time, and speeded motor function) result from estrogen deficiency and are at least somewhat reversible with estrogen treatment. The TS-associated psychosocial problems are most likely linked to these core neurocognitive deficits and do not reflect a separate and independent component of the syndrome. Turner syndrome research has progressed significantly over the last decade. The field has moved from descriptive reports based on single individuals or small clinical samples to the use of experimental designs with larger, more diverse and representative samples. This degree of variability among individuals with Turner syndrome in all domains (karyotype or genetic constitution, physical attributes, neurocognitive and social functioning) suggests the need to identify risk and protective factors contributing to the heterogeneity in the phenotype. Active education about TS and participation in patient advocacy groups such as the Turner Syndrome Society of the United States (http://www. turner-syndrome-us.org/) has provided new information for TS adults and families as well as a supportive peer group.

      "abstract": "The fundamental cause of trifacial neuralgia lies in some structural change. The really painful tic usually occurs about the period of middle life or later and is generally caused by a lesion or lesions within the teeth. All strain, whether mental or physical (and this comprises that common to all diseases and conditions), which a normal amount of sleep cannot relieve or during which the tissue consumed cannot be restored, these abnormal conditions are the foundations for an earlier degeneration of the nerve structure. No injury to the teeth from external causes, and no injury to the dental pulp from constitutional causes ever repairs itself. That is, should a tooth be broken or decayed it can never be restored by natural means, or should a pulp nodule or dentinal tumor form within the pulp from constitutional causes it will never be absorbed. A normal life should be led more on",

La dismorfofobia o trastorno dismorfico corporal es una enfermedad que produce en los pacientes una preocupacion por algun defecto imaginado del propio fisico, o que si existen algunas anomalias leves, estas producen una preocupacion excesiva que provocan un malestar significativo en el paciente. Es un trastorno sub-diagnosticado que afecta al 1-2% de la poblacion general. El dermatologo es el medico mas consultado por estos pacientes, calculandose que 46% nos consultan, y que 38% reciben algun tratamiento dermatologico. Algunos autores afirman que son los pacientes mas dificiles de tratar porque generalmente no quedan conformes con el resultado cosmetico de los procedimientos que se les realizaron, inclusive tienden a ejercer acciones legales y/o violentas contra el medico, por lo que se recomienda no hacerles ningun procedimiento, e intentar ayuda psiquiatrica. Sin lugar a dudas, debemos aprender a reconocerlos para asi tener una conducta adecuada. Body dysmorphic disorder: a real problem in cosmetic dermatology practice Abstract The cosmetic problems have impregnated intensively the current societies, doing of the cosmetic dermatology a speciality in rapid growth, with a high demand. Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by an excessive preoccupation with a real or imagined defect in your physical appearance. People with body dysmorphic disorder have a distorted or exaggerated view of how they look and are obsessed with actual physical characteristics or perceived flaws, such as a certain facial feature or imperfections of the skin. They often think of themselves as ugly or disfigured. Affects 1-2% total population. The dermatologists are the physicians more visited for this patient, 46% visited us and 38% received a dermatologic treatment. Treatment for body dysmorphic disorder may involve a combined approach involving medication and psychotherapy. Antidepressant medications used along with cognitive behavior therapy can help people with body dysmorphic disorder manage the obsession and anxiety about their appearance, increase confidence in how they look, and obtain normalcy in their social and work lives. Dermatologist have to recognize this patients for prefer not to make any procedure to them, and try psychiatric therapy.",

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with upheavals in personal relationships, through alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-reported because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see Definition and comparability).",

Genetics and epigenetics changes may contribute to a longer or shorter life expectancy. With advancing ageing, there is a decline in both performance and fitness, which is exhibited as frailty (loss of physiological processes and changes in metabolism) as well as cognitive decline. Cognitive changes are characterized by loss of memory, confusion as well as agitation. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), incipient dementia or isolated memory impairment is a brain function syndrome, which involves the onset of cognitive impairment beyond those which might be expected considering the age and education of the individual. This chapter has identified a number of pathways which may enhance lifespan; which include decreased signalling of insulin/insulin-like growth factor ((IGF)-1), an increase expression of sirtuins, increased telomere length and modestly decreased mitochondrial function.",

The source of the dental cause is a dysfunctional relationship between the temperomandibular joint and the dentition or dental prosthesis. The dysfunction (which may have been asymptomatic) is then exacerbated by a behavioral pattern. The usual pattern is simply clenching the teeth in response to pain elsewhere in the body. There are many modifications to this pattern, including biting the incisal edge of the front teeth, grinding the teeth, and biting two particular teeth (eg, cuspids).

      "title": "Procrastination, Perfectionism, and Other Work-Related Mental Problems: Prevalence, Types, Assessment, and Treatment—A Scoping Review",
      "abstract": "Work-related mental problems can be defined as behaviors, emotions and cognitions that impede the successful completion of a task in a given time frame, i. e., the difficulty or inability to achieve important work-related goals. They are highly prevalent but have been neglected in psychology in general and as a target of psychotherapy in particular. Although work-related problems do not represent a mental disorder per se , they are associated with severe distress and high psychosocial costs. In this article, the prevalence of work-related problems, associated burden, diagnostic assessment and treatment are reviewed. So far, research has primarily focused on procrastination, i.e., the act of postponing or delaying tasks until the last minute or past the deadline. However, procrastination represents just one type of work-related problems among several others. Further forms of work-related problems are presented (e.g., perfectionism, or work-related problems in the context of specific personality types). The relation of work-related problems to specific mental disorders is discussed. Psychosocial interventions are the treatment of choice for work-related mental problems. However, response rates for the treatment of procrastination are limited, which calls for further research into which treatments work for whom. No evidence-based treatments are currently available for other types of work-related problems, with the exception of perfectionism, a personality trait that is also linked to problems in the field of work. Thus, there is a need to further improve the treatment of work-related problems including procrastination. For other types of work-related problems, effective treatments need to be developed and validated. They may be based on existing manualized treatments and extended by specific aspects or modules focusing on work-related problems.",

The condition is uncommon, but there has been recent research to suggest that the diagnosis may often be overlooked. Moreover, it is important to be cognizant of this condition because there are reliable diagnostic tests and the disorder can be devastating from a psychosocial perspective.

The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines trigeminal neuralgia as a sudden, usually unilateral, severe, brief, stabbing, recurrent pain in the distribution of one or more branches of the fifth cranial nerve. Typically, brief attacks of pain are triggered by talking, chewing, brushing teeth, and shaving, applying make-up or even a slight breeze. Generally, it is a clinical diagnosis, although imaging may be necessary to exclude other pathology.",

      "abstract": "Electric current can damage an individual by thermal heating of the tissues; by disregulating autonomously functioning organ systems, such as the circulatory and respiratory systems; or by once-only or continuing stimulation of the nerves and striated muscles. In the first case, the result is coagulation necrosis, and in the second case life-threatening events can occur, such as arrhythmia or apnea. In the third case, vigorous nerve stimulation can lead to paralysis and vasospasm. Massive muscle contractions due to nerve stimulation or the direct triggering of striated muscles can cause ruptures, ligamentous tears, fractures, and joint dislocations, while prolonged current passing through the thoracic wall may stimulate tetany of the intercostal muscles and diaphragm resulting in asphyxia. This article is confined to a description of thermal or Joule heating of tissues when they form part of an electric circuit and to the effects of direct nerve and muscle stimulation. Other articles discuss nonthermal effects. The injuries a person sustains as the result of an electrical accident depend on a large number of interrelated factors, such as the properties of the electrical power supply, the magnitude and duration of current flow, the current pathway, and skin conditions. It makes a vast difference whether a person is hit by a lightning bolt (extremely high voltage, short current flow) or receives a shock from an electrical power supply (low to high voltage, relatively long current flow). Wide variation in the physical properties of lightning discharges and the discharges from electrical power supplies at home and in industry means that all kinds of injuries can be encountered.",

Sleep disturbances are also frequently reported following TBI, and may contribute to fatigue. Fatigue may also limit energy for social interactions and/or recreational pursuits, resulting in withdrawal, greater time spent at home and consequent social isolation. Fatigue may be a symptom of depression and depression in turn may cause sleep disruption and fatigue. Fatigue may be associated with muscle weakness or other changes or injuries in the peripheral nervous system. The subjective experience of fatigue is likely to be determined by the complex interaction of functional disability with lifestyle demands, which is difficult to quantify and idiosyncratic. Like fatigue, sleep disturbances have also been associated with pain, depression and anxiety. Bright Light Therapy represents another potential treatment for fatigue and daytime sleepiness.",

Primary psychiatric disorders involve psychiatric conditions that result in self-induced cutaneous manifestations, such as trichotillomania and delusions of parasitosis. Secondary psychiatric disorders are associated with disfiguring skin disorders. The disfigurement results in psychologic problems, such as decreased self-esteem, depression or social phobia. Most psychodermatologic disorders can be treated with anxiety-decreasing techniques or, in extreme cases, psychotropic medications.",

      "title": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a common (lifetime prevalence of about 2%; Buhlmann et al. 2010) and often severe disorder whose core feature is preoccupation with one or more nonexistent or slight defects in one's physical appearance. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in psychosocial functioning, and it is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual who meets diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder (American Psychiatric Association 2013) (see Box 22- ). Insight regarding the perceived flaws (e.g., \"I look ugly\") is usually absent or poor; most individuals are completely or mostly convinced that their view of their perceived deformities is accurate (Phillips et al. 2012). All persons with BDD, at some point during the illness, perform compulsive behaviors aimed at checking, fixing, hiding, or obtaining reassurance about the perceived appearance defects (Phillips et al. 2005a). BDD is characterized by poor psychosocial functioning and high rates of suicidality (Buhlmann et al. 2010; Phillips et al. 2005b, 2008; Veale et al. 1996a), yet BDD usually goes undiagnosed in clinical settings (Conroy et al. 2008; Grant et al. 2001). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder 300.7 F45.22 Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in response to the appearance concerns. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. Specify if: With muscle dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, which is often the case. Specify if: Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., \"I look ugly\" or \"I look deformed\"). With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true. With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are probably true. With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true. Believing that they look ugly or abnormal, many patients seek and receive cosmetic treatment. Studies from psychiatry settings have found that about two-thirds of patients with BDD receive surgery or dermatological, dental, or other cosmetic treatment for their perceived flaws (Crerand et al. 2005; Phillips et al. 2001a). In one study ( N = 250), only 7% of such treatments led to overall improvement in BDD (Phillips et al. 2001a), and in another study ( N = 200), only 4% of procedures improved overall BDD symptoms (Crerand et al. 2005). These outcome data are retrospective but concur with data from a small prospective study (Tignol et al. 2007). In a survey of cosmetic surgeons, 40% reported that a patient with BDD had threatened them legally or physically (Sarwer 2002). Such reports underscore the critical importance of diagnosing BDD and implementing psychiatric treatment. Before beginning treatment, it is important to lay essential groundwork, with the goal of engaging patients, establishing a therapeutic alliance, and instilling hope. Because most patients have poor or absent insight, they may doubt that they have BDD and that psychiatric treatment can help. Psychoeducation about BDD should be provided, including the fact that it is a common and treatable disorder. Patients may benefit from reading about BDD (e.g., Phillips 2009). Trying to convince or reassure patients with poor or absent insight that they look normal is usually ineffective (one cannot impose insight), and patients typically misinterpret comments about their appearance, even if positive or reassuring, in a negative way. On the other hand, it is important not to agree with patients' negative view of their appearance because this may be devastating to them. It is helpful to empathize with patients' feelings and to focus on the likelihood that psychiatric treatment will improve their distress, preoccupation, and functioning.",

Their thoughts can be scattered and require significant effort to organize, often resulting in sentences that do not come out as intended, making little sense to others. Methods： Two Patients with psychasthenia are unable to resist specific actions or thoughts, regardless of their maladaptive nature and have insufficient control over their conscious thinking and memory, sometimes wandering aimlessly and/or forgetting what they were doing. Results： The constant mental effort induces physiological fatigue, which worsens the condition. Nevertheless, psychasthenia has become a forgotten disorder. We observed two cases that are worthy of the original definition of psychasthenia.

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

      "title": "Gelotophobia: The fear of being laughed at",
      "abstract": "Abstract Gelotophobia may be considered as a specific variant of shame-bound anxiety. It is defined as the pathological fear of being an object of laughter. This fear can be traced back to early childhood experiences of intense and repeated exposure to “put-down,” mockery and ridicule in the course of socialization. Gelotophobes constantly fear being screened by others for evidence of ridiculousness. Thus, they carefully avoid situations in which they feel exposed to others. Gelotophobia at its extreme, therefore, involves a pronounced paranoid tendency, a marked sensitivity to offense, and a resulting social withdrawal (Titze, Die heilende Kraft des Lachens, 1995, Humor &amp; Health Journal 5:1–11, 1996). The origins and consequences of gelotophobia are described, and a model of specific treatment is presented.",

      "abstract": "Occasionally, in the medical literature, attempted or successful suicides during interferon therapy are reported. We report a case of a 32-year-old man who developed a psychotic syndrome with attempted suicide at the third month of treatment. The cessation of interferon and an appropriate psychiatric therapy determined a complete remission of symptoms. A medical literature review, through several computerized searches, showed a lack of research into the subject. The main conclusion of our article emphasizes the importance of recognizing the early neuropsychiatric symptoms, that are reversible at the cessation of treatment.",

      "abstract": "The development of hair loss associated with headgear use is a rare phenomenon. Pressure alopecia is a condition characterised by localised, non-scarring hair loss attributed to a mechanical cause. Factors such as prolonged periods of peri- and postoperative immobility have been implicated, as well as immunological and genetic predisposing factors. If the mechanical trauma is very prolonged, there is a risk of permanent follicle damage due to tissue hypoxia. A 13-year-old boy wore high-pull headgear as part of his orthodontic management. Within four weeks of headgear wear, localised areas of hair loss were seen corresponding with the areas of contact with the force delivery modules of the headgear. The patient experienced bullying at school as a result of this hair loss. Hair regrowth resumed after headgear use was discontinued, therefore confirming the diagnosis of temporary pressure alopecia. Temporary pressure alopecia is a rare side effect of orthodontic headgear. Alopecia can negatively impact an individual's psychosocial wellbeing; therefore, caution should be taken to avoid prolonged or excessive pressure in susceptible individuals and headgear patients should be regularly monitored.",

      "abstract": "Burnout, a phenomenon that has been widely acknowledged as an important issue among people helping professionals, still lacks both precise theoretical foundations and substantial empirical support. Its conceptual and operational definitions vary widely. The broadcast definitions equate Burnout with stress, connect it with a long list of adverse health and well being variables and suggest that it is caused by relentless pursuit of success. Burnout has been related to human service professions with chronic inter-personal stress as its caused (Maslach and Jackson, 1981). It is conceived as a state of mental, physical and emotional exhaustion, typically occurring as a result of long-term involvement with people in situations, which are emotionally demanding. Burnout can be defined as the end result of stress experienced, but not properly coped with resulting in symptoms of exhaustion, irritation, ineffectiveness, discounting of self, others and problems of health (Hypertension, Ulcers and Heart Problems).",

      "title": "How does multiple trauma, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI) affect male sexual functioning?",
      "abstract": "Sex is an important part of life for many people, therefore dealing with erectile problems, living with the effects of physical injury, changes in your appearance or side-effects of treatment can have an enormous impact on your sex life and relationships. Normal sexual behaviour and erectile function depends on a complex interaction between various body-systems, including the brain, nerves, blood-supply and hormones. All of these systems (alone or in combination) may be affected following multiple trauma, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI). For men, trauma may result in problems with achieving or maintaining erections (commonly referred to as erectile dysfunction; ED), problems with ejaculation, or how they think/feel about sex - all of these problems may have an indirect, if not profound impact on long-term functional recovery and overall quality of life. Following multiple trauma, spinal injury, or TBI, it is not unusual for some men to go through a period of reduced sexual drive (reduced libido). Apart from physical effects of injury, the way the body responds sexually also depends on thoughts and feelings – thoughts and feelings about yourself and others may be influenced by changes in mood, motivation, personality and thought-processes. This may be complicated by depression, emotional trauma following the injury, medication, or changes in hormone levels. As some men grapple with the changes and implications associated with their injury, many may initially ignore the importance of sexual difficulties, as they remain focused on physical rehabilitation and recovery of mobility. Other men may be reluctant to acknowledge sexual difficulties, due to cultural or personal reasons. There are a wide range of treatments and interventions that may be helpful for the man and his partner, which is why assessment of sexual function should be routinely incorporated into rehabilitation and follow-up services for trauma-survivors. The information below describes common sexual problems after TBI, SCI or multiple trauma and ways to improve sexual functioning.",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "title": "PIK3CA-Related Segmental Overgrowth",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth includes disorders of brain (e.g., MCAP [megalencephaly-capillary malformation] syndrome, hemimegalencephaly); and segmental body overgrowth (e.g., CLOVES [congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies] syndrome, fibroadipose hyperplasia [FH]). Heterozygous (usually somatic mosaic) pathogenic variants of PIK3CA are causative. MCAP syndrome is characterized by the major findings of (1) megalencephaly (MEG) or hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) associated with neurologic findings of hypotonia, seizures, and mild to severe intellectual disability; and (2) cutaneous capillary malformations with focal or generalized somatic overgrowth. Additional findings can include digital anomalies (syndactyly, polydactyly), cortical malformations – most distinctively polymicrogyria (PMG); and variable connective tissue dysplasia. CLOVES (or CLOVE) syndrome and fibroadipose hyperplasia (FH) may be associated with (1) MEG or HMEG; and (2) patchy segmental overgrowth associated with skeletal anomalies, lipomatosis, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi. Diagnosis/testing PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is confirmed in an individual with a pathogenic variant on one PIK3CA allele, typically in affected tissues. Because the vast majority of PIK3CA pathogenic variants arise postzygotic (and are thus mosaic), more than one tissue may need to be tested. Failure to detect a PIK3CA pathogenic variant does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of the PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth disorders in individuals with suggestive features. Management Treatment of manifestations: Significant or lipomatous segmental overgrowth may require debulking; scoliosis and leg-length discrepancy may require orthopedic care and surgical intervention. Neurologic complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, progressive and/or symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar ectopia or Chiari malformation; epilepsy in those with HMEG) may warrant neurosurgical intervention. Routine treatment of the following, when present, is indicated: cardiac and renal abnormalities; intellectual disabilities and behavior problems; motor difficulties; speech, swallowing, and feeding difficulties. Surveillance: MCAP syndrome: Follow up no less than every six months until age six years and at least yearly thereafter to monitor for neurosurgical complications, breathing or sleep disorders, seizures and orthopedic complications. Provisionally recommended imaging in early childhood includes brain MRI every six months for the first two years, then yearly until age eight years for neurologic complications (e.g., hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia). Consider screening for Wilms tumor following the protocol suggested for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) (by ultrasound examination every 3 months until age 8 years); however, tumor risk in PIK3CA-related segmental overgrowth is undetermined and appears to be lower than in BWS. CLOVES syndrome and FH: Monitoring for severe scoliosis, infiltrative lipomatous overgrowth, paraspinal high-flow lesions with spinal cord ischemia, lymphatic malformations, cutaneous vesicles, orthopedic problems, central phlebectasias, and thromboembolism. Genetic counseling PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is not typically inherited. Most affected individuals with MCAP reported to date (21/24) had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA, suggesting that mutation occurred post-fertilization in one cell of the multicellular embryo. Two of 24 affected individuals had a de novo germline pathogenic variant in PIK3CA. All reported individuals with CLOVES and FH had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA. No confirmed instances of vertical transmission or sib recurrence have been reported. Because family members are not known to have an increased risk, prenatal diagnosis is usually not indicated for family members.",

      "title": "What Do Patients Want in the Treatment of Major Depressive Disorder? Taiwan’s TAILOR Survey",
      "abstract": "In Taiwan, the number of patients being treated for depression has been increasing over recent decades, but there remain some key unmet needs for these patients. One issue is the low rate of help-seeking, which may be at least partially attributable to the stigma of depression in Asian societies. Stigma also contributes to underdiagnosis, because stigmatised patients may emphasise somatic symptoms (e.g. lethargy/fatigue, sleep disorders or changes in appetite), fearing how they will be perceived if they discuss psychological symptoms with their physician. Underdiagnosis may also result from cross-cultural differences, because assessment scales and screening tools are usually developed in Western populations and may not have the same validity in Asian patients. Depression in Taiwan appears to be undertreated, with a high rate of suboptimal antidepressant dosages and inadequate duration of therapy. Patients may discontinue treatment earlier than recommended for a number of reasons related to their own beliefs about treatment, their relationship with their physicians, or the effects of the medication (adverse effects, slow onset of effect, or lack of effect on comorbid symptoms). Moreover, frequently there is discordance between how patients and physicians define treatment success in depression. Patients are more likely to achieve a benefit from treatment which remains persistent when physicians and patients are closely aligned on treatment goals. To better understand the experiences, preferences and attitudes of patients with depression in Taiwan, the Target Antidepressant Initiation choice to unLock positive patient Outcomes and Response (TAILOR) survey was conducted in 340 adult outpatients receiving treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). The results of the TAILOR survey highlight the personal and perceived stigma of depression, current barriers to seeking help and maintaining treatment, and opportunities to improve shared decision-making, medication adherence and clinical outcomes for Taiwanese patients with MDD.",

Today, occupational stress has become an epidemic spreading like wildfire. Organizations lose much money in stress-related accidents, lost productivity, absenteeism, and medical insurance costs. Physical symptoms of occupational stress are: headaches, digestive problems, sleep deprivation, rashes or hives, heartburn, night sweats, diminished sexual desire, menstrual irregularities, chronic back pain, muscle tensions, loss of appetite, weight gain. Emotional or mental symptoms of occupational stress are: increased anger, frustration, depression, moodiness, anxiousness, problems with memory, fatigue, and increased use of nicotine, alcohol and drugs. Work related symptoms are: increased absenteeism, accidents on the job, and complaints from coworkers, decrease in work productivity, and difficulty in understanding office procedures, job absenteeism, and taking long coffee breaks, excessive personal time on the telephone or internet. Many attempts have been made to identify causes of stressful job events. There are essentially three different, but overlapping, approaches to the definition and study of stress. The engineering and physiological approaches are obvious among the earlier theories of stress, while the more psychological approaches characterize contemporary stress theory.",

      "abstract": "Recognition of tics is essential not only in the diagnosis of Tourette syndrome (TS), the most common cause of tics, but also in the diagnosis of other neurological disorders in which tics may occur as one clinical manifestation. The current diagnostic criteria for TS exclude other causes of tics (1,2). Because tics may be confused with other hyperkinetic movement disorders, it is imperative that the full spectrum of phenomenology of tics is appreciated. Tics are characterized by abrupt, repetitive movements (motor tics) or sounds (phonic tics), commonly preceded by a premonitory sensation of an urge, tension, discomfort, or other sensory phenomena (3,4). Motor tics may be classified as either (1) simple tics, involving only one group of muscles, or (2) complex tics, which are coordinated, sequenced movements resembling normal motor acts or gestures (5). Simple motor tics are further classified by frequency and duration of the muscle contraction into clonic, dystonic, or tonic.Clonic tics are abrupt, brief, rapid, jerklikemovements, suchas excessive blinking andother facial twitches or head andneck jerks. Tics involving briefly sustained muscle contractions have been classified as dystonic and tonic tics. Dystonic tics consist of associated twisting or gyrating motions such as oculogyric or rotatory shoulder movements. Tonic tics involve isometric contractions such as abdominal or limb tensing. Blocking tics, manifested by either start hesitation or a sudden interruption in the normal flowof speech,MD: KURLAN, JOB: 03329, PAGE:MD: KURLAN, JOB: 03329, PAGE:are often associated with isometric contractions of abdominal muscles producingaValsavamaneuver (forcible exhalationagainst a closed glottis),which results in a sudden interruption and cessation of speech (6).",

      "abstract": "The author, largely from a clinical standpoint, discusses the various ideas of negation. He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Sexual dysfunction in men may be related to multiple factors according to the type of sexual problems (e.g. low desire, erectile, or ejaculatory disturbances). Organic and psychological factors both contribute to the development of male sexual dysfunction. Among organic causes, endocrine disorders (the most important of which is hypogonadism) may contribute to the occurrence of male sexual dysfunction, but are much less frequent than other organic causes (i.e. vascular, neurological, and drug-induced). Clinical assessment (including a sexual history) is important for identifying patients with hormonal (e.g. testosterone deficiency) or other disorders (e.g. vascular or neurological) who may present with symptomatic sexual dysfunction. The aetiology(ies) underlying the sexual dysfunction will guide the most appropriate treatment in individual cases. Management of male sexual dysfunction may include psychological counselling, pharmacological therapy (e.g. PDE5Is), surgery, and testosterone replacement therapy in cases of well-documented hypogonadism. Despite the recent improvements due to the use of PDE5Is, in the management of erectile dysfunction remains largely unsatisfactory for a significant proportion of patients so there is still a major treatment gap and challenge ahead.",

      "abstract": "Advances in neuroscience and pharmacology have led to improvements in the cognitive performance of people with neurological disease and other forms of cognitive decline. These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

      "title": "Clinical Effectiveness of Tofrānil in the Treatment of Depressive Psychoses",
      "abstract": "FrenchDeux hypothèses opposées continuent à embrouiller le traitement pharmacologique des psychoses dépressives:1° La dépression résulte d'une déficience biochimique, marquée par la diminution de l'énergie psychocinétique. Elle doit être traitée par des méthodes stimulantes et énergétiques.2° Les états dépressifs sont des troubles multidimensionnels des fonctions psycho-biologiques. Il est impossible de les exprimer sous la forme d'un simple antagonisme.L'étude clinique des effets du Tofrānil a fait supposer dès le début que ce corps exerçait une activité sélective sur les syndromes dépressifs. On observe rarement une action mentale spécifique, au sens d'un syndrome psycho-affectif provoqué par la médication. Ni l'euphorie, ni la stimulation psychocinétique ne marchent régulièrement de pair avec les effets du Tofrānil sur le cerveau. La caractéristique thérapeutique de ce corps est une dissolution du syndrome dépressif, et une restauration de l'état affectif normal.Un fait étonnant est que le spectre de cette activité thérapeutique demeure discontinu. Alors que, dès le début des recherches, il a paru évident que le Tofrānil exerce son action optimale sur les dépressions accompagnées d'inhibition, on ne peut pas toujours escompter le résultat du traitement, du fait que certains sujets avec symptômes d'inhibition typiques ne sont nullement améliorés, tandis que d'autres voient leur état se modifier de façon impressionnante.L'attention des chercheurs s'est concentrée sur l'identification des facteurs psychopathologiques qui semblent particulièrement sensibles à l'action du Tofrānil. De tels symptômes ont été sélectionnés tant dans le domaine du comportement, que sur le plan psychosomatique et le plan expérimental. Au für et à mesure des progrès de la thérapeutique, il a été possible de préciser les signes, ou les groupes de signes, susceptibles de modification, ainsi que ceux qui demeuraient réfractaires au traitement. Les appréciations finales sont basées sur l'élimination totale ou partielle des symptômes-clés. Cette analyse phénoménologique s'est avérée très précieuse dans les recherches psychopharmacologiques entreprises pour identifier les effets différentiels des agents thérapeutiques.L'auteur cherche ensuite à déterminer si l'action thérapeutique est suspensive, correctrice ou préventive. Le matériel clinique comporte en première ligne des malades atteints de psychoses dépressives et hospitalisés. Il englobe, en outre, un groupe de patients en traitement ambulatoire, dont l'anamnèse présente de fréquents accès de dépression. L'auteur cherche, pour finir, à répondre à la question de savoir si les indications relatives du Tofrānil et du traitement électroconvulsif peuvent être formulées. Il se base pour cela sur des expériences de thérapeutique comparée, entreprises avec le même matériel clinique.",

Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

During a prolonged stay in an intensive care unit, muscular atrophy is systematic and involved in several functional consequences. The causes include the bedrest itself, alterations in the neural drive, hormonal changes, and a lower efficacy of the energetic substrates. The importance of the sarcopenia can be assessed by repeated clinical evaluations and by the ratio of the urinary concentrations of 3-methylhistidine-to-creatinine, an index of the breakdown of myofibrils.

      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

In elderly, loss of motivation blunts the intensity of moral pain. Depressions with conative disorders can move in a dysexecutive syndrome. Even if, owing to the treatment, the cognitive disorders disappear, several years after, an authentic dementia can be diagnosed. With aging process, elderly must cope with losses, less or more balanced: affective, physical and financial losses, triggering the reject of any personal commitment. Aging process also concerns brain amines, especially dopamine, exposing old persons to depression. It alters by a similar way others brain neuro-mediator, such acetylcholine, involved in dementia. Both loss motivation and executive disorders have to be systematically assessed. An antidepressant therapeutic is necessary in case of doubt, improving patients thymic status, quality of life of patients and their family, and sometime of frontal dysfunctions.",

      "abstract": "The thyroid gland which is also known as the butterfly gland due to its butterfly shaped. It makes the triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) hormones, which operates as chemical 'messengers', travelling through the bloodstream to all the cells and tissues in the body and maintaining the speed at which our body works, which is also called 'metabolism'. In some people, the thyroid gland doesn't work properly. An underactive thyroid gland can lead to too little thyroid hormone being made, which is called hypothyroidism. Others can have an overactive thyroid gland, where thyroid hormone levels are too high, which is called hyperthyroidism. These are the two main types of thyroid disease. Hypothyroidism causes the body's metabolism to slow down. Weight gain, weariness, memory issues, movements and thoughts, sluggish speech, anxiety, and concentration problems are all possible symptoms. Hyperthyroidism, on the other hand, causes the body's metabolism to speed up. This causes a variety of symptoms, including a racing heartbeat, weight loss, diarrhoea, thirst, feeling sweaty and trembling, feeling excessively hot, and so on. There are ample of techniques through which this can be solved, which includes machine learning and deep learning techniques. The main aim of the paper is to find a novel accuracy which could be used by the researchers using deep neural network.",

Their thoughts can be scattered and require significant effort to organize, often resulting in sentences that do not come out as intended, making little sense to others. Methods : Two Patients with psychasthenia are unable to resist specific actions or thoughts, regardless of their maladaptive nature and have insufficient control over their conscious thinking and memory, sometimes wandering aimlessly and/or forgetting what they were doing. Results : The constant mental effort induces physiological fatigue, which worsens the condition. Nevertheless, psychasthenia has become a forgotten disorder. We observed two cases that are worthy of the original definition of psychasthenia. Conclusions : It can be concluded that patients with psychasthenia complain of sinking because of a reduction in psychological tension or an effort to recover the reduction in tension.",

Surgery in adults provides seizure freedom in only one third of patients. The poor results of epilepsy surgery could be explained by an extrahypothalamic epileptogenic zone. The existence of an independent, secondary epileptogenic area with persistent seizures after resection of the presumably primary lesion supports the concept of a \"hypothalamic plus\" epilepsy. \"Hypothalamic plus\" epilepsy could be related to either an extrahypothalamic structural lesion (visible on magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or on neuropathology) or if the former is absent, to a functional alteration with enhanced epileptogenic properties due to a process termed secondary epileptogenesis. We report two patients with gelastic seizures with HH (gelastic seizures isolated or associated with dyscognitive seizures of temporal origin). Both patients underwent two-step surgery: first an endoscopic resection of the HH, followed at a later time by temporal lobectomy. Both patients became seizure-free only after the temporal lobectomy. In both cases, neuropathology failed to demonstrate a significant structural lesion in the temporal lobe. To our knowledge, for the first time, these two cases suggest the existence of independent secondary epileptogenesis in humans.",

Despite being a term coined by Rebora back in 1996 to described patients with diffuse alopecia consistent with telogen effluvium, this symptom has currently been reported in other entities. Androgenic alopecia, scarring alopecia, alopecia areata, trichotillomania, and chemotherapy-induced alopecia are common causes of trichodynia. Similarly, its association with psychiatric comorbidities, including depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and somatoform disorders has been reported with a higher prevalence among women. Although its pathogenesis is still to be elucidate, some factors involved are substance P, psychiatric comorbidities and perifollicular inflammation. Clinically it exhibits pain or discomfort of the scalp, almost always in association with hair los. The sensation of pain can occur throughout the scalp or locally in some specific areas. Diagnosis is clinical and one of exclusion. Regarding treatment, there are no specific therapies for trichodynia. However, the use of botulinum toxin A, antidepressants, neuromodulators, propanolol, topical corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids and topical cannabinoids are therapeutic alternatives that should be taken into consideration. Since treatment of trichodynia is still therapeutically challenging for dermatologists more prospective studies are needed to evaluate new therapies.",

It occurs when there is persistent psychological maltreatment, leading to an adverse effect on the child. Abuse can happen in many environments, but frequently within the home. It can be active, for example rejection or exploitation, or passive, including emotional unavailability or negative interactions. Signs of emotional abuse can be subtle and age-dependent. Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

      "abstract": "A 37 year old woman presented to her general practitioner with a two month history of low mood, poor sleep, and irritability. She was initially treated for depression with sertraline. Her mood improved slightly over six weeks, but, because of continued insomnia and irritability, her medication was changed to citalopram, with no further improvement. Through regular review and the building of a trusting relationship with her doctor, the patient felt able to disclose that she was experiencing intrusive images of past domestic violence. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and referred for trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy; over 15 sessions, this led to a substantial reduction in her symptoms. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe, prolonged, and impairing psychological reaction to a distressing event. The precipitating incident must be “exceptionally threatening or catastrophic”1 and can range from interpersonal violence and combat to accidents and natural disasters; sexual violence is a particularly potent cause.2 Serious illnesses or medical interventions can also precipitate PTSD if the individual perceived their own or someone else’s health or life to be under threat. The individual repeatedly relives the event through intrusive imagery, bodily re-experiencing, nightmares, and flashbacks. Irritability, insomnia, and other symptoms related to increased arousal also occur. Sufferers usually have difficulty remembering aspects of the event and avoid reminders of it (see box of diagnostic criteria). Children may act out the traumatic event through repetitive play, drawings, and stories, and have frightening dreams without recognisable content.3 Adolescents with PTSD can show aggressive or withdrawn behaviour and can find it difficult to relate to their peers. #### Diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision) classification of mental and behavioural disorders1)",

A second reason may be that forms of depression that are not clinically signifi cant, but that are more severe than simple feelings of sadness (i.e., subclinical depression), are not uncommon. A third reason probably refl ects the diversity of depression. For example, DSM–IV–TR lists 10 different types of mood disorder. Depression is common both in experience and in defi nition.",

For example, trauma is known to precipitate seizures, headache, or focal neurological deficits in previously asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, psychological stress seems to be a factor in the development of some peptic ulcers, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric states. In addition, trauma and/or stress have been suspected to have links to many other medical disorders. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both physical trauma and psychological stress have been posited to be causal factors in either the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS).

B. beim Rasieren oder der Zahnpflege, getriggert werden. Die Beschwerden sind oft stark behindernd oder beeinträchtigen die Lebensqualität und können – bei Fehlinterpretation – zu unnötigen Zahnbehandlungen führen. Als häufigste Ursache wird ein neurovaskulärer Kontakt zwischen einem meist arteriellen Gefäß (A. cerebelli superior oder A. cerebelli anterior inferior) und der Nervenwurzel des N. trigeminus nahe der Eintrittszone in den Hirnstamm angesehen. Der genaue Pathomechanismus ist nicht hinreichend geklärt. Favorisierte Hypothesen sind zum einen eine mechanische Schädigung der Myelinscheiden mit Beeinträchtigung derer isolierender Funktion, was zu überspringenden Erregungen zwischen benachbarten Axonen, sogenannten Ephapsen, führt. Zum anderen wird postuliert, dass die pulsatile mechanische Reizung des Nervens eine zentrale Dysregulation mit Disinhibition des nozizeptiven Systems bewirkt.",

      "title": "Hyposalivation Strongly Influences Hypogeusia in the Elderly",
      "abstract": "Aging is sometimes associated with decreased sensitivity to tastants, i.e., hypogeusia. The loss of taste sense induces not only the decreased quality of life (QOL), but also weight loss or health problems in the elderly. In our recent study, whole saliva secretion including minor salivary secretion, was found to be significantly decreased in the elderly with gustatory impairment, while it was normal in all of the elderly with normal taste thresholds, indicating that hyposalivation is closely related to hypogeusia. Moreover, clinical studies have shown that treatment for hyposalivation alleviates hypogeusia, even that due to the side effects of prescribed drugs or the effects of disease, e.g., nervous disorders or endocrine disorders. Thus, salivation is essential for maintenance of the normal taste function. Many medications for relief of dry mouth, primarily parasympathomimetic drugs, have serious adverse effects such as palpitation, sweating, nausea, diarrhea or dizziness, particularly in the elderly. To circumvent this problem, we use glutamate (umami taste) in an attempt to increase salivary secretion and to alleviate hypogeusia. An umami stimulus might be an effective method for the alleviation of hypogeusia through improvement of hyposalivation or dry mouth without side effects in aged patients. Consequently, attempts should be made to remedy hypogeusia by alleviation of hyposalivation so as to maintain and promote the health of the elderly.",

      "title": "Overtraining Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Definitions Functional overreaching (FOR): intensified training results in a temporary decline in performance. When appropriate periods of recovery are provided, a positive \"supercompensation\" effect occurs, with the athlete exhibiting enhanced performance. Nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR): an accumulation of training and/or nontraining stress resulting in short-term decrement in performance capacity with or without related physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of maladaptation in which restoration of performance capacity may take from several days to several weeks. Overtraining syndrome (OTS): same as NFOR, except decrement is long-term and restoration takes several weeks or months. Key point: the difference between NFOR and OTS is the amount of time needed for performance restoration; therefore, the diagnosis of OTS can often only be made retrospectively (3). Pathophysiology Unknown, biochemical/hormonal hypotheses include the following: glycogen depletion, central fatigue/branched chain fatty acid depletion, glutamine depletion/immune dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, oxidative stress, hypothalamic dysregulation, and cytokine release/inflammation (1,2). The mechanism triggering these changes often involves a training error that results in imbalance between energy expenditure load and recovery. This typically occurs in combination with a complex set of psychological factors and environmental stressors (e.g., monotony of training, excessive competitions, sleep disturbances, interpersonal difficulties, academic/occupational stressors, illness, altitude exposure, heat or cold injury, etc.). Epidemiology Most commonly seen in endurance events such as swimming, cycling, or running Prevalence and incidence data for true OTS are lacking; the lifetime prevalence of NFOR/OTS is estimated to be approximately 30% for nonelite endurance athletes and 60% for elite athletes (2,3). Important Differential Diagnoses NFOR/OTS is a diagnosis of exclusion (1). Common: caffeine withdrawal, environmental allergies, exercise-induced bronchospasm, infectious mononucleosis, insufficient sleep, anemia, performance anxiety, inadequate carbohydrate or protein intake, mood disorder, psychosocial stress, upper respiratory infection. Less common: dehydration, diabetes mellitus, eating disorder, hepatitis, hypothyroidism, lower respiratory infection, medication side effect (antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihistamine, β-blocker), post-concussive syndrome, pregnancy, substance abuse. Rare but important: adrenocortical insufficiency or excess, congenital or acquired heart disease, arrhythmia, bacterial endocarditis, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, human immunodeficiency virus, malabsorption syndrome, chronic lung disease, Lyme disease, malaria, malignancy, neuromuscular disorder, chronic renal disease, syphilis. Evaluation Thorough history including chief complaint, training program, diet, medications, nutrition, illness, review of systems, and assessment of training goals. Hallmark feature in history: athletes with NFOR/OTS are usually able to start a normal training sequence or a race at their normal pace but are not able to complete the training load they are given or race as usual (3). Initial laboratory examinations: complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate/C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, iron studies, creatine kinase, urinalysis, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. Consider monospot, hepatitis panel, Lyme titer, toxicology screen, and chest x-ray. Prescribe absolute rest for 2 wk. ○ If mood is adversely affected with full rest, consider relative rest with well-defined expectations. If improved at follow-up, focus on adjustments to training and prevention (as follows). If no improvement, consider NFOR/OTS: ○ Will require prolonged training rest and further workup ○ Consider consulting with a sports psychologist and nutritionist. ○ Sequence of advancing activity should focus on frequency, then duration, then intensity (1,2). Monitoring Monitor performance in time trials and standard exercise challenges. There are currently no good practical biomarkers for NFOR/OTS (2). Psychiatric indicators may be most useful. Examples include the Profile of Mood States and Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (1). A two-bout maximal exercise protocol has shown differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response for athletes with FOR, NFOR, and OTS and may have prognostic value (2). Prevention Considerations for coaches, athletic trainers, and health care providers (2,3): Maintain accurate records of performance and encourage athletes to keep a diary of training load. Emphasize adequate rest and \"time out\" periods when performance declines, when an athlete complains of fatigue, or after illness or injury. Individualize and supervise training program. Avoid monotony of training. Encourage and reinforce optimal nutrition, hydration, and sleep. Be aware of life stressors, and communicate with athletes about physical, mental, and emotional concerns. Consider regular psychological questionnaires. Schedule regular health checks with a multidisciplinary team.",

The second aspect of psychosomatic medicine suggests that specific somatic diseases are influenced by mental states. Thus, peptic ulcer is aggravated when the patient is distressed or under tension and apt to be improved during periods of physical and emotional relaxation. The third consideration is the one that is least established, but nevertheless the most discussed recently.

Symptomatic hypotension (almost always with a blood pressure fall ^ 20/10 mm Hg) may reflect unrecognized medication effects or a variety of other causes. Autonomic neuropathies include those secondary to diabetes, peripheral autonomic impairment (the Bradbury-Eggleston syndrome), central autonomic impairment (the Shy-Drager syndrome), or newly described gene defects such as dopamine-β-hydroxylase deficiency (which causes the absence of norepinephrine with an accumulation of dopa-mine). Baroreceptor dysfunction causes wide swings in blood pressure that are unrelated to posture, whereas a variety of stimuli (cough, micturition, or carotid sinus pressure) may precipitate paroxysmal parasympathetic activation, and sympathetic orthostatic hypotension associated with hypovolemia may occur with mitral valve prolapse or as an idiopathic condition.

Thirty years ago, the term “burnout” was coined to describe this state of frustration and fatigue among health and service workers, which arose from excessive demands on their resources.1 Burnout syndrome has primarily been described as a multidimensional process with three central constructs: Emotional Exhaustion or “EE” (feeling emotionally drained and exhausted by one's work), Depersonalization or “DP” (negative or very detached feelings toward clients or patients), and Reduced Personal Accomplishment or “PA” (evaluating oneself negatively and feeling dissatisfied with positive job performance and achievements).2 Burnout is different from stress in that while stress is acute, burnout tends to be chronic and is exacerbated by an accumulation of emotional and interpersonal stressors on the job.2 Burnout is relevant for both healthcare personnel as well as for the patients they serve as it has been associated with negative consequences for both groups.3,4 Burnout can result in decreased morale and increased physician turnover, as well as poor judgment in patient care decision making, increased medical errors, diminished dedication, decreased quality of care, and reduced patient safety all of which can have consequences. It is important for the culture of medicine, for healthcare workers, and for patients, that burnout be identified in practice and its symptoms alleviated. Physicians and healthcare workers are able to provide a higher standard of care when their work satisfaction is high.4 The burden of burnout in healthcare providers is significant. In fact, in the United States, burnout is more common among physicians than any other type of US worker.5 The prevalence of burnout in US physicians was reported at 45.8% in 2011 where physicians reported at least one symptom of burnout and rose to 54% in 2014.5 Its prevalence has been found to range from 17% to 52% in UK physicians6 and 9% to 82% in Middle-Eastern physicians. In all three groups the burnout symptom most commonly reported was EE. While mental well-being has been investigated among Caribbean physicians, burnout has not been studied in this group. Burnout has also been found to affect medical students and residents.7,8 Healthcare personnel (HCP) in the Bahamas were queried to assess the burden of burnout in this group. A convenience sample of HCPs who attended a Scientific Conference at the University of the West Indies (UWI) in the Bahamas was surveyed. In this cross-sectional survey the study population consisted of attending/private practice physicians, resident physicians, and medical students, all of whom practice and train in the Bahamas. The study tool used was the Abbreviated Maslach Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel,8 which participants completed prior to entering the conference. The Abbreviated Maslach Inventory Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel measures the three dimensions of burnout—Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalization, and Low Personal Accomplishment. For each item, participants were asked to respond, “Every day,” “A few times a week,” “Once a week,” “A few times a month,” “Once a month or less,” “A few times a year,” or “Never.” Each item was scored with a number ranging from 0 to 6; 6 being “Every Day” and 0 being “Never.” It consists of an abbreviated 9 items taken from the original 22, the latter being a gold standard, validated, survey. Sixty-six surveys were returned, some of which had incomplete sections of either PA, DP, or EE. Fifty four respondents answered all of the Personal Accomplishment items, 51 respondents answered all of the Depersonalization items, and 58 respondents answered all of the Emotional Exhaustion items. Most of the respondents were women (49/66; 75%), 41% were attending/private practice physicians and the remainder were resident physicians (16/66; 24%) and medical students (35%; 23/66). Of the three dimensions of burnout, emotional exhaustion was the only one reported as being experienced and it was only reported among resident physicians and medical students. Medical students and residents were significantly more likely to report this dimension. No symptoms of burnout were reported by attending/private practice physicians. In addition, healthcare workers aged 20 to 29 and 30 to 39 reported feelings of burnout in this dimension (emotional exhaustion), while those over the age of 40 did not report burnout in any dimension. Women were also significantly less likely than men to report burnout in the dimension of depersonalization. Neither attending/private practice physicians, resident physicians, nor medical students reported feelings of burnout in the dimensions of depersonalization or personal accomplishment. In summary, Bahamian medical students and resident physicians report burnout symptoms in the dimension of emotional exhaustion, to a significant degree, while practicing physicians did not report experiencing burnout in any dimension. This finding that burnout in the dimension of emotional exhaustion decreases with increased age may be partially explained by the fact that older physicians who are either attendings or private physicians, are able to set their own hours, while resident physicians and medical students are studying and working under unrestricted hours. It could also suggest that Bahamian medical professionals tend to learn how best to cope with their work environment over time through increased feelings of self-efficacy and increased resilience. Those who struggled more and did not experience this change over time may have exited the medical field entirely. A study conducted by Ey et al9 in 2013 found that 87% of residents who were aware of a Resident Wellness Program addressing burdens like burnout would be willing to seek help through the program. In order to promote physician well-being, leaders within organizations, including medical schools, residency programs, hospitals, and healthcare systems have to play a large role.10 Residents and fellows are looking to physician leaders for counseling regarding how to avoid as well as cope with distress in training.8 If burnout is identified and counseling made available, as well as provision of an environment that “cultivates well-being,”10 residents and medical students will benefit in the short term, and will also likely acquire some of the necessary tools to combat burnout throughout their careers. This convenience sample sheds some light on the burden of burnout in this setting. A more rigorous study design using the validated 22-item Maslach survey and securing a larger sample size may allow an improved understanding of burnout in this setting. However, it may be prudent to consider strategies to alleviate burnout and build resilience among medical students and resident physicians in the Bahamas. Importantly, burnout prevention methods must be explored, trialed, and implemented as well.

Esta afeccion se presenta frecuentemente en todas las personas del mundo y mas, si estos se encuentran laborando y/o estudiando, si el estres se presenta en exceso o no se puede revertir, se pueden generar distintas enfermedades como: hipertension y diabetes, las cuales presentan sintomatologias como: aumento de la presion sanguinea, gastritis, problemas del sueno, agotamiento, alteraciones de apetito, tension y dolor muscular, dolores de cabeza, alta temperatura corporal, pesadillas, ansiedad, fobias e irritabilidad, ademas, no solo se generan alteraciones a la salud, sino tambien en el rendimiento academico y laboral causando ausencia e incapacidad para cumplir con sus deberes, hasta incluso se pudiese llegar a la muerte. En la presente investigacion se determinaron las diferentes variantes que pueden llegar a ser alteradas por el estres academico y laboral. Los datos se obtuvieron midiendo los parametros fisiologicos de frecuencia cardiaca, presion arterial y glucosa serica utilizando los equipos necesarios para ello, ademas, se aplicaron diferentes encuestas como el PSS-14 e Inventario SISCO, los resultados recabados se verificaron estadisticamente con las pruebas de Ryan-Joiner y Kruskal-Wallis aplicando un nivel de confianza del 95%, concluyendo estadisticamente que el estres fisiologico no puede ser danino o mortal cuando se liga directamente con el estres academico y laboral.",

      "abstract": "Trichotillomania (TTM) is a mental disorder characterized by recurrent hair pulling that result in significant hair loss. Traditionally, serotonin has been the principal neurotransmitter implicated in TTM, however, recent literature strongly supports the role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of TTM. Here we describe 7 year old boy who had fluoxetine-induced trichotillomania. According to the temporal association in time between fluoxetine treatment, the symptoms of trichotillomania and the resolution of symptoms in the absence of fluoxetine, hair pulling was likely fluoxetine induced. It is implicated that serotonin reuptake inhibitors may have facilitative effects on dopamine. We suggest that TTM may be the result of dopamine increase due to fluoxetine treatment. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of antidepressant-induced trichotillomania.",

Systems of classification of the epilepsies, each useful for particular purposes, may be based on phenomeno- logical or seizure-type description, clinical-electrographic description, or response to different classes of drugs.

Psychogenic excoriations are lesions caused by scratching, picking, lancing, rubbing or squeezing, usually, in areas that patient can easily reach (face, upper back and upper and lower extremities). They are initiated because an urge to excoriate an irregularity of the skin or by a disturbing sensation in the skin. The classic lesions are characterized by clean, linear erosions, scabs and scars that can be hypopigmented or hyperpigmented and are usually similar in size and shape. Association with psychiatric comorbidities are common, particularly mood and anxiety disorders. It is estimated to occur in 2% of dermatology clinic patients and is associated with functional impairment, medical complications (e.g. infection) or substantial distress. Psychotropic medications (e.g. SSRIs) and appropriate counseling can be effective treatments. The purpose of the poster is to highlight the existence and characteristics of psychogenic excoriations. A condition that can be chronic, causes significant impairment and is believed to be common but unreported. Here we report the case of a 27 year-old woman, with a 10 years history of self-inflicted excoriations, associated to high anxiety levels, treated with an SSRI with good response. Although it does not appear as a diagnostic category in DSM- IV, psycogenic excoriations is indeed a treatable condition that, isolated or associated with psychiatric comorbidity can cause marked distress, impairment and psychological suffering.",

      "title": "THE CONTRIBUTION OF PHYSICAL THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF MUSCLE IMPAIRMENT CAUSED BY MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY",
      "abstract": "Muscular dystrophies (DM) are neurological conditions of great complexity and severity that involve progressive loss of muscle mass and associated reduction in muscle strength. The causes are genetic and involve mutations in the dystrophin gene that lead to the absence or deficiency of functional dystrophin, a cytoskeletal protein that enables general muscle function. In neuromuscular dystrophies there are direct molecular mechanisms responsible for exercise intolerance and inability to contract muscles. The use of therapeutic physical exercises is a way to slow down the preogression of the disease, to combat the loss of functionality of the muscle fibers as well as to delay the appearance of secondary manifestations of the disease, manifestations that occur with the ability to ambulate and with the installation of sedentarism caused by muscle weakness and degeneration. The effects of therapeutic exercise on patients with muscular dystrophy (including the effects of exceptional or maximal exercise) have been analyzed in the literature, and it has been found that aerobic exercise performed under the guidance of a physical therapist can be effective in improving oxidative capacity and progressive muscle function of the patient. The exercises must be adapted to the individual case, depending on the patient's general condition and availability of effort. Careful supervision and monitoring of patients can achieve the objectives obtained in the form of beneficial effects for the affected muscles. The present dissemination proposes a brief presentation of different types of therapeutic exercises (aerobic, endurance, resistance) and their role in the recovery program of patients with progressive muscular dystrophies.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

Along with associated impairments, it results in functional limitations, such as inability to use the hand in daily activities and difficulty with transfers and gait. When severe, it may cause pain and lead to contractures and other permanent deformities. Lance (1980) defined spasticity as “motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome.” While this is the most commonly used definition, it does not accurately describe the entire spectrum of motor disorders observed in clinical practice. Indeed, recent investigations suggest that spastic hypertonia may not be the sole cause of these impairments and functional limitations. (Ada et al., 1998; Gracies, 2001; Gracies et al., 2002; Levin et al., 2000; Sgouros &amp; Seri, 2002) Rather, the abnormalities associated with the upper motor neuron syndrome—dystonia, co contraction of agonists and antagonists, clonus, weakness, incoordination—are also believed to play important, if not predominant, roles.",

Spasticity is a component of the upper motor neuron syndrome especially in addition to weakness and loss of selective motor control. Spasticity should not be treated just because stiffness is present. Most of the time spasticity is useful to assure safe balance and for compensating loss of motor strength. With these considerations in mind, spasticity should only be treated when excess muscular tone leads to further functional losses, impairs locomotion, or induces deformities, or chronic pain. As for most procedures in functional neurosurgery, surgery for spasticity should be considered as a second line treatment after failure of medical therapies (i.e. physical, pharmacological and Botulinum toxin injections).",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothyroidism is mainly classified, resulting in failure of thyroid function and secondary (middle) due to failure of an adequate thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) from the pituitary gland or thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. Secondary hypothyroidism can be distinguished from the pituitary and hypothalamic by using TRH tests. In some cases, failure of hormone action in peripheral muscles can be detected. Primary hypothyroidism may be clinical when free T4 (FT4) decreases and TSH increases or subclinical when FT4 is normal and TSH increases. In secondary hypothyroidism FT4 decreases and TSH normal or decreases. Major hypothyroidism is often caused by chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, causes that are rarely treated with radioiodine and thyroidectomy. Hypothyroidism is one of the most common endocrine disorders seen in daily OPD. As per Charak Samhita, we can categorize Hypothyroidism in Anukta vhadhies. Vata and Kapha are two main doshas involved in this vhadhies. Present case is one of my successful cases of hypothyroidism. 32 year’s female patient suffering from weakness, dry skin, poor memory, hair loss, constipation, acidity, breathlessness since the last 8 years, and from last one month all symptoms increase rapidly.

      "abstract": "Tinnitus is defined as the perception of sound in the absence of an external source. It is often associated with hearing loss and is thought to result from abnormal neural activity at some point or points in the auditory pathway, which is incorrectly interpreted by the brain as an actual sound. Neurostimulation therapies therefore, which interfere on some level with that abnormal activity, are a logical approach to treatment. For tinnitus, where the pathological neuronal activity might be associated with auditory and other areas of the brain, interventions using electromagnetic, electrical, or acoustic stimuli separately, or paired electrical and acoustic stimuli, have been proposed as treatments. Neurostimulation therapies should modulate neural activity to deliver a permanent reduction in tinnitus percept by driving the neuroplastic changes necessary to interrupt abnormal levels of oscillatory cortical activity and restore typical levels of activity. This change in activity should alter or interrupt the tinnitus percept (reduction or extinction) making it less bothersome. Here we review developments in therapies involving electrical stimulation of the ear, head, cranial nerve, or cortex in the treatment of tinnitus which demonstrably, or are hypothesised to, interrupt pathological neuronal activity in the cortex associated with tinnitus.",

      "abstract": "Disabilities are complex, dynamic, multidimensional and also contested; one or more key functions of the organism can be affected so to diminish an individual�s freedom of expression and of action. The transition from an individual, medical perspective to a structural, social perspective was described as a shift from a medical model to a social model where individuals are more likely considered disabled by the society then by their own bodies. Disabilities represent a part of the human condition due to its bidirectional connection with poverty: the existence of disabilities can increase the risk of poverty, and poverty can increase the risk of disability. The experience of disability that results from the interaction of the state of health, personal factors and environmental factors varies greatly. Stress, anxiety or different unpleasant moments can cause a temporary decrease in salivary flow but a constant decrease can indicate the existence of a serious health problem. Xerostomia represents the subjective sensation of dry mouth. It can be accompanied by hyposalivation, an objective phenomenon but this is not always the case. Even if the patient declares the existence of xerostomia, this does not necessarily imply the existence of hyposalivation. Xerostomia can be determined by modifications in the oral cavity, as the sensitivity level to moistening, adverse reactions to certain drugs (anti-depressants, inhibitors of the conversion enzyme). The handicap, now called disability represents a special condition of the individual, reason why he must benefit of the support of the society and of those around him. Dental treatment in patients with psychiatric disabilities must consider the general and local involutive modifications, the existent overlay polypathologies that can influence the dental treatment. The study was conducted practically and included the direct interaction as part of the medical team and the registration of 145 patients presented on request with various types of psychological disorders, sometimes covered by the mask of somatic disorders, indicating a masked depression, or a physical depression, where the emotional condition of yesterday and today differ very much. Pointing out the role of the dentist in approaching patients with physical and psychical disabilities, motivating and making them aware of the necessity of adopting a proper oral hygiene for preventing oral disorders. The dramatic impact on the psyche and the well-chosen words stressed by the clinician increase patient awareness and motivation in order to make him collaborate during the treatment.",

      "title": "Daytime Drowsiness",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

Psychosis due to TBI, also referred to as PD TBI in the literature is characterized by the presence of hallucinations and/or delusions in the aftermath of traumatic brain injury. The diagnosis is difficult to make because it requires the clinician to make a determination of whether the psychosis resulted from the brain injury or whether it is a manifestation of another illness. This can be particularly challenging because there can exist a significant lag between the time of head injury and onset of psychotic symptoms. To further complicate the picture, some patients have additional neurological conditions, either primary or secondary to the TBI that may confound the presence of psychotic symptoms. Migraine and other headaches, for example, have commonly been associated with TBI.",

Moreover, it is detrimental to the implementation of preventive strategies and induces depressive reactions, loss of self esteem and reduction of patients' quality of life. Finally, it keeps researchers away from certain domains of medicine and has a negative impact on funding for research and treatment. It is therefore important to understand its underlying mechanisms in order to fight it more efficiently.La stigmatisation est un phénomène social très commun, basé sur la discrimination d’un individu ou d’un sous-groupe d’individus par un groupe dominant ou majoritaire.

The question arises as to whether trichotillomania is best conceptualized as a disorder characterized by impulsivity or compulsivity. Impulsive and compulsive symptoms and traits were compared in 43 patients who presented for treatment of trichotillomania, OCD or impulsive personality disorder. Trichotillomania patients had significantly lower scores of obsessive-compulsive symptoms than OCD patients, and significantly higher impulsiveness scores than this group. Measures of aggression did not differ significantly between groups.",

Although the ‘combination of alcohol and testosterone’ is often regarded as a major aetiological factor, a significant number of injuries are not related to either. Motor vehicle collisions and equine-related sports injuries in particular can result in devastating injuries to the skull and face and are frequently seen.Over the last few decades, management has moved away from closed methods to open exposure, anatomical reduction and internal ‘rigid’ fixation of facial fractures, with significant improvements in outcomes. Nevertheless, current management of ‘high energy’ or complex fractures can still result in residual functional disability and cosmetic deformity.Today’s challenge is to restore patients back to their pre-injury form and function, consistently, but this is not always possible. Greater understanding and a number of developments have significantly improved outcomes, although controversy still exists in some areas. Some of these will be discussed.",

Family members may be there when the injury occurs or be called to the hospital afterwards, and even quite a mild head injury (HI) appears to cause parents anxiety. In more severe cases, the child may be in a coma and family members may spend long, uncertain hours at the child’s bedside, disrupting family routines. If and when the child emerges from the coma he may, for example, be unable to walk or talk. A lengthy rehabilitation process may then begin, again requiring family members to spend long periods of time in the hospital and suspend or defer other activities.",

Being “primary,” these disorders are due to innate brain states rather than structural or systemic (i.e., “secondary”) etiologies. The pathophysiology of these conditions is not yet fully realized. These often distressing headache conditions are much less common than tension-type headache and migraine. Many of them have clear and effective treatment options, while others have suboptimal treatments. Pharmacological, anesthetic, and neuromodulatory interventions are discussed in detail.",

Dentre outras funcoes, e responsavel em manter a continencia urinaria. A perda das funcoes dessas estruturas, seja por lesao nervosa direta ou por distensao/laceracao muscular, pode reduzir a capacidade do assoalho pelvico e enfraquecer o mecanismo de continencia permitindo a perda urinaria, assim, interferindo negativamente na qualidade de vida causando limitacoes fisicas, sociais, ocupacionais e ou sexuais. A Esclerose Multipla (EM) e a Mielopatia Associada ao HTLV-1 (HAM/TSP) sao desordens neurologicas cronicas, caracterizadas por ataque auto-imune a bainha de mielina causando desmielinizacao do nervo afetado, no qual geralmente resulta na diminuicao da conducao pelo nervo. Um metodo de avaliacao que vem sendo recentemente utilizado para avaliar a funcao dos musculos do assoalho pelvico e a eletromiografia (EMG) com uso de sensor vaginal. Alem de avaliar a capacidade de contracao muscular, a EMG registra a amplitude de contracao em microvolts (µV), sendo que os valores registrados em repouso caracterizam o tonus basal da musculatura. Durante a contracao muscular, a EMG oferece informacoes sobre as fibras fasicas que produzem contracoes de maxima amplitude e maior tempo de duracao. O estudo teve como objetivo avaliar a atividade mioeletrica da musculatura do assoalho pelvico de mulheres portadoras de EM, mielopatia associada ao HTLV-1 e mulheres saudaveis. Foi utilizado um eletromiografo Miotool 400, para a captacao da atividade mioeletrica. Participaram do estudo 15 mulheres, sendo 5 pacientes em cada grupo. Os resultados demonstraram que as mulheres infectadas com o virus HTLV-1 possuem um maior tonus basal da musculatura do assoalho pelvico, em comparacao com as pacientes portadoras da EM. Em relacao a forca de contracao total, as mulheres com o virus HTLV-1 tiveram uma melhor captacao do sinal eletrico dos MAP comparando-se com as doadoras saudaveis e as portadoras de EM. Em geral, as portadoras de EM apresentaram uma menor chegada do sinal eletrico em todos os quesitos avaliados, tanto no tonus basal como nas contracoes voluntarias. Acredita-se que devido o acometimento neurologico das pacientes com EM ser maior do que o das pacientes com HTLV-1 que se apresentaram assintomaticas, a conducao do sinal eletrico ate a musculatura do assoalho pelvico e em menor quantidade.",

The development of anxiety or depressive disorders are common with demoralization, another psychological syndrome, a topic of interest in psychiatry. To feel demoralized is to lose hope, courage, or confidence, which upsets normal functioning. While depression may co-exist with demoralization, they are 2 distinct entities, with the former characterized by an inability to experience pleasure and the latter characterized by helplessness and avoidance coping. In an effort to more adequately address the psychological stress in organ transplant patients, it is important to distinguish between demoralization and depression. Demoralization has prognostic implications such as negative disease outcomes such as treatment nonadherence and an increase risk of suicide. Medication for depression is not effective for demoralization syndrome. Therapeutic interventions include cognitive behavioral techniques that focus on exploration of attitudes toward hope and meaning in life.",

The interview not only is diagnostic, but it can also be therapeutic. Use open-ended questions, such as, “Tell me about your headaches,” “Tell me in your own words how headaches affect your life,” or “What else can you tell me about your headaches?” After presenting the patient with a list of therapeutic options described here, always ask, “What do you think about these options? Do you have any questions about them? And which ones do you want to pursue?” Establishing the correct diagnosis is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process. Not having a biological marker or a test for primary headaches and relying on the clinical picture for diagnosis require constant vigilance and reappraisal, particularly when headaches change in character or worsen in severity or frequency. A migraine sufferer may develop other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, brain tumor, cervicogenic headaches, or magnesium deficiency, which in the beginning may only worsen the typical migraines without any additional signs and symptoms. Typical migraine, tension, or cluster headaches have been reported to occur with the majority of intracranial pathologies, such as vascular abnormalities, tumors, and infections.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

      "title": "Practical Approach for the Diagnosis and Management of Insomnia During Menopausal Transition",
      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent at menopausal transition and substantially affect the quality of life in midlife women. Diagnosing and treating sleep disturbances are essential parts of the management of menopausal symptoms. Persistent insomnia in midlife is not a single entity, and is not always linked with menopause per se. Detailed patient history supplemented with appropriate physical examination and diagnostic tests is the basis for correct diagnosis. Insomnia in midlife women can be divided into four major categories: (1) menopausal insomnia (often related to climacteric vasomotor symptoms); (2) primary (psychophysiologic) insomnia; (3) secondary insomnia (associated with other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing), mental (e.g., anxiety or depression) or medical (e.g., fibromyalgia) disorders or aging; and (4) insomnia induced by behavioral, environmental, or psychosocial factors. Careful evaluation of the nature of the menopausal insomnia will help choosing the best therapy for each individual. Treatment options for menopause-associated insomnia include hormone therapy, behavioral interventions as well as medication targeting the specific underlying medical condition (such as pain, anxiety, or depression). Conventional hypnotic agents rarely provide long-term benefit in chronic forms of insomnia. This chapter provides a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment of menopausal insomnia.",

      "title": "Defining Dystonic Tremor",
      "abstract": "A strong association between dystonia and tremor has been known for more than a century. Two forms of tremor in dystonia are currently recognized: 1) dystonic tremor, which is tremor produced by dystonic muscle contraction and 2) tremor associated with dystonia, which is tremor in a body part that is not dystonic, but there is dystonia elsewhere. Both forms of tremor in dystonia frequently resemble essential tremor or another pure tremor syndrome (e.g., isolated head and voice tremors and task-specific writing tremor), and relationships among these tremor disorders have long been debated. Misdiagnosis is common because mild dystonia is frequently overlooked in patients with tremor. It is now clear that essential tremor is a syndrome, not a specific disease, and the use of essential tremor as a specific clinical diagnosis is arguably an impediment to elucidating this and other pure tremor syndromes and their relationship to dystonia. A new classification, primary tremor, is proposed and would be used for any disorder in which tremor is the sole or principal abnormality with no identifiable etiology other than possible genetic inheritance. This classification scheme would facilitate tremor research by moving the focus from the narrow question “Is it essential tremor?” to a broader consideration of what genetic and environmental factors cause primary tremor disorders, and how do they relate to dystonia and other neurological disorders. Keywords: Dystonia, essential tremor, tremor",

The entered energy may cause direct or primary injury, or result in other, secondary, events to the tissues. These are mechanical loads and are classified as static when the duration of loading is more than 200 ms and dynamic when less than this. The dynamic loads are further classified as impact if the injurious agent has contact with the head or impulsive when the load exerted to other body part/s results in damage to the brain by the change in speed of the head motion. Impact loads can either exert their effect with direct contact to the tissue or may cause inertial loads. The direct contact can cause deformation of the skull or induce energy stress waves to the head and brain. All of these events will result in tissue strain due to compression, tension, or shear. The strain will culminate in injury, which may be a scalp abrasion, laceration, skull fracture, or different kinds of intracranial traumatic lesions.",

Out of the unspecific hair shaft dysplasias the only ones showing neurological alterations are trichorrhexis invaginata, observed in the syndrome of Netherton. Among the specific dysplasias we would like to point out monilethrix, and very especially the moniliform hair syndrome, the trichorrhexis nodosa, the pili torti and trichotiodystrophy. The latter is actually a group of syndromes which associates a series of diverse symptoms that have in common hair brittleness, fertility problems and physical and mental retardation, and they constitute the basic syndrome know as 'BIDS syndrome.",

Atomoxetine is the first nonpsychostimulant agent approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of ADHD. Trichotillomania (TTM) is an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder characterized by a long-term urge that results in the pulling out of one’s hair from any part of his/her body. Studies have implicated dopaminergic and serotonergic dysfunction in the aetiology of TTM. We report a male patient with ADHD developing of symptoms of TTM following atomoxetine use. Atomoxetine indirectly affects dopamine levels in the mesolimbic dopamine system, similarly to methylphenidate/amphetamine, and can thus lead to hair pulling behaviour. Further studies concerning the potential adverse effects of atomoxetine, such as the development of TTM, are now needed.",

Actualmente se las considera como parte del espectro de los trastornos obsesivo-compulsivos (TOC). Esto se debe a que comparten patrones del TOC y porque las personas con alteraciones provocadas por excoriacion y tricotilomania presentan mayor incidencia de TOC y cuadros asociados.A pesar que algunos sujetos pueden lastimarse por habito o aburrimiento, en muchas ocasiones se pellizcan la piel o arrancan el pelo para afrontar pensamientos o emociones negativas como ansiedad, tension, tristeza o enojo. Mientras lo hacen pueden sentir alivio, pero este es frecuentemente seguido por sentimientos de verguenza o culpa.La forma adecuada de ayudar a estos pacientes es que los profesionalesque los tratan conozcan este nuevo encuadre diagnostico y sus tratamientos.

Largely classified as an impulse control disorder, they are now considered as part of the obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder because they share features of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Also, because people with skin picking disorder and trichotillomania are more likely to have OCD and other OC spectrum disorders than people without them.Even though some people may pick out of habit or boredom, they often pick their skin or pull their hair in order to cope with negative thoughts or emotions, such as anxiety, stress, tension, sadness or anger. While picking, people may feel relief, but then they often feel ashamed or guilty.The right way to help these patients is that those professionals that treat them know the new diagnosis framework and their specific treatment. Therefore, we conducted a revision of the cutaneous manifestations associated to these disorders, their etiopathogenic mechanisms and their possible therapeutic approaches.Key words: self-inflicted dermatoses, skin picking disorder, dermatillomania, trichotillomania, obsessive-compulsive disorder.Dermatol.

Yet, for want of something better, practioners and patients keep this dubious enterprise going — because psychoneurotic problems stubbornly persist, and even proliferate. It is thereforeaxiomatic that psychotherapy is being misused, in any of the several possible ways. Why is this happening? The present paper suggests three major respects in which much (perhaps most) psychotherapy and counselling is being misdirected or misapplied. As corollaries, alternative types of remedial endeavor are suggested.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

      "title": "How long is the appropriate duration to determine that the hormone therapy is ineffective in menopause?",
      "abstract": "As a general rule in pharmacotherapy, ineffective pharmacological treatment should be discontinued. Ineffective pharmacotherapy should not be administered for a long time. The first problem is the appropriate duration to determine that the pharmacological treatment is ineffective. The second problem is the criterion for determining the efficacy (or ineffectiveness) of the pharmacological treatment. As far as I know, there is no evidence regarding the duration. Nevertheless, it is necessary to determine the duration. Standards by academic organizations are necessary, even provisional standards are acceptable. Long-term administration of ineffective medicine causes the problem of adverse effects. It loses the opportunity to receive effective treatment. In case that HT is ineffective for menopause, the treatment of fibromyalgia may relieve symptoms of menopause. Patients do not get medical attention for the improvement of abnormal hormone levels but do for the improvement of subjective symptoms such as widespread pain, numbness, insomnia, and fatigue. Some people are almost asymptomatic even if their hormone levels are abnormal. I believe that the efficacy (or ineffectiveness) should be determined with the improvement of the above-mentioned subjective symptoms rather than the improvement of the abnormal hormone levels.",

      "title": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder: Common, Severe and in Need of Treatment Research",
      "abstract": "The appearance preoccupations trigger feelings of depression, anxiety, distress, shame, or other painful emotions. These emotions, in turn, trigger repetitive compulsive behaviors that are intended to alleviate the emotional distress [5] . As required by DSM-5 criterion B (which is new to DSM-5), all individuals with BDD perform excessive repetitive behaviors in response to the preoccupations with appearance at some time during the course of the disorder [1] . These repetitive behaviors have many similarities to OCD compulsions, and thus they are commonly referred to as compulsions or rituals. Common excessive behaviors include checking mirrors, excessive grooming, seeking reassurance about the perceived defects, skin picking (to try to minimize perceived blemishes), and tanning (e.g. to darken ‘pale’ skin) [3] . Some BDD compulsions consist of mental acts, such as comparing one’s own appearance with that of other people, rather than observable behaviors [3] . The repetitive behaviors are difficult to control and occur, on average, for 3–8 h a day [4, 5] . Nearly all patients camouflage the perceived defects (e.g. with a hat, makeup, hair, clothes, body position). Although camouflaging is a safety behavior, it can also be done repeatedly (e.g. reapplying makeup 20 times a day), in which case it may be considered a repetitive behavior [3] . Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is common yet very under-recognized. It has a point prevalence of about 2%, making it more common than obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anorexia nervosa or schizophrenia [1] . BDD typically causes tremendous suffering and substantial impairment in psychosocial functioning. The rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and completed suicide appear markedly high. Yet treatment research on BDD lags very far behind that of other common and severe disorders. Thus, the study by Veale et al. [2] is a major contribution to the literature and to patient care. Individuals with BDD (previously known as ‘dysmorphophobia’) are preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their appearance; these defects, however, are not observable or appear only slight to others (DSM-5 criterion A) [1] . Preoccupations most often focus on skin (e.g. perceived acne, scarring, wrinkles, color), nose (e.g. size or asymmetry) and hair (e.g. too little hair) but may focus on any body area [3] . Patients typically describe the disliked body parts as ‘ugly’, ‘unattractive’, ‘hideous’, or even ‘monstrous’. The preoccupations occur, on average, for 3–8 h a day (usually for at least an hour a day). They are intrusive, unwanted, and usually difficult to resist and control [4, 5] .

      "abstract": "Abstract People with myotonic dystrophy, like anyone else, can require surgery, either as part of the essential management of their myotonic dystrophy or for incidental reasons unrelated to their condition. For the majority, surgery will be uneventful. Thus, it may seem dramatic to state that ‘anaesthesia in myotonic dystrophy is a major life-threatening event’, but the response to surgery and anaesthesia is unpredictable and disaster awaits the unwary or unprepared (Speedy 1990). The importance of correct anaesthetic management of the patient with myotonic dystrophy cannot be overstated, a fact fully supported by the literature with numerous examples of individuals who developed peri-or postoperative complications that led to their death (Kaufman 1960; Buzello et al. 1982; Aldridge 1985; Braham 1989; Mathieu et al. 1997). Many poor outcomes occurred because myotonic dystrophy had not previously been diagnosed in the family (Aldridge 1985; Mathieu et al. 1997), but too often the condition was known about, an inappropriate anaes­ thetic technique used, and the patient died. Mortality is the tip of the morbidity iceberg, and many patients have survived after episodes of prolonged postoperative recovery or other complications (Kaufman 1960; Webb et al. 1978; Aldridge 1985; Speedy 1990; Mathieu et al. 1997). In some instances, patients have continued to remain undiagnosed through several eventful anaesthetic procedures (Aldridge 1985; Nightingale et al. 1985).",

The hair pulling may occur anywhere on the body; with the scalp and eyelashes most commonly affected. Onset is often during childhood or early adolescence. Once presumed to be an obscure condition, the estimated lifetime prevalence is 1.5% for male and 3.4% for female college students. In very young patients, a more equal sex ratio is observed. On the whole, women show 5 to 10 times higher prevalence rates than men. Majority of the sufferers disguise their hair loss very well. Because of the secrecy and shame about their behaviour, many remain silent sufferers, and treatment is often delayed. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors currently are the pharmacological treatment of choice, although other drugs like naltrexone and antipsychotics like pimozide and haloperidol have varying responses.

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

      "abstract": "Summer is a wonderful time to take advantage of the great outdoors and exercise outside more often. Keep in mind though, outdoor workouts are not for everyone. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminds us that you can become ill from the heat if your body can’t compensate for it and properly cool you off. This could result in a heat-related illness that can be quite serious. Anyone is at risk — even a highly trained athlete. Thus, it is important to learn and recognize the signs and symptoms for yourself or a companion. Failure to respond to a person in distress can result in severe dehydration and, in extreme conditions, death. WHAT TO LOOK FOR Heat cramps: painful involuntary muscle contractions caused by altered nervous control of the muscles that is exacerbated by fatigue, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. Heat exhaustion: inability to continue to exercise because of heat-induced symptoms such as nausea, headache, hyperventilation, etc. Generally occurs at a body core temperature of 97° to 104°F. Can quickly progress to heat stroke. Heat stroke: a body core temperature that reaches 40°C (104°F) or more. This condition is life threatening unless promptly recognized and treated. Confusion; hot, red skin; disorientation; profuse sweating; hyperventilation; loss of balance; rapid pulse; and possible loss of consciousness are all signs to look for in a person experiencing heat stroke. Another factor that compounds an individual’s heat tolerance is high environmental humidity, where sweat won’t evaporate as quickly, if at all. This keeps your body from releasing heat as fast as it may need to and results in overheating. Personal factors also are major influences in heat tolerance. Age, obesity, fever, dehydration, heart disease, mental illness, poor circulation, sunburn, prescription drugs, and alcohol use can play a role in whether a person can cool off enough in very hot weather. Make sure you play it safe with these warm weather exercise tips: Stay Away from Midday: Unless you are training for an event that takes place in the midday heat, avoid exercising from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Generally, the early morning or sundown is the best time to work out. If you can, choose shaded trails or pathways that keep you out of the sun. Light and Loose: Wear loose lightweight and light-colored clothing. Light-colored clothing reflects the sun to keep you cooler, whereas dark colors absorb the heat and make you feel warmer. Stick to fabrics that wick moisture away from your body. Many apparel companies offer fabrics with SPF 50+ that is an added bonus. Good Nutritional Intake is Critical: Proper food intake, especially real food, promotes fluid intake and retention. Normal fluid intake with meals supports prehydration before activities and helps prevent/delay dehydration. Remember to Drink: Exercise in hot/humid weather will require more fluid intake than usual. Because people of different sizes, sex, and physical condition sweat at different rates, checking your weight pre-post training will help to zero in on your personal fluid requirements. At a minimum, make sure you start each training session and competition hydrated and drink during the activity as well. Pace Yourself: Start out slowly and gradually pick up your intensity while monitoring your response. Remember that your body is working to acclimate to the hotter environment in addition to the workout, so don’t expect your body to perform as well as it does in a cooler, less humid condition. Apply and Reapply: Wear sunscreen and reapply as directed. Weather or Not: Check the weather forecast before you start your workout. If there’s a heat or other advisory, such as high ozone and air pollution, consider taking your workout indoors. In addition to the heat challenges, environmental pollutants can trigger asthma, allergic responses, and even lung damage over time. Body Knows best, so listen to it: The great benefit to having a routine is that your body knows what to expect. You will be able to recognize when your body isn’t performing as it normally does and be able to adjust accordingly. If you feel dizzy, disoriented, or light-headed, discontinue exercise, let somebody know, move to a shady location, and hydrate until you feel better.

      "title": "Damages derived from mobbing and professional contingencies—state of the art on the Portuguese legal framework and case law",
      "abstract": "Mobbing is a topic that has gained an increasing importance, due to escalating numbers of cases that are reported and go back to courts. This phenomenon may be characterised as a set of intimidating, humiliating or embarrassing, harmful or unwanted conducts of various kinds, occurring in the context of an employment relationship, that objectively violate the fundamental rights of the worker, namely, his dignity and physical and moral integrity (Pereira, 2009, p. 72). Moreover, a systematization of these behaviours is demanded: the repetition of the offensive conduct, which should be extended in time, but also the combination of several acts that complement each other in achieving the purpose it was intended1. Therefore, mobbing may cause damage to the physical and psychological health of workers2. Indeed, it is responsible for cognitive, psychological, psychosomatic and hormonal changes, as regards the nervous system, muscle tension and sleep, and may ultimately lead to suicide. In September 2012, the Portuguese Health authorities changedon the article (art.) 28 of the Portuguese Labour Code (Law nr. 7/2009, 12-02-hereinafter only CT) not adequate and sufficient? The convenience of this research lies not only with the advantages that the institutes of professional contingencies3 may adduce for the analysis of this matter, but also with the need to give adequate treatment to the figure of mobbing, which has worryingly gained an increasing dimension.",

      "abstract": "Clinical entities listed as mood disorders in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) relevant to depression in elderly patients include 1) bipolar disorder, 2) major depressive disorder (with or without psychotic features), and 3) persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ). Subtypes of depression and bipolar disorder in later life Depressive disorders Major depression, single episode or recurrent episode Psychotic depression Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Other specified depressive disorder Unspecified depressive disorder Bipolar and related disorders Bipolar I disorder Bipolar II disorder Cyclothymic disorder Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition Other specified bipolar and related disorder Unspecified bipolar and related disorder A bipolar I disorder diagnosis describes a condition in which a patient has experienced at least one manic episode with or without history of a depressive episode. A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

      "title": "Mechanism of brain concussion, contusion and laceration",
      "abstract": "Injury to the head and intracranial structures may occur as a result of direct or indirect forces. An injury by a direct force occurs when an object strikes the head. Indirect injury to the head may take place when an object accelerates or decelerates the body, with injury to the head and contents occurring indirectly. The significance of direct and indirect types of injury lies in the fact that with direct injury, there is a greater likelihood of involvement of the head and contents only, whereas, in indirect injury to the head the entire body may be involved and the possibility of injury not only to the head but to other parts of the body as well is likely. As energy is absorbed by the head upon impact, the skull deforms and the head is either accelerated or decelerated. With regard to the production of injury the following may result. (a) There will be deformation of the skull with possible fracture or compression of the intracranial contents or both. This compression of the intracranial contents results from a decrease in the volume of the head due to deformation of the skull. (b) Sudden increase in intracranial pressure due to the acceleration or deceleration of the head at the time of impact; (c) mass movements of intracranial contents due to different acceleration rates of the skull and its contents; (d) distortion of the skull and dural septae as seen particularly in birth injuries; (e) shearing off a portion of the head without necessarily producing an appreciable increase in intracranial pressure; (f) shearing and tearing of intracranial contents due to greatly increased intracranial pressure as in bullet and shell fragment injuries; (g) a combination of any of these effects, (5). This last possibility is probably the most common mechanism as one or more of the above effects combine to cause the head injury in most cases. The injury to the head and intracranial contents occurs as a result of the following mechanisms: (a) There may be compression or squeezing of the tissues. (b) There may be tension or tearing apart of the tissues. (c) There may be shearing or sliding of the tissues over each other. These three mechanisms may operate simultaneously or in combination in different areas or in different directions in the same area. Concussion is a term describing a state of post-traumatic unconsciousness associated with pallor and a shock-like state in the human. It may be of varying intensity from completely recoverable states to those of continued coma and death. Concussion is caused by derangement of brain stem reticular formation. Open wounds of the head, contusions and lacerations of the brain may or may not be associated with concussion or such derangement. The mechanism of contusions and lacerations of the brain, electrical changes and chemical alterations after head injury are discussed and evaluated.",

Movements are often twisting in nature, meaning rotatory about the long axis of a body part. Some patients may also have quick movements, called myoclonic dystonia, or tremor, but ordinarily there will have to be some sustained movements for dystonia to be recognized as such. These quick movements particularly might be confused with epileptic phenomena. Dystonia can be present during rest, but in general is more likely to appear when the patient is engaged in voluntary activity. Voluntary movements are slow, clumsy, and characterized by overflow (excessive activity in muscles not needed for the task).",

Their proneness to somatization may result in medical overinvestigation that can add an iatrogenic component to their illnesses; and their ‘affect storms’ or difficulty in relinquishing unhealthy affect regulatory behaviours, such as alcohol abuse or binge eating, may lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and helplessness in their treating physicians, nurses, or psychotherapists.",

Lesional headaches follow a sinusitis or an arthrosis, or accompany a \"temporal arteritis of Horton\". Funstional headaches include several varieties. 1. Trigemellar neuralgia. 2.Vascular algi originating from the basal arteries, the large cerebral venous sinuses or the branches of the external carotid. Among these are: a) headaches due to a dilatation of the internal wall, causing \"Horton headache\", migraine-like psychosomatic migraine and hormonal migraines (premenstrual, menstrual, menopausal or linked to the use of contraceptive pills); b) headaches caused by an angiospasm of the arteriole, which is the case in exposure to the cold, in traumatic headaches (malfunction of temporomandibular articulation, dry alveolitis), in psychosomatic angiospastic algias and in ethmoidal artery algias preciously described by the author in 1949 (Godin's disease).3. Headaches due to psychic hypertension. 4. Postconcussional psychogenic headaches. 5. Neurotic headaches. The author gives a detailed description of the subjective symptoms in each case, including localisation, from, intensity, duration course and associated phenomenons. This facilitates greatly the differential diagnosis and the choice of complementary examinations. Necessary biological investigations should be performed (e.g. hormonal balance). One should however avoid to increase the number of complementary examination which would only delay treatement and would expose patients to somatisation. Furthermore, in each case drug treatment, periarterial infiltration technics of the temporal, internal frontal, facial, mastoid and occipital arteries are described. The necessity of questioning the patient at lenght and to listen to him to enable him to verbalise conscious conflicts is emphasized. A serious medicopsychlogical examination and a relaxation treatment to reduce anxiety and muscular tension are advised in some cases.",

      "abstract": "The process of aging in man involves a lot of functional and structural changes in the body organs and systems. In this review we shall characterize the physiological and clinical manifestations of andropause. We'll review the physiological basis of the ageing process, the age-related changes in the testosterone secretion regulation, and the dynamics of androgen action and active testosterone metabolism. We also investigate the multifactorial etiology of age-related physiological changes--the body undergoes changes in its structure, there is a loss of muscle strength and decline in physical functions. Sexual dysfunction, hypogonadism and psychological changes are also commonly observed symptoms in this condition. Changes of similar kind can also be seen in young males with androgen deficiency. The age-related changes in physiological functions can potentially lead to some important consequences such as reduced physical activity, higher risk of developing specific diseases (ischemic heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis), diminished capacity to recover after acute diseases, but most often it leads to increased fracture predisposition. All these may eventually affect negatively the self-care capacity of patients making them require a long-term professional care, and lead to severe psychological and social isolation and increased mortality and change in quality of life. To limit the age-related physiological decline in serum testosterone levels, we should be able to tackle the still unresolved important clinical issue--can hormone replacement therapy administered to elderly men improve their functional status, prevent diseases from developing, improve quality of life and reduce fracture risk. The data included in the present review will contribute to determining the potential benefits and risks of testosterone replacement therapy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The classic symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions, hallucinations, and elements of disorganized behavior (e.g., communication abnormalities and bizarre behavior), are striking in their presentation. However, the most common symptom of schizophrenia is disability in everyday functioning: impairments in social, living, and vocational outcomes. The striking clinical signs of schizophrenia are episodic in nature and can come and go even in the absence of treatment, as demonstrated by the fact that up to a third of people with schizophrenia demonstrated remission of these symptoms even prior to the development of antipsychotic medications. In contrast, disability in schizophrenia develops early in the illness and is persistent, even during periods when the symptoms just described are absent because of treatment or spontaneous remission.",

Chromosome 13q deletion results in phenotypic disorders such as malfunctions in the central nervous system, anatomical changes of the body, as well as disorders in large and small motor skills. One of the possible consequences of the problems in motor skills development are speech development disorders, particularly concerning speech production. Other problems may relate to breathing, phonation and articulation. Additionally, on the one hand, some persistent reflexes in the orofacial area can be observed, while, on the other hand, some reflexes are absent. In the case of chromosome 13q deletion, the logopedic therapy contains also swallowing, as well as exercises which aim at improving the muscle tension in the area of face, articulators, neck, shoulders, chest and upper limbs. Disorders in speech production may take form of dysarthria, for example. Whereas, learning to communicate may require to introduce alternative communication – non-verbal communication within language production.",

      "title": "Functional limitations associated with mental disorders : inescapable fact or avoidable reality?",
      "abstract": "Psychische aandoeningen, zoals depressie en angststoornissen, zorgen vaak voor functionele beperkingen zoals verminderd vermogen om voor jezelf te zorgen, problemen met het onderhouden van vriendschappen, ziekteverzuim en nog veel meer. Er is echter nog veel onduidelijkheid over de sterkte van het verband tussen psychische aandoeningen en de soort en ernst van deze functionele beperkingen. In dit proefschrift wordt dit verband nader onderzocht in de bevolking. De belangrijkste bevindingen kunnen als volgt worden omschreven: (1) Psychische aandoeningen gaan gepaard met andere functionele beperkingen dan lichamelijke aandoeningen, maar ze beperken het functioneren minstens even ernstig. (2) Lichamelijke en psychische aandoeningen komen vaak samen voor bij dezelfde persoon en dit leidt tot veel ziekteverzuim. (3) Het ziekteverzuim dat samenhangt met depressie wordt vooral veroorzaakt door concentratieproblemen en gevoelens van schaamte. (4) Na herstel van een depressie herstelt het functioneren ook in de meerderheid van gevallen. Bij mensen die na hun depressieve episode niet volledig herstellen in hun functioneren komen vaker ook een angststoornis, verslaving, of lichamelijke aandoening voor en deze mensen ervaren minder steun uit hun sociale netwerk dan mensen die wel volledig herstellen. Hoewel er nog onduidelijkheid blijft bestaan over welke factoren een positieve en negatieve invloed hebben op functioneren, blijkt uit dit proefschrift duidelijk dat niet iedere aandoening bij iedereen tot evenveel functionele beperkingen leidt. Behandelingen die niet direct leiden tot een afname in de ernst en het aantal psychische symptomen, maar wel zorgen voor verbeteringen in het functioneren, zouden dan ook niet als zonder succes moeten worden beschouwd.",

Action tremor, also referred to as \"kinetic tremor,\" is further subdivided into postural and intention tremor and is defined as any tremor that is produced by voluntary contraction of muscle. Postural tremor is present while voluntarily maintaining a position against gravity (e.g., holding up outstretched arms). Intention tremor occurs when tremor increases as one is approaching a target (e.g., with finger-to-nose movements). The differential diagnosis for tremor is vast, including drug-induced tremors, essential tremor, tremors as part of a genetic or neurodegenerative syndrome, or tremors secondary to other medical conditions. The practical aspects of differential diagnosis, treatment approach, and workup are outlined in detail.",

It arises from pathological brain plasticity: physiological studies suggest that it is an exaggeration of brain changes that are required to achieve advanced musical skills.

This perspective, however, is untenable given recent data regarding the prevalence, course, consequences, and costs of insomnia. Further, the emerging data that the treatment of insomnia may promote better medical and mental health (alone or in combination with other therapies) strongly suggests that the question is no longer “why treat insomnia,” but rather “when isn’t insomnia treatment indicated?” This perspective was recently catalyzed with the American College of Physicians’ recommendation that chronic insomnia should be treated and that the first line treatment should be cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).",

Myoclonic or tremulous movements are often superimposed in CD, producing a “tremor like” appearance – especially early in the disease state. The terms CD and spasmodic torticollis are not interchangeable: CD is the preferred term when referring to idiopathic focal dystonia of the neck. Spasmodic torticollis is now considered to be one of four types of CD. Cervical dystonia is classified into four types based on the principal direction of head posture: torticollis (abnormal rotation of the head to the right or to the left in the transverse plane); laterocollis (the head tilts toward the right or left shoulder); anterocollis (the head pulls forward with neck flexion); and retrocollis (the head pulls back with the neck hyperextended).",

      "title": "Distortion of Olfactory Perception: Diagnosis and Treatment",
      "abstract": "Clinically, olfaction can fail in any of three ways: (i) decreased sensitivity (hyposmia, anosmia) and two types of distortion (dysosmia); (ii) distorted quality of an odorant stimulation (troposmia); (iii) perceived odor when no odorant is present (phantosmia, hallucination). The distortions are usually much more upsetting to a person's quality of life than a simple loss. An ipsilatersal loss of olfactory sensitivity is often identified in the nostril with any type of olfactory distortion. The pathophysiology of a stimulated distortion (troposmia) is likely a decreased number of functioning olfactory primary neurons so that an incomplete characterization of the odorant is made. In phantosmia, two possible causations include an abnormal signal or inhibition from the primary olfactory neurons or peripheral olfactory or trigeminal signals that \"trigger\" a central process. The clinician's goal is to carefully define the problem (e.g. taste versus smell, real versus perceived, one versus two nostrils), to perform the appropriate examination and testing and to provide therapy if possible. Treatment includes assurance with no active therapy (because many of these will naturally resolve), topical medications, systemic medications, anesthesia to parts of the nose and, rarely, referral for surgical excision of olfactory neurons. Endoscopic transnasal operations have the advantage of treating phantosmia and sometimes allowing a return of olfactory ability after the operation.",

This theoretical condition tangentially explains the loss of professional efficacy and became a quasi-clinical concept. Nevertheless, burnout questionnaires do not measure loss of professional efficacy. The attribution of this loss remains understudied. Some allege that over 50% of therapists and health workers suffer from burnout, but these results warrant scepticism on account of the overlap with loss of motivation. A main prodromal factor in the loss of professional efficacy is a loss of motivation or «disenchantment», possibly caused by occupational boredom. A sequence boredom loss of motivation burnout means that therapist efficacy loss depends on continuing professional education (CPE) and peer monitoring. Self-monitoring for motivation is important.

The term \"TMJ disorder\" is often a misnomer, because the joint itself frequently is not implicated. Diagnosis requires persistent multidisciplined investigation. Initial treatment is aimed at relief of pain and restoration of function. Treatment may then be directed at the source of the problem. For patients with atypical face pain, a complete and detailed history must be obtained before further examination and treatment can be pursued. Trigeminal neuralgia and trigeminal neuropathy must be differentiated before treatment is initiated, because of major differences in therapy.

Assessment also requires a comprehensive psychological/psychiatric interview to assess for comorbid illness, which may either contribute to hair pulling or require separate attention. Several instruments have been designed to assist in quantifying the core symptoms of trichotillomania and can be useful for monitoring treatment progress over time. Treatment approaches include medication, hypnosis, and behavioral therapies, especially modifications of habit reversal therapy. Controlled studies are few in number and are limited to only a few behavioral treatment approaches and medication classes. Research suggests that variations of habit reversal therapy have the greatest efficacy of the interventions investigated thus far. There is additional support for treatment with clomipramine, N-acetylcysteine, and olanzapine, in contrast to multiple other drugs that have been studied or suggested as useful for trichotillomania.",

The uncertainty about pregnancy may be worrisome. Much more serious is the suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function that lingers after withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy.

      "title": "Anesthetics",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anesthesia, which constitutes a state in which noxious events such as surgical procedures are imperceptible, may or may not be accompanied by loss of consciousness. A complete or general anesthetic given by the inhalation or intravenous routes produces hypnosis (profound sleep), analgesia, muscle relaxation, and protection against the increase in blood pressure and heart rate resulting from surgical stress (maintains homeostasis). An anesthetic which blocks the neural transmission of painful stimuli through afferent nerves and does not affect the level of consciousness can be classified as a local anesthetic. Induction of general anesthesia produces a progressive deepening of the anesthetic state and represents a descending desensitization of the central nervous system (CNS). A progression of clinical signs useful for estimating the depth of anesthesia. Four stages can be defined: first, a state of altered consciousness and analgesia begin; second, loss of consciousness, accompanied by irregular respiration and motor movement from depression of higher motor inhibitory centers with release of lower motor mechanisms, occurs; third, surgical anesthesia is reached, in which spinal cord and spinal reflexes are abolished, providing relaxation of skeletal musculature, and loss of corneal, conjunctival, pharyngeal, and laryngeal reflexes occurs progressively; fourth, onset of respiratory paralysis resulting from significant depression of the medullary respiratory center occurs, and subsequent cardiovascular collapse ensues. Monitoring via an electroencephalogram (EEG) and hemodynamic and blood gas monitoring help assess the depth of anesthesia. The potency of inhaled agents is expressed as the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) that is required to prevent spontaneous movement in response to a surgical or equivalent stimulus in 50% of patients. The onset of action is fast (within 60 s) for the intravenous anesthetic agents and somewhat slower for inhalation and local anesthetics. Although the modern practice of anesthesia is exceedingly sophisticated, identification of the basic molecular mechanism underlying it is still lacking. Inhalational anesthetics are very diverse chemically and extrapolation from the effect of a particular agent to the physiological state of anesthesia is problematic. Anesthesia theories may be divided into two categories: lipid theories and protein theories. Lipid theory postulates that inhalational anesthetics exert their primary effects by dissolving in the lipid portions of nerves, altering the conductivity. In protein theories, the direct interaction of inhalation anesthetics and proteins has been proposed as the cause of anesthesia. All inhalation anesthetics agents introduced after 1950, except ethyl vinyl ether, contain fluorine. Agents such as ether, chloroform, trichloroethylene (Trilene), cyclopropane, and fluoroxene (Fluoromar), which were once used, have been displaced by the newer fluorinated anesthetics. The intravenous (iv) anesthetic agents are of two types: those which are used to induce, but not maintain, anesthesia, and those useful for induction and also maintenance. The need is for an anesthetic agent having an extremely fast rate of onset and limited side effects. Fast onset minimizes the stress and agitation. Among the various classes of compounds that have been used are barbiturates, opioids, steroids, benzodiazepines, and hindered phenols. Balanced anesthesia, a potent opioid combined with an inhalation agent, is often used. The inhalational agents probably exert their biological activity through physical effects, while function through a biological receptor‐mediated pathway. At the end of a surgery, the primary concern is to eliminate respiratory depressant effects. This reversal can also diminish analgesic effects. There are two types of reversal agents: pure antagonists and mixed agonist–antagonists. The antagonists naloxone and naltrexone are the most commonly used. Local anesthetics act by inhibiting the channel opening allowing influx of sodium ions. The degree of blockage depends not only on the amount of drug, but also on the rate of nerve stimulation. In the clinically useful agents the polar group is an ester or an amide, although activity may be maintained when the polar function is an ether, thioether, ketone, or thioester. The ideal agent should have a short onset of nesthesia and be useful for multiple indications.",

Some of them may experience loss of ability to work or even death due to the mental disorders, despite successful patch-up of their physical injuries.

      "title": "Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "When evaluating a patient whose preoccupations and rituals have become persistent, excessive, and impairing, clinicians are encouraged to consider each of the disorders within the chapter on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. These include obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and repetitive thoughts that often involve such concerns as pathological doubt, fear of contamination, somatic concerns, and a need for symmetry. Compulsions are the repetitive behaviors that are performed in response to the distress of the obsessions. Common compulsive behaviors include checking, ordering, cleaning, and mental rituals. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by a preoccupation with one or more physical flaws that are not readily apparent to others. In addition, a diagnosis of BDD requires repetitive behaviors (such as excessive grooming or reassurance seeking) and significant distress or dysfunction. If the preoccupation is primarily about weight, however, then that patient would receive an eating disorder diagnosis if diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder are met. Once a diagnosis is made, DSM-5 includes multiple specifiers for many of its diagnoses. OCD, BDD, and hoarding disorder are unusual in having an \"insight\" specifier. The insight specifier characterizes patients as having good or fair insight, poor insight, or absent insight/delusional beliefs. For example, people who are delusionally convinced that their BDD beliefs are true would not be coded as having a comorbid psychotic disorder (e.g., delusional disorder) but would instead be noted to have BDD with absent insight. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling), and excoriation (skin-picking) are the most common body-focused, repetitive behavior disorders. Hair-pulling disorder was previously listed among the impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified, along with such disorders as pyromania and intermittent explosive disorder. Skin-picking disorder was new in DSM-5. Both disorders involve the sort of persistent, repetitive dysfunctional behaviors that characterize all of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Hoarding disorder was also new in DSM-5. It was previously listed as a possible criterion for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder or considered a symptom of OCD. In some cases, hoarding-type behavior is a symptom of OCD (e.g., if trash accumulates because of fears of becoming contaminated by touching it), but evidence indicates that dysfunctional hoarding often exists without an accompanying OCD diagnosis. As continues to be true throughout much of DSM-5, this chapter includes categories for patients whose symptoms are assessed to be secondary to medications, substances, or another medical condition. DSM-5 also allows clinicians to identify clinically relevant conditions that do not meet full criteria for a disorder. For example, a presentation that meets criteria for body dysmorphic disorder in a person who has significant physical flaws—a circumstance that would preclude the use of that diagnosis (which requires that any physical flaws be no more than \"slight\")—could be recorded as \"other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (body dysmorphic–like disorder with actual flaws).\" The \"other specified\" diagnosis might also be used to refer to a symptom cluster not described in the criteria for any DSM-5 obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, such as obsessional jealousy or olfactory reference disorder. \"Unspecified\" disorders can refer to symptom clusters that resemble presentations found in a particular DSM-5 chapter but that do not meet criteria for any specific disorder; the unspecified diagnosis is often used when the clinician has insufficient clinical information to make a diagnosis, such as in an emergency evaluation or an initial consultation.",

The DSM-IV defines malingering as “the intentional feigning or exaggeration of physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives such as avoidance of work or military service, receipt of financial compensation, evasion of criminal prosecution, or procurement of prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, malingering may constitute adaptive behaviour: for example, feigning illness while in captivity as a prisoner of war” (American Psychiatric Association, 1995, p. 698). The concept is considered more closely by Resnick (1997), who distinguishes between pure malingering, simulation of a non-existent disorder; partial malingering, the conscious exaggeration of present symptoms or of a now-cured disorder; and false imputation, the erroneous attribution of real symptoms to a particular cause, due to non-deliberate self-deceit or a wrong interpretation of the situation. Gorman (1982) also distinguished between the act and the state of malingering, insofar as the act implies wilfulness, an assertive attitude of desire and purpose, while the state, from a legal point of view, would be inherent to the person, due to their social condition or possible limitations. On the other hand, the question arises as to whether malingering can, in itself, be the reflection of some mental disorder. This is fairly clearly the case in the so-called factitious disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), in which the person intentionally feigns physical or psychological symptoms, with the aim of taking on the sick role, or in histrionic personality disorder, due to lack of control over one’s manipulative behaviour; however, the conscious exaggeration of physical or mental complaints in order to achieve a financial, professional or similar objective may also be a neurotic behaviour, since nobody “in their right mind” would normally go to such extremes, nor choose such tortuous and painful routes, in the pursuit of potential benefits. Nevertheless, the law does not make such distinctions, and considers certain behaviours to involve clear intention on the part of the person carrying them out (Gorman, 1982). The incidence of malingering after an accident is not well known, being estimated at between 1% and 50% of cases (Henderson, 1986; Miller & Catlidge, 1972), depending on whether the source of information is the claimant’s lawyer or the insurance company. An influential factor here concerns the financial and employment conditions, since it has been observed that such malingering increases when redundancies are immiMALINGERING OF ORGANIC ILLNESS OR MENTAL DISORDER",

      "title": "Canine and Equine Therapy for Mental Health: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Animals have been used for medicinal and therapeutic purposes throughout much of the course of human history., Formal research into the use of animals for therapeutic purposes being in the 1960s, where work investigating the use of pet psychotherapy for treatment of behavior disorder in children was published. More recently, animals have been incorporated into a number of “animal-assisted interventions”, including animal-assisted activities, animal assisted-therapy, and service animal programs. The most common forms of animal-assisted interventions for the treatment of mental health conditions involve dogs or horses, often described as canine or equine therapy (or hippotherapy), respectively.Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders (including generalized anxiety disorder; GAD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) are common mental health conditions associated with disability, decreased quality of life, increased mortality, and economic burden.– PTSD is a persistent mental health condition that may occur in individuals who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event, such as exposure to death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence. GAD, which is estimated to affect approximately 1 in 40 Canadians aged 15 years and older per year, is characterized by persistent and excessive fear, worry, and feelings of being overwhelmed. Finally, symptoms of MDD (also known as clinical depression or major depression) include sadness, insomnia, loss of interest in hobbies, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. A formal diagnosis of MDD requires the persistence of symptoms over a period of at least two weeks. Treatment strategies for PTSD, GAD, and MDD often include clinical care with pharmacologic agents (e.g., antidepressants), psychotherapy, or a combination of both approaches.The objective of the current report is to summarize and appraise the available evidence on the clinical effectiveness of canine therapy and equine therapy versus other forms of psychotherapy for the treatment of individuals with PTSD, GAD, MDD. This report compliments a 2012 CADTH Rapid Response Report on the use of therapy dogs and horses for patients with mental health conditions.",

In 25 healthy subjects, variable amounts of sleep loss (1-3 h for 1-3 nights) caused headaches lasting from 1 h to all day.

Simple analgesics, purchaseable without a doctor's prescription, completely or markedly reduced the head pain in 20-60 min. Headaches due to insufficient sleep differ from tension headaches in their site, duration and response to analgesics.

      "title": "A case of incomplete Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome with schizophrenia and global cerebral atrophy",
      "abstract": "Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS), a congenital malformation, is characterized by the triad of capillary malformation, venous varicosities (with or without lymphatic malformation), and limb overgrowth due to soft tissue and bone hyperplasia. Its clinical severity can range from mere cosmetic concerns to severe debilitation consequent to bleeding and deep vein thromboembolic episodes.[1] KTS can also be associated with abnormalities of the central nervous system (CNS) such as hydrocephalus, cerebral calcification, vascular malformations, cerebral and cerebellar hemihypertrophy.[2,3] Rarely, neurological and/or psychiatric disorders such as mental retardation, seizures, or bipolar affective disorders have been described.[1,4] We herein report a 35-year-old female, product of a nonconsanguineous marriage, referred to the dermatology OPD from the psychiatry ward where she was currently admitted due to complaints of feeling irritable, restless, ineffective, withdrawn, and continually distracted from work since about a year. A day before the current admission, she had physically and violently attacked her brother without any provocation. She also felt that all her family members and acquaintances at work were plotting to harm her. The parents opined her to be oversensitive over trivial matters and worsening over the years to become almost insular. On examination, she was found to be aware of her physical problems and was compliant to commands. Mental status examination revealed formal thought disorder and first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia. She was diagnosed as having grade 3 paranoid schizophrenia, i.e., being aware of the illness but attributing it to external factors. History and examination on dermatologist referral revealed the presence of well-defined varicosities on her left arm [Figure 1] around the axilla [Figure 2], cubital fossa [Figure 3], and forearm since birth along with gradually increasing hypertrophy of the 4th and 5th digits [Figure 4] of the left hand since 2-year consistent with a diagnosis of incomplete KTS. Doppler of the axilla revealed grade 3 dilated veins with normal blood flow. Karyotyping, as also biochemical and hematological parameters, were found to be normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain revealed prominent ventricles, sulci, Sylvian-fissure, and basal-cisterns implying mild diffuse cerebral atrophy [Figure 5]. There was no evidence of midline shift, intracranial bleed, or diffusion restriction. Corpus striatum, neuroparenchyma, sellar and parasellar structures along with major intracranial vessels and dural venous sinuses showed normal flow voids.Figure 1: Varicosities seen on the left axilla, cubital fossa, and forearm along with the hypertrophy of 4th and 5th digitsFigure 2: Varicosities - left axillaFigure 3: Varicosities – left cubital fossaFigure 4: Varicosities seen on left forearm along with the hypertrophy of 4th and 5th digitsFigure 5: Axial section of MRI brain in Flair mode at the level of ventricles showing a smaller total brain volume and prominent (a) ventricular system, (b) sylvian fissure and (c) sulci suggestive of mild cerebral atrophyThe patient is currently responding well to aripiprazole along with cognitive therapy. Structural brain abnormalities are well established in schizophrenia, with MRI consistently demonstrating a reduced global cerebral volume along with an increased lateral ventricular volume in its sufferers. Several studies have also reported these abnormalities to progress with time; with greater rates of progression being associated with a worse clinical prognosis. However, it remains unclear whether these changes are inherent to the disease processes underlying schizophrenia or are accelerated upon treatment with antipsychotic agents or other yet-unknown factors.[5] Cerebral hemimegaloencephaly and hemihypertrophy are the most frequent CNS findings reported in up to 18% of patients with KTS.[3] However, global cerebral atrophy-the intracranial abnormality demonstrated in our case has been documented earlier in only two cases of KTS (along with bilateral facial vascular abnormality), though without any evidence of schizophrenia.[5–7] The largest study exploring the psychosocial morbidities associated with KTS till date reported 23.2% of them to have a diagnosed psychiatric disorder (depression in 15% and anxiety in 5%), of which 15% had undergone treatment.[1] The study also reported that the highest prevalence of psychiatric disorder was seen in those above 50 years of age and concluded that KTS patients in pain had a significantly higher chance of developing a psychiatric condition.[1] This increased risk could be due to the diathesis-stress model which suggests that stress exposure on top of a preexisting vulnerability precipitates schizophrenia with increased risk of psychotic episodes.[8] To the best of our knowledge, this forms the first reported concurrence of KTS and paranoid schizophrenia and combined with earlier studies highlights the need to investigate the likelihood of psychiatric conditions in people with KTS. Patients should thus be routinely asked about symptoms of pain, particularly when factors that are more likely to be associated with pain are present.[1] Future larger prospective studies with a longer follow-up are required to define the association between psychiatric disorders and KTS more clearly.

Tic disorders are characterized by multiple sudden, rapid, recurrent, and non-rhythmic movements (motor tics) or utterances (vocal tics), or both. They fall under the category of neuropsychiatric disorders. Tic disorders pertaining to nails, also known as compulsive nail disorders, include onychophagia, habit tic deformity, onychotillomania, perionychotillomania, onychotemnomania, onychotieromania, onychodaknomania, bidet nails, and others. Onychophagia, onychotillomania, and habit tic are the most common nail tic disorders where the patient has a habit of nail biting and nail picking, respectively. Nail tic disorders are not only limited to cosmetic disfigurement of the nail, but may be associated with psychopathological states that can affect patient's quality of life. Each such case should be addressed with a detailed history, physical examination, and psychiatric evaluation in selected cases. Diagnosis is based on history and clinical examination but histopathology may be required in special circumstances. Management includes both non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities. Proper counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy play an important role in the management. The choice of pharmacological agent depends on the type of nail tic disorder and its severity.",

Since limb weakness or hemiplegia can also be a common symptom of an acute ischemic stroke, it is often difficult to diagnose Todd's paralysis in individuals experiencing an acute ischemic stroke if they do not have a pre-existing history of epilepsy. Given that there is a limited understanding of Todd's paralysis, this review discusses the history, prevalence, clinical manifestations, duration, etiology, and diagnosis of Todd's paralysis. A few factors that may help clinicians distinguish Todd's paralysis from other clinical indications are as follows: (1) Todd's paralysis is commonly observed after partial seizures or generalized tonic-clonic seizures. (2) The incidence of Todd's paralysis is greater if the epilepsy is associated with old age or stroke history. (3) The duration of Todd's paralysis can range from minutes to days, depending on the type of seizure or whether the patient has experienced cortical structural damage. (4) The etiology of Todd's paralysis is associated with cerebral perfusion abnormality after seizures. Further research is needed to explore factors that distinguish Todd's paralysis from other indications that may lead to limb weakness in order to improve the diagnosis of Todd's paralysis.",

      "abstract": "Acquired brain injury is an umbrella term that encompasses traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and non-traumatic brain injuries. Approximately 150,000 Canadians will sustain an ABI on an annual basis. An ABI is damage to the brain that is not due to a congenital or degenerative disorder. Occurring after birth, ABI can be caused by a traumatic event or external force (e.g., motor vehicle accident, sports injury), or a non-traumatic event or internal factor (e.g., infection, tumour). Injury to the brain can result in temporary or permanent physical (e.g., movement issues, spasticity, chronic pain), cognitive (e.g., impaired speech, memory loss), and/or emotional (e.g., depression, anger issues) impairments.As 1 of the major physical impairments resulting from an ABI, muscle spasticity is often described as muscle over-activity and is characterized by ongoing muscle contractions that are partly due to a decrease in skeletal stretch reflex threshold. Occurring spontaneously or continuously, spasticity typically affects muscles in the neck and upper and lower limbs. Spasticity can result in a variety of musculoskeletal issues such as involuntary shaking, joint stiffness, muscle contracture, and limited range of movement. This debilitating condition may limit one’s ability to perform the activities of daily living, impact one’s quality of life, and require additional assistance from caregivers.The treatment of ABI-related spasticity can involve a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological options may include casting and splinting to maintain positioning, stretching and strengthening to improve control of spastic muscles, and/or transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation to help reduce pain. Pharmacological options can be administered systemically (e.g., oral baclofen, tizanidine, clonidine, dantrolene sodium) or locally (e.g., injection of botulinum toxin type A [BoNT-A], phenol, baclofen). Botulinum toxin (BoNT), a neurotoxic protein produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria, exists in multiple subtypes (i.e., A to G) and formulations.BoNT-A intramuscular injection is used to treat spasticity by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in activating skeletal muscles. BoNT-A injections result in temporary local paresis (i.e., partial paralysis) and may help to improve pain. BoNT-A is approved for various indications (i.e., not exclusive to spasticity), and is available as 3 formulations in North America: onabotulinum toxin A (Botox), abobotulinum toxin A (Dysport), and incobotulinum toxin A (Xeomin). Due to different manufacturing processes and pharmacological activities, these 3 formulations are not considered interchangeable products. This report focuses on onabotulinum toxin A, which will be referred to herein as Botox — its brand name.The body of evidence evaluating treatment options for spasticity after brain injury is limited in quality and quantity, and there is uncertainty regarding the clinical effectiveness of Botox for this population. Another 2021 CADTH rapid review report focused on the use of Botox for the treatment of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. The aim of this rapid review report is to summarize and critically appraise the relevant evidence on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of Botox for the treatment of ABI-associated spasticity.",

      "title": "Traumatic Brain Injury: A Disease Process, Not an Event",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is seen by the insurance industry and many health care providers as an \"event.\" Once treated and provided with a brief period of rehabilitation, the perception exists that patients with a TBI require little further treatment and face no lasting effects on the central nervous system or other organ systems. In fact, TBI is a chronic disease process, one that fits the World Health Organization definition as having one or more of the following characteristics: it is permanent, caused by non-reversible pathological alterations, requires special training of the patient for rehabilitation, and/or may require a long period of observation, supervision, or care. TBI increases long-term mortality and reduces life expectancy. It is associated with increased incidences of seizures, sleep disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, neuroendocrine dysregulation, and psychiatric diseases, as well as non-neurological disorders such as sexual dysfunction, bladder and bowel incontinence, and systemic metabolic dysregulation that may arise and/or persist for months to years post-injury. The purpose of this article is to encourage the classification of TBI as the beginning of an ongoing, perhaps lifelong process, that impacts multiple organ systems and may be disease causative and accelerative. Our intent is not to discourage patients with TBI or their families and caregivers, but rather to emphasize that TBI should be managed as a chronic disease and defined as such by health care and insurance providers. Furthermore, if the chronic nature of TBI is recognized by government and private funding agencies, research can be directed at discovering therapies that may interrupt the disease processes months or even years after the initiating event.",

Such patients complain of increased urination (pollakiuria), urinary incontinence (enuresis), urinary retention, or loss of urination. As a rule, for the first time, such patients turn to a pediatrician (therapist), then to a urologist who, after a comprehensive examination, excludes any organic violation of the genitourinary system. Psychogenic dysuria can be noted in the structure of general neurosis, be a somatoform disorder, or be a neurotic (usually conversion) monosymptom. Hysterical (conversion) disorders, by definition, are not simulative, but manipulative, representing either a way to draw attention to your person, which is typical for females, or being a kind of unconscious way out of a hopeless from the patients point of view situation, as it was in this case. For the same reasons, the treatment of patients with hysteria remains one of the most difficult problems, requiring the involvement of a specialized specialist a psychotherapist or psychiatrist. Integrative psychotherapy (rational, behavioral and suggestive) is quite effective here, however, long-term treatment is usually required to achieve a good effect. Which consists of consultation with confrontational and paradoxical techniques, and the way out of such a confrontation is usually the same behavioral therapy and 510 sessions of hypnotherapy. The given clinical example is of scientific and practical interest, since the full effect was achieved after the first consultation and one session of hypnotic suggestive therapy.",

Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population.

It includes delusional beliefs about bodily sensations or functions; such as feeling malodorous, being infected by parasites, having dysmorphic features, or that a certain organ is no longer functioning. MHP has been divided into 4 main categories: Delusions of infestation (including parasitosis); delusions of dysmorphophobia, such as of misshapenness, personal ugliness, or exaggerated size of body parts (this seems closest to that of body dysmorphic disorder); delusions of foul body odours or halitosis or delusional bromosis (also known as olfactory reference syndrome); and a miscellaneous group.",

The patient's relentless pursuit of the delusional love object, often with escalating intrusiveness, may eventually involve threats or overt acts of retaliation, in response to repeated rejection, unrequited love, or alleged betrayal. Cases from the literature are reviewed in which the delusional romantic attachment involves the patient's psychiatrist or another medical specialist. The authors present a case involving a patient suffering from erotomania who develops a delusional fixation on her psychiatrist and, after her advances are repeatedly rejected, sues him for malpractice, alleging she had a sexual relationship with him in the course of treatment. The implications of the litigious paranoid, who uses the legal system to act out delusional concerns and retaliatory fantasies, are discussed. This is the first known case of an erotomanic patient claiming malpractice on the grounds that her psychiatrist had a sexual relationship with her.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY We have carried out this research because accidents are a serious public health problem in Mexico. They are the third overall mortality cause and the first among young adults. In addition, in our country, the study of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has not been focused sufficiently on accidents, not to speak of motor vehicles accidents. Among the different types of accidents, traffic accidents are placed at the top of the list. Aside from causing injuries and the loss of man hours at work, these accidents bring about emotional distress to affected individuals. Stress is a factor that triggers short-and medium-term consequences which are in turn reflected in the quality of life of the patient and his/her family. PTSD is an anxiety disorder that causes psychosocial disfunctioning and appears due to the exposure to a stressor or traumatic event. It may come about in two ways: when the subject is a victim of a serious threat to his/her life or integrity and when the subject witnesses an event seriously affecting a third party. The main stressors may be natural phenomena, such as hurricanes and earthquakes, intentional attacks, such as rape or any form of criminal violence, and, as is the case here, from traumatic events caused by motor vehicles. The etiology of PTSD is multi-factorial and involves genetic, psychological, educational, and environmental aspects. It has three forms: severe, where the disorder appears immediately after the occurrence of the event or until a month later; chronic, lasting between one and three months; and delayed, where symptoms appear six months after the event. Our objective was to establish PTSD frequency in patients with physical injuries caused by motor vehicles accidents who were attended at the Regional Orthopaedics and Trauma Hospital “Adolfo Lopez Mateos”. Together with the application of the scales, we were interested in making a description of the sociodemographical side of accidents, comparing the affect profile, and somehow defining the wide range of factors involved in the occurrence of this problem. For this, we devised a transversal and descriptive study with a non-probabilistic sampling. The sample was chosen using the following inclusion criteria: a)Being older than 18 years.",

      "abstract": "Emetophobia is a specific fear of vomiting. Although it is a relatively unknown anxiety disorder that has received limited attention in research, many psychotherapists are familiar with it as they frequently encounter persons with emetophobia in clinical practice. While animal-related phobias are the most common specific phobias in general, a recent study by Veale and colleagues (2025) suggests that among persons seeking treatment for specific phobias, emetophobia appears to be the most prevalent. Furthermore, the study indicates that persons with emetophobia differ from those with other specific phobias (e.g., in terms of gender ratio or treatment setting). These findings dovetail with results from other recent studies, suggesting that emetophobia may be a more impairing disorder and is, therefore, more likely to require treatment than other specific phobias.",

      "abstract": "Depresi berat merupakan salah satu gangguan jiwa yang sering ditemui yang ditandai dengan 3 gejala utama yaitu afek depresif, kehilangan minat dan kegembiraan, berkurangnya energi hingga mudah lelah. Serta gejala lainnya berupa merasa pesimis atau putus asa, merasa bersalah, gagal, dan sendirian, berbicara atau bergerak dengan lamban, sulit berkonsentrasi, mengingat, maupun mengambil keputusan, tidur yang lebih sedikit atau lebih banyak daripada biasanya, nafsu makan dan perubahan berat badan yang meningkat atau menurun dari biasanya, adanya pikiran atau percobaan bunuh diri minimal dalam waktu 2 minggu. Terapi yang diberikan dapat berupa obat-obatan, psikoterapi, maupun keduanya. Jika terapi tersebut tidak dapat mengurangi gejala maka dapat diberikan electroconvulsive theraphy (ECT). ECT menyebabkan berbagai efek samping seperti pusing, disorientasi, kehilangan memori. Biasanya efek samping tersebut dalam jangka pendek, namun kehilangan memori berlangsung berkepanjangan. Namun selain ECT belum ada terapi lain yang mendapat hasil secara cepat untuk terapi depresi berat dan menjadi tantangan untuk pasien yang tidak responsif terhadap ECT. Sehingga diperlukan terapi lain untuk penderita depresi berat. Ketamin merupakan obat bius non- competitive NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) yang digunakan untuk merawat tentara saat di medan perang. Proses pelepasan metabolit spesifik ketamin akan merangsang terjadinya peningkatan pelepasan sinaps glutamat yang menyebabkan efek antidepresan. Hal tersebut menunjukkan bahwa ketamin dapat menjadi harapan baru untuk pasien dan peneliti dalam kasus depresi berat.\r\n \r\nKata Kunci: Antidepresan, Depresi Berat, Glutamat, Ketamin",

      "abstract": "Total thyroidectomy has evolved from a vilipended surgery owing to its high mortality to one with commonly performed surgery with minimal complications. After a total thyroidectomy many patients are left hypothyroid and/or hypoparathyroid, and thus prone to develop neuropsychiatric complications. Although anxiety and depression are the common manifestations, acute psychosis consequent to total thyroidectomy is rarely reported. Herein, we present the case of a 55-year-old female with a massive neck swelling diagnosed as papillary carcinoma of thyroid with bilateral metastatic cervical lymph nodes for which total thyroidectomy with bilateral modified neck dissection was performed. Postoperatively, she developed symptoms of altered sensorium, disorientation, insomnia, agitation, and delusions of persecution as well as suffered from two episodes of generalized seizures. Initially, suspected to be delirium, the persistence of the psychotic symptoms led to revision of diagnosis to psychotic disorder due to another general medical condition. The acute neuropsychiatric manifestations consequent to major thyroid surgeries may seldom leave the surgeon by surprise. Hence, a multidisciplinary liaising for major thyroid surgeries is the need of hour to avert severe emergencies.",

      "abstract": "Hyperthyroidism is an excess in thyroid hormone production caused by such conditions as Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma. Overt hyperthyroidism is defined as a low or undetectable thyrotropin (TSH) level with elevated triiodothyronine (T3) or thyroxine (T4) values, whereas subclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as low or undetectable TSH with normal T3 and T4 levels. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include nervousness, heat intolerance, weight loss, and fatigue. The long-term consequences of unmanaged or poorly managed hyperthyroidism include increased risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, atrial fibrillation, sexual dysfunction, and osteoporosis. Overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism can be managed effectively with antithyroid drugs (eg, propylthiouracil, methimazole) or with definitive therapies (eg, radioactive iodine ablation, thyroidectomy). Subclinical hyperthyroidism is not always treated, although close monitoring is needed to prevent disease complications or progression to overt hyperthyroidism. Treatment for subclinical hyperthyroidism is recommended for patients 65 years or older with TSH levels lower than 0.10 mIU/L. Treatment also is recommended for symptomatic patients or those with cardiac or osteoporotic risk factors. Thyroid storm is a life-threatening complication of unmanaged or inadequately managed hyperthyroidism that warrants urgent treatment in a hospital setting.",

Compulsive disorders are characterized by repetitive, persistent, or sustained behaviors in excess of what is required for normal function, especially if severe enough to interfere with normal function. Cutaneous compulsions (psychodermatoses) often have an underlying organic disease or trigger. Diagnosis and treatment include identifying the underlying trigger, treating secondary dermatoses, and modifying behavior to prevent recurrence; medications are a helpful adjunct if anxiety interferes with normal activities or learning. Dermatoses may be initiated by a pathology, with subsequent self-injury causing persistence or worsening of lesions. Basic work-up to rule out medical causes of self-injurious behavior include evaluation for pain or pruritus, including musculoskeletal disease, neurologic disease, and/or primary dermatologic disease.",

      "abstract": "Serious physical illness naturally leads to emotional disturbance, particularly when the illness is disabling or life-threatening, so it is not surprising that stroke is associated with mood disorder, manifested as an increase either in general levels of distress or in the rate of clinically diagnosable states. In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

It is experienced as thoughts and feelings as well as in the body. Another way to define stress could be as an internal and conditioned response to external pressures. Mental health professionals often help people reduce and manage their stress. They can also help people work through other mental health issues that have developed while coping with high levels of stress over a period of time. The American Institute of Stress calls stress “America’s leading health problem.” In many cases, the stress Americans experience today is a response to psychological threats. Some of these threats might be losing a job or looking for employment, the death of a loved one, or relationship issues. Any of these can occur more than once in the course of a life",

Trauma on a woman's thoughts, feelings, dreams, fantasies, intentions, and relations changing her attitude to life as such, to her nearest, also to the values and eventually to herself. The consequences occurring as uncontrolled chain reaction affect her family life, career and communication; they break her as personality and lead towards destruction. There is always a risk of suicide. In psychiatry, termination of pregnancy is very important as it can be a reason of developing psychopathology. The identified psychopathological symptoms meet the diagnostic criteria of post-traumatic stress disorder which are considered a post-abortion syndrome. Psychopathology is distinguished by its personal, spiritually painful and stigmatized character. In the course of more than thirty years of clinical practice I have met, and medical documentation describes, about five hundred cases of post-abortion syndrome in Lithuania. The problem of termination of pregnancy exposes the tragic situation of family relations and discloses the destructive effects of the lack of love and warmth between nearest and dearest people, the poverty of sexual life, a woman's slavish behavior and dependence on a man.The topic has been highly syigmatized in Lithuania.

Every phase of the treatment is greatly improved. Anxiety, which so often develops during unmodified E.C.T., is greatly reduced if not abolished altogether. There is no cry or other noise that might disturb other patients awaiting treatment; the convulsion is attenuated to a reaction that may be varied at will from a mild modified convulsion to a mere flicker of facial muscles or complete absence of muscular activity. Cyanosis is absent and the colour remains good throughout, and—perhaps most important of all from the therapeutic point of view—there is no restlessness or confusion after the treatment, the patient sleeping quietly after the treatment until he wakes up without any unpleasant sensations or memories.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Headache can be described as a throbbing, pulsating or dull ache, at times worsened by movement and varying in intensity. Headache can be a disorder unto itself, such as migraine, or a symptom of another disorder ranging from a head injury to a brain tumour. Migraine is a primary episodic headache disorder characterised by various combinations of neurological, gastrointestinal and autonomic changes. Tension‐type headache (TTH) is usually bilateral. The approach to the treatment of episodic headache, whether TTH or migraine, is similar, and consists of psychophysiological therapy, physical therapy and pharmacotherapy. Cluster headache is a rare, distinct, primary headache characterised by devastating pain. Key Concepts: Headache can be a disorder unto itself, such as migraine, or a symptom of another disorder. Migraine has an enormous impact on society. In evaluating a patient with headache, secondary causes of headache, such as a mass lesion, subarachnoid haemorrhage or subdural haematoma, need to be identified or excluded. TTH varies in frequency as well as in severity, from rare, brief episodes to frequent, often continuous, disabling headaches. What we call migraine may be the upper end of a normal distribution of painful episodic headaches. Prophylactic treatment, designed to reduce the frequency and severity of headache attacks, should be considered if the frequency (more than two per week), duration (&gt;3–4 h) and severity might lead to the overuse of abortive medication or significant disability. The migraine attack can be divided into four phases: the prodrome, which occurs hours or days before the headache; the aura, which immediately precedes the headache; the headache itself and the headache resolution phase. The pharmacological treatment of migraine may be acute (abortive) or preventive (prophylactic), and patients who are experiencing frequent severe headaches often require both the approaches. Cluster headache is a rare, distinct, primary headache characterised by devastating pain. Cluster headache attacks are stereotypical. They are generally shorter than those of migraine, invariably unilateral and very severe.",

      "title": "Body dysmorphic disorder and cosmetic dermatology: more than skin deep",
      "abstract": "Summary Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is relatively common in cosmetic practise, yet it remains under‐recognized. BDD patients are unnaturally concerned with minimal or non‐existent flaws, most commonly in the skin (e.g. facial acne or scarring) and hair (e.g. hair loss). Many patients develop social avoidance and suffer occupational or academic impairment. More severely ill patients may become housebound or even attempt suicide. Despite the minimal or non‐existent nature of the perceived appearance flaws, patients with BDD may request dermatological treatments such as isotretinoin or dermabrasion. Although treatment outcome has received little investigation, it appears that most patients are dissatisfied with dermatological treatment and, even if the outcome is objectively acceptable, they do not worry any the less about their appearance afterwards. In contrast, a majority of patients respond to serotonin reuptake inhibitors or cognitive behavioural therapy. Treatment of these patients is best given by an experienced health professional. This may be a mental health professional or a dermatologist with an interest in psychological medicine.",

      "title": "Management of chronic non-cancer pain in primary care",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Mrs Yeo, a 68-year-old woman, came to you for chronic back pain, which had been persistent for the past year. She had been doctor-hopping, hoping to find an effective pain relief. About 6 months ago, she visited an orthopaedics specialist, who diagnosed her with degenerative disc disease and offered surgery, but she was not keen. Due to the back pain, Mrs Yeo stopped her part-time job 3 months ago and had been staying home more often instead of participating in community activities or interacting with her neighbours. She expressed hopelessness and lamented about the impact of the back pain on her function and lifestyle.WHAT IS CHRONIC PAIN? Chronic pain refers to pain that lasts for more than 3 months and persists past normal healing time. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain, pain is defined as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage\". It is always a personal experience that is influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological and social factors.[1] The perception of pain is often affected by personal life experiences, emotional factors, personal belief systems and family upbringing and values. HOW COMMON IS THIS IN MY PRACTICE? About 8.7% of the Singapore population experiences chronic pain.[2] Within this subset, a higher prevalence of chronic pain is present among females (10.9%) and it increases significantly among people above 65 years old. Chronic pain is a risk factor for psychological disorders. A Singapore cross-sectional epidemiological survey showed that chronic pain is significantly associated with major depressive disorder (odds ratio 2.4) and generalised anxiety disorder (odds ratio 3.0).[3] The economic effects of chronic pain are substantial. Another local cross-sectional study showed that episodic migraine alone posed an economic burden of SGD 1 billion per year, translating to about 2% of total government healthcare expenditure in Singapore.[4] HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE? With Singapore's ageing population, the prevalence of chronic pain is expected to increase, and it will be beneficial for family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs) to manage uncomplicated chronic pain conditions. Complex cases may still eventually require a pain specialist's review. Chronic pain is challenging to manage in primary care. Although there are few studies conducted on the local practice of chronic pain management, some common barriers have been identified. In a local qualitative study, fellow physicians in Singapore shared that a considerable number of physicians still view chronic pain in a biomedical model rather than a biopsychosocial model. In addition, the older community often feels stigmatised or views it negatively when offered psychological treatments for chronic pain. This lack of public awareness also deters physicians from referring older persons for psychological treatment. Keeping a close and therapeutic relationship with patients, involving the family members and having consistent graduated patient education on the multifaceted nature of chronic pain were found to be helpful.[5] In our local context, chronic pain management may incur considerable costs, especially in the aspect of psychological treatment, which may not be covered under government subsidy schemes such as Medisave. This, in turn, can further deter patients from pursuing holistic treatment. FPs and GPs can look into these factors and better reach out to patients. In this article, we aim to shed light on the range of management strategies available to manage chronic pain conditions [Box 1]. Chronic pain management is complex to manage in a primary care setting and it often requires multidisciplinary co-management (FP or GP, pain specialist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and psychologist) with the necessary patient empowerment and link-up with community resources.Box 1: Common chronic non-cancer pain conditions.WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Chronic and acute pain management has some similarities, although their management differs in some regard due to the different pathophysiologies. Besides the underlying nociceptive or neuropathic pain, the perception of pain and suffering is often contributed by psychological factors, personal beliefs, life experiences and social factors such as financial struggles or litigation.[6] It should be ingrained into our daily practice to elicit and address the root causes to manage chronic pain effectively. Figure 1 shows a brief overview of an approach that can be applied in primary care. For patients with chronic pain lasting from months to years, the priority is not to eliminate pain completely, as this is often ambitious to achieve, but to improve function and quality of life. Chronic pain should be treated with a multimodal 4 'P's approach, which are Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (Physical, Psychological and Procedural) strategies. These strategies can be initiated early and concurrently for greater effectiveness and to instill confidence in the doctor–patient relationship.Figure 1: Chart shows the overview of approach to chronic pain in primary care.Non-pharmacological therapy The pathophysiology in chronic pain commonly involves central sensitisation and may be associated with underlying psychiatric conditions. Chronic pain management can be effective with non-pharmacological interventions such as physiotherapy, yoga, mindfulness, exercise, heat and cold application therapy, acupuncture, patient education and empowerment. However, the effect of these interventions was reported to be either immediate or short term, which suggests that non-pharmacological interventions should be done regularly for a sustained effect.[7] A typical physiotherapy course consists of two or three sessions each week for a duration of 8–12 weeks. Failure to show improvement within this time frame should prompt the physician to reconsider if physiotherapy is still recommended.[8] However, in the local context, due to exceeding demand for subsidised physiotherapy services, public healthcare institutions are unable to accommodate two or three sessions per week for each patient. These limited resources can be made more available and efficient by educating and empowering patients with the right mindset and attitudes towards exercise regime. Empowerment can further enable patients to sustain the efforts and reap its benefits. Pharmacological therapy Chronic pain can be broadly classified into nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain. Generally, nociceptive pain is sharp and well localised, while neuropathic pain is characterised by paraesthesia (numbing, shooting, cramping sensation) and may be poorly localised. Occasionally, patients may present with both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Among patients who have end-stage knee or hip osteoarthritis, which is traditionally understood as nociceptive pain, about 35% of women and 27% of men have pain features that are suggestive of neuropathic knee pain.[9] This dichotomy can assist FPs and GPs to prescribe the appropriate pharmacological therapy. Typically, all pain should be treated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) pain guidelines, starting with non-opioid modalities to weak opioids and escalating to opioid therapy, with gabapentinoids and antidepressants conventionally reserved for neuropathic pain. If the pain is mild, a single analgesia can be given. For moderate or severe pain, combining multiple analgesic agents should be considered. These combination therapies have synergistic effects, which allow for lower doses of each analgesia and reduce the risks of adverse effects of each analgesia. When initiating treatment, the efficacy can be assessed after 2–4 weeks. If deemed ineffective, the medication can be switched to an alternative agent, reduced or withdrawn. The effect of pharmacological therapy is short-lived, and this may encourage patient reliance on medications in the long term, leading to higher risks of adverse effects. Hence, treatment often needs to be individualised, directed according to patients' functional limitations and goals, and kept as short a period as possible [Table 1].Table 1: Overview of common non-opioid pharmacological agents.[ 10 ]Opioid therapy Discussion surrounding opioid therapy should include the common side effects and the increased risks of opioid dependence and abuse. In line with the recent release of the Ministry of Health Opioid Guidelines, long-term opioid therapy should not be routinely prescribed.[11] If a patient is started on opioid therapy, regular assessments of the patient's response should be conducted. The doctor should consider ceasing the therapy if there is no improvement in the quality of life or achievement of functional outcomes, or if there is any suspicion of abuse. The risk factors of opioid therapy include developing comorbidities such as major depression and psychosis, suicidal tendencies and substance abuse. There are several scoring systems for prediction of aberrant use before initiation of opioid therapy, such as the 'Opioid Risk Tool' and the 'Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain' (SOAPP).[12] With these screening tools, the risks of aberrant behaviour from opioid use can be stratified as low risk, moderate risk or high risk. Low-risk patients are generally deemed reasonable to start opioid therapy in primary care. High-risk patients should be referred to pain specialist for further management. Procedural treatment Lastly, there are various types of procedures that can help manage chronic pain, such as injections and nerve blocks. Patients who are suffering from chronic back pain due to disc herniation, spinal stenosis, discogenic pain or post-surgery syndrome may benefit from having epidural injections.[13] There is debatable evidence for intra-articular injectables for the management of chronic knee osteoarthritis.[14] Timely referral to tertiary pain specialists and, hence, access to these procedures can help to provide synergistic effort in managing chronic pain. As a result, patients can achieve significant improvement in pain control, which will strengthen their adherence to subsequent treatments. HOW CAN I PROVIDE MORE HOLISTIC MANAGEMENT? Patients with chronic pain often have associated psychological complications such as depression and anxiety, and face social issues such as unemployment. This is especially prominent among patients with a low socioeconomic status. A local study showed that a person with chronic pain is twice as likely to face unemployment compared to a person of similar socioeconomic status without chronic pain.[15] It is challenging for FPs and GPs to thoroughly address these issues in a time-efficient manner. However, FPs and GPs can value-add by improving communication with tertiary centres, highlighting new issues and working together to best manage these psychosocial issues. There are several support groups available for patients and their caregivers, such as the Knee Osteoarthritis Improvement Group for patients with knee osteoarthritis and the Autoimmune Diseases Support Group for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. TOUCH Community Services also has a community musculoskeletal clinic which is mainly run by physiotherapists. Patients facing employment woes can also approach government agencies such as Workforce Singapore, which provides training opportunities, career guidance and links to job openings. The Skillsfuture programme provides a platform to access courses and training to improve employability. National Arthritis Foundation is a charitable body which raises funds to be utilised as financial subsidies for financially needy patients for treatment or to enhance employment prospects. In addition, patient's mental well-being often suffers along with the chronic pain. Chronic pain can also bring about friction among family members as patients assume the sick role. With multiple facets of life affected, these patients may find it difficult to access help and have respite. FPs and GPs can suggest and link up the patients with available community resources. Besides the Samaritans of Singapore hotline, there are various avenues for counselling that may be helpful [Table 2]. These organisations include Silver Ribbon Singapore, which offers free basic counselling services, and Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH), which provides in-person counselling sessions. Other organisations may have religious roots, in which some patients may find the counselling more relatable. These include Shan You, an organisation with buddhist roots, and Calvary Community Care, which was founded by a church. Typically, churches have volunteers who provide help with counselling as well.Table 2: Summary of community resources.*WHEN SHOULD I REFER TO A SPECIALIST? Doctors should refer their patients to a specialist in these scenarios: (a) the patient has persistent pain that significantly impacts on function and quality of life or causes anxiety and/or depression, and has not responded to initial management; (b) the patient continues to seek medical treatment for persistent pain that cannot be explained; (c) the patient is a possible candidate for interventional treatment; (d) the patient requires high-dose opioid therapy, shows possible opioid dependence or has a moderate-to-high risk of opioid dependence based on risk screening tools; and (e) the patient needs multimodal treatment not available in a primary care setting. TAKE-HOME MESSAGES Elucidate the cause of the pain. If the chronic pain is secondary to a mechanical pathology (i.e. spinal stenosis or osteoarthritis), explore if surgical options have been discussed. Chronic non-cancer pain often has many facets. Considering the biopsychosocial aspects of the presentation can help to identify various contributing factors and provide effective treatment. 4 'P's management: Pharmacological, Physical, Psychological and Procedural. There are numerous pharmacological treatments available, and these medications can be directed based on the type of pain and the underlying contributing disease. Opioid therapy is often associated with adverse effects, misuse and dependence. Utilising risk screening tools and regular monitoring can help to reduce these problems and allow for early detection and intervention. Patients should be empowered through patient education and understand the various treatments for better management of chronic pain. Consider other non-pharmacological treatments as a multimodal approach, especially for patients who may not be suitable for surgical treatment and aggressive pharmacological treatment due to its adverse effects. Consider psychosocial implications of chronic pain and offer management options for more holistic care. Timely referral to a tertiary centre should be considered and made in the above-mentioned situations. Closing Vignette You found out that Mrs Yeo had mild depression brought on by the chronic back pain and the resultant functional limitations. She had previously been trialled on paracetamol and short courses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. You started her on combination therapy, including duloxetine, and explained to her about the biopsychosocial nature of chronic pain. On review, Mrs Yeo's pain had improved, although it was still causing functional limitations. You referred her to a pain specialist for consideration of procedural treatment, as well as a physiotherapist and psychologist. After 3 months, Mrs Yeo reported that she was feeling much better and was now able to better ambulate in the community.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

Lightheadedness, meaning a feeling like the patient may pass out, is usually due to low blood pressure, often orthostatic hypotension. Vertigo, meaning a sensation of spinning or movement, can be an inner ear problem or a brain problem: Stop toxic substances; if there is nystagmus, refer to ENT for a full evaluation; perform the Dix-Hallpike maneuver to assess for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; and refer to physical therapy for repositioning maneuvers if positive; consider vestibular rehabilitation; consider a short course of medication such as scopolamine or meclizine; consider ordering an MRI scan of the brain, as sometimes the concussion unmasks another unrelated problem. Dizziness meaning “mental fogginess” usually turns out to be attention deficit. Dizziness meaning vague and nonspecific malaise usually turns out to be fatigue, depression, or anxiety.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

Dans les deux sexes, un tiers a deux tiers des patients environ presentent un ou plusieurs symptomes ou indices d’alteration de la vie sexuelle. Les troubles les plus importants, de beaucoup les plus frequents, sont inter-critiques. Dans la tres grande majorite des cas, il s’agit d’une baisse de l’activite sexuelle, qui peut affecter, isolement ou en association, le desir et l’interet sexuels, l’excitation ou l’orgasme. Ces troubles s’observent majoritairement dans les epilepsies partielles, particulierement les epilepsies temporales, mais peuvent concerner aussi les sujets presentant une epilepsie generalisee idiopathique. Les perturbations a l’origine de ces troubles sexuels sont multiples, psychologiques mais aussi physiologiques. L’etiologie de ces troubles, quasi certainement multifactorielle, reste imparfaitement elucidee. Les decharges et crises epileptiques, les lesions cerebrales, des troubles ou handicaps psychiques, intellectuels et sociaux, des modifications hormonales et neuro-endocriniennes, des effets collateraux des medicaments antiepileptiques, le traitement neuro-chirurgical de l’epilepsie sont autant de facteurs contributifs ou etiologiques dont certains sont fortement co-dependants. Les troubles sexuels en relation avec les crises sont beaucoup plus rares, qu’il s’agisse de crises comportant une semiologie de type sexuel ou d’exceptionnelles crises survenant en relation temporelle avec une activite sexuelle. En raison de la frequence des troubles sexuels intercritiques et de leur impact negatif notoire sur la qualite de vie, l’amelioration de leur depistage diagnostique et de leur prise en charge therapeutique est un objectif de soins tres important.",

The most common types of compulsions include washing/cleaning, checking/rechecking, ordering/arranging, and counting. Some of the less common compulsions include gambling, shopping, hoarding, trichotillomania, or sexual behaviors. Although many healthy, normal individuals may engage in compulsive behaviors, what distinguishes normal and abnormal compulsions relates to the frequency, intensity, and discomfort of the behaviors. Compulsions are often time-consuming (e.g. more than one hour per day) and cause significant distress or impairment to an individual's daily functioning. Generally speaking, there are three types of treatment for compulsions: psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and brain modulation. Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is one of the most effective types of treatment for compulsive behaviors.",

Psychotherapy is often ineffective, and cognitive behavioral therapy in combination with serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors seems to be the treatment of choice. Some cases are resistant to all therapy. This paper reports on three adolescents with pure trichotillomania who responded to the imaginative hypnotherapy technique with Ericksonian suggestions. The patients described their hair as weak and vulnerable and needy of protection. In therapy, the patient was assigned the role of \"patron of the hair\" thereby giving him/her control of the situation. Hair pulling was significantly reduced, and the improvement was sustained throughout the 6-month follow-up. These cases suggest that imaginative techniques may be effective in adolescents with trichotillomania. Further controlled studies in adolescent population are needed to confirm this assumption.",

Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure.

Somatic Symptom Disorder is differentiated from Illness Anxiety Disorder by virtue of the presence of a substantial somatic symptom(s).

      "title": "Can leukocyte telomere shortening be a possible biomarker to track Huntington’s disease progression?",
      "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD): HD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease, caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first exon of the HTT gene encoding the huntingtin protein. The mutant protein contains an expanded polyglutamine sequence that confers a toxic gain-of-function and causes neurodegeneration. Moreover, several studies indicate that loss of the normal protein beneficial functions, contribute to the pathology (Schulte and Littleton 2011). Triplet expansion over 40 repeats are fully penetrant and invariably lead to manifest HD in the fourth or fifth decade of life. Clinically, HD is a debilitating, incurable disorder in which no symptoms reveal genetic status (presymptomatic phase) until signs and symptoms of motor impairment, such as poor coordination or slight involuntary movements and subtle changes in eye movements, begin to appear (prodromal phase). Often the prodromal phase (up to 15 years before the full-blown disorders) includes psychological and psychiatric alterations as irritable mood, depression, difficulty in learning new information or mental planning; nonetheless, affected individuals are usually able to perform their ordinary activities and to continue work. With progression of the disease, however, involuntary jerking or twitching movements (choreic movement) become exacerbated, making walking, speaking, and swallowing increasingly difficult. Also, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms are worsening until dementia (Paulsen, 2010). The clinical diagnosis of HD is based chiefly on the presence of motor signs and symptoms according to the diagnostic confidence level from the Unified Huntington's Disease rating scale. This standard assessment tool for grading HD symptom severity is based on two relevant subscores: total functional capacity, which tracks the ability to perform daily activities, and the total motor score, which specifically tracks motor abilities (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1305/). The diagnostic confidence level ranges from 0 (asymptomatic) to 4 (motor impairments as unambiguous signs of HD). When a clinical diagnosis is established, the disease is manifest and becomes more and more devastating with time. In late stages, motor disability progress from hyperkinesia/chorea to severe hypokinesia/rigidity, rendering the affected individual often totally dependent, mute, and incontinent. Since, right now, there are no disease-modifying treatments, the disease slowly progresses toward death within 15 to 18 years after its onset. Though no treatment can alter its course, the prodromal stage is fundamental for evaluating the wide spectrum of signs and symptoms of disease progression. In addition, earlier stages of dysfunction offer a potential window for intervention or modification of pathogenic mechanisms. The duration of these stages varies among individuals. The length of CAG repeat is negatively correlated with age at disease onset. Models based on biological age and CAG repeat length are available to approximately estimate the years until onset in mutation carriers (Langbehn et al., 2010). Such testing, although useful, is not accurate in predicting age at clinical onset because CAG length accounts for only about 50–70% of the variation within a range of 40 to 55 CAG repeats. The residual variance is probably due to genetic, stochastic, and environmental factors. Given this variance, there is growing interest in HD research to search for phenotype modifier genes and biomarkers, identify specific changes or \"stages\" of disease progression, predict disease onset, and accurately track disease progression in premanifest HD (Gusella et al., 2014). Telomeres as HD biomarkers: The possibility of presymptomatic genetic testing in HD opens the way for evaluating potential disease-modifying treatments in the premanifest phase. Biomarkers that reflect underlying disease processes or progression are needed to monitor changes in clinically asymptomatic individuals. No studies to date have yielded validated biomarkers that can accurately predict either age at HD onset or disease progression, although the neurofilament light protein appears extremely promising (Silajdzic and Bjorkqvist, 2018). At present there are no effective treatments in clinical practice that can prevent the disease, halt its progression or delay its onset. Nonetheless, as the future holds promise for disease-modifying strategies, there is a need for reliably assessable disease progression biomarkers, as well as markers to detect treatment-related changes. Ideally, a biomarker will be closely linked to the pathophysiology of the disease, reliable, accurate, sensitive, specific, reproducible, inexpensive, non-invasive, and acceptable for the patient (Silajdzic and Bjorkqvist, 2018). Easily accessible peripheral biomarkers from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma have gained increasing attention. Our recent work seems to indicate that leukocyte telomere length (LTL) could possess several of the characteristics required of an ideal biomarker to track HD progression (Scarabino et al., 2019). Telomeres are the terminal ends of the chromosomes and play a role in preserving genome stability. Telomere shortening occurs progressively with repeated cell division because of the inability of DNA polymerase to replicate the 3′ end of the DNA strand. A cellular multiprotein complex, called telomerase, counteracts telomere shortening, but its activity, usually present in the early stages of embryonic development, is silenced in several human somatic tissues immediately after birth. As a consequence, the telomeres shorten progressively with increasing age in the replicating cells of adult tissues (Blackburn et al., 2015). This phenomenon may indicate cellular senescence and reflect an organism's biological age. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells provide an easily accessible source of cells in which telomere length can be analyzed. Shortened LTL has been found to be associated with aging and various age-related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and stroke-associated dementia. Studies have demonstrated rapid leukocyte telomere shortening in diseases associated with increased systemic oxidative stress and chronic inflammation (von Zglinicki, 2002). In addition, telomere loss may be induced by increased immune cell turnover associated with inflammation. When LTL was investigated in neurodegenerative diseases, shorter LTL was frequently found in association with cognitive decline/dementia and AD. A significant progressive leukocyte telomere reduction detected in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, as compared with controls (Scarabino et al., 2017), suggests that LTL measurement could be a useful means to follow dementia progression as it converts from prodromal (MCI) to manifest AD. AD and HD share several common features, including loss of neurons, accumulation of aggregated and misfolded proteins, and cognitive decline (Clark and Kodadek, 2016). Unlike subjects with MCI in which the evolution of the disease towards AD is uncertain, premanifest individuals with HD will inexorably develop the disease, although the age at disease onset varies widely. Our recent study (Scarabino et al., 2019) analyzed LTL in a sample of patients with premanifest (pre-HD, n = 38), manifest HD (HD, n = 62), and healthy control (n = 76) to gain a clearer picture of the relationship between telomere length and HD progression. The mean LTL differed significantly (P < 0.00001) across the three groups, with the highest mean values observed in the control group, intermediate values in the premanifest HD, and the lowest values in the manifest HD patients (Figure 1A), suggesting a relationship between telomere shortening and manifest HD development. The mean LTL values observed in manifest HD were nearly half those observed in the age-matched controls and slightly higher than the minimum length reported to be necessary to ensure human telomere protective stability in white blood cells (Blackburn et al., 2015). Comparison of the regression lines showed that the decreasing trends for telomere length with age were significantly different among the three groups (Figure 1B). As expected, there was a downward trend of LTL with increasing age in the controls, which began to increase with advancing ages. In very young premanifest HD patients, LTL was very similar to that reported for the age-matched controls but with and fast decrease after the age of 30. The youngest manifest HD subjects showed already very short telomeres, with only a slight decrease in the most advanced ages (Figure 1B).Figure 1: Distribution of LTL in HD patients.(A) Box Plot showing the distribution of LTL (T/S ratio) in controls, premanifest HD (Pre-HD), and manifest HD patients (HD). LTL was measured by real-time PCR. T/S ratio: Number of copies of telomeric repeats (T) as compared to single copy gene (S). (B) LTL expressed as T/S ratio as a function of age in controls, in premanifest HD (pre-HD) and manifest HD patients (HD) (Scarabino et al., 2019). LTL: Leukocyte telomere length; HD: Huntington's disease.After adjusting LTL for age, the effect of CAG repeat number on LTL was analyzed as well. An inverse relationship between mean LTL values and number of CAG repeats was found in the individuals with premanifest HD but not in those with manifest HD, indicating that in premanifest HD the number of CAG repeats contributes to telomere attrition independently of age (Scarabino et al., 2019). These findings indicate that in premanifest HD leukocyte telomeres begin to shorten gradually and markedly after age 30 years, depending on increasing age and CAG number, up to the values that are typically observed in patients with manifest HD. In premanifest HD individuals, LTL was then examined in relation to the estimated time to clinical diagnosis. The estimated age at onset was calculated according to the formula of Lanbehn et al. (2010), at different probability values, given CAG repeat number and age at blood sampling. The years to clinical diagnosis were calculated as the difference between estimated onset and age at blood sampling. A significant linear positive relationship was observed between LTL and estimated years to diagnosis, indicating that the fewer the estimated years to HD onset, the shorter the LTL and vice-versa (Scarabino et al., 2019). To date, two other studies on LTL in HD have confirmed significantly shorter LTL in HD patients as compared with controls (Kota et al., 2015; Castaldo et al., 2019). Taken together, the data seem to indicate that LTL could possess several characteristics required of an ideal biomarker of HD progression (Silajdzic and Bjorkqvist, 2018). It can be easily obtained by inexpensive blood sampling, and it is readily quantifiable and highly reproducible. Moreover, LTL is closely linked to the pathophysiology of HD. Indeed, the discovery of brain lymphatic vessels, the new role of microglia and astrocytes in survival, and metabolism of neurons are changing the idea of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. There is now strong evidence that the mechanism leading to neuron death is substantially influenced by the expression of the mutant protein by non-neuronal cells (microglia-astrocytes, non-cell autonomous pathogenesis). Since microglial cells are regulated and regulate lymphocytes (Clark and Kodadek, 2016), we reason that peripheral lymphocyte stress might be a faithful mirror of microglia-astrocytes-neuron stress. Moreover, also leukocyte telomere shortening could reflect microglial activation and the resulting neuroinflammatory state. In this context, we may speculate that leukocyte telomere shortening could be an indicator of the above-mentioned phenomena that accompany disease progression from the premanifest to manifest HD. Conclusions and future perspectives: LTL measurement seems to possess distinctive features required for a suitable biomarker to detect HD progression: it is easy to obtain, readily quantifiable and reproducible, and closely linked to the pathophysiology of HD. In premanifest HD individuals, LTL shows a very significant linear relationship with the estimated years to the clinical onset of HD and could predict the time at clinical diagnosis with good probability levels. Using LTL as a biomarker in HD could have multiple potential applications: characterize the different phases (premanifest and overt dis ease); monitor the progression of pathogenic events leading to manifest disease; find peripheral patterns that may mirror brain dysfunctions; contribute to constructing a simple and reliable model, perhaps by incorporating novel biomarkers (LTL, circulating micro-RNAs and sno-RNAs, neurofilament light protein), to predict disease onset and to define a temporal window in which patients could be effectively treated. Previous models, which focused only on the length of CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion, were univariate predictors of clinical age; monitoring the efficacy of potential novel therapies. In this context, a non-invasive procedure to obtain samples and relatively simple analytical assays are desirable as biomarkers for trials and care in premanifest HD individuals. Extending the analysis to a larger sample with a longitudinal study design would be useful for investigating the real properties of LTL as a biomarker for HD progression. We thank R.M.

During the course of implanting a brain stimulation electrode for the treatment of chronic and recurring incapacitating headaches, diagnostic electrographic recordings revealed focal abnormal discharges in the mesothalamus. Electrical stimulation attenuated the discharges and alleviated the headaches and associated symptoms. A retrospective analysis of this case suggested that a head injury-induced brain stem gliosis was the source of the brainstem abnormal discharges. It is speculated that various biologic systems represented within the brainstem were implicated by the reticular formation generated discharges. Symptoms making up the chronic pain syndrome were thus thought to emanate from the electric malfunctioning of those biologic systems.",

      "abstract": "The definition of the chronic lower back pain is established by the persistence of pain beyond 3 months of symptoms. Very often, the pain is \"non specific\", meaning related to a mechanical origin. The main factors inducing the pain to become chronic are individual factors, psychological factors or socio-professional factors. The socio-professional factors are often much more influential than the physical factors. The overwhelming element of treatment is physical exercise. Other methods of treatment like cognitive therapy, behavioural therapy and multidisciplinary rehabilitation can also lead to significant improvements.",

      "title": "Functional Electrical Stimulation",
      "abstract": "Abstract Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a rehabilitative technique where low level electrical voltages and currents are applied to an individual in order to improve or restore function lost to injury or disease. In its broadest definition, FES includes electrical stimulation technologies that, for example, are aimed at restoration of a sense of hearing for the deaf, vision for the blind, or suppression of seizures in epilepsy or tremors for people with Parkinson's disease. Most FES devices and systems are known then as “neuroprostheses” because through electrical stimulation they artificially modulate the excitability of neural tissue in order to restore function. While sometimes used synonymously with FES, the term functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS) is most commonly used to describe only those FES technologies that are applied to the neuromuscular system in order to improve quality of life for people disabled by stroke, spinal cord injury, or other neurological conditions that result in impaired motor function (e.g., the abilities to move or breathe). Another technology closely related to FES is that of therapeutic electrical stimulation (TES), wherein electrical stimulation is applied to provide healing or recovery of tissues (e.g., muscle conditioning and strengthening, wound healing). As will be seen, some FES and FNS technologies concurrently provide or rely upon such therapeutic effects in order to successfully restore lost function. For illustrative purposes, much of this article is centered on FNS and related TES devices and technologies.",

      "abstract": "The loss of taste is a common symptom and may have serious somatic and psychological consequences. Little attention is paid to the condition in doctors' practices, however, and the topic is also hardly mentioned in scientific publications. It is important to distinguish between isolated gustatory loss and gustatory loss in combination with other neurological symptoms. Isolated gustatory loss can be the result of a laesion of the chorda tympani of the facial nerve caused by otitis media or damage to the taste buds, for example. Treatment is aimed at removing the cause, e.g. medication or chronic otitis media, but the treatment options are often limited. Zinc supplementation in patients with zinc deficiency has not been proven to be effective. Gustatory loss in combination with other neurological symptoms is caused by damage to one or more cranial nerves, to the brain stem or cerebral cortex, and is an indication for referral to a neurologist. Early detection of the loss of taste, good patient counselling, diagnostics and possible treatment may limit the negative consequences of this condition.",

With the acceleration of modern life rhythm and the increase of the social competition pressure, emotional stress has become an important cause for the spread of Shanghuo symptoms. What's more, Shanghuo can impact the body physiological functions to cause the onset, recurrence and progression of common diseases, harming the health of the body. According to the long-term research findings, the author found that Shanghuo referred to the imbalance of multiple physiological functions, such as nerve, immunity and metabolism, caused by emotional stress. \"Shanghuo\" is not a disease itself, but it can increase the susceptibility to a variety of diseases. This study reviewed the traditional medicine theory and the modern medical studies, and explored the relevance and correlation mechanisms between the Shanghuo symptoms and disease susceptibility, so as to provide a reference to improve the state of sub-health and prevent or treat modern diseases.",

The onset and severity of terminal decline vary greatly between individuals. It is thought that a certain degree of cognitive decline occurs due to biological changes in the aging human brain, but evidence suggests that more abrupt and perceptible decline is often associated with an underlying death process or disease pathology. Decline is often gradual and relatively imperceptible for a period of several years, then increases dramatically in closer proximity to death. Future investigations are necessary to characterize disease‐specific decline trajectories and understand how specific areas of cognition (i.e., memory, vocabulary) are affected by terminal decline.",

      "abstract": "Neuropati Optik Toksik (NOT) adalah kelainan pada fungsi penglihatan akibat kerusakan saraf optik yang disebabkan oleh zat beracun salah satunya adalah etambutol. Kejadian NOT terkait etambutol ini sangat bervariasi dari beberapa studi berkisar antara 0,5 - 35% penderita. Neuropati optik toksik dapat memberikan gejala berupa penurunan penglihatan yang berlangsung progresif, semakin memberat hingga dapat terjadi kebutaan. Meskipun hilangnya penglihatan ini bersifat reversibel saat etambutol diturunkan dosisnya atau dihentikan, beberapa pasien mengalami gangguan penglihatan permanen bahkan dengan dosis obat yang standar. Beberapa kasus progresifitas tetap berjalan meskipun obat telah dihentikan. Seringkali dijumpai perbaikan yang tidak sempurna. Bahkan ada pula yang mengalami kebutaan permanen. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah Melaporkan kasus Neuropati Optik Toksik akibat terapi Etambutol pada penderita TB. Seorang wanita usia 28 tahun, dengan keluhan pandangan kabur sejak satu minggu yang lalu dan dirasakan semakin memberat. Tidak didapatkan keluhan mata merah, nerocoh, maupun nyeri pada mata. Pasien juga mengeluhkan nyeri kepala terasa berat pada seluruh kepala disertai mual. Keluhan lain seperti kejang, penurunan kesadaran, kelemahan separo tubuh, kesemutan, merot, maupun pelo tidak didapatkan. Tidak ada riwayat diabetes maupun hipertensi. Pasien terdiagnosis TB paru satu bulan yang lalu, kemudian mulai menjalani pengobatan TB regimen HRZE dengan dosis standar sejak dua minggu ini. Pemeriksaan Fisik dan neurologis hanya didapatkan penurunan visus VOD 6/20, VOS 6/40, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex OS menurun, pemeriksaan lain dalam batas normal.  Pada pasien ini, keluhan pandangan kabur mulai dirasakan setelah satu minggu mengkonsumsi etambutol, durasi ini cukup cepat mengingat pada literatur disebutkan onset munculnya gejala mulai dua bulan hingga enam bulanan. Dosis etambutol yang dikonsumsi oleh pasien ini adalah dosis standar, yaitu 15 mg/kgBB. Pada pemeriksaan fisik& neurologis semua pemeriksaan normal kecuali status oftalmologis. Didapatkan VOD 6/20 VOS 6/20, scotoma central, funduskopi macular reflex menurun. Pemeriksaan laboratorium juga telah dilengkapi dan tidak didapatkan abnormalitas. Pada awalnya pasien juga mengeluh nyeri kepala disertai muntah. Sehingga neurologis juga memikirkan diferential diagnosis suatu proses intrakranial. Namun hal ini telah disingkirkan dengan hasil CT Scan kepala yang menunjukkan gambaran normal. Selama perawatan terapi yang diberikan adalah berupa anti inflamasi, neurotropik, obat simtomatis untuk keluhan nyeri kepala mual muntahnya, dan melanjutkan terapi TBnya tanpa etambutol. Evaluasi visus dilakukan setiap hari saat opname, dilanjutkan tiap minggu saat rawat jalan. Perbaikan mulai dirasakan oleh pasien setidaknya tiga hari setelah dilakukan penghentian regimen etambutol. Perubahan yang signifikan tampak setelah dua minggu penghentian. Kemudian tiga minggu setelah keluhan, di klinik rawat jalan pasien mengatakan bahwa penglihatannya sudah kembali normal, demikian pula hasil pemeriksaannya, VODS 6/6, scotoma central-, funduskopi dbn. Neuropati optic akibat etambutol dapat reversibel. Penghentian obat harus segera dilakukan bila didapatkan keluhan terkait penglihatan pada pasien, yaitu berupa penurunan visus, gangguan lapang pandang, maupun abnormalitas funduskopi. Dari evaluasi visus selama perawatan, pasien mengalami perbaikan visus sempurna dalam waktu tiga minggu setelah obat dihentikan.",

Shortened or disturbed sleep causes increases in levels of traditional stress markers (eg, cortisol) and may thus exacerbate the effects of stress. Much knowledge is still lacking, however, particularly about the effects of real-life work stress. The latter requires longitudinal studies in real-life situations.",

In psychiatric terms there are at least three ways of looking at such an event: (1) the medical viewpoint. Doctors and hospitals are used to coping with physical emergencies in the course of their daily work. Therefore, when some abnormal mental state is the cause of the emergency the remedy is most frequently seen in terms of some form of medical intervention, usually implying the administration of drugs. (2) the psychological viewpoint. This is less concerned to classify overt symptoms and more willing to see the person in distress as somehow failing to cope with some stressful situation. This failure to cope may be due to the sheer size and impact of the stress or indicative of some breakdown of the usual defensive mechanisms, either because the ego is underdeveloped and therefore vulnerable, or because it has been undermined by illness. (3) the social worker's viewpoint. An emergency may be seen as being concerned less with the disturbance within one individual than with a breakdown within a system or a wider group. In these terms the focus shifts from a concern with one person and moves to a consideration of that person within the context of friends, neighbours and relatives.",

The change from being employed to unemployment affects mostly mental health. First symptoms appear together with the danger of losing the job. Unemployment can evoke apathy, fear or frustration and then it leads to more serious disorders such as neuroses, depression and so forth. It can be also responsible for suicidal attempts. These disorders are usually associated with somatic complaints. Stress evoked by the loss of the job is the major factor affecting the health state of an unemployed person. The loss of income and social status is another important factor. Many authors turn particular attention to a growing intensity of all negative effects of unemployment if it lasts for a long period of time.",

Terapi farmakologi seperti pemberian Antidepresan dan Antipsikotik atau disebut juga dengan neuroleptik untuk menurunkan frekuensi dan tingkat keparahan simtom-simtom psikotik pada penderita skizofrenia. Pengobatan dengan antipsikotik sering menimbulkan efek samping seperti mulut kering (xerostomia). Xerostomia sekunder untuk hiposalivasi juga dapat mengakibatkan karies gigi rampan, infeksi jamur mulut seperti kandidiasis, perubahan rasa, mulut berbau, atau mulut terbakar. Karies gigi merupakan penyebab utama kehilangan gigi di kalangan kelompok muda. Hilangnya satu atau beberapa gigi dapat menyebabkan gangguan fungsi pengunyahan, bicara dan estetika yang dapat mempengaruhi kualitas hidup seseorang. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk mengetahui hubungan gangguan psikotik skizofrenia paranoid terhadap kehilangan gigi sebagian pada pasien di Rumah Sakit Jiwa Banda Aceh. Pengambilan sampel dilakukan dengan cara Non-Probability Sampling dengan metode Purposive Sampling yang didapat sebanyak 24 orang subjek. Data yang diperoleh dari penelitian di analisis dengan Uji Chi-Square untuk melihat hubungan kehilangan gigi sebagian pada pasien skizofrenia paranoid dengan pengaruh lama konsumsi obat, jenis kelamin dan obat yang dikonsumsi. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan pada variabel jenis kelamin tidak memberikan hasil yang signifikan karena nilai p = 1.000. Namun pada variabel lamanya perawatan menunjukkan hasil yang signifikan karena p = 0.041 dan juga pada variabel obat yang dikonsumsi menunjukkan hasil signifikan dengan nilai p = 0.027.

Pharmacological therapies such as antidepressants and antipsychotics or also called neuroleptics are intend to reduce the frequency and severity of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenics. Treatment with antipsychotics which oftenly cause some side effects such as dry mouth (xerostomia). Secondary xerostomia to hyposalivation can also result in dental caries, oral fungal infections such as candidiasis, changes in taste, bad breath or burning mouth sensation. Dental caries is a major cause of tooth loss among young group. The loss of one or several teeth can cause functional of mastication, speech and aesthetic disorders that can affect a person's quality of life. This study aims to determine the correlation of paranoid schizophrenic psychotic disorders to partial tooth loss in patients at Banda Aceh Mental Hospital. The method of acquiring the data were delivered by Non-Probability Sampling that use Purposive Sampling method obtained by 24 subjects. Data which obtained from the study were analyzed by the Chi-Square Test to see the correlation of partial tooth loss in paranoid schizophrenic patients with the effect of duration in medication treatment , gender and medication consumed. The results indicate that the gender variable did not provide significant results because of the p = 1.000. Nevertheless the variable of duration in medication treatment indicate a significant results because of the p = 0.041 and also the variable of the drugs consumed also indicate a significant results of the p = 0.027. The results of the study reveal a significant correlation between psychotic disorders of paranoid schizophrenia to partial loss of teeth in patients at the Banda Aceh Mental Hospital with a significant duration of treatment and type of drugs consumed by the patient, but there is no significant correlation to gender.\r Keywords: Paranoid Schizophrenia, Antidepressant Drugs, Antipsychotic Drugs, Xerostomia, Dental Caries, Partial Tooth Loss.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

Presentation ... Pathophysiology Spinal cord injury releases spinal preganglionic sympathetic motor neurons below the level of the injury from descending control by the rostral CNS. A series of abnormal reflexes develop (e.g., the plantar reflex) as new synaptic circuits form in the independent cord below the lesion. In some cases, a reflex arc develops and any form of sensory stimulus may cause a massive sympathetic discharge. Most commonly, this reflex is triggered by stretch of a hollow organ like the bowel or bladder. Severe hyperreflexia is common (50–90%) when the spinal injury is above the T6 level, but hyperreflexia may occur when the injury is as low as T10. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Immediate Management ... Subsequent Management If long-term therapy is required, consider oral therapy with diazoxide, mecamylamine, or phenoxybenzamine.",

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

Rather, they fit into a third category--those with the \"tired person\" syndrome. The essential feature of this syndrome is the decrease in self-esteem that follows the real or perceived loss of the ability to work productively. The decrease in self-esteem triggers anxiety, which may be so severe as to approach a panic state. The patient then becomes increasingly disabled or has increasing physical symptoms and enters a vicious cycle culminating in debility. Treatment is aimed at the physician's accepting and legitimizing the very real loss that the patient perceives in order to help him or her become comfortably dependent.",

      "title": "Condylar dysfunctional remodeling and recortication: a case-control study",
      "abstract": "Temporo-mandibular disorders (TMD) is a collective term comprehending different clinical issues involving masticatory muscles, temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ) and other associated structures. TMD diagnosis is not made for its pathogenesis or etiology, but mainly on clinical symptoms. Primary dysfunction develops mostly on four factors: individual predisposition, high psychomotor activity (due to stress or parafunction), occlusal instability and low or absent tissue adaptation capability. On the other hand, secondary disorders can be caused by hereditary or congenital diseases, rheumatic inflammatory diseases, autoimmune and tumoral diseases. During their function, the condyles undergo a structural adaptive and physiological remodeling, but when mechanical stress exceeds adaptive capability, dysfunctional remodeling phenomena may occur. It is characterized by significant condylar morphological modifications at the level of the head of the condyle (smaller condyle), break of cortical integrity and reduced mandibular ramus height with subsequent mandibular retrusion and articular function alteration. The aim of this study is to compare condylar recortication amount, and pain reduction after two different therapeutic protocols.This is a case-control study. Twenty TMD patients were chosen and each of them underwent a documentation protocol including extraoral and intraoral photographs, dental casts, casts mounting on the articulator to evaluate CPI (CO-CR discrepancy index) and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of the mandibular condyles taken in closed mouth position. For the radiographic evaluation, a Planmeca ProMax 3D Mid system was utilized with an acquiring volume of 80×80 mm dimension, exposition 90 kV, 10.0 mA, 12 seconds with a DAP (Dose Area Product) of 1094 mGy·cm2 for each condyle. The acquired volume was elaborated by the Planmeca Romexis software v. 3.2.0.R and TMJ module. Seven coronal cuts and 10 sagittal cuts were performed on the head of the condyle to highlight the amount of cortication, before and after the application of two different therapeutic protocols. Protocol number 1 (N.=10 patients) included the exclusive use of a splint, while protocol number 2 (N.=10 patients) included the use of a splint associated with pharmacological therapy (NSAIDs, antioxidant, omega 3). The revaluation was performed on asymptomatic patient after a period of 6-8 months. The pain for each patient was assessed by a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from 0 to 10, 0 meaning no pain and 10 the worst pain ever felt. The VAS was evaluated after 10 days from the beginning of the treatment, after 3 months and after 8 months at the end of the treatment. Statistical analyses were carried using a χ2 test (P value <0.05).No significant differences in the amount of cortication were found in the radiographic revaluation between the two different therapeutic protocols, even though it was noticed that the use of medicaments brought to a resolution of the symptoms in a shorter period of time (P=0.00001 after 10 days; P=0.0251 after 3 months).According to this study, pharmacological protocol in the therapy of TMD does not seem to affect condylar cortication. Medicaments although seem to accelerate the disappearance of clinic symptomatology, but more researches are needed to valid these findings.",

      "abstract": "Have you ever wondered what causes clinical depression? Perhaps you have been diagnosed with major depression, and that's made you question why some people get depressed but others don't. Depression is a complex disease. No one knows exactly what causes it, but it can happen for a variety of reasons. Some people have depression during a serious medical illness. Others may have depression with life changes such as a move or the death of a loved one. Still others have a family history of depression. Those who do may have depression and feel overwhelmed with sadness and loneliness for no known reason.",

Thyroid dysfunction (TD) is an important public health problem that concerns 10% of the general population. Diagnosis of TD is currently carried out on the basis of serum hormone levels determined by laboratory analysis. The results are classified into clinical (TSH and thyroid hormones out of normal range) and subclinical (isolated TSH disorder) dysfunction. The development of third generation assays in the TSH test represents a great step forward in the diagnosis of TD. However, the debate about the pathological significance of subclinical TD has intensified. There is as yet no agreement on the best approach for diagnosis and treatment of this common condition. It is currently impossible to know which subjects with subclinical TD will develop the typical complications of clinical dysfunction. In this setting, it is feasible that a number of subclinical hypothyroid subjects may in some cases be overtreated with thyroxin, while others remain undertreated with increased iatrogenic morbidity as a consequence.",

      "abstract": "The electrical excitability of skeletal muscle enables action potentials to be generated at the motor end plate and propagated along the sarcolemma and into the transversetubule (T-tubule) membranes of muscle fibres. This spread of electrical activity is critical for coupling the local synaptic depolarization at the neuromuscular junction to the release of intracellular calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Several primary and secondary disorders of skeletal muscle are associated with abnormal excitability. An increase in sarcolemmal excitability manifests as a tendency for the autonomous generation of repetitive action potentials, persistent contraction and delayed relaxation, the hallmarks of myotonia. By contrast, intermittent failure of muscle membrane excitability causes paroxysmal weakness or paralysis that is characteristic of periodic paralysis. These alterations in muscle excitability produce a spectrum of clinical syndromes in which a patient may have myotonia, periodic paralysis, or a combination of both (Fig. 71.1).",

      "abstract": "Depression is a debilitating mood disorder which carries a high risk of suicide. A long-standing proposal is that it is caused by a functional deficit of noradrenergic and/or serotonergic transmission in the brain. So far, attempts to find a neurochemical marker in humans that could support this view have not succeeded. However, in animal models, antidepressant drugs do prevent abnormal behaviours caused by depletion of brain monoamines. Certainly all established antidepressants either increase release of noradrenaline and/or 5-HT (e.g. MAO inhibitors or mianserin) or inhibit their neuronal reuptake (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, fluoxetine, venlafaxine). Both these actions will increase monoaminergic transmission in the brain. Outstanding research goals are to explain, and eliminate, the problematic delay in the therapeutic actions of antidepressant drugs and to develop alternative effective treatments. This research is likely to encompass neuroendocrine systems (e.g. the glucocorticoids) which also express abnormalities in depression and are known to influence monoamine function.",

      "abstract": "Several subjects who tell their depression and play a part of it in front of the doctor without being really depressed are reported. Some of them try to hide the symptoms (irritability or erethism, ceremonials of obsessive neurosis, shunning of phobia) which, in their opinion, might be detrimental to their reputation. Others neglect to describe some of the symptoms of their polymorphous clinical picture only underlining the depressive signs. Some others play a part of depression because they have believed to recognize themselves in persons presented by mass media, because it seems to them a duty to show an adequate depression in case of mournful event, or because they \"convert\" their problem into a depression. Some others use depression as a blackmail, or to obtain an advantage from doctor's conviction about their illness. The reason for the high frequency of similar cases in the present time are examined: the scientific divulgation and the acceptance of depression by the modern society are among the most important ones. The peculiar semantic vicissitudes of the word depression are also reviewed. A widening of the boundaries of depression has contributed to an increase in the number of the cases. Finally, in addition to patients who are depressed without being aware of it, the authors focus the inverse possibility: patients who believed or try to make their doctor believe (playing the part of depression in front of them) that they are depressed.",

      "title": "Origin of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

Other reports refer to possible shock injury mechanisms that manifest solely with neuropsychological symptoms. A critical examination of this literature reveals no mechanistic basis for the association of the proposed physical symptoms of diffuse electrical injury with remote injury.

      "abstract": "본 논문에서는 경찰 외상 후 스트레스 장애(PTSD)에 관한 증상적 특징 및 병인 론을 살펴보고 치료에 대한 자가 치유기법 적용과 상용화 여부의 가능성을 살펴보 고자 한다. 경찰관 중 상당수가 직무수행에 있어 빈번히 접할 수 있는 각종 사건사 고현장에서의 직접적인 신체적 위해 내지는 그런 위험을 당했던 무섭고 두려운 사 건이나 시련에 나타나는 불안장애 등의 부정적 경험인 외상 후 스트레스 장애 (PTSD: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) 증후 등의 심각한 정신적 고통을 격고 있다. 경찰관의 업무 특성상 계속 긴장하게 만드는 일상의 스트레스, 그러한 스트 레스의 원인이 지속되며 정상적인 일과 삶의 패턴에 방해를 줄 때 발생하는 축적 된 스트레스, 개인이 혼자 힘으로 감당할 수 없어 신체적 또는 심리적으로 쇠약해 질 수밖에 없는 극단적 스트레스 등의 특징이 전형적인 외상 후 스트레스 장애로 이어질 수 도 있는 것이다. 또한 외상 후 스트레스 장애에 수반되는 증상과 징후에 는 우울증, 불안장애, 불면증, 알코올 남용, 약물 남용, 질병, 자살 등이 있다. 이러 한 경찰관들의 외상 후 스트레스 장애 등의 정신적 고통에 대해서 많은 선행 연구 가 있었지만 실제 경찰관 스스로 심리적 극복을 위한 자가적 심리치유 기법에 대 한 탐구는 드문 편이었다. 따라서 본 연구는 경찰관 개인의 즉각적 치유와 해소를 위한 자가적 심리치료에 대한 필요성과 경찰관 직무 특성상 다양한 종류의 문제들 에 대하여 조기에 아주 효과적이고 적절하게 치료할 수 있는 심리치유 방법을 찾 아 스스로 활용하여 극복해보도록 하는 것이다. 이는 경찰관 스스로 불쾌감이나 부정적 감정 등의 양상을 한 가지씩 점차 쪼개 고 소멸시켜감으로서 결국 건강한 마음과 모습으로 개선되어 나아간다는 것이다. 특히 이 연구에서는 경찰관 스스로 심리적 극복을 할 수 있는 가능성을 조성해줌 과 함께 일상의 직무수행 중 활용할 수 있는 치유기법을 제시하였다.",

      "title": "Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, encompasses fear and avoidance of social or performance situations, with prominent fear of embarrassment or humiliation (see Box 18–1 for the DSM-5 criteria). The disorder is very common, with a lifetime prevalence of 12% (Ruscio et al. 2008). It typically has onset by teenage years and is often chronic. The scope of feared situations can range from fear of a few specific public performance situations to a more generalized fear of most social situations. In this chapter we review the psychosocial and medication approaches with the strongest evidence base for efficacy in the treatment of SAD. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder 300.23 F40.10 Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive. Specify if: Performance only: If the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public.",

Army life differs from that prevailing in civilian communities by the frequency and intensity of situations that lead to basic conflicts. The rigidity of the environment does not permit modifications so necessary for the continued functioning of persons with borderline psychoneurotic or psychopathic personalities, while the replacement of the protection of familial or domestic life by an impersonal domination leads to frequent conflicts with authority. Moreover, the threat of combat to the basic instinct of self preservation results frequently in a permanent conflict, which can be solved only by the removal of a soldier from the threat of death or injury. In many instances a soldier solves his problem by the development of psychosomatic diseases, the cure of which is obtained only with extraordinary difficulty, because of an active desire",

Depression is characterized, and in many cases, caused, by negative cognitive styles, interpersonal dysfunction and deficits, sensitivity to life stress, maladaptive personality traits, and biological dysfunction at the genetic, neurochemical, and neurophysiological levels of analysis. Effective interventions include first-line treatments such as antidepressant medication and psychotherapy (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy, behavioral activation, interpersonal therapy, mindfulness based cognitive therapy) and, for treatment-resistant depression, neurostimulation treatments (e.g. electroconvulsive therapy, deep brain stimulation).

Myoclonus describes a symptom and generally is not a diagnosis of a disease. It refers to sudden, involuntary jerking of a muscle or group of muscles, vairable in intensity and frequency. Myoclonic twitches or jerks usually are caused by sudden muscle contractions, called positive myoclonus, or by muscle relaxation, called negative myoclonus.Myoclonic jerks may occur alone or in sequence, in a pattern or without pattern. They may occur infrequently or many times each minute. Myoclonus sometimes occurs in response to an external event or when a person attempts to make a movement. The twitching cannot be controlled by the person experiencing it. Tic is a nonvoluntary body movement or vocal sound that is made repeatedly, rapidly, suddenly and suppressible. It has a stereotyped but nonrhythmic character. Tics are type of dyskinesia, which is the general medical term given to impairments or distortions of voluntary movements. Although tics vary considerably in severity, they are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Tics management is including education and medical treatment as well as botox injection. The holistic treatment of tic is not only for the tics, but also for the medical illness which sometimes convey the disease.",

The question then arises about manipulation: how does this abnormality influence decisions on the appropriate use of manipulation, where the paraphysiological zone (or functional barrier) of segmental mobility is affected?",

It has been proved through recent studies that 75% of diseases occur due to mental stress, The deadly disease like heart disease and cancer too is related to stress. Now what is stress? Psychologists have in many ways tried to define stress. The reason of mental stress has been made clear. Here, stress means the factor or event or cause through which there is mental disequilibrium, tension and maladaptive behaviour in the individual. Reber (1995) ahs rightly defined stress as “Stress, generally is any force that when’ applied to a system causes some significant connotation that the modification of its forms, usually with the connotation that the modification is a deformation or a distortion. There is a stress provoking situation or event, which causes stress in an individual. It causes mental agony, worthlessness, frustration, depression and so on. This stress provoking situation can be physical, social or psychological, e.g. :- Physical disease, fatigue, pain etc. are the examples of Physical stress.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicideDifferential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar].Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer..

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable. Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.).

Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting. Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar]. Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar].

Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability. an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M.

General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agents Psychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer..

Staff play an important role in the improvement of depressive symptoms in the cancer patient. Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment. A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided. This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches. In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well. disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest.

The application of a shearing force on the skin is thought to be the cause of this phenomenon. Attempts have been made to treat cervical dystonia using equipment designed to induce the hanger reflex. This reflex may have implications in the treatment of headaches, cervical pain, and adhesive capsulitis. The hanger reflex is seen not only in the head region but is also in other parts of the body. Thus, it could be used in the treatment of systemic dystonias. The hanger reflex may help develop inexpensive and non-invasive treatment for dystonia or other neurological diseases and is expected to be the focus of research in the future.",

      "abstract": "Out of the two functions constituting male sexual functions, the reproductive and the coital one, the author has made a clinical study on the latter, that is, insufficiency and impotence in the narrow sense, which has hitherto been paid little scientific attention to. The sutudy has been on psychic impotence which accounts for the most part of clinical cases and on endocrine (androgen deficient) impotence which were found conciderable in frequency.(1) The author has defined impotence as the deficiency of one or two factors of sexual pattern, that is, sexual desire, erection, ejaculation, and orgasm.(2) The author's causal classification of 130 cases he treated is as follows: -a) organic cause: -penile (malformation or disease) 1.5%: endocrine (pituitary, testicular, or adrenal deficiency) 21.5%: nervous (central or distal motility, or sensory nerve damage) 4.6%. b) functional cause: -psychic (psychological 8 cases, psychic 81 cases which is 62.3%) 68.5%. c) other causes (urological cause by the disease in the urethra, in the accessory sexual glands, or by operation or external injury, diabetes mellitus, chronic consumption, physiological defect) 3. 8%. It is notworthy that out of the urological out-patient the psychic cause accounts for more than 50%.(3) Various psychic causes inhibiting the male sexual pattern were the basic factors, as the authors calls, of psychic impotence and the classification of 89 cases he treated is as follows: -sexual organ inferiority 6 cases, new marital condition 23 cases, abnormal sexual behavior 16 cases, disease anxiety or fear of disease 24 cases, suppression from the wife 3 cases, fear of conception 1 case, subconscious homosexuality 1 case, neurosis sign 8 cases, and unknown 5 cases.(4) The classification by age groups of psychic impotence is as follows: -the young group below 30 years old 45 cases, the prime-of-life group between 30 to 40 years old 18 cases, the more elderly and old age group 26 cases.(5) The author found that there was a characteristic difference between the basic factor of the young-group psychic impotence and that of the elderly-and-old-age-groups psychic impotence. The formation process of psychic impotence was that it originated from the individual's unconscious fear, doubt, anxiety, inhibitory idea about his own sexual function.(6) The treatment of psychic impotence was conducted primarily by psychotherapy through the interview at a regular interval and secondarily by medical therapy as a kind of trigger to cure. This method was sufficient and the most suitable even for a urologist.(7) The author's therapeutic result was that, out of 19 cases of new-marital impotence which is typical of young-group impotence, 10 cases were successful, 2 cases unsuccessful, and uncertain of result 7 cases: and that, out of 22 cases of elderly-and-old-age-group impotence, 10 cases were successful, 5 cases improved, 7 cases uncertain.(8) Endocrine impotence he treated was 28 cases and the classification of factors were that 17 cases were counted for the upper-central-nervous disorder, out of which 13 cases eunuchoidism: testicular disorders were 11 cases, out of which 8 cases post-pubertal castration, and 3 cases testicular atrophy.(9) The characteristic features of sexual pattern in endocrine impotence were that sexual desire generally declined, erotic erection and reflexible erection were damaged to various degrees, ejaculation decreasing and orgasm weakened.(10) Sexual function of castrate could be maintened and kept under control by supplying him with androgen. The author made investigation on the most efficacious method for it.",

The term “dropped head syndrome” (isolated neck extension myopathy) usually refers to a condition characterized by severe weakness of the neck extensors in the absence of a generalized neuromuscular disorder and may be due to a restricted noninflammatory myopathy.1,2⇓ In such a case, there may, in fact, be additional weakness affecting periscapular, shoulder, and thoracic muscles or even more extensive distribution of weakness—“dropped head plus syndrome.”3 Hypothyroidism is often accompanied by a myopathy with proximal distribution.4 In 1880, William M. Ord described a woman with myxedema who had, among many other symptoms, head drop.5 There are, to our knowledge, no reports in the literature on isolated neck extensor weakness caused by hypothyroidism. We report a case of hypothyroidism presenting as an isolated dropped head syndrome, which subsided almost completely during treatment with levothyroxine.\n\nA 53-year-old man presented with a 4-year history of slowly progressive neck weakness and pain in the neck.

It is generally the result of excessive activity from training and competition in combination with insufficient rest. It can be exacerbated and/or triggered by other stresses. Excluding other illnesses its diagnosis is made on history and serial exercise test data, no simple discriminative laboratory tests exist yet. Treatment is rest and gradual reintroduction of training. Prevention is possible and can be done by carefully monitoring subjective exertion from training and general mood combined with simple exercise test results. Its aetiology is not well known. The cytokine model of excessive stress leading to a generalized inflammatory state may explain the overtraining syndrome and represents an interesting avenue of further research to improve the diagnosis and management of this frequent and debilitating health problem in athletes.",

      "abstract": "Onychotillomania is a psychodermatosis that results from self-induced repeated trauma to the nail unit. It is characterized by the neurotic and irresistible urge to pick at, pull out, or harmfully bite or injure the nail(s). Multiple psychological factors can be involved. It can be difficult to diagnose, as patients mostly deny the self-destructive behavior, and the clinical features may mimic other inflammatory conditions of the nail apparatus. It presents with typical, usually bizarre morphologies of the nail plate. There is no evidence-based treatment for the condition, and it can be highly resistant to both dermatological and psychological interventions. Based on history and classical nail changes, a case of onychotillomania in a 19-year-old woman successfully treated with local steroid injection plus topical calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate combination is presented. An injection of a local steroid (0.2 mL of 5 mg/mL triamcinolone acetonide) was given monthly for 3 months and was then decreased to a bimonthly interval. In addition, topical calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate combination was applied daily for 3 months and was then decreased to every other day. Clinical improvement was noted after the third month, while complete resolution of the condition was achieved after 8 months. This treatment regimen can be advocated for similar nail dystrophies after excluding infective etiology.",

      "abstract": "Burnout» is a syndrome consisting of physical and emotional exhaustion resulting from negative self-concept, negative job attitudes, and loss of concern for clients. This theoretical condi- tion tangentially explains the loss of professional efficacy and became a quasi-clinical concept. Nevertheless, burnout questionnaires do not measure loss of professional efficacy. The attribution of this loss remains understudied. Some allege that over 50% of therapists and health workers suf- fer from burnout, but these results warrant scepticism on account of the overlap with loss of moti- vation. A main prodromal factor in the loss of professional efficacy is a loss of motivation or «disenchantment», possibly caused by occupational boredom. A sequence boredom > loss of mo- tivation > burnout means that therapist efficacy loss depends on continuing professional education (CPE) and peer monitoring. Self-monitoring for motivation is important. National professional practice rules should be tuned to these requirements.",

After an athlete experiences a traumatic event, sequelae may include posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but also other reactions, especially culture-specific patterns of symptoms and comorbidities such as depression. Comorbid substance abuse can hide unrecognized PTSD. Posttraumatic symptoms in athletes interfere with rehabilitation and performance. Support and treatment of posttraumatic symptoms in athletes require specialized care. Ethical dilemmas can develop, especially when traumatic stress is resulting from abuse, from events related to overtraining, or from inadequate care or violence within teams.",

      "title": "Mental Health- An Emotional Roller Coaster Around Menopause",
      "abstract": "Menopausal mental health is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of a woman’s overall well-being during the menopausal transition. Menopause, which typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, marks the end of a woman's reproductive years, characterized by a natural decline in estrogen and other hormones. This hormonal fluctuation can lead to various mental health challenges, including mood swings, anxiety, depression, and cognitive changes like memory lapses or difficulty concentrating. Women may experience emotional turbulence during this period due to both biological and psychological factors. Physically, the drop in estrogen can influence the production of neurotransmitters like serotonin, which regulates mood. Psychologically, the changes associated with aging, such as shifts in identity, self-image, and social roles, may exacerbate feelings of stress or anxiety. Sleep disturbances, common during menopause, can also heighten mental health concerns, leading to fatigue and irritability. Addressing menopausal mental health requires a comprehensive approach, including lifestyle modifications, counseling, and, in some cases, medical treatments like hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Mindfulness practices, physical activity, and a strong social support network can also help women navigate the emotional challenges of menopause. Raising awareness and reducing the stigma around mental health issues during menopause are essential to ensuring that women receive appropriate care and support during this significant life stage. By recognizing and addressing these challenges, women can maintain their mental health and overall quality of life during and after menopause.",

      "title": "Aspectos psicológicos y neuropsicológicos de la esclerosis múltiple",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION\nLa Esclerosis Multiple (EM) es una enfermedad de naturaleza desmielinizante y curso cronico, cuya base anatomopatologica se caracteriza por un proceso de destruccion de las vainas de mielina que recubren los axones neuronales (manifestandose en forma de lesiones distribuidas extensamente en el parenquima cerebral y la medula espinal), lo que propiciaria una alteracion en los mecanismos sinapticos y la emergencia de los sintomas caracteristicos de la misma. Se trata de una neuropatologia que se diagnostica habitualmente al final de la segunda decada de la vida o inicio de la tercera, con una prevalencia superior entre las mujeres (2:1). Supone, ademas, una de las principales causas de discapacidad en este periodo etario. \nA nivel sintomatologico se aprecia una clinica diversa en la que predomina el compromiso sensomotriz, acompanado con cierta frecuencia de perdidas en otras areas de relevancia clinica y humana (vision, funcion vesical/intestinal, estabilidad postural, fatiga o dolor; entre otros). La evolucion es generalmente en forma de brotes periodicos (85%), seguidos de un periodo de remision/estabilidad tras el cual pueden prevalecer sintomas residuales (cuyo efecto acumulativo genera discapacidad con el devenir del tiempo). Ocasionalmente este proceso se presenta de modo continuo, tanto desde el inicio de la enfermedad (EM primaria progresiva) como tras algunos anos de convivencia con el subtipo bifasico (EM secundaria progresiva), momento en el que la EM constituye un reto terapeutico todavia mayor. \nLa literatura sobre esta patologia evidencia la presencia de resonancias en el area de la salud mental de estos pacientes (presencia de sintomas depresivos, deterioro de la calidad de vida, compromiso de la funcion cognitiva, etc.), que requieren la puesta en marcha de recursos diagnosticos y terapeuticos especificos dirigidos a su deteccion y abordaje clinico.\n OBJETIVO\nLa presente tesis doctoral tiene como proposito principal evaluar a un grupo de pacientes con diagnostico de EM en una serie de variables sociodemograficas, clinicas, psicologicas y neuropsicologicas; con el fin de explorar las relaciones que se establecen entre todas ellas y detectar las necesidades asistenciales de este colectivo en el ambito de la salud mental.\n METODO\nSe opto por un diseno descriptivo y transversal, de corte correlacional. Se incluyo un grupo control (personas sin evidencia de la enfermedad), de tamano equivalente al clinico (n=55 en ambos casos). Tras una profunda revision de la literatura, se procedio a la construccion de una bateria de evaluacion dirigida a la exploracion de las siguientes variables: estres (Escala de Sucesos Vitales Estresantes -SVEAD), afrontamiento (Cuestionario de Estilos de Afrontamiento -COPE), apoyo social (Cuestionario Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey -MOS-SSS), personalidad (Cuestionario de Personalidad de Eysenck Revisado -EPQ-R), sintomas psicologicos (Cuestionario Revisado de Sintomas Psicologicos -SCL-90-R), calidad de vida (Cuestionario Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 -MSQOL-54), dolor (West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory -WHYMPI) y funcion cognitiva (Bateria Neuropsicologica Breve -BNB y Trail Making Test -TMT). Para la evaluacion de las variables sociodemograficas se diseno una entrevista ad hoc.\nEl analisis de los datos contemplo estrategias de comparacion de medias, analisis multivariados (discriminante), analisis correlacionales y analisis de mediacion; ademas del calculo de los correspondientes tamanos del efecto. Adicionalmente, se exploro la consistencia interna de todos los factores sometidos a estudio.\n RESULTADOS\nDe las diferencias obtenidas entre los pacientes y la poblacion general (de las que se infieren las necesidades asistenciales) se concluye: un malestar emocional mas intenso, una erosion pronunciada de la calidad de vida, un apoyo social deficitario, un perfil de personalidad que implica vulnerabilidad para la psicopatologia, un estres acentuado y un uso mas frecuente del afrontamiento emocional. Paralelamente, el analisis discriminante extrae las dimensiones que permiten una mejor diferenciacion entre los grupos, asi como su correspondiente capacidad de clasificacion.\nSe confirma, asimismo, el papel modulador de determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas (discapacidad, estres percibido, experiencia de un brote reciente y problemas para dormir) sobre un amplio abanico de dimensiones psicologicas y neuropsicologicas, evidenciandose la configuracion de patrones especificos de expresion en casa caso. Tambien se corrobora el papel mediador del apoyo social en la relacion que se establece entre la discapacidad y el malestar emocional, asi como la capacidad de mediacion del afrontamiento orientado a la emocion y el neuroticismo en la asociacion entre el estres y las variables de resultado (sintomas psicologicos y calidad de vida). Por ultimo, se detallan las interacciones entre las variables contempladas en el estudio, de modo que puedan discernirse las relaciones de covariacion que se establecen entre todas ellas en aras de una comprension mas profunda de la experiencia interna del paciente.\n CONCLUSION\nLa EM es una enfermedad compleja, que presenta un evidente impacto sobre la salud mental de la persona que la sufre. La presente tesis doctoral extrae algunas de las principales necesidades asistenciales (incluyendo el modo en que determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas durante el proceso de enfermedad pueden modular la experiencia subjetiva del paciente) y explora las interacciones entre variables de relevancia clinica (incluyendose las relaciones con el deterioro cognitivo), de modo que pueda incrementarse el conocimiento disponible sobre la enfermedad desde la perspectiva de la salud mental. Los analisis de mediacion determinan que tanto el apoyo social como el estilo de afrontamiento emocional (dos dimensiones susceptibles de abordaje terapeutico) tienen un importante papel explicativo en la relacion que se objetiva entre la discapacidad y el estres con la sintomatologia psicologica y la calidad de vida. \nLos resultados obtenidos permiten incrementar el conocimiento actual sobre los aspectos psicologicos y neuropsicologicos de la EM, y ofrecer herramientas para el diseno de un plan de tratamiento orientado a este colectivo.",

And yet, there are many aspects of grief which challenge our everyday understanding. It is difficult to comprehend, for example, that bereaved individuals are often so angry and aggressive that they alienate those who try to help them, or that some seem to search for the deceased, although they know that this is futile. A theory of grief should help one to understand these symptoms. It should also explain why the death of a loved person results in enduring physical and mental impairment for some people when the majority of bereaved individuals seem to be able to cope with the loss without such health deterioration. But, most importantly, a theory of grief should allow one to develop strategies of therapy to ameliorate or prevent pathological grief reactions.",

It can occur in any workplace environment, but, in the past several years, its prevalence in the healthcare industry has gained more attention. Burnout has been defined as consisting of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment. Up to 40% of physicians have reported burnout. Risk factors that contribute to physician burnout include female gender, young age, long working hours, low job satisfaction, and presence of a work–home conflict. Physical activity, mindfulness, and institutional wellness programs that include cognitive behavioral therapy and stress management may reduce the prevalence of burnout in healthcare workers.",

      "abstract": "The combination of hearing loss, recruitment, poor speech discrimination and tinnitus, which is characteristic of acute cochlear disorders, can be accounted for on the basis of a decoupling of hair cells from their drive system, the tectorial membrane. Decoupling may either be caused by a temporary reduction of ciliary stiffness (shown to occur during periods of noise-induced temporary threshold shifts) or by temporary and/or chronic ciliary pathology (demonstrated to exist in cases of antibiotic ototoxicity and in endolymphatic hydrops). Since ciliary coupling is elastic in nature, the decoupling is only partial. The hearing loss and the tinnitus are manifestations of the reduced coupling per se, the magnitude of the loss depending on the degree of decoupling and the number of hair cells involved. Recruitment and poor speech discrimination result from center-clipping of the signal waveform applied to an involved hair cell, the direct corollary of partial, ciliary decoupling.",

The case of Emma, who was presented to the pediatric emergency room, with numerous physiological complaints, such as; dizziness, severe headache, unconsciousness, vomiting. Specific examinations showed the absence of any possible organic cause. Based on the sessions conducted with the patient, it appears that the girl was sexually abused. During the clinical conversation, the patient is very withdrawn, isolated and does not want to talk. Appreciating her silence, the use of art therapy was seen as appropriate. Art therapy reached very interesting findings, which were later confirmed by other medical examinations as well as subsequent conversations with the patient. Art therapy was used to assess her emotional, cognitive and rational state. Its use increased the efficiency of assessment and promoted the definition of treatment objectives. The girl was asked to draw all the members of her family. Interpretation of drawing when observed for therapeutic purposes.",

      "abstract": "One problem, as noted in Part 1 of this article, is the flawed process of diagnosing thyroid disorders. Even when a patient is obviously symptomatic, his or her condition may go unrecognized by orthodox physicians because they focus so exclusively on the results of conventional thyroid blood tests. These tests do not directly measure the functioning of the entire thyroid system, which includes both the central production of T4 hormone and the conversion of T4 to T3 at the tissue level. This conversion process, which occurs outside of the thyroid gland itself, is essential because T3 is the active form of thyroid hormone that works in the body’s cells.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics 3q29 recurrent deletion is characterized by global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, and commonly, speech delay, and increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders (including autism spectrum disorder, anxiety disorder, psychosis, and/or schizophrenia). Other common findings are failure to thrive and feeding problems in infancy that persist into childhood, heart defects (especially patent ductus arteriosus), gastrointestinal disorders (including gastroesophageal reflux disease), and dental abnormalities. To date findings in fewer than 50 affected individuals have been reported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of the 3q29 recurrent deletion is established by detection of the 1.6-Mb heterozygous deletion by chromosomal microarray at the approximate position of chr3:195998129-197623129 in the reference genome (NCBI Build 38). Management Treatment of manifestations: Early speech and language therapy to address speech delays; physical therapy as needed to address fine and gross motor delays; individualized education program (IEP) for school-age children; care by a child psychiatrist/psychologist as needed for neuropsychiatric disorders; feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube as needed; routine management of dental caries, congenital heart defects, recurrent ear infections. Surveillance: Continued assessment of feeding and nutrition, developmental milestones, cognitive development, and possible neuropsychiatric manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Parents and older and younger sibs of a proband should be tested for the 3q29 recurrent deletion to encourage close assessment/monitoring of developmental milestones (in children) and monitoring for neuropsychiatric manifestations (in children and adults). Genetic counseling The 3q29 recurrent deletion is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Although most deletions are de novo, inherited deletions have been reported. If the 3q29 recurrent deletion identified in the proband is not identified in one of the parents, the risk to sibs is low (",

      "title": "Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The term \"brain death\" (BD) is used to indicate a clinical situation characterized by the irreversible loss of all brain functions; the identification of this condition is closely linked to the development of intensive care medicine that, with mechanical ventilation, allows the maintenance of somatic functions even when cerebral functions are ceased. BD diagnosis is essentially based on the presence of three cardinal clinic criteria: 1) coma or unresponsiveness, 2) absence of brainstem reflexes 3) absence of spontaneous breathing, evaluated with apnea test. For BD diagnosis the following prerequisites must be scrupolously considered: knowledge of the proximate cause of coma and confirmation of its irreversibility; exclusion of confounding clinical variables (severe electrolyte, acid-base, endocrine disturbances); hypothermia and/or hypotension; drug intoxication or poisoning. Ancillary tests used in BD confirmation are represented by neurophysiological methods to highlight the loss of bioelectrical brain activity (EEG, evoked potential (EP)) and methods for demonstration of cerebral circulatory arrest (TransCranial Doppler (TCD); Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT); conventional Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA); CT angiography; MRI angiography). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ancillary tests are able to confirm the complete cessation of all brain functions and then, in adults, ancillary tests are not needed for the clinical diagnosis of brain death and they should never replace the clinical neurological examination. However, even though ancillary tests are not mandatory but only optional in many countries, they continue to be used, especially when there are factors that may interfere with the complete clinical assessment or when apnea test cannot be performed. Although BD is a relatively simple clinical diagnosis, there are substantial differences in perceptions and practices regarding its declaration among countries, states and even between hospitals worldwide. There are also cultural and religious obstacles—especially in lower-income countries—to the determination of death with neurologic criteria, which lead to the suspension of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, health organizations should implement educational campaigns to improve knowledge and awareness of current criteria among the population, and national and international scientific societies should also make every efforts to validate and standardize clinical and laboratory criteria. Finally, it should reminded and underlined that the ultimate purpose of brain death determination should be to increase the number of organs donated, to improve the quality of life of organ recipients.",

      "title": "Treatment of Female Endocrinopathies",
      "abstract": "THE endocrine glands have, since first discovered, offered a very perplexing problem to the clinician both in diagnosis and therapy. Rapid strides have been made in the understanding of the function of the various glands and their interaction, but this is far from complete. Knowledge of the glands which control the female sex function is perhaps more advanced than in any other field of endocrinology and many of the functional disorders of the female are recognized as glandular in origin. But the mechanism of this complex function has not been sufficiently demonstrated so as to serve as a basis of specific therapy. The identity and individuality of some of the hormones have not been determined, and in many cases it has not been proven which hormones cause certain reactions. Also, endocrine disorders are not the result of the lack of or the over-abundance of a single hormone with complete normalcy of the other glands. The abnormal function of one gland is usually accompanied by decreased function in some of the other glands of the endocrine system, with compensatory hyperactivity of still others, depending upon the normal interaction of the glands. For these reasons organotherapy is not sufficient in treating functional disorders of the female, though we have some of the hormones in pure form and in potent concentration. We have, therefore, sought some other means of treating the cases which might more nearly relieve the cause of the disorder than glandular products which are purely substitutional in action. We refer to irradiation of the pituitary gland. This method of treatment is not very recent; however, it has been used more extensively in Europe than in this country. It was introduced by Hofbauer (1), in 1922, before the German Gynecological Congress. Rubin (2, 3), in 1926, and Kaplan (4) reported the use of x-ray therapy to the ovaries and to the pituitary gland in cases of amenorrhea and functional sterility. Ford (6) and Drips (5), in 1928, and Collins et al. (7), in 1936, found irradiation helpful in relieving the symptoms associated with the menopause. Recently (1935), Newell and Pettit (8) reported excellent results in cases of functional dysmenorrhea treated with pituitary irradiation. Mazer and Spitz (9), in 1935, found irradiation helpful in the functional menstrual disorders. In using x-ray to the pituitary gland we make no pretense of explaining its method of action. We have found that it is effective, which must be sufficient for the time being: no one as yet really knows how it works. This is attested to by the fact that there is such a wide divergence of opinion as to its modus operandi. Some able clinicians say that all x-ray is destructive, hence irradiation can be beneficial only when there is a state of hyperfunction, and reduction of the activity of the gland is indicated.",

Diffuse alopecias include telogen and anagen effluvium, are usually self-limited, and depend on stopping the underlying cause (e.g., stress). Patterned hair loss, specifically androgenetic alopecia, is the most common form of alopecia; it is typically genetic, and first-line treatment is minoxidil. Oral finasteride is another treatment available for male patients. Focal hair loss includes alopecia areata, which is typically self-limited and treated with intralesional corticosteroid or oral immunosuppressant therapy; tinea capitis, which is treated with oral antifungals; and traction alopecia, which is treated by decreasing tension on the hair. Hair loss can be caused by several systemic diseases. A comprehensive history and physical examination, with targeted laboratory testing, may elucidate malnutrition, autoimmune diseases, and endocrine disease. Patients with moderate to severe hair loss are more likely to have accompanying anxiety, depression, and lower work productivity and quality-of-life scores. Educating patients about expected hair changes, treatment options, and realistic outcomes can help patients feel that they are being listened to and that their hair loss is being taken seriously.",

      "abstract": "Structural damage of the human brain (perinatal damage, cerebral trauma, head injury, cerebrovascular and degenerative diseases, intracranial tumor, metabolic diseases, toxins, drug-induced seizures) may lead to chronic epilepsy in survivors. Epidemiologic analyses show that a considerable time-delay occurs between the exposure of the brain to injury and the appearance of seizures. Such seizures are usually partial or mixed, may develop at any age, and are difficult to treat. In rats subjected to structural damage of the brain induced by sustained convulsions triggered by systemic administration of the cholinergic agent pilocarpine, spontaneous seizures may develop after a mean latency of 14-15 days. The mean frequency of spontaneous recurrent convulsions remains constant for several months. Evolution of these convulsions proceeds through several electrographic and behavioral stages resembling kindling. Kindling may be otherwise induced in rodents by repeated systemic administration of convulsants or by repeated electrical stimulation of sensitive brain regions. These observations demonstrate that structural damage of the brain may lead to spontaneously recurrent convulsions (chronic epilepsy) in rats and that kindling may be involved in the evolution of such a condition. This finding suggests that kindling mechanisms underlie the development of epileptic foci from structural brain lesions. Such mechanisms may be involved in the etiology of some forms of epilepsy in humans.",

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

Every one is familiar with the fact that certain patients maintain a relatively high pressure with little or no loss of visual fields, while others continue to lose field even though the tension is apparently within normal limits.

      "title": "Prevalence of Thyroid Disorders in Children at a Tertiary Care Hospital in Western India",
      "abstract": "Disorders of thyroid gland are the commonest endocrine disorder in India [1].With a population of around 1.25 billion, an estimated 42 million people would be suffering from thyroid disorders [1].It is a spectrum of disorders manifesting either as hypo or hyper functioning of the thyroid gland reflected in the circulating levels of Tri-iodothyronin (T3), Thyroxin (T4) and Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).The disorders of thyroid hormone can be due to diseases of the thyroid gland itself (primary), secondary to pituitary disorder (secondary) or due to hypothalamic diseases (tertiary) [2].Thyroid hormones are invaluable in their role in maintenance of growth, metabolism and mental development in infants and children.Congenital hypothyroidism is the most common preventable cause of mental retardation with an incidence of 1:2500-2800 live births in India [3,4].Hypothyroidism, during later years, when brain development is completed, leads to slow growth and delayed skeletal maturation [5].On the other hand, hyperthyroidism is rare in children [4].It can induce rapid skeletal growth and maturation and other systemic effects due to increased metabolic activity [5].The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction depends on gender, age, ethnic and geographical background and most importantly on iodine intake.Therefore, data of thyroid disorders from one population cannot be extrapolated to other.Despite the successful implementation and widespread coverage of National Iodine Deficiency Diseases Control Program (NIDDCP) in India, thyroid disorders are still prevalent in many parts of the country [6].Highlighting the lack of attention paid to thyroid disorders, Thyroid Research and Practice advocated inclusion of thyroid diseases in the list of non-communicable disease of public health importance [7].This prospective, observational study was carried out to determine the prevalence, clinical profile, aetiology and associated co-morbidities of thyroid dysfunction in children visiting a tertiary care hospital in Western India.These children were also followed up with appropriate therapy to look for response to therapy and complications of the same. MAterIAls And MethOdsChildren below 12 years of age who visited the Pediatric Out-Patient Department (OPD) and in-patient department (IPD) of a tertiary care hospital in wetern India were included if they had clinical suspicion of thyroid dysfunction.Ethical clearance was obtained from the Institute Ethics Committee and a written informed consent was taken from either of the parents/ legal guardian.A total of 23,460 OPD patients and 9,351 IPD patients visiting the hospital over a period of one and half years (December 2008 to June 2010) were screened.Inclusion criteria were newborns and children below 12 years with clinical features suggestive of thyroid disorders like prolonged jaundice in newborn, features of cretinism, goiter, physical and mental growth retardation, obesity, constipation etc. Patients who were on any medications known to alter the thyroid hormone status including patients already diagnosed with thyroid disorder on therapy and patient in whom an informed consent could not be obtained were excluded from the study.A total of 498 patients were recruited, 300 from OPD and 198 from IPD. Demographic data (age, sex, address) including family history of thyroid disorders, use of iodized salt, data related to symptoms suggestive of thyroid hypo-or hyper-function (eg.dry skin, lethargy, developmental delay, prolonged neonatal jaundice, constipation) were recorded.Anthropometric measurements were noted and compared with the CDC references.Vital parameters were recorded and complete systemic examination was done.Examination of the thyroid gland",

      "title": "[Psychological stress and sudden death].",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",

For inflammatory skin disorders, suggestions can often influence the inflammatory process through neurohormonal or other mechanisms. For chronic viral infections such as the wart virus, hypnosis can help boost the delayed cellular immune response to eliminate the problem. Hypnotic suggestions can decrease discomfort and itching and alter habits such as scratching or picking or compliance with treatment. Teaching the patient self-hypnosis can strengthen the effectiveness of suggestions and increase the likelihood of permanent change through repeated hypnotic suggestions. Choosing moments when the patient appears to be strongly absorbed or in light trance can be key times to insert appropriate hypnomoment suggestions during regular office visits. For persistent skin disorders not responding to ordinary suggestions, psychosomatic hypnoanalysis may help reveal and permit correction of root problems to permit improvement or healing.",

A toxic effect is an adverse effect that arises through an exaggeration of the same pharmacological effect that is responsible for the therapeutic effect of the drug, for example hypokalaemia due to diuretic therapy, and is therefore dose related. A side effect is an adverse effect that arises through some pharmacological action other than that which produces the therapeutic effect; such effects may be dose related (for example anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants) or not dose related (for example a rash associated with an antibiotic). Because dose-related side effects can also be regarded as toxic effects, it is better to avoid the terms ‘toxic effects’ and ‘side effects’ and to use instead the term ‘adverse effects’, which covers all types of unwanted effects.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "title": "Temporomandibular joint dislocation due to atypical antipsychotic-induced acute dystonia: a case report",
      "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes sustained muscle contractions, repetitive twisting movements, and abnormal postures of the trunk, neck, face, arms or legs [Fahn et al. 1987]. It may be focal, segmental (multifocal), or generalized and may also be primary or secondary based on their etiology. It may manifest as oculogyric crisis, deviation of eyes in all directions, protrusion of tongue, trismus, lock jaw, torticolis, laryngeal spasm, difficulty in speaking, facial grimacing, opisthotonus, lordosis or scoliosis and tortipelvic crisis. Drug-induced dystonia are secondary dystonias which occur commonly with drugs with antidopaminergic effects such as antipsychotics and metoclopramide [Ropper and Samuels, 2009; Fadare and Owolabi, 2009]. They reportedly arise from a drug-induced alteration of dopaminergic–cholinergic balance in the nigrostriatum (i.e. basal ganglia). Most drugs produce dystonic reactions by nigrostriatal dopamine D2 receptor blockade, which leads to an excess of striatal cholinergic output. High-potency D2 receptor antagonists are most likely to produce an acute dystonic reaction [Marsden and Jenner, 1980]. Agents that balance dopamine blockade with muscarinic M1 receptor blockade, such as atypical antipsychotics, are less likely to cause dystonic reactions [Marsden and Jenner, 1980; Volkow et al. 1998]. The incidence of acute dystonic reactions varies according to individual susceptibility, drug identity and dose of the drug. Increased age may carry less risk for the development of dystonia because of diminished numbers of D2 receptors. It occurs commonly to young males who are naive to antidopaminergic drugs [Volkow et al. 1998].\r\n\r\nOromandibular dystonia is one of the focal dystonias, which can be presented as jaw clenching, jaw opening or jaw deviation and leads to impaired speech and swallowing [Eken et al. 2009]. At times, oromandibular dystonia is so severe that it can cause temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation. So far, few case reports have been published about TMJ dislocation due to antipsychotic medications [Ibrahim and Brooks, 1996]. Among antipsychotic-induced TMJ dislocation, case reports were mainly for high-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol [Eken et al. 2009; Ibrahim and Brooks, 1996; Zakariaei et al. 2012]. It has been proposed that drugs such as risperidone and amisulpride which block specific receptors of serotonin (the S-HT2 receptors) and dopamine (the D2 receptors) are less likely to cause these effects [Owens, 1994]. Therefore, the present paper reports a case of oromandibular dystonia with TMJ dislocation with atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and amisulpride.",

On the other hand, ablation frequently generates undesirable complications, such as uncontrolled overactivity of a modulating organ and a need for major, lifelong replacement therapy. Perplexities mount when the primary cause of the endocrinopathy is called into question. Is the hyperactive organ the true culprit, or is it merely a puppet manipulated by an organ in a higher order of the endocrine hierarchy?

      "abstract": "Abstract. Many older people with hearing and vision loss experience reduced communicative capacity. Medical treatments (eg. cerumen removal, lens replacement), and ‘;instant’ therapies (eg. slowed speech, close proximity) may improve communication in the short term. In serious cases, specialist therapists may need to implement longer‐term intervention (eg. environmental control, perceptual aids, communication training). Recurrent communication breakdown can have devastating consequences for interpersonal relationships and psychosocial well‐being. Some older people with severe sensory impairment are able to interact only with skilled communication partners. This condition of age‐related communicative dependence on others has major implications for health care and professional education.",

      "abstract": "Religion and spirituality plays a significant role in the lives of many individuals around the world. However, the importance of religion and spirituality to various domains of psychiatry (psychopathology, explanatory models, treatment seeking, treatment adherence, outcome, etc.) has not received much attention. Religious beliefs influence help seeking, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of the individuals. Religious delusions are on its rise in the new era. Evidence suggests that those with religious delusions take longer to establish service contact, receive more medications, have overall higher symptom scores, and have poor socio-occupational functioning. Those with religious delusion are more likely to receive magical-religious healing, are not satisfied with psychiatric treatment, and are more likely not to adhere to psychiatric treatment. Evidence also suggests that those with religious delusions have poor outcome and more frequently indulge in violence and self-harm. Religious delusions can influence the health beliefs models and consequently lead to poor treatment compliance.",

      "title": "The role of depression in coronary artery disease",
      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

Lesional headaches follow a sinusitis or an arthrosis, or accompany a \"temporal arteritis of Horton\". Functional headaches include several varieties. 1. Trigemellar neuralgia. 2. Vascular algia originating from the basal arteries, the large cerebral venous sinuses or the branches of the external carotid. Among these are: a) headaches due to a dilatation of the internal wall, causing \"Horton headache\", migrain-like psychosomatic migraine and hormonal migraines (premenstrual, menstrual, menopausal or linked to the use of contraceptive pills); b) headaches caused by an angiospasm of the arteriole, which is the case in exposure to the cold, in traumatic headaches (malfunction of temporomandibular articulation, dry alveolitis), in psychosomatic angiospastic algias and in ethmoidal artery algias previously described by the author in 1949 (Godin's disease). 3. Headaches due to psychic hypertension. 4. Postconcussional psychogenic headaches. 5. Neurotic headaches. The author gives a detailed description of the subjective symptoms in each case, including localisation, form, intensity, duration course and associated phenomenons. This facilitates greatly the differential diagnosis and the choice of complementary examinations. Necessary biological investigations should be performed (e.g. hormonal balance). One should however avoid to increase the number of complementary examinations which would only delay treatment and would expose patients to somatisation. Furthermore, in each case drug treatment, periarterial infiltration technics of the temporal, internal frontal, facial, mastoid and occipital arteries are described. The necessity of questioning the patient at length and to listen to him to enable him to verbalise conscious conflicts is emphasized. A serious medicopsychological examination and a relaxation treatment to reduce anxiety and muscular tension are advised in some cases.",

However, the influence of noise on the vegetative functions is not so clear. In addition to existing investigations on vegetative functional disturbances, the role of noise as a risk factor has to be determined and its effects have to be quantified. The significance of noise‐induced sleep disturbances in relation to health and well‐being, is also controversial. The hypothesized causal connection between acoustical stimulation and the occurrence of disorders, includes primary‐effects (e.g. awakenings) and after‐effects (e.g. changes in mood or performance). To date, it has not been feasible to determine late after‐effects, such as health disorders. The most often reported sociopsychological effect of noise is general annoyance, whereby annoyance is defined as disturbance of communication, rest, recreation or concentration. Some results indicate a higher sensitivity of critical groups (e.g. old people, the sick, children, pregnant women).",

      "abstract": "From a sprained ankle to a brain injury to a total hip replacement, when something limits our ability to move or perform daily activities, life can be miserable. This is where physical therapists (PTs) step in. PTs help people--from the very young to the very old--restore function, improve mobility, relieve pain, and prevent or limit permanent physical disabilities. As Director of University of Delaware's Infant Motor Behavior Lab, PT Cole Galloway helps infants born at high risk for movement problems learn to coordinate head, arm, and leg actions. Within a few days of working with very young infants, he realized he had found his niche. Overview of the field. PTs help people with physical disabilities, caused by a range of conditions, improve mobility and relieve pain. The conditions PTs treat may be orthopedic (bone-, joint-, and muscle-related) such as a fracture, dislocation, or osteoporosis; neurological (brain-related) such as a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or Parkinson's disease; or cardiopulmonary (heart- and blood vessel-related) such as congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. PTs work in a variety of settings, including hospitals, private practices, home-health agencies, schools, sports-and-fitness facilities, company offices, nursing homes, and research labs within universities. Finding a niche. I love movement--whether through playing sports or dancing--so it seems natural to have a career that allows me to help people who have significant problems moving. I began my path with an undergraduate degree in biology and exercise science, followed by an additional bachelor's degree in physical therapy (at the time, a graduate degree was not required). I then went to work at a wonderful rehab hospital for several years, helping adults with severe brain and spinal cord injuries. I really enjoyed my work there, but at the same time, it led me to consider a whole host of research questions about the brain and how best to help people relearn to use their arms and hands after brain injuries. So, I went back to school for a doctorate in neurophysiology (basically, how the brain works). From that experience, I realized I was very interested in the control of reaching movements, so I started at the very beginning--studying how reaching first emerges in infants. Helping babies move. I run a research lab within the Department of Physical Therapy. We help infants born with injuries--usually of the brain or spinal cord--who have difficultly learning to use their hands for reaching or their legs for walking. For instance, we create specific play activities for babies with reaching problems, which allow families to help their children learn to use their arms and hands. To enable babies with leg-movement problems to explore their worlds, we are developing robot-assisted power wheelchairs (also called power chairs). This project is especially exciting as we get to work with engineers to develop a vehicle that is fun and functional for very young infants. …",

Entre las hipotesis que se barajan en la literatura cientifica, las mas populares hacen referencia a la existencia de un deficit en el procesamiento fonologico o conciencia fonologica que consiste en una incapacidad para segmentar el flujo del habla en sus constituyentes sonoros. Todavia no se conoce con exactitud el origen de este problema aunque se han planteado dos hipotesis:\nA,- El deficit es producido por una disfuncion en un sistema especifico para el habla.\nB,- El deficit es producido por una deficiencia auditiva mas general caracterizada por una dificultad para discriminar estimulos que cambian rapidamente de frecuencias.\nEsta ultima hipotesis ha sido denominada hipotesis del procesamiento temporal.\nOtro tipo de teorias hacen referencia a la existencia de dificultades en el procesamiento visual tanto a un nivel de procesos basicos, que se encuentran relacionados con la via magnocelular encargada de procesar las imagenes en movimiento durante la lectura, como de procesos superiores asociados al procesamiento ortografico o visuoespecial. En este sentido, el modelo de deficit de Symour (1997) se constituye como un modelo valido y parsimonioso que permite integrar las diferentes hipotesis mencionadas dentro de un modelo cognitivo de la lectura.\nUna de las tecnicas utilizadas en el estudio de la dislexia es la tecnica de potenciales cerebrales relacionados con eventos que consiste en el registro de la actividad cerebral debida a un proceso cognitivos inducidos por la realizacion de una d",

      "abstract": "The importance of depression as a psychopathologic syndrome in the elderly is stressed by the estimate that about 30 percent of persons over the age of 65 may be expected to experience an episode of depression severe enough to interfere with daily functioning. Depression is the chief cause of psychiatric hospitalization among the elderly, and it bears great potential for death through inanition or suicide. Loss of mastery (ability to cope) and the onset of helplessness are frequent dynamic issues in the development of depression or behavioral problems in the elderly. Geriatric stereotypes contribute directly to helplessness by reinforcing such behavior. Stereotypes also minimize the chance of appropriate response outcomes relative to needs. Rolelessness, a partial result of stereotyping, leads to anomie, alienation, and lowered self-esteem. These issues are discussed and points of interaction among them are examined. The relevance to psychotherapy with older persons is outlined.",

      "abstract": "Työn jatkuvaan keskeytymiseen on liitetty kielteisiä vaikutuksia, kuten päätöksenteon vaikeutumista sekä stressin, turhautumisen ja mahdollisesti virheiden lisääntymistä. Tässä tutkimuksessa tarkastellaan, kuinka usein terveyskeskuslääkärin työtehtävät keskeytyvät, miksi ne keskeytyvät ja miten lääkäri reagoi tehtävien keskeytymiseen. Tutkimuksessa havainnoitiin viittä terveyskeskuslääkäriä yhteensä 117 tuntia. Aineistoksi poimittiin kaikki ne tilanteet, joissa lääkärin työtehtävä keskeytyi. Keskeytyksiä löytyi yhteensä 102. Aineisto koodattiin Atlas.ti ohjelmalla ja analyysissä käytettiin sekä laadullisia että määrällisiä menetelmiä. Tulokset osoittavat, että terveyskeskuslääkärin työ keskeytyy noin kerran tunnissa vaihdellen 0.4 keskeytyksestä 1.9 keskeytykseen tunnissa. Kolme neljästä keskeytyksestä johtuu työn organisointitavasta kuten lääkäri-hoitaja työparimallista tai lääkärin tuutorointivastuusta. Loput ovat ennakoimattomia keskeytyksiä kuten tietokoneongelmia. Keskeytykset kumuloituvat niin, että niitä tulee useita peräkkäin tai myös keskeytyksen jälkeen aloitettu uusi tehtävä keskeytyy. Lähes kaikissa tapauksissa lääkäri keskeyttää sen hetkisen tehtävänsä ja siirtyy uuteen työtehtävään. Terveyskeskustyössä keskeytysten ennakoitavuus auttaa sopeutumaan niihin. Kuitenkin lääkärin työssä on myös tehtäviä, kuten vaativien lausuntojen laatiminen, jotka edellyttävät keskeytymätöntä työaikaa. Työhyvinvoinnin näkökulmasta kestävä tapa olisi järjestää lääkärille hiljaista työaikaa tai muuttaa esimerkiksi lausuntoja sellaisiksi, että niihin on mahdollisen keskeytyksenkin jälkeen helppo palata.",

If the patient's romantic ideas shaped private fantasies instead of determined public behavior, there would be little cause for concern. The situation becomes critical when the fantasies are dramatized in real life with an unsuspecting and usually unwilling man cast in the role of the lover. The woman dwells on the feelings she ascribes to her \"suitor.\" Such delusional thinking, resulting from an ego defect and producing bizarre actions, may be shaped largely by feelings of being unloved or even unloveable; a narcissistic blow is overcome by a grandiose fantasy. Cases in which erotomania is prominent are usually diagnosed as paranoid state or paranoid schizophrenia.",

Symptomatic hypotension (almost always with a blood pressure fall greater than or equal to 20/10 mm Hg) may reflect unrecognized medication effects or a variety of other causes. Autonomic neuropathies include those secondary to diabetes, peripheral autonomic impairment (the Bradbury-Eggleston syndrome), central autonomic impairment (the Shy-Drager syndrome), or newly described gene defects such as dopamine-beta-hydroxylase deficiency (which causes the absence of norepinephrine with an accumulation of dopamine). Baroreceptor dysfunction causes wide swings in blood pressure that are unrelated to posture, whereas a variety of stimuli (cough, micturition, or carotid sinus pressure) may precipitate paroxysmal parasympathetic activation, and sympathetic orthostatic hypotension associated with hypovolemia may occur with mitral valve prolapse or as an idiopathic condition. The differentiation of these and other causes of symptomatic hypotension may in many cases lead to beneficial therapy.",

      "title": "A Case to Tear One's Hair Out: Trichotillomania in Wilson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ATPase copper transporting beta (ATP7B) gene, which lead to abnormal copper deposition in different body tissues. An estimated 50% of patients report neurological or psychiatric manifestations.1 Common symptoms that may appear and progress in time are tremor, ataxia, dysphagia, dysarthria, and personality changes.2 Here we present a unique case of a patient with WD, with trichotillomania as one of the presenting signs. A 21-year-old man with no family history of psychiatric or neurological diseases and born out of a nonconsanguineous marriage presented to the outpatient department with a 3-month history of mixed movement disorders and psychiatric disturbances. On neurological examination, he demonstrated impaired verbal communication in which his speech was delayed and reduced; choreiform movements of his head, neck, trunk, and upper limbs; a shuffling gait; and an ‘irresistible’ urge to pull out his facial hair (Video 1). The patient said that he could not stop these compulsions, but there was no interference with his activities of daily life. His mother told us that at home he spent at least 3 hours per day on this behavior and also pulled out hair from his armpits and pubic area while showering. Laboratory investigations showed a serum ceruloplasmin level of 26 mg/L (normal, 180–300 mg/L), serum copper level of 4 umol/L (normal, 11–19 umol/L), and a 24-hour urinary copper excretion level of 3.9 (normal, <1.0). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (Fig. 1) revealed bilateral slit-like areas of low T1 and high T2 signals in both putamens attributed to deposits of paramagnetic material. Genetic testing identified a novel homozygous nonsense variant c.1147C > T p.(Gln383*) in the ATP7B gene, confirming WD. Initially, he was commenced on chelation treatment as an inpatient (zinc 50 mg 3 times a day and trientine 500 mg twice a day) for copper reduction. He was discharged, although he remained highly dependent on family with activities of daily life. Furthermore, he was referred for neuropsychiatric evaluation but failed to attend his appointments. Neurological status and behavioral abnormalities were unchanged 4 months after discharge. The copper-transporting protein ATP7B mediates in biliary copper excretion and copper incorporation in ceruloplasmin before secretion into the plasma. In patients with WD, defective ATP7B function results in the accumulation of copper in body tissues (eg, liver, brain, corneas of the eyes) and rapid degradation of ceruloplasmin in the bloodstream, which leads to low levels of copper and ceruloplasmin in serum.2 All available therapies aim to restore the negative copper balance. Chelating agents that increase copper excretion, such as D-penicillamine and trientine, are effective therapies for most patients. In patients with neurological manifestations, zinc, which interferes with the uptake of copper in the gastrointestinal tract, may have a role in the first-line treatment as well.3 Liver transplantation should be considered in patients with acute liver failure. Trichotillomania, also known as “hair-pulling disorder,” was previously considered an impulse control disorder, but in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, is classified as a form of obsessive–compulsive behavior.4 It is characterized as a recurrent, overwhelming urge to pull out one's own hair, resulting in subsequent hair loss.5 Hair from the scalp as well as eyebrows, beards, or other body parts can be affected. The exact cause of trichotillomania is unknown, but several factors including genetic and environmental factors might play a role. Co-occurring depression and anxiety have frequently been described, along with other body-focused repetitive behaviors, such as nail biting, head banging, and skin picking. Obsessive–compulsive behavior as a presenting sign of WD has only sporadically been described in 2 patients with obsessions of contamination and compulsions of hand washing.6, 7 However, more recent research revealed an important role of the basal ganglia networks in the pathogenesis of obsessive–compulsive disorders in children and adults.8 Specifically, functional imaging studies have demonstrated different patterns of connectivity in limbic and frontostriatal circuits, the same areas that are involved with copper deposition in WD.9 To our knowledge, this is the first report of trichotillomania as one of the presenting signs in a patient with neurological WD.

      "abstract": "Abstract Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is highly prevalent in society, affecting both men and women. More than the sociological meaning of hair loss, it has become a very important part of self-identity or “body image.” A psychological concept of body image refers to one's thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and behavioral changes related to one's physical looks. In spite of alopecia's common occurrence, it often leads to psychological disturbance and distress. Hair thinning and perceived hair loss also has a very important negative impact on the psyche of the individual. The common emotional aspects associated are self-consciousness, embarrassment, frustration, and jealousy. Knowledge of these effects among the clinicians managing hair loss patients is beneficial. The clinician must make an active effort to identify the borderline group of patients with body dysmorphic syndrome so as to manage them with psychotherapeutic medication for their hair loss prior to hair transplantation. This article aims to provide important information and an understanding of how the psychology gets affected due to hair loss, particularly AGA and its management to the practicing hair transplant surgeons.",

      "title": "Androgen replacement therapy in men: current evidence and controversy",
      "abstract": "The decline in Testosterone (T) levels in the ageing male - known as andropause or late-onset hypogonadism - may be responsible for several aspects of quality of life decline in older men: erectile dysfunction, impaired libido, decreased strength and energy, sarcopenia, osteopenia, fatigue and even depression in some cases. Many of these signs and symptoms represent the same alterations that are usually attributed to the process of ageing. When some individual presents with such symptoms, hypogonadism should be suspected, and serum T level should be evaluated. Men who are symptomatic and present low levels of serum Testosterone (generally below 300 ng/ml) are candidates for T replacement therapy. Current evidence shows that, when correctly selected, patients receiving T replacement may benefit from improvement in libido, erectile function, overall and sexual related quality of life, bone density and muscle mass. Conversely, patients with physiological circulating levels of T who receive hormone, aiming at supraphysiologic levels, may face severe side effects, including testicular atrophy and behavioral changes. Of note, T replacement, regardless of age and pre-therapy levels, leads to fertility impairment which can be transient or persistent. Direct testosterone replacement should not be indicated in men who wish to conceive children, although other options are available. The effect of Testosterone replacement on prostate cancer and on cardiovascular risk is still controversial; hypogonadal men known to have prostate cancer or high cardiovascular risk should be examined individually to have their risks stratified and mitigated.",

      "abstract": "The concept of work-related is controversial in all countries and its design varies depending on the different legal precepts of each one. The objective of this study is to assess the circumstances of a case of a work accident claim resulting in the death of employee suffering from epilepsy and in which, as the result of a crisis, a brain trauma occurs with fatal consequences. Laborer contingency is claimed, but it is denied in the first instance by the Mutual of occupational accidents and diseases. In Spain, the legal definition of an accident at work has been developed by case-law in virtually all the elements that constitute it. It contemplates the concept of gainful employment, damage or injury caused, of physical and mental injury, and it deems as injury or accident not only what results from the sudden and violent action of an external agent on the human body, but also the damage that comes from certain diseases such as internal processes, sudden or slow action, or arising or originating from the job. With common diseases such as epilepsy, the lack of a strict or direct causal link between epilepsy and work does not preclude any legal presumption to the harmful results caused by seizures in the place and time of the job (death or injuries from falls caused by the crisis), as these may have occurred during work.",

      "title": "Diagnostic Tools for Insomnia",
      "abstract": "In a general sense, insomnia suggests inadequate sleep quality or quantity when one has an adequate opportunity to sleep. When defined as a sleep disorder, insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep, which may represent problems with sleep maintenance or early morning awakening despite attempts to be sleeping. Sleep disorder nosologies also may include a complaint of nonrefreshing sleep as an insomnia complaint. For a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder to be made, daytime consequences or functional impairment also should be present. These may include fatigue, inability to concentrate, or irritability. Insomnia may be characterized as primary or comorbid (1). Primary insomnia occurs independently while comorbid insomnia presumably is associated with a sleep disturbance related to another disorder. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the general population at least occasionally and is a severe or chronic problem for about 10% of the population. Patients with co-occurring conditions have significantly increased risk for insomnia (2). People suffering with insomnia have increased healthcare costs and utilize health resources to a greater extent. They also have worse scores on quality-of-life measures. Persistent insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for the development or exacerbation of certain psychiatric and medical conditions. Overall, insomnia represents a significant socioeconomic burden both for individuals and for society. This chapter will provide an overview of current perspectives on the causes, consequences, and associations of insomnia.ETIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AND PATHOGENESIS",

      "title": "[Biomechanical aspects of cervical trauma].",
      "abstract": "The biomechanical expert opinion on the injury mechanism is necessary in few cases only. However, the judgement of these cases is extremely compromised if mechanically wrong terms are introduced in the clinical report. Since the injury mechanism in the neck is very complex the clinical physician should concentrate on the clinical findings familiar to him; usually the clinician lacks technical case documentation and specific training in injury biomechanics. The relevant mechanisms of neck injuries are an indirect trauma induced by a) a head contact leading to compression, hyperflexion, hyperextension and/or hypertranslation and b) a non-head-contact mechanism (hyperflexion or hyperextension, hypertranslation, acceleration). A non-contact mechanism occurs e.g. during a rear end impact without head restraint (hyperextension) or a frontal collision of a belted occupant (hyperflexion) without head impact. The term \"whiplash\" is misleading and incorrect: It presumes a virtually non existing two phase movement back and forth (or vice versa) like during the development of the crack of the whip. Secondly, it mixes the physical criterion mechanism with the anatomical or morphological criterion injury e.g. distortion, sprain etc. A (head)-contact mechanism is due to a corresponding momentum exerted from the head on the neck. Again, the anatomical or morphological terms are equal, but the mechanism is different. During a contact mechanism as well as during a non-contact mechanism not only a hyperflexion or a hyperextension can occur; in the first phase of the impact also a shearing force between the upper vertebral bodies (CO-C2) may load the intervertebral structures by hypertranslation.",

      "title": "18 Velopharyngeal Dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) refers to any situation in which an individual is unable to completely close the nasal airway during speech.The velopharyngeal mechanism is comprised of a complex group of structures that act in unison to control airflow through the nose and mouth by elevation of the soft palate and constriction of both the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls (►Fig. 1).Any disruption in this mechanism may result in abnormal, poorly intelligible speech.VPD can manifest as hypernasality, nasal emission, decreased vocal intensity, and/or facial grimacing. 1Moreover, patients who suffer from VPD will frequently develop maladaptive articulations to compensate for their speech difficulties. 2umerous etiologies can be responsible for this failure of normal speech production.Myoneurogenic problems can impair muscle control or affect muscle programming.Anatomic irregularities can present as a tissue deficit, structural problems that affect function, or even mechanical interference preventing normal closure.Mislearning comprises a host of etiologies whereby the patient has developed abnormal usage of the velopharyngeal mechanism despite the absence of other pathology. 3elopharyngeal dysfunction is a carefully chosen term that simply denotes the presence of incomplete velopharyngeal closure without making suggestions as to its cause.Use of this nomenclature has gained increasing favor by experts, replacing the previous designation, velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI).This helps to avoid confusion, as VPI has been differentially interpreted as denoting insufficiency, incompetence, and inadequacy-terms that may be similar, but are not synonymous and potentially implicate the cause of the dysfunction rather than describe the clinical finding.VPD is seen in roughly 20 to 30% of individuals who have undergone cleft palate repair, 4,5 and 5 to 10% of patients with a submucous cleft palate (SMCP). 6",

Depression and sexual dysfunction have long been known as comorbid conditions; however, some research suggests that depressed mood may not always be associated with specific sexual dysfunctions. Associations between sexual dysfunction and depression appears bidirectional, such that either one of these conditions may trigger or worsen the other, while improvement in one may also improve the other. This chapter examines the complex relationship between depression and male and female sexual dysfunctions. We explore the classification and prevalence of sexual dysfunction, the known interconnections involving neurobiology, and psychological issues. Finally, we summarize the core principles of evaluation and treatment of common sexual dysfunctions, particularly in the context of depressive illness.",

This results in stretching of the neural elements and microvasculature, resulting in both direct and ischemic injury.[7] Animal studies suggest that impairment of oxidative metabolic pathways may contribute to neuronal injury.[7] Associated conditions include myelomeningocele, lipomyelomeningocele, intraspinal lipomas, diastematomyelia, thickened/fatty filum terminale, and trauma.[2] Tethering may be asymptomatic or result in a variety of symptoms including lower extremity weakness/sensory deficits, bowel/bladder dysfunction, scoliosis, pes cavus, and back/leg pain.[6] Early surgical intervention has been shown to improve outcomes and may be performed prophylactically or to prevent symptom progression.[1,3] More specifically, retrospective studies demonstrate that surgical intervention in patients under the age of 2 years is associated with improved outcomes.[5] In some cases, detethering may result in clinical improvement.[3].We present a case of a 6-month-old male with a low-lying conus medullaris, lumbar syrinx, mildly abnormal urodynamic studies, and asymmetric utilization of his lower extremities observed during the evaluation of a Y-shaped gluteal cleft. He underwent elective spinal cord detethering via the safe and effective, minimally invasive technique described in the video.The patient's parents gave informed consent for treatment and video recording. Institutional review board approval was deemed unnecessary.Given the variety of surgical techniques used for cord detethering, this video may assist other surgeons in developing techniques that require little to no compromise of the developing bony spinal column while achieving sufficient release of the spinal cord.[4].",

However, heterogeneity may be unavoidable because of the biopsychosocial complexity of depression. MDD may be characterised by complexities that cannot be distilled down to any brief set of diagnostic criteria. Psychiatrists and psychiatric epidemiologists may need to revise their expectations of this diagnosis in order to avoid over-estimating its ability to guide the selection of treatments and prediction of prognosis. An opposing perspective is that of reification, in which the diagnosis is viewed as being more real than it really is. The concept of rheostasis may help to explain some features of this condition, such as why major depressive episodes sometimes seem understandable or even adaptive (e.g. in the context of bereavement) whereas at other times such episodes are inexplicable and maladaptive.",

      "title": "The Impact of Chemical Changes in The Brain Caused by Chronic Stress Can Trigger Depression",
      "abstract": "The present research has attempted to study the link between chronic stress, the chemical changes in the brain caused by it, and depression. Chronic stress (also known as chronic strain) has been defined in a variety of ways, but it usually refers to one or more types of stress that have persisted for at least many months. Numerous chemical changes occur in the human brain when the human body is subjected to chronic stress over a lengthy period. Chronic or ongoing stress can cause several psychological and physiological problems and stress has been found to influence brain chemicals including cortisol and corticotropin-releasing factor. Cortisol levels that are elevated for an extended period have been related to mood disorders and hippocampus shrinkage in the brain. Stress is a key contributor to chronic inflammation in the body. Furthermore, diabetes and heart disease can also be caused by chronic inflammation. Chronic stress elevates cortisol levels in the blood and has an effect on serotonin levels in the body. This contributes to the fact that continuous stress causes a series of chemical changes in the human brain, which may simply make the individual more prone to developing depression or relapsing (the condition is prone to recur in someone who has recovered). These physiological and biochemical changes make the human body more sensitive to depression and make it more likely to acquire the mental illness (known as Major Depressive Disorder). The current study examined many research studies that support a substantial relationship between chronic stress and depression",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a sleep disorder, which is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) that is typically associated with cataplexy, sleep fragmentation and other REM sleep-related phenomenon such as sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucination. Narcoleptic symptoms can be developed from various medical or neurological disorders. A 17-year-old male patient admitted for the evaluation of EDS which started three-month ago. He slept more than 18 hours a day with cataplexy and hypnagogic hallucination. He was obese with body mass index (BMI) of 30.4 kg/. After admission he was newly diagnosed to the thyrotoxicosis. T3 391.2 ng/dL (60-181), free T4 4.38 ng/dL (0.89-1.76), TSH /mL (0.35-5.5) were measured. His pulse rate ranged 70-90 beats per minute and blood pressure ranged 150/100-120/70 mmHg. Polysomnography revealed many fragmentations in sleep with many positional changes (81 times/h). Sleep onset latency was 33.5 min, sleep efficiency was 47.9%, and REM latency from sleep onset was delayed to 153.6 min. REM sleep percent was increased to 27.1%. Periodic limb movement index was 13.4/h. In the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), average sleep latency was 0.4 min and there were noted 3 SOREMPs (Sleep Onset REM sleep period) on 5 trials. We couldn't discriminate the obvious sleep-wake pattern in the actigraph and his HLA DQB1 type was negative. His thyroid function improved following treatment with methimazole and propranolol. Vital sign maintained within normal range. Cataplexy was controlled with venlafaxine 75 mg. Subjective night sleep continuity and PLMS were improved with clonazepam 0.5 mg, but the EDS were partially improved with modafinil 200-400 mg. Thyrotoxicosis might give confounding role when we were evaluating the EDS, though sleep fragmentation was one of the major symptoms of narcolepsy, but enormous amount of it made us think of the influence of thyroid hormone. The loss of sleep-wake cycle, limited improvement of EDS to the stimulant treatmen, and the cataplexy not supported by HLA DQB1 should be answered further. We still should rule out idiopathic hypersomnia and measuring CSF hypocretin level would be helpful.",

Generalized anxiety disorder produces fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. This worry could be multifocal such as finance, family, health, and the future. It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. Anxiety and worry associated with at least three of the following: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued, difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance.",

      "title": "Key Facts About Tinnitus",
      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound when there is no external sound present, often described as a ringing, buzzing, humming, clicking, or cicada-like sound. Less commonly, tinnitus can be heard as a musical tune or a pulsing sound in time with a person's heartbeat. It may be one or multiple sounds, and it may be constant or intermittent. It can be heard as coming from one or both ears or from within the head. Research shows that most people hear tinnitus when they are asked to listen in a very quiet environment (i.e., when sitting in a sound-proof booth). Tinnitus is common and reported in all age groups. CAUSE AND HABITUATION The exact cause of tinnitus is hard to pinpoint, but it is generally understood that it results from some type of change, either mental or physical, but not necessarily related to the ear. Tinnitus can be associated with noise exposure, hearing loss, middle ear pathology or dysfunction, impacted wax, head or neck injuries, some medications, or a period of high stress. In many instances, the cause or the trigger is unknown. Tinnitus may dissipate over time or a person may habituate to it such that even though it may be audible, it is of little consequence. In some people, the tinnitus can be intrusively bothersome and significantly affect their general well-being. Seek assistance if the tinnitus: is associated with hearing difficulties. presents or changes suddenly. becomes intrusive and bothersome. interferes with sleep and/or your ability to concentrate. impacts general well-being. is in one ear only. Individuals with tinnitus are often told that “there is nothing that can be done” or that “you will have to learn to live with it,” but this is not the case. While there is no cure, treatment options are available, and patients can successfully manage the tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a concern. Consult a general practitioner to address any underlying medical factor that may be contributing to the tinnitus. Some people require a more involved intervention, and those with distressing tinnitus often benefit from a multidisciplinary approach. In addition to a general practitioner, an ENT specialist, and an audiologist/a tinnitus specialist, others who may be involved in the rehabilitation process include physiotherapists, counsellors, sleep specialists, and/or temporomandibular joint dental specialists. Factors influencing your ability to get used to the tinnitus include current stress levels and coping abilities, emotional and physical support systems, and insight into the mechanisms of the tinnitus. Plus, understanding how all of the above interact. FINDING SUPPORT Your experience of tinnitus and its impact on your life are unique, so it's important to seek the assistance of a tinnitus specialist who can offer a holistic, evidence-based tinnitus program designed specifically for your personal situation. A tinnitus management program should provide you with a deeper understanding of tinnitus and strategies you can use to manage and reduce the symptoms. These strategies may include a combination of: sound enrichment hearing devices neuromonics treatment behavioral techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy and acceptance commitment therapy stress reduction and relaxation strategies sleep solutions TINNITUS AND HEARING If the tinnitus is accompanied by any hearing loss, the use of hearing aids can be helpful on a number of levels. Well-fitted hearing aids assist with communication, help reduce the stress and fatigue associated with intensive listening, and amplify low-level background sound. This can result in a reduction in tinnitus awareness. There are also devices that combine a hearing aid and a noise generator in a single unit, and these can provide the benefits of both. The timing and sequence of different types of intervention can play an important role in how individuals respond to treatment. A person with chronic tinnitus may be grieving for the perceived loss of silence and how this is affecting his or her life. This person may not be ready for certain types of intervention (e.g., hearing aids, maskers), and may even reject any early intervention. Before the rehabilitation process begins, it is helpful for the individual to be in a place of acceptance and to start coping emotionally.

      "abstract": "Drowning is diagnosed based upon the circumstances and the absence of a disease or injury at autopsy that better explains death. Key questions include: Was the person alive or dead before entry into the water? Did the person drown? Why did the person get into the water? Why was the person unable to survive in the water? Exposure to environmental temperatures that cause hyperthermia or hypothermia is an unnatural death. The most important issue with electrocutions is to first recognize that it is an electrocution death. Fewer than half of low voltage (less than 1000 V) burns will have a visible burn. The severity of electrical burns depends upon the voltage, the amount of current, the area of contact, and the duration of contact. There are three mechanisms by which electricity causes death: a stoppage of the heart mediated by the electrical interference of the cardiac conduction system, current passing through the central nervous system (brain) causing an electrical disruption of neuronal activity, and asphyxia, due to the paralysis of the respiratory muscles. Ferning, also known as feathering or Lichtenberg figures, is pathognomonic for a lightning strike.",

      "title": "Burnout, Compassion Fatigue and Vicarious Trauma",
      "abstract": "Compassion Fatigue (CF) in healthcare workers was first coined by Carla Joinson in 1992, in almost three decades following copious amounts of research have been done on this subject. Findings of the research indicate an astronomical growing problem, yet very little has been done to curb this problem. Today researchers agree that one of the major causes of compassion fatigue in nursing is a lack of education. Nurse’s education doesn’t include subjects dealing with self-care, burnout, vicarious trauma, and CF. Francoise Mathieu, an expert on CF, notes that after completing her degree and several courses in three different countries, she had not once heard the words self\u0002care, burnout, and CF, and nor did I until it happened to me “Burnout is a depletion or exhaustion of a person’s mental and physical resources attributed to his or her prolonged yet unsuccessful striving toward unrealistic expectations, internally or externally derived” Burnout is not trauma related and could happen to anyone in all walks of life Vicarious Trauma (VT), also known as Secondary Traumatic Stress, describes a serious shift in the worker’s worldview. VT happens when the trauma and suffering of others are transferred onto us in such a way that we are also traumatized even though we did not experience the trauma ourselves. “VT is the accumulative process: we are not referring to the most difficult story you have ever heard; we are talking about the thousands of stories you don’t even remember hearing” CF is the deep emotional and physical erosion that occurs when helping professionals are unable to refuel and regenerate. “First, you should understand that it’s a process. It’s not a matter of one day, you’re living your life with a great deal of energy and enjoyment, and the next, you wake up exhausted and devoid of any energy-both physical and emotional. Compassion fatigue develops over time-taking weeks, sometimes years to surface. It’s a low\u0002level, chronic clouding of caring and concern for others in your life whether you work in or outside the home. Compassion Fatigue and COVID-19 The C19 Pandemic has highlighted the importance of nurses, something that has always been true but has gone unappreciated for centuries. In doing research for this article I am again amazed at the amount of research that has been done to date on the effect of C19 on nurses, if all we are doing is research, we are missing the point! Another aspect of the research that I found incredible, is that most of the research done focuses on ICU nurses even though a study was done at a hospital in Wuhan comparing the frequency of burnout amongst frontline workers, clearly indicate that burnout frequency amongst ward nurses are significantly higher than ICU nurses, 39% versus 13% [2]. This was a small study of 220 frontline workers but the fact that the burnout frequency is 300% higher inward nurses should command our attention. Watching C19 related news coverage I have been struck by the lack of coverage of nursing fatalities. Physician’s deaths were headline news, interviews with family and colleagues, and then as an afterthought, oh yes, X number of nurses died. Nurse’s deaths where/are rarely a focus on the news and many nurses have taken to social media in an attempt to bring attention to the problems they are facing, as a 35- year veteran RN I find this disrespectful and so should all the nurses out there.",

      "title": "Social-Cultural Influences and Personality Disorders Favoring Drug Consumption",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact that crime is a social phenomenon, we consider necessary to analyze it as an individual action committed by a real person in an actual circumstance. We mention that crime is a human action, determined by certain psychological elements, necessities, reasons, purposes. In Romania, the evolution of the crime phenomenon is a consequence of the impact of severe socio-economic issues, characteristic of the transition period, as well as of the authority crisis transited by the competent state institutions. The defective legislation and the overburdening of the criminal justice system, associated with the lack of staff and logistics, have limited the effect of preventive and repressive measures. Therefore, people who consume substances submitted for national inspection are called drug addicts or drug abusers. According to the World Health Organization, narcomania is “the state of constant or chronic intoxication, harmful for the individual and for society, caused by the repeated consumption of a certain drug (natural or artificial) – &lt;em&gt;it is characterized by the following&lt;/em&gt; – an irresistible need to continue consuming it and acquiring it by all means, a tendency to increase its dosage and a psychical, sometimes physical addiction for the effects of the drug”. Drugs of all types have been considered “magic” pills the molecular structure of which is well known by chemists, physicians and pharmacists. In literature they are also called “millenary fragile molecules”, which from ancient times were “glorified”, but in fact they do not have supernatural powers, but deceive people, being in fact a “two-faced coin”. The first face is the one which creates appeal and the second is the one which creates addiction, making us change our behavior and avoid our family and lose our friends. Thus we can state that one of the highest challenges of humanity is represented by drug consumption. The multiple environmental changes and the set of social, economic, and psychological changes are aspects which negatively influence people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions: &lt;/strong&gt;As a general conclusion, we can state that presently, illicit drug trafficking and consumption is the most successful business. The illicit drug market is considered the most “dynamic” crime market. Regarding the facts previously mentioned, we want to show that the citizens of the European Union spend over 24 billion lei a year on drugs.",

      "title": "Low Back Pain Diagnostic Approach",
      "abstract": "Low back pain is one of the leading causes of primary care and emergency room visits and job-related disability in many countries [1]. Back pain is sorted into three categories, differentiated by the duration of symptoms. Acute back pain, which is the focus of this article, is classified as pain lasting 6 weeks or less, subacute back pain is pain that has been present between 6 and 12 weeks, and chronic back pain is pain that persists longer than 12 weeks. Etiologies of low back pain include (but are certainly not limited to) mechanical injury (e.g., muscle sprain or spasm, ligament strain, facet joint disruption), arthritis, sciatica (lumbar radiculopathy), spinal fracture, malignancy, connective tissue disease, infection (e.g., vertebral osteomyelitis, epidural abscess), cauda equina syndrome, metabolic causes (e.g., hyperparathyroidism), abdominal or retroperitoneal visceral or vascular processes, psychogenic pain, and malingering. Careful history-taking and physical examination are crucial to diagnosing the etiology of back pain. This review presents the current state of science regarding the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain.",

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

The most typical symptoms fall into four categories, encompassing intrusive memories (e.g., periodic distressing reminders of the traumatic episode), avoidance behaviors (avoidance of people or places reminiscent of the traumatic episode), negative changes in thinking and mood, along with changes in physical and emotional responses (i.e., arousal symptoms).[1] The historical epidemiology of PTSD suggests that between 5 and 10% of the general population may be affected by this condition at some point in their lives,[2] although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has contributed to significantly increase the prevalence of PTSD, with almost 20% of COVID-19-discharged patients showing symptoms.[3] Given this concerning epidemiology, the search for effective treatment options for patients with PTSD has become increasingly important in recent years.

      "title": "Paradigm shift in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy during later stages of recovery",
      "abstract": "Bell’s palsy (idiopathic peripheral neuropathy of the facial nerve) is an acute, usually unilateral paralysis of facial muscles. This disorder had been described and studied by Sir Charles Bell in 1836. In majority of Bell’s palsy cases the patient achieves full spontaneous recovery within 3-5 weeks even without treatment. In about 15-30% of cases the recovery takes considerably longer time (3 to 6 months, sometimes longer) and is usually incomplete. After the incomplete recovery of Bell’s palsy some residuals and complications usually develop. Those can include weakness of facial muscles, facial asymmetry in both neutral expression and with facial movements, pathological synkinesis, contractures of facial muscles, crocodile tears, facial pains etc.\r\n The above-mentioned complications may result in disfigured face with various degrees of severity, involuntary facial movements during speech and emotions, facial pains that are difficult to relieve with pain-killers, inability to adequately express emotions. All the named manifestations can have a dramatic impact on individual’s self-esteem, social contacts and general quality of life. They may lead to stress, depression, self-isolation and in some extreme cases – to suicidal behavior.\r\nCustomary treatment for acute Bell’s palsy include prednisone, antiviral medications, eye care to prevent drying of the cornea, mime-therapy (neuromuscular retraining). Sometimes acupuncture, chiropractors, laser therapy or high doses of B-vitamins are used. In some countries such controversial interventions as electrical stimulation (shocks) and massage with ice-cubes are being used as treatment modalities for acute Bell’s palsy. If the facial condition does not considerably improve within the first year, then the choice of treatments for residuals and complications of long-standing Bell’s palsy is rather limited. It includes continuation of mime-therapy, periodic injections of botulinum toxin, and in some exceptional cases surgical interventions (nerve graft, muscle transposition etc.) Facial nerve decompression has not been proven to be effective as Bell’s palsy treatment and therefore is nowadays seldom used. Long-standing Bell’s palsy patients are left with very limited choice of treatments for their residuals and complications. In the medical world and among rehabilitation specialists it is considered that if Bell’s palsy had not recovered within first 1-2 years and if complications had formed, then the patient will retain the developed synkinesis, contractures, related facial pains and other manifestations for the rest of his or her life.\r\nIn the recent years there has not been much research done of the underlying causes for the complications of long-standing Bell’s palsy. Without thorough understanding of such causes it is rather challenging to compose proper rehabilitation programs that deliver the desired improvements in facial symmetry and respectively, in patient’s quality of life.\r\nIn this article we discuss the traditional approach to possible causes, available treatments of Bell’s palsy complications and share our concept of a new paradigm in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy during later stages of the recovery (2 years and more). According to this new paradigm, synkinesis, contractures and mass movements of facial muscles, as well as related chronic facial pains are the result of newly-formed, pathological mimetic patterns in the CNS, which can be reduced and then reversed by applying the new approach to rehabilitation, based on other than traditional principles. The results achieved by our patients can serve as an evidence that this new approach may indicate a beginning of a paradigm shift in rehabilitation of long-standing Bell’s palsy.",

This dissertation studied the working of melatonin in individuals with intellectual disabilities who have long-term sleep problems. In their case, namely, sleep problems are often caused by a disorder in their own melatonin rhythm; in individuals without intellectual disabilities other factors (such as stress) often play a role. Melatonin not only turned out effective in the treatment of problems with falling asleep and continuing to sleep, but it also had a positive effect on behaviour problems during the day. Aggressive behaviour, such as hitting, biting and destroying, was reduced. Remarkably, in some patients the sleep problems recurred during the treatment after a few weeks because the melatonin was too slowly broken down. The advice is to only start a melatonin treatment after (in the saliva) the moment has been determined when the own melatonin production has started.",

      "abstract": "Nyeri kepala merupakan bagian dari pengalaman manusia dalam kehidupan sehari-hari dan sering kali dikeluhkan ke dokter. Yang menjadi masalah meskipun frequensi nyeri kepala dalam praktek sehari-hari sangat tinggi, adalah kesulitan penegakan diagnosis. Seringkali ada ketidakcocokan antara derajat berat keluhan nyeri kepala dan adanya faktor penyebab struktural atau organik yang memang perlu dicemaskan. Bahkan gejala berbagai jenis nyeri kepala boleh dikatakan hampir sama dan tumpang tindih, menambah kesulitan untuk mengenal atau mendiagnosis jenis nyeri kepala, yang diperlukan untuk pegangan penentuan pengobatan. Maka pemahamam neuromuskuloskeletal kepala dan leher baik dari aspek anatomi maupun fisiologi menjadi sangat penting. \r\nNyeri kepala tegang primer ada dua jenis yaitu nyeri kepala tegang episodik dan nyeri kepala tegang khronik. Nyeri kepala tegang primer paling sedikit harus mempunyai 2 dari karakteristik berikut: 1) lokasinya dua sisi, 2) terasa seperti ditekan atau diikat sekeliling kepala (tidak berdenyut), 3) dengan intensitas ringan sampai sedang, 4) tidak bertambah berat saat aktivitas rutin seperti: berjalan atau naik tangga. Tidak dijumpai sama sekali mual dan tumpah, dapat dijumpai sekali photophobia (takut sinar) atau phonophobia (takut suara). Nyeri kepala tegang kadang-kadang meluas ke tengkuk atau sebaliknya mulai dari tengkuk meluas ke kepala \r\nPada nyeri kepala tagang, puncak kepala seperti ditekan, sekeliling kepala seperti diikat. Hal ini disebabkan karena ketegangan berlebihan otot daerah dahi, otot belakang kepala, dan otot daerah pelipis. Otot-otot lain yang mengalami ketegangan pad a nyeri kepala tegang adalah otot yang berfungsi untuk menegakkan kepala. Tarikan otot berkepanjangan pada kulit tulang di daerah perlekatan otot yaitu pada tulang belakang kepala dapat menimbulkan proses peradangan yang berakitab juga timbulnya rasa nyeri di daerah tersebut. \r\nPada keadaan biasa otot-otot leher bagian belakang sudah dalam keadaan dengan tonus atau ketegangan otot tertentu untuk mempertahankan supaya kepala tetap tegak. Stres fisik karena posisi tertentu berakibat otot menjadi lelah dan teregang peregangan ini lewat kumparan otot akan menimbulkan secara refleks ketegangan otot yang akan semakin meningkat, dan dapat menjadi khronis. Pemicu lain nyeri kepala tegang primer adalah aspek psikis yang terkait dengan stres. Stres mental atau pun stres fisik setelah diterima pusat-pusat penganalisis sensorik di otak, diproyeksikan ke sistim limbik (pusat untuk emosi). Melalui jaras-jaras tertentu diproyeksikan lagi ke hipotalamus (sistem komando) yang akan meng-ekspresikannya lewat jalur otonom maupun kelenjar hormon dan jalur motorik. Nyeri kepala tegang primer umumnya dikeluhkan bersama keluhan lain yang menunjukkan hiperaktivitas otonom. Faktor pencetus penting pada nyeri kepala tegang baik faktor fisik, ataupun psikis. Di sinilah pemahaman mengenai anatomi dan fisiologi dibutuhkan, yaitu yang terkait dengan pekerjaan atau okupasi dan aktivitas fisik harian serta keadaan emosi yang mewarnai \r\nPengobatan nyeri kepala tegang primer mengacu pada keluhan pasien, hasil pemeriksaan fisik, dan adanya faktor-faktor pencetus. Obat ditujukan untuk relaksasi otot dan anti nyeri. Manipulasi fisik dapat untuk merilekskan otot juga, yaitu dengan pemanasan dan pemijatan otot. Faktor psikis tidak boleh dilupakan untuk dicoba diatasi.",

O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

      "abstract": "Over one million mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) occur annually in the United States. Most of these patients recover full function within about 3 months, but a significant minority do not. Failure to recover as expected following a diagnosed or suspected mild TBI is most commonly related to a concurrent diagnosis or alternative diagnosis or condition. Consideration during the diagnostic process must be given to alternative organic conditions (prior or unsuspected severe TBI, pain, medication side effects or dementia), pre-existing non-organic conditions (active or dormant psychiatric conditions, pre-existing personality characteristics, or social/economic factors), non-clinical conditions (compensation/litigation, malingering) or post-injury psychiatric morbidity (notably depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or conversion disorder). Scrupulous care must be given during the history, physical examination, and neuropsychologic assessment of the patient to evaluate for different or contributory diagnostic possibilities; not all patients that have symptoms following a blow to the head have traumatic brain injury as the sole etiologic agent for their symptoms. Accurate diagnosis will lead to better treatment and optimal outcomes. Future research should focus on early identification of the 'slow to recover' group to allow early and appropriate treatment.",

      "title": "Police Mental Health and Wellness",
      "abstract": "When compared to the general population, police officers are at a substantially increased risk for operational stress injuries due to their inherent exposure in the line of duty to a number of potentially psychologically traumatic events. Well-established in the police literature remains that these experiences of intense stress and the accompanying psychological strain may lead to a variety of mental health challenges for police, including symptoms of compromised mental health (i.e., burnout, low resilient coping) and mental health disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, or general anxiety disorder. Though progress has been made in several jurisdictions around the world to improve the availability of mental health resources, treatment options, and other support for police, challenges and organizational barriers (i.e., staff shortages, workload issues, work–life balance, poor perceptions of leadership, stigma, constant changes in legislation) persist in some services across regions, which have been found to decrease enthusiasm toward treatment-seeking, and in turn, amplify challenges tied to police officers’ mental health and well-being. When services are present, police can experience barriers to service utilization, such as concerns regarding confidentiality, stigma, departmental distrust, or negative perceptions of treatment (i.e., they will be viewed by colleagues as weak, no longer fit for the job, or taking advantage of the system). For police to disclose their mental health status and needs, they must be first comfortable doing so in a supportive, professionalized, and de-stigmatized workplace where there is increasing police awareness of and education about mental health, as well as preventative resources that promote wellness, healthy lifestyle choices, and coping skills. Additional research is needed that examines the changing and current mental health of police officers as well as the context and content informing the high prevalence of mental health disorders.",

Alternatively the collapse may be secondary to serious injury or disease and require veterinary intervention.

On the basis of the vertical dimension hypogonadism can be hypothalamic, hypophyseal, testicular or peripheral in its origin; 2. Depending on the impaired testicular functions (single or both), hypogonadism can be selective or total; 3. Depending on the severity of the lesion hypogonadism can be complete or incomplete; 4. the time-factor indicates the beginning of the lesion (pre- or postpuberal). The duration of the lesion is also of clinical significance. For the division of male hypogonadism, two etiopathogenetical groups can be suggested: Group I: \"Classical\" male hypogonadism.

      "abstract": "Stressful life events have been linked to the onset of severe psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction in many patients.Moreover, vulnerability to the later development of such disorders can be increased by stress or adversity during development (e.g., childhood neglect, abuse, or trauma).This review discusses the methodological features and results of various models of stress in nonhuman primates in the context of their potential relevance for human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction, particularly mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system.Such models have typically examined the effects of stress on the animals' behavior, endocrine function ( primarily the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal systems), and, in some cases, immune status.Manipulations such as relocation and/or removal of an animal from its current social group or, alternatively, formation of a new social group can have adverse effects on all of these outcome measures that may be either transient or more persistent depending on the species, sex, and other experimental conditions.Social primates may also experience significant stress associated with their rank in the group's dominance hierarchy.Finally, stress during prenatal development or during the early postnatal period may have long-lasting neurobiological and endocrine effects that manifest in an altered ability to cope behaviorally and physiologically with later challenges.Whereas early exposure to severe stress usually results in deficient coping abilities, certain kinds of milder stressors can promote subsequent resilience in the animal.We conclude that studies of stress in nonhuman primates can model many features of stress exposure in human populations and that such studies can play a valuable role in helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Hearing loss is a common problem encountered in ENT practice. Recognition of hearing loss as a problem by the patient usually occurs when speech frequencies are affected or when there is a sudden hearing loss. Hearing loss following head trauma or head injury is a major medical problem in adults (Bergemalm P-O&Borg.E. 2001) as well as children (Hough JVD &Stuart WD, 1968). The loss may go unnoticed when the speech frequencies are not affected. Sensorineural hearing loss at high frequencies is a frequent finding associated with head injuries (H.Alexander Arts). Hearing impairment can be due to central or peripheral causes, middle ear or cochlea being the most common site of peripheral injury. The most pronounced injury is fracture of temporal bone (Dahiya.R &Keller J.D, 1999). In both clinical and animal experimental studies it has been shown that there are various sites of pathology ranging from hair cell damage and degeneration of the organ of corti, ischemia of the 8th nerve to damage of central auditory pathways (due to compromise of blood supply to the inner ear ) either partly or totally. In most cases hearing impairment dissipates during subsequent post traumatic period, but some times it may persist or progress.",

Non-missile injury (or blunt head injury) is usually due to rapid acceleration or deceleration of the head, with or without impact, or less commonly crushing of the head, and most often occur as the result of road traffic accidents or falls. Missile injuries are due to penetration of the skull by a rapidly moving external object, for example gunshot wounds, and result in a different pattern of brain injury. The neuropathology can be separated into focal (or localised) lesions such as contusions, haemorrhages, skull fractures, or diffuse changes such as diffuse axonal injury, diffuse vascular injury, brain swelling and ischaemia (see Table 2.1).",

Thyroid hormones are involved in almost all metabolic processes, their deficiency leads to disruption of metabolic processes in all organs and systems, which is the reason for the rich clinical picture and variety of symptoms of hypothyroidism. The deficiency of thyroid hormones also has a significant negative impact on a person's mental health, identifying a diverse clinical picture – from mild disorders to serious mental disorders. For hypothyroidism, such psycho-neurological changes as drowsiness, weakness, loss of interest in the surroundings, loss of memory and intelligence are also characteristic. Delirious and delirious-hallucinatory conditions are described, as well as anxious and depressive conditions. Hypothyroid psychoneurological disorders have recently become more common, and therefore their diagnosis and correction are becoming more urgent. Persons with hypothyroi dism often mistakenly go not to the endocrinologist, but to a psychiatrist and receive therapy, but psychotropic drugs and antidepressants in hypothyroidism don´t give the proper effect and even are contraindicated. Hypocalcemia is very often observed with Hashimoto´s thyroiditis, it can be explained by autoimmune parathyroiditis with a hypoparathyroid clinic, that is, with autoimmune thyroiditis, the function of parathyroid glands may be disrupted. The article presents the results of our own research. A group of patients with autoimmune thyroiditis and hypothyroidism was examined. Complaints, anamnesis and clinic of the disease, levels of TSH, thyroid hormones, total and ionized calcium, inorganic phosphorus, vitamin D3 were studied.",

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep is vital for adolescents’ physical and emotional development; however, sleep disturbances and disorders frequently occur in this age group and affect their health and well-being. In this review, we investigated the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, clinical characteristics, and treatment of sleep disorders observed among adolescents.Current Concepts: The diagnostic criteria for insomnia disorder among adolescents include difficulties in falling asleep, maintaining sleep, or waking up too early and feeling unrefreshed, which are observed at least 3 days per week over 3 or more months. Cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia typically includes identifying and addressing negative thoughts and behaviors associated with sleep and establishing a consistent sleep-wake schedule. Delayed sleep phase syndrome is diagnosed in individuals in whom sleep onset and wake times are persistently delayed by 2 or more hours beyond the desired or existing sleep schedule, which leads to excessive daytime sleepiness or impaired functioning. Behavioral interventions comprise sleep hygiene education, relaxation techniques, and phototherapy. Symptoms such as pronounced snoring, apnea observed by others, and gasping or pauses in breathing during sleep may indicate sleep apnea. Continuous positive airway pressure therapy is an effective treatment strategy for sleep apnea. A history of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy suggests narcolepsy, and treatment options include pharmacotherapy, behavior modification, and lifestyle adjustments. Restless leg syndrome treatments include behavioral therapy, as well as anticonvulsant and dopamine receptor agonist administration.Discussion and Conclusion: Addressing sleep disorders is important to promote optimal health and well-being of adolescents and requires a multidisciplinary approach. Early detection, accurate diagnosis, and individualized treatment improve sleep and overall health outcomes and promote academic and social success.",

Different side effects, like rest and psychomotor unsettling influences, sensations of blame, low confidence, self-destructive propensities, just as autonomic and gastrointestinal aggravations, are likewise frequently present.",

El diagnostico se establece cuando el desarrollo del lenguaje no sigue la pauta de los demas aspectos del desarrollo, y han quedado excluidas otras posibles causas. Desarrollo. Durante los ultimos anos, las neurociencias se han aproximado al estudio del TEL. Se cree que la clave para una adquisicion correcta del lenguaje es la capacidad de procesar dos o mas estimulos auditivos que se presentan en una sucesion rapida. Una hipotesis que se ha planteado es que el TEL es una consecuencia de unas anomalias de bajo nivel en la percepcion auditiva. Ademas, los ninos con TEL manifiestan un deficit especifico en la discriminacion automatica de las silabas. Es posible que los metodos electrofisiologicos revelen una inmadurez u otra anomalia subyacente del procesamiento auditivo, incluso cuando los umbrales conductuales parecen normales. Conclusiones. Hay mucha polemica sobre el papel de dichos deficit en la etiologia de las dificultades linguisticas, y ha sido dificil establecer unos resultados consistentes y repetibles en esta area debido a la heterogeneidad de la poblacion y tambien porque no se ha prestado suficiente atencion a los aspectos relacionados con la maduracion del procesamiento auditivo.",

      "abstract": "Syncope is a sudden, transient loss of consciousness, as well as loss of postural tone. Syncope results from an abrupt decrease in cerebral perfusion or essential substrate delivery. It can be difficult to differentiate syncope from seizure activity or, sometimes, episodes of transient weakness. Syncope is often associated with sudden exertion or excitement. Limb stiffening, opisthotonic posture, micturition, and vocalization are common. Syncope occurs when cerebral blood flow falls below a critical level; this is about 30–50% of normal in people, although it might differ for quadripeds. Reduced cerebral blood flow also can result from cerebrovascular or other intracranial disease. Cardiac arrhythmias, as well as organic heart disease, commonly are involved. Quadrupedal posture makes this less likely in companion animals, although it does seem that sudden excitement might precipitate this in dogs. Arrhythmic causes of syncope can occur during sleep such that a loss of consciousness might not be observed, but might result in seizure-like activity, opisthotonus, urination.",

Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) has been profoundly used in the treatment of depression. It involves in use of movement and dance to support intellectual and emotional functions of the body. Often, DMT looks at the correlation between movement and emotion. DMT uses certain basic principles and has proven to be highly effective in treating depression and its sessions have been found effective in many other disorders and physical illnesses too. Being a very recent trend, this therapy has not reached people yet. There is a need for promotion for DMT. Since there are no side-effects for the same, DMT and Treatment of Depression often go hand in hand.",

Sleep apnea is classified into 3 types based on its severity and management varies accordingly. The first step in treatment is to identify correctible causes and educate patients on lifestyle modifications. Positive airway pressure is the preferred treatment modality and can be delivered via 3 different modes. Oral appliances are of 3 types and are generally indicated in mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea.

Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician.

Chronic diffuse alopecia can derive from persistence of acute alopecia, or have a general endocrine or metabolic cause. The shedding results in a diffuse loss with a more prominent central, frontal, and subauricular scalp loss. The hair cycle begins with the anagen growth phase of the hair follicle. Telogen effluvium, or excessive loss of normal hair, reflects a disturbance of the hair cycle. The diagnosis of telogen effluvium is based on the clinical presentation and the confirmation of excess telogen hair loss.

      "title": "When depression envelops frontotemporal dementia: The differential diagnostic frame through a case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is common in presenile population. The overlapping symptoms with other psychiatric disorders can lead to wrong/late diagnosis which cause delays/difficulties regarding case-management. Especially, long-standing and/or late-onset depression can descriptively envelop bvFTD (behavioral-variant) and leads to unnecessary treatments and increased distress. It’s important to implement a descriptive diagnostic algorithm which will help clinicians to distinguish the phenomenology of these disorders. Objectives This presentation aims to call attention of the clinicians/researchers to an elaborated effort concerning differential diagnosis of two common disorders with overlapping features through a case-study of a 59-year-old male patient. Methods One case from an inpatient unit of a psychiatric clinic in Lower Saxony, Germany will be reported. Results Case: The patient was referred to our acute-psychiatric-ward from the day-clinic-unit because of treatment-resistant, severe and long-lasting depressive symptoms. He was depressed, desperate, hopeless, listless and had suicidal thoughts. During the first days of treatment, symptoms like apathy, bad hygiene, weird eating-behavior, urinary incontinence, lack of empathy, language disorders and other behavioral symptoms were evident. Brain-MRI yielded frontotemporal lobar atrophy. Trail-Making-Test and Frontal-Assessment-Battery showed pronounced impairment of executive functions. Mini mental state examination and DemTect yielded light to moderate memory dysfunction. Diagnostic Criteria for Probable bvFTD (International-Consensus-Criteria) were fulfilled. Conclusions The diagnosis of bvFTD enabled a rapid assignment of a legal representative and relieved the long-lasting discomfort of the patient and his family that was caused by multiple unsuccessful treatment trials against depression. The differential diagnostic frame between bvFTD and depression will be discussed in view of the current literature. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "The immediate response to the traumatic event in individuals who may develop ASD2 or PTSD involves intense fear, helplessness or horror. ASD is experienced during or immediately after the trauma, lasts for at least 2 days, and either resolves within 4 weeks or the diagnosis has to be adjusted. A diagnosis of PTSD may be appropriate provided the full criteria for PTSD are met [2]. Of individuals who respond to the trauma with intense fear or horror 15–35% will eventually develop a significant degree of dysfunction and distress [3], namely PTSD, for a considerable length of time. The PTSD symptoms can be grouped into three main clusters. The first is persistent re-experience of the traumatic event, such as recurrent dreams and flashbacks. The second is persistent avoidance of internal or external cues associated with the trauma, such as avoiding thoughts, avoiding activities, diminished interest, detachment, restricted affect, and sense of foreshortened future. The third is increased arousal, which is manifested as difficulty in concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response [2]. The marked discrepancy between the proportion of the general population exposed to traumatic events and the proportion that ultimately fulfills the criteria for PTSD is a challenging aspect of the study of stress-related disorders. Identification of factors that increase vulnerability of individuals and factors that increase resilience may have important implications in public health.

      "title": "Night Shift Naps Improve Patient and Workforce Safety",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is the body’s natural response to sleep loss.1 Interruption in the quantity or quality of sleep affects fatigue,2 which in turn disrupts physical and cognitive functioning. Fatigue not only impairs attention to detail, ability to remain focused, information processing/judgment, and problem-solving, but also memory, reaction time, motivation, communication, mood, and empathy.3–5Many factors contribute to fatigue. Topping the list are staffing and workload demands, scheduling (ie, shift length, rotations, consecutive and overtime shifts), and personal issues such as habits and family responsibilities.2,6 In particular, extended shifts (&gt; 8 hours) have been associated with greater fatigue, drowsiness at work, and need for recovery.7,8 Fatigued nurses are at higher risk of making errors6,9,10 (risk increases 3-fold if shifts are &gt; 12.5 hours),11 burnout,12 and work-related injuries and accidents.10 Patient satisfaction also suffers.12 In another systematic review of 21 studies,8 as shift lengthened, adverse outcomes for patients increased (eg, hypoglycemic events, pneumonia, death), and nurses experienced more occupational injuries such as needle stick and musculoskeletal injuries, health complaints, drowsy driving and motor vehicle crashes or near crashes.8 In an attempt to assess a countermeasure for fatigue, the PICO (patient/problem, intervention, comparison, outcome) question of interest for this evidence synthesis was, What effect do strategic naps have on sleep and cognitive/psychomotor outcomes of nurses?The search strategy involved CINAHL and MEDLINE. Key words were fatigue, nurses, health care workers, hospitals, and napping. The search was limited to the past 10 years.Ten original research studies were retrieved (Table 1): 3 qualitative, 1 participatory action, 2 descriptive, 1 quasi-experimental, 2 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and 1 systematic review. All studies examined the effects of naps on hospital nurses working the night shift, except for the systematic review, which related to shift workers across industries. In most instances, a single nap was studied, but researchers in one study22 examined nightly naps over 3 consecutive nights. Length of naps varied from 15, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes to 1, 2, and 3 hours. Nap times were highly variable from midnight to 1 am, 2 am to 3 am, and 4 am to 4:30 am.As outlined in Table 1, quantitative and qualitative studies validated that strategic naps rejuvenate nurses. More than 50% of nurses who napped in one study13 could sleep (albeit lightly). Sleep latency, or time to fall asleep, was shortest for nurses who napped from 2 am to 3 am.16 But some nurses had difficulty calming down and unplugging because they wanted to stay informed as patient care was top priority.21 If unable to nap, nurses reported that 4 am to 6 am was the most difficult period for drowsiness.18Nappers reported feeling “energized” and “refreshed,”13,18,21 and sleep inertia (ie, drowsiness and impaired cognitive/psychomotor performance upon awakening) occurred less often.13,18 Another study demonstrated physiological signs of reduced tension from sleeping, including changes in bispectral measures, body temperature, heart rate variability, and activity level.15 Sleep outcomes from napping included less subjective and behavioral signs of sleepiness, and increased vigor.16,19,22 Scott et al19 found that the amount of sleep on workdays improved by 50 minutes on average, and sleep quality improved significantly at 12 weeks. Compared with those who did not nap, nappers also experienced fewer performance lapses, better probed memory recall, faster reaction times, less drowsy driving and better driving performance, faster psychomotor skills during intravenous catheter insertion, and fewer errors or near errors.16,19,22 Intercepted or discovered errors increased because of higher alertness.Most of the evidence for strategic napping to combat detrimental effects of fatigue is level C evidence (Table 2). Strategic naps were rejuvenating with favorable cognitive and psychomotor functions, which led to fewer errors. The timing and duration of naps are important. Naps that occur after the middle of the night (but before 4 am)18,24 promoted better sleep quality and were associated with greater physiological benefit and psychomotor performance. Naps should also not last more than 1 hour25 to prevent sleep inertia, or 30 minutes should be allowed for recovery.18,22Several implications must be considered when developing strategic napping programs. Educating nurses about the effects of fatigue and good self-care—including taking naps before working a night shift or a prolonged stretch—is essential.2 The need for this education to be a higher priority was demonstrated by a recent survey24 where most nurse leaders indicated that their facilities did not educate either managers or staff on risk management issues related to fatigue.26A second consideration relates to assessing the conduciveness of the environment for sleeping. Good quality sleep is more likely if nurses can take a duty-free break with uninterrupted coverage of their responsibilities.2 Nurses in a qualitative study18 provided many reasons for their inabilities to nap— from understaffing to unstable patients. When staffing is an issue, Geiger-Brown et al13 advocated that naps should be offered to nurses with (1) self-perceived sleepiness or shiftwork sleep disorders (eg, sleep apnea, insomnia), (2) commutes more than 20 minutes or on rural roads, and (3) rotating (vs fixed) shifts, especially those working their first shift or more than 3 in a row.In addition to acuity and staffing issues, Fallis et al18 reported other barriers to napping. These barriers centered on lack of comfortable spaces, interruptions due to shared space, and fear of sleep inertia. In a recent survey of critical care managers, only 11% reported that a specific nap room was available.27 In another study,20 nurses were challenged by the lack of a predefined nap time and consistent ability to take time to rest. Because of these challenges, nurses have shared preferences such as desire for a staff-exclusive area close to the unit (but separate from break rooms) that offers low lighting, pillows and blankets, timers, and either beds, couches, stretchers, or reclining chairs.18,21 Eye masks and ear plugs also may be helpful.2To compound these challenges, cultural barriers exist. Nurse managers in one study18 were surprised by the ease of implementing a napping program, but they stated that the professional/organizational culture and staff’s perceptual dissonance about the adequacy of staffing affected their ability to take restful breaks. Indeed, staff nurses and managers themselves have alluded to lack of support for napping from managers and senior leaders.18,27 Many nurses are reticent to take naps5 and feel guilty if they do.21 In a current survey, Steege et al26 found that although most nurse leaders recognized fatigue as a significant practice concern with negative consequences, most believed that stigma surrounds acknowledging fatigue because it is “part of the culture of nursing.” Thus, leaders concluded that these social norms have slowed the triggering of organizational priorities toward developing fatigue-management policies that include napping, as advocated for by the American Nurses Association.28Fatigue.

      "abstract": "Aging is of critical interest in the medical, health, and social domains, especially in developed countries and newly industrializing countries.Because muscle atrophy in elderly individuals can cause falls, its prevention is important.Moreover, prevention of agingrelated reduced skeletal muscle mass may allow a higher quality of life in the elderly, because reduced muscle function is linked to the occurrence of several chronic diseases (Handschin & Spiegelman, 2008).High-intensity resistance training effectively maintains muscle mass and strength, but rigorous training is difficult for elderly people (Seynnes et al., 2007).Acupuncture is a well-known traditional technique in eastern Asia that is used to maintain health and cure many diseases.Major acupuncture techniques utilize penetration of the skin by thin, solid metallic needles, which are manipulated manually or are stimulated electrically.This electrical needle stimulation is called electroacupuncture (EA) (Klein & Trachtenberg, 1997).EA is effective not only for pain but also for muscle problems, such as stiffness, exhaustion, and atrophy, in many patients including elderly people (Zhang, 2003).Acupuncture studies have reported the nerve routes of acupuncture signal transmission, effects via the spinal reflex, and reactions in the brain (Cho et al., 1998;Murase & Kawakita, 2000;Uchida et al., 2000).Figure 1 is a schematic diagram showing the routes of EA stimuli between treated points and organs.In a previous investigation on acupuncture, only a neural mechanism of pain reduction was clear; endogenous opioid (beta endorphin and enkephalin) is induced under the acupuncture anesthesia (Chung & Dickenson, 1980).However, the molecular mechanisms of other effects of acupuncture were as yet not defined (Acupuncture, 1997).Scientific evidence of efficacy is an important as for the CAM research, as for research in Western medicine.The enhancement of blood flow in target organs of acupuncture treatment, which is a major reason for the effectiveness of acupuncture (Niimi & Yuwono, 2000), cannot sufficiently explain the recovery of muscle from exhaustion because it is not clear how the supplied oxygen and nutrients would be used during the cellular recovery process.Many cellular and physiological processes are regulated at the transcription level of gene expression.The identification of genes specifically modulated during the process of acupuncture would provide an initial step toward elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of this technique.www.intechopen.",

      "title": "Deep brain stimulation for dystonia",
      "abstract": "The term 'dystonia' refers to a clinical syndrome of involuntary and repetitive muscle contractions leading to abnormal movements and body postures. The most common classification of dystonia is based on the three axes: etiology; age of disease onset; and distribution of affected body regions. The etiology of dystonia may be primary or secondary to an acquired cause (e.g., a hypoxic brain injury). Secondary dystonias are typically not 'pure' dystonias, but are accompanied by other neurological signs and symptoms. Exceptions are acute dystonic reactions or tardive dystonia (TD) caused by the acute or chronic use of antidopaminergic drugs, which are pure and clinically indistinguishable from primary dystonias. Primary dystonias may be accompanied by Parkinsonism or myoclonus only and are termed 'dystonia plus' syndromes in these cases. A genetic cause has been identified in an increasing number of primary dystonias or dystonia-plus syndromes. These monogenic forms are referred to as DYT1 to DYT20 (for a review see [1]). The severity and distribution of dystonia is linked to age with a greater tendency to develop generalized dystonia with an early onset (below 26 years of age) versus a late onset (>26 years of age). The distribution of dystonia can be described as focal (only a single body region affected), segmental (two adjacent body parts affected), multifocal (several noncontiguous parts affected), generalized or hemidystonia (one body half affected). The three diagnostic axes help to characterize clinically distinct forms of dystonia with a particular cause and prognosis; for example, early onset primary focal dystonia tends to generalize rapidly, can lead to severe physical disability and is often monogenic (e.g., DYT1 or DYT6), whereas the more prevalent adult-onset focal dystonias show little progression and are mostly sporadic.",

In both cases, endurance limits are pushed, which leads to burnout and has consequences for the entire human body and psychophysical health. We live in a harsh age where it is not enough to be successful, the demand is to be the best. This ultimatum is particularly prominent in sports. Athletes are distinguished from others by discipline, perseverance, persistence, focus on the goal (victory), sacrifice and responsibility. Top fitness and top results are always expected from them. The question arises: Is it even possible to achieve top results and avoid the burnout syndrome?

Research has shown that social isolation, an objective lack of contact with others, can lead to loneliness, mental health issues, and low life satisfaction. Leisure travel, which involves interactions with others, may have the potential to reduce social isolation.",

Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions. What brings these together is their clinical similarity and probable disinhibition at higher brainstem levels.",

      "abstract": "Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is the most common type of status epilepticus and carries the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality (1). It is a neurologic emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment. The traditional definition of GCSE requires continuous, repetitive seizure activity for at least 30 min, or two or more discrete seizures within a 30-min period without recovery of consciousness between attacks. The temporal marker of 30 min is arbitrary and not based on physiologic or clinical data (2). Several epileptologists have proposed a \"mechanistic\" definition of GCSE: Most seizures stop spontaneously in 1 or 2 min; therefore, longer seizures generally reflect a problem with the usual mechanisms of seizure termination. The \"mechanistic\" definition refers to any seizure that will not terminate spontaneously, consisting of convulsive movements and loss of consciousness (3,4). This definition, however, is not practical for clinical and research purposes because there is presently no clear way to distinguish a seizure that will terminate on its own from one that will not. An \"operational\" definition of GCSE must still be described in terms of time (4).",

      "title": "Psychosocial Aspects of Osteoporosis",
      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is defined as a reduction in bone mass associated with increased skeletal fragility. By far, fractures are the most clinically significant aspect of the osteoporotic syndrome. Compression fractures in the midthoracic and upper lumbar region of the spine lead to chronic back pain, reduction in physical activity, body deformity, muscle weakness, and fatigue. In general, the principal therapeutic end point for judging the efficacy of treatment is a reduction in fracture rate. Perhaps of more importance, however, to the patient is a diminution of symptoms associated with the consequences of fracture. These changes would be expected to lead to an improvement in quality of life for that individual (1,2). Not all individuals are symptomatic from osteoporotic compression fractures of the spine, and the proportion of patients with vertebral osteoporosis who suffer morbid consequences is unknown (3). Women with severe osteoporosis are at consistently higher risk of having any symptoms, compared with women with mild osteoporosis or no osteoporosis (4). The risk of pain and disability increases with the number and severity of fractures, and individuals with prevalent fractures have an increased risk of back pain and physical disability, which persists for 3 years or more on average (4, 5). To what degree the severity of osteoporotic symptoms affects the psychosocial status of patients is not well understood. Because patients may not openly discuss their emotions and concerns about living with this disease, the psychosocial status of all patients needs to be assessed. A key therapeutic strategy is to identify and address the individual psychosocial needs of each patient, so a renewed sense of life satisfaction might be achieved while coping with a chronic, painful disease.",

      "abstract": "Peningkatan suara dengan gelombang kompleks yang tidak beraturan dikenal sebagai bising, merupakan salah satu stresor bagi individu. Bila hal tersebut terjadi berulangkali dan terus menerus sehingga melampaui adaptasi individu maka berakibat tetjadi kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut distress. Keadaan bising dapat berakibat kelainan pada sistem pendengaran serta menurunkan kemampuan dalam berkomunikasi, disamping sebagai stresor yang dapat memodulasi respons imun. Telah dilaporkan bahwa pekerja yang berada atau bekerja di tempat yang mempunyai tingkat kebisingan tinggi sering mengalami gangguan kesehatan dan mudah terserang infeksi. Bila hal tersebut tidak segera mendapat perhatian maka kejadian dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas berpeluang besar terjadi, yang pada akhirnya akan mempengaruhi kualitas sumber daya manusia yang selanjutnya berakibat produktivitas kerja menurun. Intensitas suara yang melebihi 85 dB selama 1 jam, diberikan dalam waktu 14 hari berpeluang un tuk mengakibatkan gangguan pendengaran, disamping mempengaruhi kondisi kesehatan individu. Sistem safaf, endokrin, dan sistem imun saling berhubungan dengan memanfaatkan berbagai substansi penghantar sinyal stres dan reseptor sinyal, yang berakibat terjadi pengaturan perilaku sel pada sistem imun. Stres yang ditunjukkan dengan peningkatan kortisol dan katekolamin akan menekan aktivitas sel imunokompeten berakibat penurunan ketahanan tubuh. Pengaruh kortisol pada hambatan sekresi IL-l eleh makrofag dan IT,-2 oleh sel Th yang clapat menurunkan sintesis imunogobulin oleh sel B. Pengaruh perubahan kondisi ketahanan tubuh akibat peningkatan kebisingan menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan stres pada sistem imun yang dicerminkan oleh perubahan ketahanan tubuh dengan tingkat kebisingan. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan tubuh akibat pengaruh stresor suara tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Psikoneuroimunologi sebagai ilmu yang digunakan untuk menjelaskan tentang respons imun pada kondisi stres mulai dikembangkan. Konsep ini memberi peluang untuk menjelaskan perubahan biologis sebagai bentuk respons stres oleh rangsangan yaitu tingkat kebisingan. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui hypotalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menyebabkan peningkatan corticotropin releasing factor ( CRF) hipotalamus, yang memicu aktivitas HPA aksis. Dalam kondisi normal sel imunokompeten dalam keadaan homeostasis. Perubahan kadar kortisol, jumlah limfosit dan IgG akan menentukan hubungan antara stres yang disebabkan oleh kebisingan dengan perubahan respons ketahanan tubuh. Namun sejauh ini mekanisme pengaruh kebisingan terhadap modulasi respons imun tersebut belum terungkap dengan jelas. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme inmnopatobiogenesis respons imun yang stres, dengam rancangan penelitian faktorial the post test only control group design dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor suara dengan lama paparan 1 jam dan 2 jam serta intensitas suara 40-50 dB dan intensitas suara > 85 dB pada hewan coba mencit BALB/c jantan berumur 6-8 minggu (sexualy mature), berat badan kurang lebih 40 gram, dibagi 6 kelompok dengan setiap kelompok terdiri dari 8 sampel secara alokasi random, variable tergantung adalah kortisol, jumlah limfosit, IgG. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa terjadi peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB. Demikian pula pada paparan.selama 2 jam dengan intensitas suara 40-50 dB maupun intensitas suara > 85 dB yaitu peningkatan kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan kadar IgG serum (p 85 dB terjadi peningkatan lebih tinggi untuk kadar kortisol serta penurunan jumlah limfosit dan IgG serum yang lebih rendah, daripada intensitas suara 40-50 dB (p<0,01). Dengan demikian dapat disimpulkan bahwa pada stres akibat stresor suara yang berlangsung cepat ataupun lama disertai dengan intensitas suara yang berbeda dapat menyebabkan modulasi respons imun. </description",

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

Major symptoms such as deficits in social reciprocity, deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviors used for social interaction, and deficits in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships, which are common in Developmental Disorders, strongly affect work performance. Some workers with Developmental Disorders suffer from other psychiatric conditions because of maladjustment to the work environment, while the manifestation of Developmental Disorders in workers is also influenced by the work environment. Occupational health staff should have sufficient of understanding of the difficulties and psychological suffering of such workers to be able to support their health and continuous employment. Support for mild cases as well as severe cases is sometimes difficult because it may give the impression of unfairness or cause a degeneration of morale among co-workers. It is necessary to have detailed discussions about the future development of support systems for workers with Developmental Disorders.",

      "abstract": "In old age, depression mainly affects those with chronic medical illness, severe disability or mental decline. Depression in elderly worsens the outcomes of many medical illness and increases mortality. Age-related processes, including arteriosclerosis, inflammatory and degenerative diseases, may compromise the integrity of prefrontostriatal pathways and amygdala leading to increased vulnerability to depression. Environmental factors, such as impoverishment, isolation, relocation, caregiving and bereavement, contribute to further increase susceptibility to depression or triggering depression in already vulnerable elderly people. Suitable treatment of depression in elderly reduces the symptoms, prevents suicidal ideation, improves cognitive and functional status and helps patients to develop the skills needed to cope with their disability or psychosocial adversity. Prevention of depression in given pathological conditions may greatly improve the outcomes, mostly the recovery of function and quality of life, as well as the mortality risk. Therefore, it should be considered the opportunity of a depression prophylaxis, particularly in those circumstances in which the risk of depression is noteworthy increased, such as stroke, cancer, institutionalization, etc.",

      "abstract": "Stress, which can precipitate and exacerbate depression, causes atrophy and in severe cases death of hippocampal neurons. Atrophy of the hippocampus has also been observed in patients suffering from recurrent major depression. The present study examines the influence of electroconvulsive seizures, one of the most effective treatments for depression, on the morphology and survival of hippocampal neurons. The results demonstrate that chronic administration of electroconvulsive seizures induces sprouting of the granule cell mossy fiber pathway in the hippocampus. This sprouting is dependent on repeated administration of electroconvulsive seizures, reaches a maximum 12 days after the last treatment and is long lasting (i.e. up to six months). Electroconvulsive seizure-induced sprouting occurs in the absence of neuronal loss, indicating that sprouting is not a compensatory response to cell death. This is different from the sprouting induced by kindling or excitotoxin treatment, which induce cell death along with recurrent seizures. Electroconvulsive seizure-induced sprouting is significantly diminished in brain-derived neurotrophic factor heterozygote knockout mice, indicating that this neurotrophic factor contributes to mossy fiber sprouting. However, infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor into the hippocampus does not induce sprouting of the mossy fiber pathway. The results demonstrate that chronic administration of electroconvulsive seizures induces mossy fiber sprouting and suggest that increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor is necessary, but not sufficient for the induction on this sprouting. Although the functional consequences remain unclear, sprouting of the mossy fiber pathway would appear to oppose the actions of stress and could thereby contribute to the therapeutic actions of electroconvulsive seizure therapy.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a frequent psychiatric disorder. Patients do not always present with obsessions or compulsions and this may complicate the process of diagnosing and starting adequate treatment. In this article three patients suffering from OCD but not presenting with obsessions or compulsions are discussed. In the first case, in a 42-year-old woman, the presenting symptom is a therapy-resistant dermatitis, due to excessive washing. The second patient, a 27-year-old man, presented with a depression, a frequent comorbid condition. In the third case, a 34-year-old man, the effects on and the suffering of the partner and family of a patient with OCD (they were asked to co-operate in his compulsive behaviour) were the reason for his wife to consult the general practitioner. OCD has a lifetime prevalence rate of 2.5% and is somewhat more frequent in females than in males. The most characteristic symptoms are obsessions and/or compulsions. They cause marked distress, are time consuming (take more than 1 hour a day), and interfere significantly with the person's functioning (occupational, social activities, relationships). Neurobiological studies suggest genetic influences and dysfunctional neuronal circuits in the brain. The treatment of OCD consists of pharmacotherapy and behavioural therapy, but it is a lifelong condition.",

They can be all named posttraumatic neuropathies: painless sensations in phantom limb ,painful phantom limb and painful posttraumatic stump. Painless sensations in phantom limb can be seen in 90% of cases in resected body parts as soon as first postoperative day, less often during the first week, and its clinical characteristics are usually stabilized during the first year. Painful posttraumatic stump appears because of pain neuroma existing, that forms at the proximal end of amputational stump as a consequence of physiological nerve regeneration attempt. Frequency of pain significantly varies considering authors from 5 - 90%, depending on definition of this phenomena and criteria used. It is considered that 5- 10% mast be under permanent medicament treatment. Phantom pain appears more often in elderly and people with specific affective personality construction. It can bee permanent, burning, nettling, tearing (25%), or intermittent, lancerating, in the shape of electrical discharging (32%), but it can also have bizarre attributes. Phantom pain appearance usually announces its duration in the longer period. After two years it is present at 59% of patients, with decreasing intensity, and only 5- 10% suffer severe pain. In our Institute in the period from 1980-2003, 48 patients have been treated, 36 patients with medicamentous treatment, local blockades and chronic stimulations, and 12 patients, who did not react at conservative treatment were operated. In operated group in 10 patients pain disappeared, one patient it was with decreasing intensity, and one patient was without change.",

      "title": "Instrumental rationality and suicide in schizophrenia: a case for rational suicide?",
      "abstract": "It is estimated that up to 7500 people develop schizophrenia each year in the UK. Schizophrenia has significant consequences, with 28% of the excess mortality in schizophrenia being attributed to suicide. Previous research suggests that suicide in schizophrenia may be more related to affective factors such as depression and hopelessness, rather than psychotic symptoms themselves. Considering suicide in schizophrenia within this framework enables us to develop a novel philosophical approach, in which suicide may not be related to loss of self-consciousness, thought processing dysfunctions or perception disturbances. The action of suicide may be due neither to persistent hallucinations nor other psychotic symptoms, such as delusional beliefs, but to other underexamined, perhaps rational reasons, such as extreme social isolation, severe depression or emotional withdrawal. This paper does not examine the moral character of suicide. Instead, it argues that we should conceive the action of suicide in schizophrenia as an act that is not necessarily irrational. People with schizophrenia might end their life based on reasons if suicide is the best means to achieve their ends. However, the paper does not support assisted suicide. It aims to provide a better understanding of the reasons why people take their own lives and suggests that understanding can inform effective interventions to reduce high rates of suicide.",

Because sex reassignment surgery may be helpful to some patients with the syndrome and harmful to others, mental health professionals need to competently perform differential diagnoses of both the gender disorder and the associated psychopathologies. This frequently involves distinctions between subtle forms of psychosis, character pathologies of varying severity, and major developmental problems. Surgery should not be considered the only, or the best, treatment for the syndrome. Contrary to popular belief, psychotherapy can help many patients, especially those with secondary gender dysphoria.",

      "abstract": "Abstract “Pseudo-endocrine disorders” refer to proposed conditions that have never been scientifically proven to exist but, due to widespread misinformation available on the internet and other media, are relatively commonly diagnosed and treated with equally unproven and sometimes dangerous treatments. Adrenal fatigue is a nonexistent condition that supposedly results from adrenal exhaustion and atrophy due to chronic stress and has been promoted as a potential explanation for a variety of symptoms. Testing consists of nonvalidated online surveys and salivary cortisol profiles while treatment is not evidence-based at best and can be dangerous. Wilson's syndrome and reverse T3 syndrome are also nonexistent conditions that supposedly result from impaired T4 to T3 conversion and competition of excess reverse T3 with T3 for T3 receptors. Testing involves measurement of axillary temperature and treatment consists of T3 therapy, often at very high and dangerous doses. Hypogonadism (“low T”) is frequently diagnosed in “men's health” clinics and other venues without actual hormone testing or further evaluation and is often treated with supraphysiologic testosterone therapy that suppresses endogenous gonadal testosterone and sperm production, leads to a lifelong need for testosterone therapy, and may have numerous other harmful effects. Low-dose naltrexone (LDN) therapy has been proposed as a treatment for multiple disorders including autoimmune conditions and other disorders resulting from aberrant immune mechanisms, but there is no valid evidence that LDN has any benefits. Management of patients with pseudo-endocrine disorders must involve careful listening, patient education, healthy lifestyle measures, and honesty, encouragement, and compassion.",

      "title": "Hyperkalemic Periodic Paralysis: 14 Years Later",
      "abstract": "Myopathies can be broadly divided into several categories. The first involves damage to the muscle itself, called rhabdomyolysis, which typically results in clinical signs seen in tying up. The horse manifests clinical signs of exercise intolerance, muscle stiffness, or painful muscle cramps. The second category includes disorders resulting from changes in the conductivity of muscle membranes that lead to myotonia or sustained muscle contraction. Clinical signs are muscle fasciculations or trembling. One example is hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) caused by a defect in the skeletal muscle-sodium channel. Other reported disorders with suspected membrane defects in horses include myotonic dystrophy and congenital myotonia. In humans, over a dozen such disorders have been described that have some striking clinical similarities leading to the coining of the terms ion-channel diseases or ion channelopathies. Many muscle-membrane channel defects (so-called “channelopathies”) have been characterized, and the molecular basis for disease is well described. A third category of myopathies includes those associated with atrophy and weakness, such as neurogenic causes like equine motor neuron disease and botulism and myogenic causes like disuse, immunemediated causes, or causes associated with Cushing’s disease. Glycogen-branching enzyme deficiency, recently described in Quarter Horse foals, causes severe muscle weakness because of the foal’s inability to store glycogen. HYPP is an autosomal dominant trait affecting Quarter Horses, Paint Horses, Appaloosas, and Quarter Horse-crossbred animals worldwide. A “syndrome” in related horses was first recognized in the 1980s by breeders and veterinarians; it was first reported to be similar to HYPP in humans by Cox at the Annual American Association of Equine Practitioners convention in 1985. In December 1992, this genetic disease was publicly linked to a popular Quarter-Horse sire named Impressive. This prolific sire, born in 1969, has 355,000 offspring registered with the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA), and these offspring dominate the halterhorse industry. Current estimates indicate that 4% of the Quarter Horse breed may be affected. Unfortunately, the gene frequency has not decreased in the past 14 yr since genetic testing has been available to breeders, and controversy continues among horse breeders whose stock carry this gene. Affected horses seem to have been preferentially selected as breeding stock because of their pronounced muscle development, and there is evidence of selection of HYPP-affected horses as superior halter horses by show judges. In 1996, AQHA officially recognized HYPP as a genetic defect or undesirable trait. To increase public awareness",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development.

These are conceptualized as pathologic exaggerated reactions to early traumatizing events, a causality not unlike that of conversive-hysteric symptoms or \"normal\" bodily characteristics. Psychiatric-etiologic considerations of dental anxiety are not to be found in the literature.

      "title": "Iodine deficiency and its consequences for cognitive and psychomotor development of children",
      "abstract": "Dietary iodine intake is required for the production of thyroid hormones. Thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) are essential for the development of the central nervous system, they regulate genes involved in myelination and neuronal/glial cell differentiation, and play an important role in axonal and dendrite growth in synaptogenesis and myelination. Deficiencies in thyroid hormones in pregnant women directly affect brain development of the fetus, resulting in neurological and neurocognitive disorders in infants with defects ranging from decrease in intelligence and lethargy to mental retardation. Thyroid deficiency at different stages of pregnancy affects different brain regions, for example, basal ganglia are affected by early thyroid hormone deficiency and cerebellar and hippocampal development is influenced by late thyroid dysfunction [1]. Therefore the consequences of the brain damage depend upon the timing and severity of the hypothyroxinaemia, when it appearing before or at 12 weeks of pregnancy it may affect cognitive development. The neurological cretinism, a disease characterized by severe neurological lesions without clinical hypothyroidism may be a consequence of severe hypothyroxinaemia in early pregnancy. Congenital hypothyroidism is one of the most common preventable causes of mental retardation in children and describes the deficiency in thyroid hormones as of prenatal onset of severe thyroid dysfunction. Newborn screening and thyroid therapy started within 2 weeks of age can normalize cognitive development. Mild reductions in maternal thyroid hormone levels in early pregnancy are associated with reduced IQ in offspring and prenatal exposure to maternal hypothyroxinaemia increased the risk of expressive language delay and nonverbal cognitive delay in preschool age children [2]. Mild iodine deficiency during pregnancy may lead to hypothyroxinaemia in the mother and/or elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels in the foetus, and these conditions have been found to be related to mild and subclinical cognitive and psychomotor deficits in neonates, infants and children [3]. Moderate cognitive impairments have been observed in children from the age of 3 weeks up to 5 years. Low maternal iodine status could be associated with an increased risk of suboptimal scores for verbal IQ at age 8 years and reading accuracy, comprehension and reading scores at age 9 years. Correction of mild-to-moderate iodine deficiency improves cognitive performance in school age children [4]. As iodine deficiency is still the most widespread cause of maternal hypothyroxinaemia, the birth of many children with learning disabilities may already be preventable by advising women to take iodine supplements as soon as pregnancy starts, or earlier if possible.",

      "title": "Insomnia linked to medications",
      "abstract": "For the clinician, insomnia is a symptom which is difficult to understand as it is a predominantly subjective variable: in clinical practice, it is the patient's complaint which guides the doctor in his diagnostic and therapeutic approach. Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "The Dystonias",
      "abstract": "Abstract The dystonias are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by excessive muscle contractions leading to abnormal postures and movements. The clinical manifestations of this broad group of disorders are quite varied. The dystonias may emerge at any age from infancy through late adulthood, they may affect muscles in nearly any region of the body, they may occur without other clinical problems, or they may be combined with other neurological or systemic disorders. There are many etiologies for dystonia, both acquired and inherited, although many are idiopathic. The clinical manifestations and causes are quite varied, but there are numerous well-recognized syndromes. Among adults, the most common syndromes affect a single body region such as the neck (cervical dystonia or torticollis), craniofacial region (blepharospasm or oromandibular dystonia), one limb (e.g., writer’s cramp or foot dystonia), the larynx (laryngeal dystonia or spasmodic dysphonia), or another region. For adults, most cases are idiopathic and a cause cannot be found despite extensive workup. For children, dystonia often spreads to involve a broader region of the body and a cause is more likely to be discovered. The most common syndromes among children include cerebral palsy or genetic disorders where dystonia may occur in isolation or combined with other clinical problems. This volume provides a comprehensive resource that addresses the many subtypes of dystonia and how they are diagnosed and treated.",

It can occur at any age but is observed more often in adolescents, with a strong predominance in females. Diagnosis of trichotillomania may be difficult, and its effective treatment challenging. The aim of this study is to critically review current literature regarding diagnostic procedures and treatment of trichotillomania, including psychotherapy, N-acetylcysteine, naltrexone, topiramate, atypical neuroleptics, and selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors. The importance of cooperation between dermatologists and psychiatrists is emphasized to shorten the time to diagnose the disease and begin appropriate treatment. Finally, trichotillomania is also often connected with trichophagia, which may lead to formation of trichobezoars and cause a direct danger to the patient's health and even life due to the risk of intestinal obstruction and the need for surgical intervention. Based on thorough literature review, we conclude that diagnosis of trichotillomania can be challenging. Trichoscopy could help to distinguish trichotillomania from other types of hair loss. Most clinical trials using various treatment options have been conducted on small groups of patients, and the potential benefits determined using various scales. Therefore, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of different treatment methods. There is also a lack of studies assessing treatment efficacy over longer periods of time. Thus, there is a need to perform better-designed studies in the near future to optimize current treatment modalities for trichotillomania.",

Currently stress is a fairly important factor at the social level, since it manifests itself in people when it comes to having excessive or controlled loads that go beyond the capacities they suffer. Occupational stress can be the cause of many diseases, from physical health problems such as cardiovascular disorders, digestive system problems, and dermatological disorders, among others; to mental health problems, anxiety, depression, insomnia, Burnout syndrome and many more. All these pathologies experience that work stress is not an issue that should be ignored, overlooked, or even judged, since as was specifically the consequences of this situation that currently occurs in almost all people who carry out child labor.

      "title": "Vertigo",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: “Dizziness” is a common complaint that implies a sense of disorientation, usually an altered perception of position in the environment. It may be due to lightheadedness or faintness (eg, the adolescent who has orthostatic hypotension), occur in association with a variety of acute medical disorders (eg, the febrile child who has vomiting and dehydration), or have a psychosomatic origin (eg, depression, anxiety, or exhaustion).Dizziness is formally classified into four categories: vertigo, presyncope, dysequilibrium, and light-headedness. Vertigo is defined as an illusion of movement, most often a sensation of rotation or, less frequently, linear displacement or tilt. Vertigo is the key symptom of vestibular pathology and usually the result of abnormalities of the labyrinth, although it also may be symptomatic of other neurologic disease (eg, seizures or migraines). It typically is accompanied by symptoms of varying degree, including nausea, vomiting, pallor, and perspiration. There is no loss of consciousness.The prevalence of vertigo in children is unknown. A recently published study of Scottish school children reported that 15% had experienced at least one episode of dizziness in a 1-year period. Almost 50% were assessed as having “paroxysmal vertigo” with accompanying symptoms frequently suggestive of migraine (pallor, nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia).The etiology of vertigo may be due to abnormalities of the vestibular, visual, or proprioceptive systems. The labyrinth (the paired organs of equilibrium) consists of three semicircular canals stimulated by angular acceleration and the utricle and saccule stimulated by gravitational forces and vertical acceleration. Impulses pass via the vestibular nerve to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and then ascend in the medial longitudinal fasiculus (to the cranial nerves for eye movement) and descend in the vestibulospinal tracts (excitatory stimuli to the extensor muscles of the head, extremities, and trunk for maintenance of upright posture). The cerebellum receives afferent impulses and functions as a center for integrating oculovestibular and postural responses. Cortical vestibular representation is at the level of the posterior temporal gyrus.Vestibular function is assessed by evaluating the oculovestibular reflex and intensity of nystagmus produced by rotatory and caloric stimulation of the labyrinth. The oculovestibular reflex permits ocular fixation on stationary objects while the head and body are in motion.Nystagmus is the observed movement of the eye in response to stimulation of the labyrinth, retrocochlear vestibular, or central vestibulo-ocular pathway. It is classified as spontaneous or induced by direction and by fatigability. The direction of nystagmus is designated by the fast component (ocular realignment). The slow component represents the oculovestibular response.Vertigo may be due to peripheral vestibular disease or central vestibular dysfunction. When not associated with actual movement, the cause of vertigo is found in the peripheral system in 85% of cases. Use of the term “peripheral” implies that the problem occurs either in the end organ (semicircular canals or utricle) or in the peripheral nerve.The clinical presentations differ and allow for localization of the vertiginous symptomatology (Table 1).The medical history is the initial and most important step in evaluation of the child who complains of dizziness or vertigo. Young children may not have the capacity or vocabulary to describe the sensation of vertigo, but they can use “playground synonyms” such as spinning, swinging, sliding, or like “a merry-go-round.” The key symptom is a sensation of motion that is either rotatory or linear.The associated aural and neurologic symptoms must be sought carefully. Are there other symptoms of hearing loss (that may fluctuate), fullness, pressure, or ringing? Is there objective evidence of a hearing disorder? If tinnitus or ringing is present, is it continuous, intermittent, or pausitile? Are there symptoms of cortical or brainstem disorders such as headache, visual changes, seizures, or loss of consciousness?The complete physical examination should focus on neurologic evaluation of the cranial nerves and cerebellar function (past-pointing and tandem gait). The auditory canal and tympanic membranes must be examined to evaluate for evidence of middle ear infection, malformations, cholesteatoma, or a perilymphatic fistula. A fistula test can be performed in a cooperative child with a pneumatic otoscope or tragal pressure. The child is instructed to look straight ahead, and the eyes are examined while continuous positive and then negative pressure is applied. Normally, there should be no drift of the eyes. In the presence of perilymphatic fistula, the eyes may drift slowly away from the ear with positive pressure and back toward the ear with negative pressure.An important sign is the presence of spontaneous or induced nystagmus. Endpoint or physiologic nystagmus is seen in normal children at a 40-degree deviation of the eyes. Because visual fixation may inhibit mild vestibular nystagmus, otolaryngologists use Frenzel glasses (+10 diopters) both to magnify the eyes and to prevent fixation suppression.Clinical testing in the office or emergency department may provide much information about the child or adolescent who has vertigo. Simple tests of balance include the Romberg and Unterberger-Fukuda test (stepping or marching test). The Romberg test evaluates proprioceptive function. A variation of the original examination—the tandem Romberg test—can be performed by having the child place one foot directly in front of the other with the arms either at the sides or crossed in front. Vision is allowed and then excluded. The Unterberger-Fukuda test is performed with the arms placed straight out in front at shoulder height. Vision is excluded, and the child is instructed to maintain the original position and march in place. A total of 50 marching steps should be taken. Normally, patients either will remain in place, step forward up to 50 cms, or turn within approximately 30 degrees of center. Patients who have chronic peripheral vestibular lesions will march slowly toward the side of the lesion.The Hallpike-Dix maneuver should be used during the neurologic examination to elicit paroxysmal positional nystagmus. The child is placed in a sitting position midway on a flat examining table and instructed to look straight ahead at all times. The examiner first turns the head to the side, and the patient then quickly is placed backwards with the head over the end of the table. The response in patients who have a positional vertigo is horizontal rotary nystagmus with the fast phase to the downward ear. The onset of the nystagmus is delayed with typically a 1- to 2-second latency that lasts for 10 to 20 seconds and is associated with a sensation of rotational vertigo. With this positioning maneuver, nystagmus and vertigo occur with the affected ear down. If a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is considered clinically, the Hallpike-Dix maneuver is not recommended because it may interfere with immediate bedside treatment of this disorder.All patients who have symptoms of vertigo must undergo hearing testing or, in infants, auditory brainstem evoked response testing. Additional pediatric investigations depend on the characteristics of the vertigo and accompanying symptoms in the individual patient. Children who have persistent nonspecific vertigo require a complete blood count, glucose tolerance test, and measurement of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and thyroid function. Certain patients may require testing for sickle cell disease. Patients who have sensorineural hearing loss or neurologic findings should receive computed tomography with thin cuts through the temporal bones, magnetic resonance imaging (± gadolinium), or angiography. If there is a history of associated loss of consciousness, an electroencephalographic study should be obtained.Based on the course of the symptoms, the physical examination, and the results of the previously noted investigations, the child may require referral to an otolaryngologist for additional vestibular testing. Caloric testing is the definitive procedure for identification of vestibular pathology. Electronystagmography is a collection of examinations for the saccadic, optokinetic, and smooth pursuit systems and of nystagmus induced by warming and cooling the labyrinth. These tests are nonspecific and do not provide a diagnosis, but when results are abnormal, they are suggestive of vestibular dysfunction.Other testing used by otolaryngologists in specific circumstances includes rotating chair tests, vestibular autorotation test (physiologic stimuli of high frequency produced by active head oscillations), and posturography (sway movement testing).Acute-onset vertigo or paroxysmal episodes of vertigo can be approached clinically based on the presence or absence of hearing loss (Table 2). If vertigo is continuous and unremitting, assessment can be based on the presence or absence of neurologic abnormalities (Table 3). The diagnosis of labyrinthitis is based on a history of infection preceding the onset of vertigo and the presence of hearing impairment. The child usually is most comfortable lying on the unaffected side. Any movement causes severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. These episodic symptoms usually subside after several days. This condition is much more frequent in children than had been recognized in the past and often is caused by minor head trauma. There is a sudden onset of hearing loss and vertigo from rupture of the round or oval window into the vestibule that results in the creation of a fistula. An abrupt change in barometric pressure (eg, decompression syndrome) also can result in a similar rupture.Menière syndrome is very uncommon in children. Symptoms consist of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, a sensation of pressure in the ear, and tinnitus. Recurrent episodes of vertigo and tinnitus are common, with progressive hearing loss after each event.This disorder primarily occurs in adolescents following respiratory infection. Symptoms include vertigo, nausea, and vomiting with postural instability. Episodes are self-limited but tend to recur with decreasing intensity. Diagnosis is made by electronystagmography and thermal caloric testing. Benign paroxysmal vertigo presents initially between 1 and 2 years of age, with symptoms recurring to the age of 4 years. The child presents suddenly with extreme unsteadiness and may be unable to remain upright. Nystagmus may be present, but other symptoms such as vomiting are uncommon. The child is fully conscious throughout the entire episode. Many children develop migraine later in life. The diagnosis is supported by a family history of migraine. Another migraine variant seen in infants is paroxysmal torticollis. A child who has this rare form of migraine will tilt his or her head to one side for several hours (and infrequently for up to several days). There may be associated vomiting. These episodes usually cease by 2 years of age, with many children developing typical migraine headaches by early childhood.Head trauma with or without temporal bone fracture can produce labyrinthine concussion. There is severe vertigo, with unsteadiness and falling toward the affected side. These symptoms may persist, but they gradually diminish in intensity over a 4- to 6-week period.Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has been described in children as young as 11 years of age. The cause has been determined to be the presence of free-floating debris in the posterior semicircular canal. This type of vertigo has been related to head trauma or vestibular neuronitis. In a proportion of patients, no cause can be found. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is provoked by a change in position and lasts for seconds. Basilar artery migraine presents primarily in adolescent girls with recurrent stereotypic attacks of brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction. The clinical features can include ataxia, dysarthria, vertigo, and tinnitus. There are variable bilateral visual complaints. Alternating hemiplegia and paresthesias of the face and limbs can occur, and there can be alteration of consciousness. A severe pounding or pulsatile headache will follow. Vertigo also may be the aura preceding a generalized seizure or present as an actual ictal phenomenon (partial complex seizure). Vestibulogenic seizures are very rare and represent a form of reflex sensory epilepsy (induced by spinning).The treatment of vertigo depends on the duration and discomfort of the symptom and the underlying pathology. Acute vertigo can be treated symptomatically and with reassurance. Antiemetics can be given rectally or intramuscularly. Vestibular sedation or suppressant medication is also useful (meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, and diazepam). Persistent severe nausea and vomiting may require administration of prochlorperazine or metoclopramide.Most children who have acute vertigo recover spontaneously over a period of several weeks to months. Symptomatic recovery is due to vestibular compensation and central plasticity (reorganization of vestibular circuits). In some children and adolescents, symptoms recur, often in association with physical or psychological stress. Medications producing vestibular sedation should not be prescribed for long-term daily use because they may interfere with the normal compensation process.A specific treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a bedside maneuver (Epley particle repositioning maneuver). This maneuver relocates the free floating debris from the posterior semicircular canal into the vestibule of the labyrinth. Symptomatic relief after a single treatment session is reported in 80% to 90% of patients, although 15% to 30% may have recurrence of symptoms. The maneuver is repeated until nystagmus no longer can be elicited (Figure). A modified version of the Epley maneuver can be taught to patients with instructions to perform the activity three times a day until there are no symptoms of positional vertigo for 24 hours.Chronic or recurrent vertigo is often resistant to treatment, but it may respond to a course of clonazepam or carbamazepine. Exercise regimens also have been prescribed, with balance and gait training during dynamic tasks that precipitate the patient’s symptoms. These exercises are practiced until an asymptomatic state is reached. Management of accompanying psychological symptoms (eg, anxiety, panic attacks, depression) depends on the nature of the associated symptom.Surgical procedures for the treatment of vertigo rarely are required in childhood. Endolymphatic arachnoid shunt operations are successful in 65% of patients who have Menière disease. Disabling vertigo due to vestibular nerve or labyrinthine disorders may require vestibular nerve section. Surgery is an option for patients who have severe intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo using procedures to disable the posterior semicircular canal.Appropriate management of vertigo depends on determination of the etiology and carefully tailored treatment plans specific to the vestibular or central disorder producing the vertigo.",

      "title": "Exertional Rhabdomyolysis",
      "abstract": "Introduction Rhabdomyolysis is defined as the breakdown of muscle fibers that results in the release of muscle proteins and other cellular constituents into the circulation. Exercise, particularly when strenuous and unaccustomed, causes damage and subsequent muscle fiber breakdown, known as exertional rhabdomyolysis [1]. Evidence of muscle damage is derived from microscopic analysis of muscle biopsy samples taken from subjects who have undergone strenuous exercise [1]. Muscle fibers from these subjects show focal disruption in the banding patterns; particularly evident is Z-line streaming [2]. Determination of muscle damage is often made from analysis of blood samples; the most common measure of muscle damage is creatine kinase (CK), although many other muscle constituents have been assessed in blood samples, such as myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, troponin I, and myosin heavy chain [3]. Symptoms of exertional muscle damage are muscle soreness, pain, swelling, and stiffness. Pain generally develops in the hours after exercise and peaks between 24 and 48 hours postexercise [1]. The muscle has a tremendous capacity to repair itself, and it is suggested that the damage/repair process may be the stimulus for muscle growth and adaptation to exercise [4]. Pain is generally tolerable and temporary, and therefore of little clinical concern. However, rhabdomyolysis becomes clinically relevant when pain becomes debilitating, a compartment syndrome ensues, or elevated levels of circulating myoglobin precipitate in the kidney tubules. These precipitates can obstruct the renal tubules, lead to tubular necrosis, and effectively shut down the kidneys [5–7]. The increase in blood concentration of myoglobin after strenuous exercise is significantly correlated with the increase in CK activity [8]. Because of the relationship of CK and myoglobin, and the fact that measuring CK is less expensive and produces test results faster than myoglobin, elevated CK levels have been used as a surrogate for myoglobin and taken to indicate a risk of acute renal failure. In fact, recent attention has been drawn to monitoring CK in patients taking cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins) to assess the risk of myopathy and renal failure [9]. However, there appears to be little consensus concerning the amount of CK in the blood that would indicate a risk [9]. In cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, there is no commonly accepted CK threshold for determining when to hospitalize and treat individuals who present with elevated CK [8]. Terpilowski and Criddle [10] published an algorithm in which a CK greater than 20,000 U/L was the threshold to begin treatment to prevent renal failure with rhabdomyolysis. In the acute clinical setting, this arbitrary CK threshold of 20,000 U/L seems reasonable and prudent. Granted, CK values of up to 20,000 U/L are common and can seem benign in exertional rhabdomyolysis. For example, a study of serial CK values in 12 football players participating in two-a-day practices showed that, by day 4 their mean CK level was just over 5000 U/L, with one player at nearly 19,000 U/L, yet no player had any problems [11]. Also, as cited below and often discussed anecdotally among sports medicine physicians, cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis exist in patients with initial CK values well over 20,000 U/L, yet who recover simply with oral hydration. This may be why most experts who advise on management of exertional rhabdomyolysis do not cite a CK threshold for hospital admission [12–14]. What is key is not the CK level per se, but the setting, degree, stage, and tempo of the exertional rhabdomyolysis. Comorbidities such as heat stress, dehydration, shock, acidosis, and pre-existing illness can accelerate and compound the clinical problems. Life-threatening hyperkalemia can develop quickly, compartment syndromes can ensue, and initially it is difficult to predict whether, or how fast, renal failure may develop. Oral hydration and outpatient observation may suffice for a stable patient with CK of 20,000 to 50,000 U/L (and possibly higher), normal creatinine, and good urine flow. But in light of the clinical uncertainties cited above, it seems reasonable to argue that most patients who present to the emergency room with evidence of acute exertional rhabdomyolysis and a CK threshold of 20,000 U/L should be treated with vigorous intravenous hydration and close monitoring in the hospital for at least a day or two. CK Increase After Exercise Most strenuous exercise results in an increase in blood CK activity because of the stress placed on the contracting muscle fibers. Peaks of up to 80,000 U/L have been reported after exercise with no clinical consequence [8]. However, endurance exercises, even as prolonged and strenuous as marathon running, result in only relatively small increases in CK for the amount of muscle mass involved in the exercise. For example, Smith et al. [15] reported that CK activity in 34 runners immediately after the London Marathon was 707.8 U/L. Similar values were reported in a group of 16 runners immediately after a marathon with a peak increase of 2477 U/L at 24 hours postexercise, returning to near baseline by 96 hours postexercise [16]. Cycling for 2 hours resulted in an increase in CK of 542 U/L at 24 hours after the exercise [17]. Downhill running is often used as a laboratory model to produce muscle soreness and damage because the eccentric (muscle lengthening) contractions are exaggerated in this form of activity as the muscles produce a braking action to counterbalance the downhill forces. Although eccentric actions are known to produce muscle damage, the increase in CK activity after downhill running is relatively small because the contractions are not forceful. For example, Peake et al. [18] reported a CK increase of 1000 U/L 24 hours after a 45-minute bout of downhill running at 60% VO2max, and Pizza et al. [19] reported peak CK values of about 850 U/L 12 hours after 60 minutes of downhill running at 70% VO2max. From these studies and others [3,20,21], CK peaks about 24 hours after endurance-type exercise with peaks generally less than 5000 U/L. High-force eccentric contractions produce a large strain on muscle fibers resulting in considerably greater damage compared with endurance-type activities [1]. Over the past 20 years, our laboratory has used strenuous one-arm exercise to examine elevated CK levels produced by muscle injury [7,22–27]. Most of these studies used small sample sizes, but we and others have occasionally observed that some subjects are “high-responders” to this standard exercise, with postexercise blood CK values as high as 80,000 U/L [8,26]. We recently examined blood CK activity in 208 subjects who performed 50 maximal eccentric contractions of the elbow flexor muscles. The average CK increase was about 7500 U/L, peaking at 4 days postexercise and returning to near baseline by 10 days postexercise. In a study from another laboratory [28], nine subjects performed 100 maximal eccentric contractions of the knee extensors; the peak CK activity at 4 days postexercise was 18,129 U/L, and at 11 days postexercise CK remained elevated at 1009 U/L, then returned to baseline by 14 days. High-force eccentric contractions of isolated muscle groups show a larger (often > 5000 U/L) and more delayed peak (4–5 days postexercise) in circulating CK activity compared with endurance type exercises. Relationship of CK and Renal Function Although we and others have reported cases in which CK is profoundly elevated after controlled exercise in laboratory experiments, we have never provoked renal failure, nor has renal failure been reported in the numerous laboratory studies of exercise-induced muscle damage. However, these studies have typically not monitored renal function to determine possible renal compromise. Clinical definitions of acute renal failure are commonly based on changes in creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and urine output. In a recent report [8], we presented data on measures of renal function (potassium, osmolality, BUN, creatinine, phosphorus, and uric acid) in the 208 subjects who performed strenuous one-arm eccentric exercise. Despite CK levels for 11 subjects between 15,000 and 20,000 U/L, 16 subjects between 21,000 and 30,000 U/L, and eight subjects between 31,000 and 80,000 U/L, there was no impairment in renal function. Hurley [29] described a case of a 16-year-old boy who presented at an office visit with a 2-day history of dark urine and painful, swollen arms produced from a 2-hour weight lifting regimen performed 3 days prior. His CK was 181,690 U/L, myoglobinuria was positive, and creatinine was normal. He was not hospitalized and recovered with supportive therapy of rest, fluids, and analgesics. We [30] described the case of a 37-year-old emergency room physician who performed excessive exercise in a health club under direction of a personal trainer. The day after the exercise session, he noted severe arm pain, and on the following day, dark urine. His blood CK levels over a 3-day period were 19,746, 70,158, and 45,461 U/L. He was not hospitalized and recovered with self-treatment of oral hydration and bicarbonate. There have been many reports of rhabdomyolysis induced by recreational exercise [30–45], but fewer incidents of concomitant acute renal failure when there is no other underlying problem (eg, drug or alcohol abuse, or underlying genetic predisposition such as sickle cell trait or carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency) [45–48]. Demos et al. [38] reported data on 11 Marine Corps recruits who were hospitalized with muscle pain and swelling of the shoulders and arms on the third day of basic training that included push-ups, pull-ups, rope climbs and other upper body exercises. Eight of the 11 men noted dark urine and dipstick analysis indicated the presence of heme pigment for all patients. Serum BUN, creatinine, electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, and total and direct bilirubin levels were normal. The men were hospitalized, treated with fluid infusion, and had an uneventful recovery. The CKs on the day after admission ranged from 26,708 U/L to 109,609 U/L. Sinert et al. [49] reported 35 cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis in young healthy male prisoners who had performed exercise, specifically repetitive squat jumps, chin-ups, or lifting weights, as a consequence of losing a game of dominoes. The prisoners presented to the hospital an average of 2.7 days after the exercise exertion with symptoms of thigh or arm pain and a change in urine color. The range in CK was 700 U/L to 165,000 U/L. None presented with hyperkalemia, acidosis, or elevated creatinine or BUN, and other blood tests were normal. All patients tested positive for blood in the urine without microscopic hematuria. Although some of these men presented with alarmingly high CK levels, by the time they presented to the hospital, they were likely already on the way to healing. However, patients were hospitalized and all but one treated with intravenous forced bicarbonate diuresis. No patient developed renal failure. In most of the cases, treatment did not occur until at least 48 hours after the exercise, which is common in cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, in which patients do not present to the emergency room until 48 hours after the event when the urine is either noticeably dark and/or the pain is severe. Generally heat stress, dehydration, exercise-induced aciduria (which decreases myoglobin's solubility), or trauma are factors when exertional rhabdomyolysis (high CK) results in acute renal failure in otherwise healthy people [49]. Seedat et al. [46] examined hospital records over an 18-year time frame (1969–1986) and noted that 19 runners who participated in the Comrades Marathon in South Africa were admitted to the renal unit for treatment of acute renal failure, where dehydration and hypotension were present. Another case report [48] described a 25-year-old woman who hiked down the Grand Canyon in an ambient temperature of 100°F for 4 hours and suddenly collapsed. Four hours later she was transported to the hospital, where her laboratory test results indicated a serum creatinine of 3.2 mg/dL, BUN of 21 mg/dL, and an impressive CK of 1.6 million U/L. She was treated for heat stroke and acute renal failure. Even those with moderate increases in CK may develop acute renal failure. Hurley [29] described the case of a 17-year-old young man who presented with nausea and back pain 48 hours after participating in a high school football game and a session of bongo drum playing. Because of the back pain and possibility of trauma, an intravenous pyelogram was performed that showed poorly functioning kidneys with faint nephrogram. His CK on hospital admittance was 1723 U/L and increased the next day to 2423 U/L. Creatinine levels were 3.0 on admittance and 5.9, 9.0, and 2.5 mg/dL over the next several days. It was concluded that the myoglobinemia (from exercise) and radiographic contrast material led to acute renal failure. Baysal et al. [45] described a case of a 21-year-old man who participated in 1.5 hours of weight lifting exercise. He appeared to have no evidence of dehydration, heat stress, or other intervening factors, and presented 4 days later with painful, swollen arms and dark urine. CK was 101,080 U/L, BUN was 73 mg/dL, and creatinine was 8.4 mg/dL. A kidney biopsy showed acute tubular necrosis with eosinophilic material in the tubules. The authors suggested that the swelling produced a type of compartment syndrome leading to continued muscle breakdown. Conclusions Recreational activity frequently produces large increases in circulating CK activity without consequence. Thus, high CK levels alone do not portend renal failure. Most cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis can, and probably do, resolve on their own without treatment. When taking a blood sample during a routine check, for example in monitoring patients on statin therapy, a high blood CK activity may indicate that strenuous exercise was performed in the previous 10 days. Patients should be queried as to their exercise history during this time. Snow shoveling, dirt shoveling, lifting and lowering heavy boxes, strenuous resistance training, and excessive calisthenics (such as push-ups and pull-ups) are exercises that may dramatically increase circulating CK activity for several days due to forceful eccentric contractions. In addition to elevated CK, factors such as underlying disease, dehydration, environmental heat stress, or genetic predisposition (eg, sickle cell trait) are likely required for exertional rhabdomyolysis to result in acute renal failure [8]. Persons who present to the emergency room with painful, swollen muscles about 2 days after a bout of strenuous exercise should be monitored for kidney function (BUN and creatinine), evidence of myoglobinuria and dehydration, and be queried regarding hydration, heat stress during the exercise, and possible trauma. In cases of exertional rhabdomyolysis, especially in laboratory situations, CK levels up to 100,000 U/L in the absence of nephrotoxic factors have been found to resolve without consequence when no treatment is provided. However, because few data confirm this in a clinical situation in which there may be comorbidities, it remains conservative and prudent in the emergency room to hydrate intravenously and monitor closely to help avoid hyperkalemia and/or acute renal failure in the face of fulminant exertional rhabdomyolysis.",

      "title": "CLINICAL APPROACH TO THE MANAGEMENT OF INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Resistance of seizures to anti‐epileptic therapy may be due to patient error, or to physician diagnostic and/or treatment error, rather than being truly intractable epilepsy. Increased drug dosage, irrespective of blood levels, a change of drug, or the addition of a second drug, are variously indicated in truly resistant cases. The use of more than two drugs is better avoided, and in some cases reduction of treatment may improve seizure control while lessening side‐effects. Repeated assessment of patients with refractory epilepsy is important, as causative or provocative factors may remain latent for long periods. Surgical therapy probably should be used more often and earlier than it now is for epilepsies that are medically intractable. RÉSUMÉ Approche clinique de la prise en charge de I'épilepsie irréductible La résistance des crises au traitement épileptique peut étre dûe à des erreurs du patient (style de vie désordonné, manque de compliànce) ou à des erreurs des médecins dans le diagnostic ou le traitement plutol que de traduire une véritable épilepsie irréductible. Un accroissement des doses de médicament, négligeant les taux sériques, une modification de médication ou l'addition d'un second médicament sont indiqués de façon variable dans les cas authentiquement résistants. II est préférable d'éviter l'emploi de plus de deux médicaments et dans quelques cas, une réduction des doses de médication peut améliorer le contrôle des crises tout en atténuant les effets secondaires. Une évaluation répétée des patients avec épilepsie irréductible est importante, les facteurs étiologiques et favorisants pouvant rester latents durant de longues périodes. La chirurgie devrait probablement être utilisée plus souvent et plus précocément qu'actuellement pour les patients dont I'épilepsie est médicalement irréductible. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Ein klinischer Vorstoβ in der Behandlung den unbeein fluβbaren Epilepsie Die Therapieresistenz von Krampfänfallen auf Antiepileptika ist eher durch Fehler des Patienten (unausgeglichener Lebensstil, fehlende Compliance) oder durch Fehler in der Diagnose oder Therapie des Arztes bedingt, als daß es sich wirklich um eine unbeeinflußbare Epilepsie handelt. Bei wirklich resistenten Fällen ist eine Erhöhung der Dosis ohne Rücksicht auf die Blutspiegel, ein Wechsel des Medikamentes oder die Zugabe eines zweiten Präparates wahlweise indiziert. Die Gabe von mehr als zwei Medikamenten sollte besser vermieden werden und in einigen Fällen können reduzierte Medikamentenspiegel die Krampfkontrolle verbessern und gleichzeitig Nebenwirkungen verhindern. Patienten mit unbeeinflußbarer Epilepsie müssen häufig kontrolliert werden, da kausale und provokative Faktoren über lange Zeit verborgen bleiben können. Patienten mitmedikamentös unbeeinflußbarer Epilepsie sollten häufiger und früher operativ behandelt werden, als es zur Zeit geschieht. RESUMEN Aproximación clínica al tratamiento de la epilepsia intratable La resistencia de las crisis a la terapéutica antiepiléptica puede deberse a un fallo en el paciente (tipo de vida errático falta de complianza) o a errores del médico en el diagnóstico o el tratamiento, más bien que se trate realmente de una epilepsia intratable. El aumento en la dosificación del fármaco, independientemente de los dosajes en sangre, un cambio en la medicación o la adición de un segundo fármaco es lo que suele indicarse en los casos verdaderamente resistentes. Es mejor evitar el uso de dos fármacos y en ocasiones la reductión de los niveles de fármaco puede mejorar el control de las crisis disminuyéndose los efectos secundarios. La evaluación repetida de los pacientes con epilepsias intratables es importante, puesto que los factores causales y los desencadenantes pueden permanecer latentes durante mucho tiempo. Es probable que la cirugía debiera usarse con mayor frecuencia y más tempranamente de lo que lo es ahora en los pacientes cuya epilepsia es médicamente intratable.",

The behavior is a result of conscious or unconscious stimuli aimed at alleviating stress. TTM can be diagnosed, typically by a psychiatrist or dermatologist, with various assessment tools and scales. Although researchers continue to discover new pharmacologic regimens and nonpharmacologic therapies, there is no single, effective, US Food and Drug Administration-approved option available for patients. Treatment of TTM with the least occurrence of relapse consists of a combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic options and calls for the involvement of a multidisciplinary team along with family members and friends. This review provides an analysis of the current treatment modalities in the management of TTM and highlights the need for further epidemiologic, genetic, neuroimaging, and dietary research to better understand the complicated nature of the disorder.",

Nyeri kepala dapat merupakan nyeri kepala primer yang belum diketahui penyebabnya, atau nyeri kepala sekunder akibat kelainan intrakranial ataupun ekstrakranial. Melatonin adalah hormon yang dihasilkan oleh kelenjar pineal yang sekresinya berkaitan dengan hipotalamus. Melatonin memiliki peranan dalam berbagai sistem vital di dalam tubuh, salah satunya sebagai pengatur siklus sirkadian dan sebagai antinyeri. Defisiensi melatonin atau gangguan sekresi melatonin dikaitkan dengan patogenesis beberapa nyeri kepala primer seperti nyeri kepala migren, nyeri kepala klaster, dan nyeri kepala hipnik. Saat ini melatonin sudah mulai digunakan sebagai terapi yang potensial maupun sebagai profilaksis pada nyeri kepala migren, nyeri kepala klaster, dan nyeri kepala hipnik.

The effect of a constant or constantly recurring cause of disturbance may be seen to produce not only the simpler forms of mental disorder, but may also be recognised as a true cause of the gravest form of nervous disease. The mind may be upset, just as the temper may be ruined, by slight domestic worries; and this disturbance of mind may be followed by disease of the brain. In my experience, the brain is destroyed in general paralytics more frequently by constant causes of excitement or anxiety and worry, than by any sudden injury or shock.",

Headache also occurs after more severe brain injury. However, for some reason, as yet unidentified, it tends to be a much less common phenomenon in this group of patients when compared with the incidence following mild traumatic brain injury. This suggests that the traumatic brain injury (TBI) itself is probably not the primary cause of the headache because it would logically follow that if it was one would expect more headache problems with more severe TBI, which is not the case in practice. Headache is also a common problem after cranial trauma, as well as spinal acceleration-deceleration (i.e. whiplash) injuries (1,2).",

      "title": "Schizophrenia Is Normal: My Journey Through Diagnosis, Treatment, and Recovery",
      "abstract": "Most of us have special powers. When a child we care about is hurt and we are nearby, we can generally find something to say or do that will bring a smile (or sense of safety) to them. This can go so far as to take physical pain (eg, from a scraped elbow) and transform it so that it no longer hurts. We are all analgesics for those we love, to some extent. This is one of the fruits of adulthood. There are others, such as the ability not to notice when our bodies are falling apart. Perhaps this is not a special power! Maybe it is just that we are less sensitive to some things. And perhaps it is the case that the things we cannot change, we do not spend time on. Life does become more dear with age. Gratitude is not a gift of adulthood. It is something that children enjoy as well. Schizophrenia typically manifests during adolescence, in the period between childhood and adulthood, when hormonal and other changes are also transforming the person from who they were to who they dreamed of being. Those dreams are hard to realize for all of us, not just for the person with schizophrenia. Life and growth are a challenge! I am 44 years old at the time of this writing, autumn of 2013. My first psychotic episode was at age 20, in January of 1989. The last time I took any psychiatric medication was in March, 2006. Over the course of the illness, I was hospitalized 10 times, for a combined period of about 6 months. The period from January 2001 until my last dose of psychiatric medication I undertook a self-initiated protocol of weaning from the drugs, as slowly as one may imagine. I do not have symptoms which would classify me as having schizophrenia any more. I do not fear relapse, nor do I spend any time thinking about it. I have beat the diagnosis, and recovered. In truth, I did have special powers. I still do, as do we all. But I also had a few effects which were difficult to manage. Imagine that a person wishes to move their shoulder. They can think about moving their shoulder, and they can consciously move it—and that might be termed agency. We all have agency with our bodies. I can move my shoulder as much as I like. This is not distressing. Much more distressing is the sense that one has some agency for things outside one’s body. Not that there is not something to this. I have been known to try hard to make someone smile, or otherwise affect the world by my actions. But this is much more distressing when the sense of agency and ability to transform the world hinges on one’s thoughts. This was a major symptom of schizophrenia that I had. There is nothing wrong with odd conditions so long as they do not interfere with one’s life. For the shaman or social worker who can successfully transform the world, God bless them. What makes the thing an illness is when it interferes. Other symptoms I had were:",

The majority of cases are related to spinal dysraphism. TCS can present in any age group, and presentations differ according to the underlying pathologic condition and age, with pain, cutaneous signs, orthopedic deformities and neurological deficits being the most common. Surgical untethering is indicated in patients with progressive or new onset symptomatology attributable to TCS. The surgical strategy aims to release the tethering structure and thus the chronic tension on the cord. Early operative intervention is associated with improved outcomes. Pain relief is accomplished in almost all cases. Realistic surgical goals include relief of pain and stabilization of neurological function, although improvement in function is often seen. Cord untethering can also halt the progression of scoliosis. The benefits of surgery are debated in asymptomatic patients and patients with normal imaging.",

Tidur\r\nmerupakan kebutuhan bukan suatu keadaan istirahat yang tidak bermanfaat.\r\nNamun ada kalanya seseorang mengalami kesulitan tidur yang menyebabkan\r\nberkurangnya waktu tubuh untuk beristirahat, maupun untuk menjaga\r\nkeseimbangan metabolisme dan biokimiawi tubuh.\r\nBanyak sekali faktor yang menyebabkan seseorang mengalami insomnia,\r\nantara lain adalah faktor biologis dan psikologis. Kesulitan-kesulitan saat\r\npenyusunan skripsi sering dirasakan sebagai beban berat, akibatnya kesulitan yang\r\ndirasakan tersebut berkembang menjadi perasaan negatif yang menimbulkan\r\nketegangan, kekhawatiran, stress dan dapat menyebabkan insomnia.\r\nPenelitian ini bertujuan untuk melihat gambaran insomnia yang dialami\r\nmahasiswa selama menyusun skripsi, penyebab insomnia yang dialami subjek,\r\ngejala yang dialami subjek, serta strategi yang dilakukan untuk mengatasi\r\ninsomnia tersebut. Insomnia merupakan suatu kondisi ketidakpuasan seseorang\r\ndalam hal kuantitas atau kualitas tidurnya dan berlangsung selama beberapa waktu\r\n(Lumbantombing, 2004). Insomnia dapat disebabkan karena masalah psikis pada\r\nseseorang, rasa cemas dan perasaan takut yang berlebihan, bekerja terlampau\r\nlama dan keras, rasa sakit dan perasaan tidak menyenangkan.\r\nSubjek dalam penelitian ini adalah mahasiswa yang tengah menyusun\r\nskripsi yang mengalami insomnia selama lebih dari 1 bulan. Subjek berjumlah dua\r\norang subjek primer, dan dua orang subjek sekunder untuk masing-masing subjek\r\nprimer. Peneliti mengambil sampel penelitian dari mahasiswa psikologi\r\nUniversitas Negeri Semarang. Dalam penelitian ini peneliti menggunakan teknik\r\nobservasi non partisipan, yaitu peneliti secara pasif tidak terlibat langsung dalam\r\naktifitas yang sedang berlangsung dan terjadi sambil mencatat tingkah laku di\r\nsekitarnya. Peneliti juga menggunakan teknik wawancara yang bersifat\r\nsemiterstruktur yaitu wawancara dilakukan secara terbuka tetapi tetap\r\nberpedoman pada pertanyaan-pertanyaan tertulis.\r\nBerdasarkan keseluruhan hasil dan pembahasan dalam penelitian yang\r\ndiperoleh dalam penelitian studi kasus ini maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa, jenis\r\ninsomnia yang dialami subjek termasuk insomnia kronis (cronic insomnia). Bila\r\nsubjek sudah sama sekali tidak bisa tidur (dalam dua puluh empat jam subjek\r\ntidak tidur), subjek langsung meminum obat tidur yang diperjualbelikan secara\r\nbebas. Gejala-gejala insomnia yang dialami subjek antara lain subjek mengalami\r\nkesulitan untuk memulai tidur. AR harus membuat dirinya merasa lelah terlebih\r\ndulu agar dapat tidur, jika tetap tidak dapat tidur maka AR akan memaksakan\r\nmemejamkan mata agar dapat tidur, sedangkan NM harus menutup matanya\r\ndengan kain agar dapat tertidur. Gejala lain adalah kedua subjek merasa lesu dan\r\npusing saat bangun tidur dan susah berkonsentrasi saat melakukan pekerjaan.\r\nFaktor penyebab yang dialami subjek sehingga dapat menyebabkan\r\ninsomnia yaitu yang pertama karena permasalahan yang timbul saat penyusunan\r\nskripsi, yang kedua yaitu karena tuntutan orangtua yang menginginkan agar\r\nsubjek dapat menyelesaikan kuliahnya dengan cepat, dan mendapatkan gelar\r\nsarjana. Adapun faktor yang ketiga yaitu karena waktu perkuliahan yang sudah\r\nmendekati batas. Simpulan keempat, Gangguan insomnia memberikan dampak\r\nnegatif dalam kehidupan subjek. Pertama, akan mengurangi daya tahan tubuh\r\nsehingga berpeluang terhadap munculnya penyakit. Kedua, susah tidur akan\r\nberpengaruh terhadap stabilitas emosi sehingga mempengaruhi aktivitas\r\nkehidupan sehari-hari. Subjek mangalami penurunan tingkat motivasi,\r\nkonsentrasi, ketelitian, kreativitas, dan produktivitas kerja. Dari penelitian yang\r\ntelah dilakukan maka peneliti dapat memberikan saran pada subjek untuk\r\nmengurangi dan menghilangkan segala kekhawatiran dan kecemasan dengan\r\nbersikap optimis dan merilekskan diri saat melakukan pekerjaan, terutama saat\r\nakan tidur.\r\nSaran kedua adalah olahraga pada sore hari (enam jam sebelum tidur).\r\nMelakukan peregangan otot atau jalan kaki secukupnya selama duapuluh menit.\r\nHal ini akan meningkatkan metabolisme dan suhu badan, lalu akan menurun\r\nsekitar enam jam kemudian yang berefek pada tidur yang nyenyak. Ketiga,\r\nMengurangi rokok dan tidak merokok beberapa jam sebelum tidur karena rokok\r\nmengandung nikotin yang dapat meningkatkan semangat karena berefek sebagai\r\nneurostimulan. Selain itu rokok dapat membahayakan kesehatan diri sendiri dan\r\norang lain di sekitarnya, karena orang lain yang tidak merokok tetapi terkena asap\r\nrokok juga akan mengalami gangguan kesehatan dengan resiko yang sama.",

If we want to truly\r\n understand the hormonal health and, more importantly, realize it and hold it, we can not\r\n ignore the connection between hormonal health with the health of the intestine, our largest\r\n immune organ. The role of nurses is essential through all stages in the process of health\r\n care of patients with hormonal disorders. The basis for a speedy recovery and prevent\r\n complications is timely recognition and fulfillment of basic human needs. It is necessary\r\n to respect the patient's uniqueness and individuality and their rights to participate in the\r\n care. In the history of the patients taking data on medical history, patient concerns about\r\n sudden weight gain or weight loss, insomnia, headaches, irregular menstrual cycles,\r\n fatigue, decreased libido, hair loss and depression. It is necessary to identify exacerbations\r\n related to eating habits, stress or remission. It is important to recognize the family\r\n predisposition, stress related to the workplace, various food allergies, alcohol, coffee and\r\n nicotine, to assess nutritional status and psychosocial status of patients. Health care,\r\n which provide nurses with today's medical-technical achievements and recognized\r\n standards of treatment, should provide comprehensive quality, safety and health sequence\r\n of procedures respecting the principles to protect public health. The patient explains the\r\n cause of the disease and suggests the correction that needs to be done, as well as hormone\r\n replacement therapy, which is natural for body. It takes lifestyle changes that patients\r\n sometimes hardly accept, so it is important to support and obtain necessary advice and\r\n information from highly trained, specialized and competent nurses.",

      "title": "[The role of folates in the diverse biochemical processes that control mental function].",
      "abstract": "A variety of studies indicate that folate deficiency is associated with the appearance of problems of a neuromuscular or neurological nature such as depression, muscular and mental fatigue, states of confusion and non-senile dementia, and that these processes improve fully or partly when the deficiency is corrected. Because of the role of folates in the reactions in synthesis of neuro-transmitter and elements of neuron structure, it is not surprising that a deficiency is associated with depression and other mental problems. Folates are involved in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) which is the main contributor of methyl groups in the nervous system and whose action as an antidepressive agent is confirmed. They are also involved in the synthesis of glutamate which is an excitant neurotransmitter, and in the formation of puric and pyrimidic bases. An alternative mechanism for explaining the etiopathogenesis of folate deficiency in depression and other mental disorders involves the regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin (THB) which is an essential cofactor in hydroxylation process in the brains of mammals. Folate deficiency is a common nutritional problem in many groups of the Spanish population and, given the role of this vitamin in the operation of the nervous system, we might consider the possibility that, in some case, folate deficiency may cause or aggravate some alterations to mental function.",

      "abstract": "\"Psychosomatic medicine\" does not demand that the general practitioner function as a psychiatrist; rather, it is a psychiatric orientation that can increase the effectiveness of purely medical treatment for such conditions as neuroses. The general practitioner to whom the patient turns may achieve permanent results with nonverbal techniques where formal psychotherapy would be impracticable or unacceptable. The first aim is to relieve pressure so that the patient can regain his mental balance and thereby his self-confidence. Arts, hobbies, sports, and the like can be prescribed rather specifically according to the patient's personality and needs. Nutrition can be improved simply at first by prescribing needed additions to diet rather than imposing restrictions. Vitamin deficiency may by itself be the cause of neurosis or more serious mental disease, whereas psychic stress by itself may create a need for additional vitamin intake. Hormone therapy may be extremely helpful but must be based on clear indication and limited to specific purposes. Since lack of sleep and rest quickly impairs mental function, it is important for neurotic persons to learn relaxation as a necessity for sleep. Sedatives may be used in a crisis but should be abandoned as soon as possible. With all drugs there are problems of excess and habituation. The least, the mildest, the shortest dosage is the ideal. THE INITIAL STEPS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY ARE AVAILABLE TO ANY PHYSICIAN: Establishing rapport, noting how complaints are stated, encouraging ventilation, winning confidence rather than immediate results.",

      "title": "Adjustment disorders: the state of the art",
      "abstract": "The diagnostic category of adjustment disorder was introduced in the DSM-III-R 1. Prior to that, it was called transient situational disturbance. The DSM-IV 2 and ICD-10 3 descriptions of adjustment disorder are broadly similar. The main features are the following: a) the symptoms arise in response to a stressful event; b) the onset of symptoms is within 3 months (DSM-IV) or 1 month (ICD-10) of exposure to the stressor; c) the symptoms must be clinically significant, in that they are distressing and in excess of what would be expected by exposure to the stressor and/or there is significant impairment in social or occupational functioning (the latter is mandatory in ICD-10); d) the symptoms are not due to another axis I disorder (or bereavement in DSM-IV); e) the symptoms resolve within 6 months once the stressor or its consequences are removed. Adjustment disorders are divided into subgroups based on the dominant symptoms of anxiety, depression or behaviour. Since its introduction, the category of adjustment disorder has been the subject of criticism on three fronts. The first was that it constituted an attempt to medicalize problems of living and did not conform to the criteria for traditional disorders such as having a specific symptom profile 4. The second was that it was a \"wastebasket diagnosis\" which was assigned to those who failed to meet the criteria for other disorders 5. The third was on its diagnostic instability 6 and that its main utility was to serve as a \"justification\" for diagnosis-based reimbursement operating in the healthcare system of the US. Despite this, the category has been retained in the further classifications, in large measure due to its clinical utility. Adjustment disorder continues to be diagnosed in a range of clinical settings. Consultation-liaison psychiatry is the context in which the diagnosis is most likely to be made. Around 12% of referrals are so diagnosed in university hospitals in the US 7, a figure that resembles that in European hospitals 8. Nevertheless, the frequency with which adjustment disorder is now diagnosed seems to be declining, in parallel with an increase in the diagnosis of major depression 9, possibly due to the availability of psychotropic drugs, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that are safer in those who are medically ill than the older agents. So, changes in the prevalence of adjustment disorders may reflect a change in the \"culture of prescribing\", stimulating changes in the \"culture of diagnosis\" 10. Adjustment disorder has been reported to be almost three times as common as major depression (13.7 vs. 5.1%) in acutely ill medical in-patients 11 and to be diagnosed in up to one third of cancer patients experiencing a recurrence 12. In obstetric/gynaecology consultation-liaison 13, adjustment disorders predominated over other mood disorders. Among those assessed in an emergency department following self harm, a diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% of those interviewed, while a diagnosis of major depression was made in 19.5% of cases 14. None of the major epidemiological studies carried out in the community, such as the Epidemiological Catchment Area Study 15, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 16 or the National Psychiatric Morbidity Surveys 17 included adjustment disorder among the conditions examined. An exception was the Outcome of Depression International Network (ODIN) study 18, which found a prevalence of only 1% for adjustment disorder in five European countries. A possible reason for this was that mild depression was included in the depressive episode category, inflating that category at the expense of adjustment disorder. By contrast, a study of elderly people from the general population 19 found the prevalence of adjustment disorder to be 2.3%, similar to that of major depression. Adjustment disorder is reported to be very common in primary care, but relevant epidemiological studies in this setting are rare and report rates of the disorder range from 1 to 18% 20,21 among consulters with mental health problems. Concerning psychiatric settings, a study of intake diagnoses into outpatient clinics 22, combining clinical evaluation and the use of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID, 23), found that adjustment disorder was the most common clinical diagnosis, made in 36% of patients, whereas the diagnosis was made in about 11% of cases using SCID. Among psychiatric inpatients, 9% of consecutive admissions to an acute public sector unit were diagnosed with adjustment disorder 24. Quantifying the prevalence of adjustment disorder in child and adolescent populations is difficult, due to changes in the diagnostic criteria over time 25. In the younger age groups, unlike adults, adjustment disorder carries with it significant morbidity and a poor outcome, frequently developing into major psychiatric illness 25,26. A general population study in Puerto Rico 27 found a rate of 4.2% among 14–16 year old people, while the total psychiatric morbidity was 17.8%. A similar rate was found in children aged 8–9 in Finland 28. Among outpatients, figures of 5.9–7% have been reported 29,30. In child liaison psychiatry, over one third of those with recent onset diabetes were so diagnosed 31, making it the most common psychiatric disorder to follow this well defined stressor. The current diagnosis of adjustment disorder assumes that there is a stressor which acts as a trigger and that the condition is self-limiting. So, adjustment disorder is closer to the definition of a discrete disorder as proposed by Kendell 32 than most other disorders in psychiatry, since its etiology and course are encapsulated within the diagnosis, while the definition of many other mental disorders is cross-sectional and based on symptoms alone. Yet, the current classifications impose a hierarchical model that assumes equivalence in how adjustment disorder and other diagnoses are construed. As currently classified, adjustment disorder is a sub-threshold diagnosis, that is trumped once the symptom threshold for another diagnosis is met. There is an inherent belief that a sub-threshold condition is less severe than a full-blown disorder such as major depression, the diagnosis by which adjustment disorder is most often superseded. Yet, the evidence for this is lacking, and there is empirical data 33 that, when measures of symptom severity or social functioning are examined, there is no difference between those with mood disorders and adjustment disorder. Furthermore, up to 25% of adolescents with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder engage in suicidal behaviour 34, while among adults with this disorder the figure is 60% 35. Adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide 36, while among all suicide deaths in the developing world it is the most common diagnosis 37. These data show that, far from being a mild condition, adjustment disorder has a significant impact on behaviour. On the other hand, the current classifications fail to distinguish between adaptive and maladaptive reactions to stress. The DSM-IV tries to address this problem by stating that a diagnosis of adjustment disorder is only made when the distress is of clinical significance 38. There are two components to this: the distress must be in excess of what would normally be expected and/or there is an impairment in social or occupational function. In relation to the first of these, one of the most insightful critics of the DSM-IV, J. Wakefield 39, points out that it would allow the top third in the normal distribution of mood reactivity to be classified as disordered, and that it does not take into account the contextual factors that might cause this excess in distress. For example, the loss of a job for one person might be manageable while for another it could heap poverty on a family resulting in distress that might not be inappropriate under the circumstances. Cultural differences in the expression of emotion also need to be considered. In liaison psychiatry, where the diagnosis of adjustment disorder is most frequently made, a knowledge of \"normal\" coping with illness in that specific culture is essential and the diagnostic process will be guided by the extent to which an individual's symptoms are in excess of this. Some might argue that the fact of visiting a doctor indicates abnormal distress, yet the tendency to consult is also determined by factors additional to illness, including cultural and personal attitudes to symptoms. So, the mere fact of a consultation should not of itself be taken as a proxy measure of excessive distress. Neither should the decision to refer to psychiatric services, since this too is governed by factors that are not always related to symptom severity (e.g., a wish \"to do something\" under pressure from a patient in the face of continuing distress). Because adjustment disorder is a diagnosis made in the context of a stressor, there is a danger that any distress following such an event might be labelled as a disorder 40. Clinical judgement, therefore, plays a large part in making the diagnosis of adjustment disorder in the current criterion vacuum and future classifications should accord weight to culture, context and personal circumstances in differentiating normal from pathological distress. The second criterion, requiring impairment in functioning, is arguably a more robust indicator of disorder, since it is this which leads to treatment seeking. For example, the inability to work is potentially a significant indicator of impairment. However, there may be situations where functioning is reduced in the presence of non-pathological reactions. For instance, if the circumstances are especially traumatic, such as the loss of a child, the period of impaired function may be longer than anticipated in those with non-pathological responses. The evaluation of functioning in children places special demands on the assessor, since it has to be set against the demands of the developmental stage, and the degree of dependency and autonomy in key relationships. The presence of pre-existing impairment and extant vulnerabilities, such as learning disability and developmental disorders, must also be considered when making the evaluation. The ICD-10, contrary to the DSM-IV, requires the presence of both excessive symptoms and functional impairment for the diagnosis of adjustment disorder, thus narrowing the application of this category. Because of the hierarchical nature of ICD-10 and DSM-IV, adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed once the criteria for another condition are met. The condition that most frequently trumps adjustment disorder is major depression/depressive episode. This is evident from studies that compare the clinical with the research approach. For example, in a study of those presenting because of self-harm, a clinical diagnosis of adjustment disorder was made in 31.8% and one of major depression in 19.5% of cases, but using SCID the proportions changed to 7.8% and 36.4% respectively 14. However, there is a point of departure between the two conditions when other variables are considered. Suicidal behaviour occurs earlier in the course of adjustment disorder as compared to major depression 41 and the interval from suicidal communication to completion of suicide is shorter 42. The socio-demographic profile and childhood risk variables differ between the two groups 41. Among adolescents dying by suicide, there is much less evidence of prior emotional or behavioural problems 42. In addition, the readmission rates for those with adjustment disorder are significantly lower than for those with major depression, generalized anxiety or dysthymia 43 and hospitalization is also shorter 6. This highlights the need for the clearer operationalization of adjustment disorder in future classifications. A further but lesser area of potential overlap is with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The conflation is not so much related to the symptoms of these disorders but to the stressors themselves. There has been an expansion in the stressors that are deemed to trigger PTSD, from those that are potentially life threatening, as originally described, to events that are less traumatic, such as financial problems or watching distressing images on television – a phenomenon called \"criterion creep\" 44. In clinical practice, a diagnosis of PTSD is often made reflexively 45 once such an event is identified, although adjustment disorder might be a more appropriate diagnosis. Overall, it is clear from the data available that adjustment disorder is sufficiently severe and distinct from other disorders, especially major depression, to warrant upgrading from its sub-syndromal status to that of a full-blown and independent mental disorder. Criteria for the DSM-IV revision have already been suggested 46. The Clinical Interview Schedule (CIS, 47) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI, 48) do not incorporate adjustment disorder at all. The Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN, 49) do include adjustment disorder, but only at the end of the interview, in section 13, which deals with \"inferences and attributions\". This comes after the criteria for all other disorders have been completed, and there are no specific questions with regard to adjustment disorder to assist the interviewer, relying instead on clinical judgement. The SCID 23 also includes a section dealing with adjustment disorder, but the instructions to interviewers specify that this diagnosis is not made if the criteria for any other mental disorder are met, with the de facto effect of relegating it to a sub-syndromal status. In light of the very low threshold for diagnosing major depression, even in studies using SCID and purporting to be inclusive of adjustment disorder, major depression will often supersede adjustment disorder, irrespective of the context in which the symptoms have arisen. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI, 50) also incorporates a section on adjustment disorder but, as in SCID, that disorder is trumped when any other diagnosis is made. So, while structured interviews have greatly facilitated epidemiological research in psychiatry, the possibility that they are overly rigid, having been designed for use by lay interviewers, cannot be excluded. This is especially pertinent for a diagnosis such as adjustment disorder, which relies heavily on clinical judgement, context and presumptive longitudinal course rather than symptoms alone. As a result of the problems with the current crop of structured diagnostic instruments, attempts have been made to identify suitable screening instruments for adjustment disorder. Because there is symptom overlap with major depression, there is a possibility that instruments which screen for depression might identify people with adjustment disorder. A number of scales have been used for this purpose, including the Zung Depression Scale 51, which has been shown to be an adequate screen for adjustment disorder and major depression combined 52, but when compared to SCID has inadequate sensitivity and specificity 53. A study of health care workers with \"reactive depression\", an old-fashioned diagnosis but one which encapsulates the concept of adjustment disorder most closely, found little correlation with the Zung scale score 54. Efforts to develop a screening instrument using a coping measure have also been unsuccessful 55. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS, 56) has been used for screening purposes in cancer patients, but it does not distinguish between major depression and adjustment disorder 57. Similar problems arose when the 1-Question Interview and the Impact Thermometer 58 were tested for their ability to screen for adjustment disorder. The Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology 59 might have a role in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression and has been used in one study reporting that non-environmentally induced disorder had more melancholic symptoms and a different quality to the mood changes compared to environmentally triggered disorder 59. Further investigation of this is clearly required. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed in the absence of a stressor. The event must be external and occur in close time proximity to the onset of symptoms. The longer the time period between the triggering event and the onset of symptoms, the less likely is the diagnosis to be adjustment disorder. For this reason, a period between the event and symptom onset of 3 months in DSM-IV and 1 month in ICD-10 is required. Caution must be exercised when this gap is relatively long, for two reasons: firstly, those who are depressed often attach significance to particular events, that in themselves were neutral in effect at the time, in an \"effort at meaning\"; secondly, recall bias may lead to an unreliable date of the event. The 3 month upper limit may prove to be excessively long and it is difficult to ascertain the empirical data on which this is based. Concerning the type of event, there is little to assist the clinician in distinguishing adjustment disorder from major depression. While 100% of those with a diagnosis of adjustment disorder have recent life events, 83% of those with major depression also report such events, with more related to marital problems and fewer to occupational or family stressors in the adjustment disorder group 60. Such differences, while statistically significant, are unlikely to be clinically meaningful in an individual patient, since they are not exclusive as precipitants to either major depression or adjustment disorder. And the events can range in severity from those that are generally regarded as mild, such as a row with a boyfriend, to those that are more serious. This will be mediated by individual vulnerability. In the preamble to the section on adjustment disorder, the ICD-10 states that \"individual vulnerability and risk plays a greater role than in other disorders\" such as PTSD or acute stress reactions. However, it is unclear on what evidence this is based. By contrast, the DSM-IV is silent on this issue. The possibility that a diathesis-stress model operates is worthy of consideration and personality is arguably the most obvious predisposing factor. There have been few studies directly comparing adjustment disorder against other disorders to allow definitive claims about the role of personality, and caution is advisable in the current state of knowledge. The relevant studies can be classified in two broad groups: those directly examining adjustment disorder and those examining diagnoses akin to adjustment disorder. The prevalence of personality disorder among those with adjustment disorder in comparison to those with other depressive disorders seems to be not different 20, although studies are few and numbers small. Among personality dimensions, neuroticism emerged as a factor predisposing to adjustment disorder in a military sample 61. Attachment style has also been examined, and maternal overprotection was found to be a risk factor for later adjustment disorder 62,63, while paternal abuse was associated with the severity of the disorder 63. Studies using terminologies that imply a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, such as \"reactive\", \"non-endogenous\" or \"situational\" depression, are also of interest, although there is a caveat that these conditions may not be identical to adjustment disorder due to differences in the definitions in the earlier classifications. One such study 64 found that the strongest relationship was between premorbid neuroticism and a non-endogenous symptom pattern and evidence of \"oral dependent\" personality. The findings in relation to neuroticism and a non-endogenous pattern of symptoms were replicated by others 65 in studies of subjects and their relatives 66. The absence of clear symptomatological criteria for adjustment disorder in either DSM-IV or ICD-10 means that greater weight is attached to clinical judgement than in most other current conditions. Symptoms of low mood, sadness, worry, anxiety, insomnia, poor concentration, having their onset following a recent stressful event are likely indicators of a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, although it must be borne in mind that major depression can also present similarly. Mood disturbance is often more noticeable when the person is cognitively engaged with the event, such as when speaking about it, while at other times mood is normal and reactive. The removal of the person from the stressful situation is associated with a general improvement in symptoms. In the case of those who develop adjustment disorder in response to serious illness, changes in mood are related to changes in the illness itself. The more typically \"melancholic\" the symptoms are — e.g., diurnal change, early morning wakening, loss of mood reactivity — the less likely is the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. A family history of depression might also suggest a depressive episode. Due to the low symptom threshold for diagnosing major depression, it is easy to make a diagnosis of this condition rather than adjustment disorder. While the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines on depression recommend a period of \"watchful waiting\" 67, so as to allow for the possibility of spontaneous resolution, under pressure from the patient and his/her family, or the doctor's own desire \"to do something\", a diagnosis of major depression (or generalized anxiety) may be made and antidepressants prescribed. Difficulties also arise when the stressor, and hence the symptoms, is persistent and has little likelihood of resolving. Antidepressants may be prescribed on pragmatic grounds, as there is no way of establishing if the symptoms are likely to spontaneously remit or if they are now independent of the initial trigger and constitute major depression. The absence of a response to antidepressants should raise the possibility that this is an adjustment disorder, so that psychological therapies are offered rather than engaging in protracted trails of multiple medications. A further consideration is that what appears to be a single stressor (e.g., a diagnosis of a serious physical illness) may be associated with ongoing symptoms as different facets of the diagnosis impinge upon the patient (e.g., the initiation of painful treatments, treatment failures, etc.). Failure to appreciate that rolling stressors prolong symptoms might lead to an erroneous diagnosis of major depression. The role of the consequences of the initial stressor in prolonging symptoms is recognized in the DSM-IV definition of adjustment disorder. Based on the predominant symptoms, several subtypes of adjustment disorder are recognised by DSM-IV and ICD-10 (Table 1). The subtypes are broadly similar in the two classifications but, apart from adjustment disorder with depressed mood, they have received little attention. The depressed subtype is the most common in adults, while the subtypes with predominant disturbance of conduct or of conduct and emotions are more commonly diagnosed among children and adolescents. The distinction between adjustment disorder and a normal stress response is based on the severity of symptoms and their duration; the impact on functioning taking into account the nature of the stressor; the personal and interpersonal context in which it has occurred; cultural norms with regard to such responses. PTSD and acute stress disorder require the presence of a stressor of a magnitude that would be traumatic for almost everybody and the symptom constellation is also specific, although both of these have recently been challenged 40. Moreover, not everybody exposed to such traumatic events responds by developing PTSD and the possibility that other disorders can follow instead needs to be considered. For those not meeting the PTSD diagnostic criteria, but with significant symptoms and/or functional impairment, adjustment disorder should be considered a possible alternative. What may appear to be an adjustment disorder, because of the sub-threshold level of the symptoms or the lack of functional impairment, might be an axis I disorder in evolution that only emerges as a recognizable syndrome after a period of watchful waiting. Thus, the revision of an index diagnosis of adjustment disorder may be necessary at times, especially if there are persisting symptoms in spite of termination of the stressor. Few studies have examined the disorders that are comorbid with adjustment disorder, an exercise that is hampered by the fact that the criteria for this disorder preclude axis I comorbidity. Yet, a recent study 19 found that almost half of patients exhibited comorbidity with major depression or PTSD. Surprisingly, complicated grief and adjustment disorder were not significantly comorbid. The relationship between substance abuse and adjustment disorder is also deserving of mention, since it may explain the seeming instability of the adjustment disorder diagnosis. Firstly, substances may be misused for relief of symptoms such as anxiety and depression, which are prominent in adjustment disorder. Substances such as alcohol are themselves depressogenic and may present with mood changes leading to misdiagnosis. This may explain why in one study 6 several patients with an admission diagnosis of adjustment disorder were relabelled on discharge as having a primary diagnosis of substance misuse. The evidence base for the treatment of adjustment disorder is limited, due to the paucity of studies. A further problem is that these are self-remitting conditions, so that trials of interventions may fail to identify any benefits due to spontaneous resolution. In general, brief therapies are regarded as being the most appropriate, with the exception that, when stressors are ongoing, prolonged supportive measures may be necessary. However, there is a caveat for children and adolescents diagnosed with adjustment disorder, since there is evidence 26 that a majority of adolescents eventually develop major mental disorders. Practical measures may be useful to assist the person in managing the stressful situation. A person being bullied at work might decide to invoke an internal redress system or may seek the support of the trade union. A person in an abusive relationship might seek a barring order. A vulnerable person taking on too much work may benefit from simple, directive advice. Harnessing family members' input, involving supportive agencies such as social services or encouraging involvement in a support or self-help group may alleviate distress. Psychological therapies, delivered individually or in groups, span the range including supportive, psychoeducational, cognitive and psychodynamic approaches. Relaxation techniques can reduce symptoms of anxiety. Facilitating the verbalization of fears and emotions and exploring the meaning that the stressor has for the individual might also ameliorate symptoms. In persons who engage in deliberate self-harm, assistance in finding alternative responses that do not involve self-destruction may be of benefit and to date dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) has the best evidence base 68. Ego enhancing therapy was found to be useful during periods of transition in older patients 69. \"Mirror therapy\", a therapy including psychocorporeal, cognitive, and neurolinguistic components, was effective in patients with adjustment disorder secondary to myocardial infarction 70. Cognitive therapy was helpful when administered to patients with adjustment disorder who experienced work-related stress 71 and among army conscripts with adjustment disorder 72. In a study of terminally cancer patients 73, similar improvements were found in those with adjustment disorder and other psychiatric diagnoses. Some of these psychological interventions have been tested in specific medically ill groups, such as those with cancer, heart disease or HIV. While improvements in coping have been demonstrated, it is unclear if subjects had adjustment disorder, some were open pilot studies (e.g., 74) and survival and quality of life rather than symptoms were the outcome measures in others (e.g., 75). The basic pharmacological management of adjustment disorder consists of symptomatic treatment of insomnia, anxiety and panic attacks. The use of benzodiazepines to relieve these is common 76. While antidepressants are advocated by some 77, especially if there has been no benefit from psychotherapy, there is little solid evidence to support their use. Nevertheless, those with sedative properties targeting sleep and anxiety may have a role when benzodiazepines are contraindicated 78, such as in those with a history of substance dependence. There are few trials specifically directed to the pharmacological treatment of adjustment disorder and these are mainly on subjects with the anxiety subtype 79,80,81,82,83,84,85. A study 79 comparing a benzodiazepine with a non-benzodiazepine found that the anxiolytic effects of each were similar, although more responded to the non-benzodiazepine. Two randomized placebo-controlled trials examined herbal remedies, including extracts from kava-kava 80 and valerian plus other extracts 81, and demonstrated a positive effect on symptoms. A study found that tianeptine, alprazolam and mianserine were equally effective 82, while a pilot study of cancer patients with anxious and depressed mood found trazodone superior to a benzodiazepine 83. One study in primary care 84 examined the response of patients with major depression and with adjustment disorder to antidepressants, using reported changes in functional disability based on case note information. Overall, the adjustment disorder group was twice as likely to respond to antidepressants. However, as this was a retrospective case note study, the relevance of the findings is questionable. One study compared pharmacological and psychological interventions in subjects with adjustment disorder randomly assigned to supportive psychotherapy, an antidepressant, a benzodiazepine or placebo, and found that all improved significantly 85. Overall, these studies lend little support for the superiority of antidepressants, and arguably for any specific treatment, in the management of adjustment disorder, but further studies are clearly required. Adjustment disorders are common mental disorders, especially in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Their prevalence seems to be higher in children and adolescents, in whom they are associated with significant morbidity and a poorer outcome than in adults. Suicidal behaviour is common in both adolescents and adults with these disorders, and adjustment disorder is the diagnosis in up to one third of young people who die by suicide. There are major problems with the diagnostic criteria for adjustment disorder in both ICD-10 and DSM-IV. The most prominent of these is the status as sub-syndromal conditions. This has resulted in their being the subject of little research. Furthermore, current classifications fail to provide guidance on distinguishing these disorders from normal adaptive reactions to stress, and encourage the diagnosis of major depression in people with self-limiting reactions to stressors. Treatments for adjustment disorders are underinvestigated, although brief psychological interventions are likely to be the preferred option.",

About 100,000 Americans have full-blown Tourette's syndrome, but more people have a milder form of the disease. It often starts in childhood, and more boys than girls get it2. The exact cause of Tourette syndrome is not known. It is a complex disorder likely caused by a combination of inherited (genetic) and environmental factors.

A simple tic affects one or just a few parts of the body, like blinking the eyes or making a face. A complex one involves many parts of the body or saying words. Jumping and swearing are examples. Symptoms often get better as children grow up. For some people, they go away completely3. Although there is no cure for Tourette syndrome, treatments are available. Many people with Tourette syndrome donot need treatment when symptoms are not troublesome. Tics often lessen or become controlled after the teen years.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by the breakdown of thought processes and emotional disorders. This disease is characterized by a combination of disorders: cognitive (impaired attention, memory, thinking) and behavioral, productive (hallucinatory, delusional, affective, etc.) and negative (apathy, abulia, emotional and social detachment, etc.) symptoms. Schizophrenia causes psychosis, can be accompanied by disability and negatively affect all areas of life, including personal, social life, family and work activities. This disease is also characterized by changes in emotions, loss of concentration, autism, asociality (\"immersion in oneself\", unusual thoughts and fantasies), a drop in energy state and a violation of the will. The sick person does not understand that he is ill, and this complicates treatment. Psychoses become more frequent over time and this leads to frequent hallucinations, and they can affect all the senses. The most common are auditory hallucinations in the form of voices and a person's subordination to voices, which can make the situation dangerous. The absence of treatment for schizophrenia leads to an absolute loss of one's own \"I\", loss of a person's personality, and during an exacerbation of the disease, a person can harm first of all himself and then others. The following research article examines all the factors that can influence the onset and progression of the disease.",

      "title": "Concepto y manejo práctico de la fragilidad en neurología",
      "abstract": "Frailty is a clinical situation of decreased homeostatic reserve that, after a minor trigger (acute illness, fall, taking a drug...) increases the risk of an adverse event such as hospital admission, institutionalization, functional and/or cognitive decline, death, etc. Frailty can be understood as physical frailty, Fried's phenotype, a true geriatric syndrome that can be reversible by avoiding its progression to more advanced stages of irreversibility and dependence, and Rockwood's frailty due to accumulation of deficits, as a continuum of health or classification typology of the elderly along the frailty spectrum (healthy, robust, vulnerable, mild-moderate-severe and extreme frailty or end of life). The diagnosis of physical frailty is part of the comprehensive geriatric assessment, recommending the use of a performance test such as gait speed (<0,8m/s), Timed Up and Go (>12 s) or Short Physical Performance Battery (<10). Physical frailty is reversible by a multidisciplinary management based on three fundamental pillars: multicomponent physical exercise and resistance training, adequate protein and micronutrient intake (leucine, vitamin D, etc.) and appropriate pharmacological prescription, management of comorbidity and geriatric syndromes. Frailty is a risk factor for neurological disease progression and increased risk of adverse events in neurodegenerative diseases such as mild cognitive impairment, dementia, Parkinson's disease and cerebrovascular disease. Frailty based on the Clinical Frailty Scale or VIG-Frail shows patient typologies in relation to a greater or lesser state of fragility, being a basic prognostic tool of great utility in making diagnostic and therapeutic management decisions. It opens up a new opportunity for improvement in the management of neurological disease in the diagnosis and treatment of frailty.Concepto y manejo práctico de la fragilidad en neurología.La fragilidad se entiende como un situación clínica de disminución de la reserva homeostática que, ante un desencadenante (enfermedad aguda, caída, toma de un fármaco...), aumenta el riesgo de un evento adverso, como ingreso hospitalario, en residencia, deterioro funcional y/o cognitivo, muerte, etc. La fragilidad puede entenderse como fragilidad física, fenotipo de Fried, verdadero síndrome geriátrico, que puede ser reversible evitando su progresión a estadios más avanzados de irreversibilidad y de dependencia, y fragilidad por acúmulo de déficits de Rockwood, como continuum de salud o tipología de clasificación del anciano a lo largo del espectro de la fragilidad (sano, robusto, vulnerable, fragilidad leve-moderada-grave y extrema o final de vida). El diagnóstico de fragilidad física forma parte de la valoración geriátrica integral y se recomienda para su diagnóstico utilizar un test de ejecución, como velocidad de la marcha (menor de 0,8 m/s), Timed Up and Go (>12 segundos) o Short Physical Performance Battery (menor de 10). La fragilidad física es reversible basándose en un tratamiento multidisciplinar sobre tres pilares fundamentales: ejercicio físico multicompetente y contra resistencia, aporte adecuado de proteínas y micronutrientes (leucina, vitamina D, etc.), y adecuada prescripción farmacológica, de tratamiento de comorbilidad y de síndromes geriátricos. La fragilidad es un factor de riesgo de progresión de la enfermedad neurológica y de mayor riesgo de evento adverso tanto en enfermedades neurodegenerativas, como el deterioro cognitivo leve, la demencia o la enfermedad de Parkinson, como en la enfermedad cerebrovascular. La fragilidad a través de la Clinical Frailty Scale o el VIG-Frail muestra tipologías de pacientes en relación con un mayor o menor estado de fragilidad, y es una herramienta básica pronóstica de gran utilidad en la toma de decisiones de manejo diagnóstico y terapéutico. Se abre una nueva oportunidad de mejora en el manejo de la enfermedad neurológica ante el diagnóstico y el tratamiento de la fragilidad.",

      "abstract": "Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as elevated TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels. This review discusses the following questions concerning subclinical hypothyroidism that have not been solved yet: 1) does elevated TSH always mean failure of the thyroid gland? 2) Do patients with subclinical hypothyroidism always develop overt hypothyroidism? 3) Are they symptomatic? 4) Does treatment with L-Thyroxine cure these symptoms,--if they exist? Summarizing the results of the literature one can give the following answers: 1) Elevated TSH with normal free T4 can but does not necessarily mean thyroid failure. 2) Patients with positive thyroid antibodies and especially with TSH levels above 10 mU/l are at high risk to develop overt hypothyroidism. 3) Typical symptoms (thyroid-specific, cardiovascular, neurological and psychiatric and finally alterations of risk factors for atherosclerosis) seem to occur in a greatly varying percentage of patients--some of the described symptoms are of questionable clinical importance. 4) Some of the symptoms, especially the cardiovascular, seem to be treatable by L-T4, whereas others like most of the changes in lipid metabolism can not be influenced by normalization of the TSH levels. In conclusion, screening for TSH and free T4 seems to be justified in elderly women, where the prevalence of the disease is approximately 20%. However, treatment of \"symptoms\" of subclinical hypothyroidism like elevated cholesterol levels or depression should be done only in patients with a TSH > 10 mU/l and there only with great caution in order to avoid unnecessary overdosage with the danger of eliciting atrial fibrillation.",

      "title": "Syndrome of Transient Headache and Neurological Deficits with Cerebrospinal Fluid Lymphocytosis (HaNDL): A Case Report - Is there an Association with the COVID-19 Vaccine?",
      "abstract": "Bartleson, 1981 described the syndrome of transient headache and neurologic deficits with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytosis (HaNDL) for the first time.[1] HaNDL is classified as a \"headache attributed to nonvascular intracranial disorder\" and is included in the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders.[2] HaNDL, a rare clinical entity, is diagnosed according to the following criteria: (1) episodes of migraine-like headache; (2) accompanied or shortly preceded by the onset of at least one transient neurological deficit lasting >4 h, and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis (>15 white cells/mL), with negative etiological studies; (3) development or significant worsening of headache and transient neurological deficits in temporal relation to the onset or worsening of the CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis or led to its discovery, and/or have significantly improved in parallel with the improvement in the CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis; and (4) not better accounted for by another diagnosis. The syndrome resolves within 3 months.[2] Although the etiology of HaNDL is not precisely known, based on CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, it is assumed to be associated with an autoimmune or infectious inflammatory disease. Cortical spreading depression may also cause neurologic deficits.[3] CSF lymphocytosis may be accompanied by elevated CSF total protein and CSF pressure that supports possible inflammation. Electroencephalography (EEG) may demonstrate focally abnormal areas consistent with focal neurological deficits. The neurological manifestations include sensory symptoms in approximately three-quarters, aphasia in two-thirds, and motor deficits in a little more than half of the cases.[2] Neurologic adverse events such as fever, headache, fatigue, and myalgia following coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination are generally mild and transient. One of the most frequent neurological complaints reported after the COVID-19 vaccination is a headache. Twenty-eight-year-old female patient with migraine reported to our outpatient clinic with severe headache, speech disturbances, and right-sided sensory symptoms. She had a throbbing pain localized to the left hemisphere, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. The migraine attacks occurred once every 2 months and were responsive to simple analgesics. After the second dose of COVID-19 (BNT162b2-BioNTech) vaccination, the frequency and character of headache attacks changed. Distinct severe headaches were noted, and the frequency of headache attacks was increased to 15 days a month with a significantly reduced analgesic response. After 2 months of vaccination, severe headache attacks became chronic and right-sided hemi-hypesthesia and dysarthria appeared. There was no recent viral disease history except for the COVID-19 infection 8 months back during which she had mild symptoms. There was a minimal increase in the frequency of headaches without any change in character. However, dramatic changes occurred post-vaccination. Neurologic examination revealed mild dysarthria, and right hemi-hypesthesia with normoactive tendon reflexes, without any motor disturbance, neck stiffness, meningeal irritation signs, pathological reflexes, or cognitive dysfunction. A detailed blood work-up was performed, including vitamin B12 levels, and serological tests, all of which were within normal limits. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was weakly positive (1/100) in the vasculitis panel. Detailed autoimmune and paraneoplastic antibody panels were all negative. Ophthalmological examination revealed no papilledema. Contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), non-contrast computerized tomography (CT), MR angiography (MRA), venography, and EEG were unremarkable. Lumbar puncture (LP) showed leukocytic pleocytosis with lymphocytic dominance (45 leukocytes-80% lymphocytes without erythrocytes). CSF opening pressure was 10 cm/CSF and analysis revealed normal protein (40 mg/dL) and normal glucose levels (61 mg/dL-serum: 79 mg/dL). The CSF viral panel, Gram stain, and culture were negative. After the exclusion of other differential diagnoses, HaNDL secondary to the COVID-19 vaccination was diagnosed and was followed closely with symptomatic treatment. The patient's clinical symptoms lasted for approximately 3 weeks and then disappeared spontaneously. During the 6-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of neurologic deficits despite the occasional headache. There are different views on the etiology of HaNDL syndrome. The presence of inflammatory CSF findings suggests that infection and/or inflammation triggers the condition. Additionally, it is hypothesized that viral infection may activate the immune system and cause HaNDL syndrome.[4] The most important finding in support of this hypothesis is that some patients had a viral infection before the onset of symptoms.[5] After infection with COVID-19, persistent or new symptoms may develop for weeks or months, called long COVID or post-COVID syndrome. The symptoms may exceed 12 weeks. Common symptoms in people with long COVID are fatigue, headache, breathlessness, cough, chest pain, myalgia and weakness, insomnia, memory and concentration problems, and worsened quality of life.[6] Although the frequency of the patient's headache increased post-COVID-19 infection, it was vaccine-related rather than infection since the main change in headache character was post-vaccination. A known adverse event of COVID-19 vaccination is a headache. Patients with migraine-type headaches develop more headaches after COVID-19 vaccination compared to healthy controls.[7] In BNT162b2 clinical trials (manufactured by BioNTech and Pfizer), a higher incidence of headache was noted after the second dose than the first dose, with approximately 52% of patients reporting mild to moderate headaches.[8] In accordance with the literature data, headaches increased in our patients with a history of migraine, particularly after the second vaccination dose. Studies emphasize that the risk of headache after vaccination is increased twice and has a migrainous character in one-third of patients. Although the mechanisms underlying vaccine-induced headaches are still unclear, it may be owing to a systemic inflammatory response.[9] Vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA may cause an immunomodulatory response. The immune system stimulation following vaccination induces a strong T-cell response and increases CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells.[10] Although the neurological deficit developed in our patient 2 months after the vaccination, there was a significant and constant change in the frequency and character of the headaches immediately post-vaccination. Therefore, the neurological deficit added 2 months later was considered a continuation. In light of all these data and after excluding other differential diagnoses, the COVID-19 vaccination may be considered as a possible cause of HaNDL syndrome by triggering inflammation in our patient. HaNDL should be considered in the differential diagnosis after excluding other probable causes in patients with neurological deficits and headaches post-COVID-19 vaccination.

Modern sleep research has opened important views into the structure of sleep and the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. In a narrower sense sleep disorders mean a deficiency of sleep (hyposomnia). This may concern the induction of sleep or its maintenance. Sleep disorders without underlying disease may be differentiated from those caused by different diseases. Hypersomnia may occur as a symptom of various cerebral dysfunctions and processes, as an episodic disorder (Kleine-Levin-syndrome) or as a part of the Pickwick-syndrome. In narcolepsy characteristic symptoms are sleep attacks, kataplexy (emotionally induced loss of muscle tone) and transient pareses during awakening. Disturbances linked with sleep are snoring, somnambulism, speaking and grinding of the teeth during sleep and nocturnal enuresis. They may constitute idiopathic disorders. On the other hand, there may be similarities between epileptic phenomena and these disorders. Some epilepsies demonstrate relations to the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness which become evident in the manifestation of seizures and epileptiform EEG activity at certain stages of vigilance.",

It is difficult to know why exactly each horse performs these behaviours, there may be specific causal factors for these activities in the horse. Homeopathy can contribute to the treatment of these disorders, because it approaches the organism as the sum of the specific characteristics of an animal when it is in a state of health or illness, at the physical, mental and psychological level. The application of homeopathic laws during anamnesis allows us to achieve a deeper understanding of the horse, considering all its special characteristics. This study has been conducted with 17 horses showing one of the stereotypic behaviours of cribbing, circling, wall kicking and self mutilation. Homeopathic remedies are determined specifically according to the constitution and stereotypic behaviour problem of each horse. One month after the begining of the treatment, the symptoms of stereotypical behaviours were found to be decreased and after two months considerable regression were detected. Cribbing and self-mutilation were completely treated. Circling and wall kicking were decreased. To our knowledge, this study is the first report to cure the stereotypic behaviours of horses with using homeopathic remedies. This study suggests that homeopathy is as an effective therapy method which is used uncommonly in stereotypic behaviours of horses.",

      "title": "Force Maintenance With Submaximal Fatiguing Contractions",
      "abstract": "Whereas many definitions of fatigue include externally measurable decrements in force or performance, fatigue can be present with no change in the external output of the muscle. The maintenance of submaximal forces can be considered a compromise between neuromuscular force enhancement and competing inhibitory influences. An example of a muscle facilitatory process includes postactivation potentiation that results in an increased sensitivity to Ca ++ . The neuromuscular system copes with metabolic disruption and subsequent loss of force by recruiting additional motor units and increasing the firing frequency. If the contraction persists, firing frequency may decrease so as to optimize the stimulus rate with the prolonged duration of the muscle fibre action potential (muscle wisdom). The insertion of additional neural impulses into the train of stimuli can result in force potentiation (catch-like properties). Furthermore, there is evidence of neural potentiation and a dissociation of muscle activity with submaximal fatigue. Conversely, inhibition may be derived supraspinally or at the spinal level. While there may be some evidence of intrinsic motoneuronal fatigue, inhibitory afferent influences from chemical, tensile, pressure, and other factors play an important role in the competing influences on force output. Key words: postactivation potentiation, recruitment, rate coding, inhibition, catch-like properties",

      "abstract": "Abstract The severity of disease can be described in many different ways, ranging from the patient’s perception, the amount of physiological disturbance, and the consequent disability and handicap caused, to the burden for society (Stein et al. 1987). The severity of a stroke may be assessed in terms of the amount of brain damaged (e.g. size of the lesion found on CT), the extent of any arterial lesion(s) demonstrated on angiography, or the function of the brain (by positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, or presence of symptoms and signs of decompensation). Alternatively, the severity of a stroke may be measured by the distance walked in a fixed time, the ability to climb stairs, or the ability for self-care. From a social perspective, severity may be measured by impact on work, enjoyment of usual sex life, and social engagement. The pathological differences between types of stroke and the alternative ways of assessing severity make a simple answer to the question ‘Is it a bad stroke?’ difficult.",

      "title": "Burnout in the workplace",
      "abstract": "Average adults spend a third of their living in offices, making them susceptible to extreme stress. Often this stress breaks the tolerance threshold and causes deteriorating effects on an individual’s mental, physical, and emotional life. This effect is known as Burnout. In medical terms, Burnout is a psychiatric syndrome in response to chronic stress at work. This paper discusses the causes, mitigating factors, and various models of burnout. Also discuss the implications of this phenomenon due to its high relevancy and presence in our 21st-century work culture, where people are seriously overworked and exhausted. Burnout often stays disguised and can reduce a person’s wellbeing and productivity over time, not to mention causing chronic health issues, hence it is important to be aware and recognize this before it gets too late.",

      "title": "Burnout and its impact on Nurses and Doctors",
      "abstract": "Burnout is a highly researched syndrome resulting from job stress. It is an ultimate response that occurs because of chronic exposure to stressors from the job characterised by the magnitudes/key dimensions which are feeling of cynicism, sense of ineffectiveness, detachment from the job, lack of accomplishment and overwhelming exhaustion.1 This implies that burnout characterised by a variety of factors can cause extreme suffering to an individual. Exhaustion is a central quality of burnout and the most obvious manifestation of this complex syndrome. It refers to feelings of being overextended and depleted on one’s emotional and physical resources. The individual feels drained due to perpetual lack of energy as a result of which, the quality of work responsibility is compromised. The major sources of this exhaustion are work overload and personal conflicts at the work place. The cynicism dimension represents the interpersonal context that refers to negative, callous, or excessively detached response to various aspects of the job which results in the loss if idealism and dehumanisation of others. The inefficacy dimension represents the self-evaluation component of burnout that refers to feeling of incompetence and lack of achievement and productivity in work. Burnout is a cumulative reaction on ongoing occupational stressors. Healthcare professionals, especially clinicians seem to be at particular risk for burnout. Additionally nurses, specifically psychiatric nurses are considered as a group at risk for excessive stress and burnout because they are in constant interaction and frequent interpersonal contact with psychiatric clients and their families.2 These reasons and risk factors can be same in between the professions, however, even within the discipline there are gender differences that calls for further discussions.

      "title": "The symptom of generalised fatigue",
      "abstract": "What is fatigue? It is a sensation that we all feel at times and which has a variety of synonyms such as tiredness, exhaustion, and weariness.1 In this article we are concerned with a general feeling of fatigue or exhaustion and not with fatigue specific to a part of the body; this is sometimes called central as opposed to peripheral fatigue.2 Although one may interpret a complaint of \"fatigue\" as meaning whatever the patient wants it to mean, it is useful to apply more precision by exploring exactly what the patient means by the term. For example, to differentiate the core concept of fatigue as a lack of ability to initiate or sustain activities because of a feeling of lack of energy, from other meanings such as the \"lack of interest and motivation\" that is typical of depression, and the \"tendency to fall asleep\" that is typical of sleep disorders. When is fatigue abnormal? Fatigue as a symptom must be differentiated from normal tiredness. Given that the severity of fatigue is continuously distributed in the population (fig 1), we need to draw some kind of cutoff to define fatigue of clinically important severity, in the same way that we do for blood pressure and depression. One approach is to define this as fatigue that has persisted for a period of time (say a month or more) and that is of sufficient severity to interfere with the patient's activities or to be otherwise severely troublesome. A patient with fatigue of this severity and duration may then be referred to as \"a case\" of clinically significant fatigue. Figure 1 The distribution of the complaint of fatigue in the population.

A traumatic brain injury means that a sudden force has been applied to the brain from outside. But not every force causes a concussion. In fact, most do not. The scalp, skull, and dura do a pretty good job protecting our brains from most of what happens to us on a daily basis. A traumatic brain injury means that the force applied to the brain caused a disruption in the brain’s structure, an impairment of the brain’s function, or both. Just because a computed tomography (CT) scan, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, or a blood test is negative does not mean that there has not been a concussion. Traumatic brain injury, especially concussion, is a clinical diagnosis, not based on any laboratory test or scan. Typically, patients with concussion have Glasgow Coma Scores between 13 and 15.",

      "title": "Beyond the motor impairment in dyskinetic cerebral palsy: neuropsychological and connectome-based approach",
      "abstract": "La paralisis cerebral (PC) se define como un grupo de trastornos del movimiento y/o la postura y de la funcion motora debidos a una lesion, interferencia o anomalia no progresiva en un cerebro inmaduro o en desarrollo. Estos trastornos motores a menudo se acompanan de alteraciones sensoriales, de la percepcion, de la cognicion, de la comunicacion, del comportamiento o de epilepsia, y se ha evidenciado que estos deficits pueden tener un mayor impacto sobre la calidad de vida que el propio deficit motor. Teniendo en cuenta la clasificacion de la PC segun el tipo de afectacion motora se identifica que la PC discinetica es un subtipo poco frecuente (entre el 3% y el 15% de todos los casos) que se caracteriza por patrones anormales de postura y/o movimiento, acompanados de movimientos involuntarios, descontrolados, recurrentes y, ocasionalmente, estereotipados. Este tipo de PC se ha asociado principalmente a procesos de hipoxia-isquemia en bebes nacidos a termino o casi a termino, y a la presencia de ictericia grave. Se ha evidenciado como la PC discinetica es mas incapacitante que otros tipos de PC, no solo por su asociacion con una mayor afectacion motriz sino tambien por una mayor presencia y gravedad de deficits asociados, como una mayor afectacion del habla y de la comunicacion.\nCabe destacar que los estudios que han analizado este tipo de PC son todavia escasos, probablemente debido a su menor frecuencia y mayor gravedad. Especialmente escasos son los estudios cognitivos y de neuroimagen, ya que las pruebas neuropsicologicas requieren de una destreza manual y/o de respuestas verbales y los estudios de neuroimagen implican la adquisicion de secuencias de resonancia magnetica en donde la persona debe permanecer quieta. \nLos estudios cognitivos realizados hasta el momento se focalizan principalmente en el rendimiento intelectual general, y evidencian que entre el 52% y el 65% de los casos presenta discapacidad intelectual. No obstante, cabe destacar que no existe un consenso sobre como evaluar el rendimiento intelectual en esta poblacion, con una gran variabilidad entre estudios. La aplicacion de tests psicometricos que requieren habilidades manipulativas y/o respuestas verbales pueden estar emmascarando e infravalorando el rendimiento intelectual real de estas personas. Los estudios que se focalizan en el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas son escasos y se basan en muestras muy reducidas que a menudo no superan los 8 casos. Por otro lado, los estudios cualitativos de neuroimagen han hallado una afectacion de ganglios basales y talamo. Las primeras evidencias de estudios de resonancia magnetica de difusion apuntan a una afectacion mas extensa, con una mayor afectacion de la sustancia blanca. \nEs por ello que esta tesis tiene como objetivos principales: 1) identificar una medida objetiva de inteligencia adecuada para la gran heterogeneidad que existe en la PC, 2) describir el perfil cognitivo de una muestra relativamente amplia de personas con PC discinetica, y 3) analizar el estado de la sustancia blanca cerebral de esta poblacion mediante la tecnica del conectoma. Para ello se incluyeron en el estudio un total de 52 sujetos con PC discinetica y 52 sujetos control, a quienes se les administro una bateria neuropsicologia que evaluaba el rendimiento cognitivo general (mediante las Matrices progresivas de Raven - version color, el Test de vocabulario en imagenes de Peabody - III y la Escala no verbal de aptitud intelectual de Wechsler) y cinco dominios cognitivos especificos (atencion, visuopercepcion, lenguaje, aprendizaje y memoria y funcion ejecutiva) y se les realizo un estudio de resonancia magnetica estructural. \nLos resultados comparando las diferentes pruebas de inteligencia muestran un mayor potencial de las Matrices progresivas de Raven. Esta prueba demuestra una gran aplicabilidad en la PC, incluso en casos con una grave afectacion motora y pocas habilidades comunicativas. Tambien se evidencia que proporciona informacion completa sobre el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas, tanto visuales como verbales, y que es sensible al estado de la estructura cerebral en fibras de asociacion y de proyeccion y estructuras subcorticales como los ganglios basales y el talamo.\nEn relacion al perfil cognitivo de la PC discinetica, los resultados a nivel grupal han evidenciado un rendimiento cognitivo por debajo del grupo control en todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal. No obstante, estas alteraciones cognitivas se han relacionado con la alteracion motriz, hallandose una afectacion cognitiva mas generalizada a medida que incrementa la gravedad motora. En los casos mas leves, aquellos en los que existe deambulacion autonoma, se ha evidenciado un rendimiento similar al del grupo control en casi todas las funciones evaluadas a excepcion de las funciones visuoperceptivas, atencionales y de la memoria visual. Los casos moderados, en los que se requiere de ayuda para la deambulacion, han mostrado las mismas alteraciones cognitivas y se anaden dificultades en las areas de lenguaje receptivo. En el grupo mas grave, aquellos casos en que no es posible la deambulacion, se observa el mismo rendimiento que con el grupo general (un rendimiento inferior en todas las funciones cognitivas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal).\n En el estudio de neuroimagen realizado en una submuestra de 25 participantes con PC y 24 sujetos control, se ha demostrado una disrupcion de la conectividad cerebral a diferentes niveles (global, regional y a nivel de conexion). Este patron se caracteriza por una disrupcion generalizada de la sustancia blanca cerebral, pero una afectacion mas localizada de la integridad de esta, que incluye areas mas posteriores (parietal, occipital y temporal) y una relativa preservacion de las areas prefrontales. Tambien se evidencia alteracion en la conectividad hipocampal, asi como de estructuras subcorticales (principalmente en putamen y talamo). Por ultimo, se ha hallado una correlacion entre el estado de la sustancia blanca de la circuiteria sensoriomotora y el nivel de gravedad motriz (tanto gruesa como fina) y se ha evidenciado como la red formada por conexiones fronto-estriatales y fronto-parietales juega un papel relevante en el rendimiento cognitivo general de estos sujetos. \nEn el presente trabajo se discuten estos resultados en relacion a la literatura previa tanto en el ambito de la PC como en otras patologias, asi como teniendo en cuenta el desarrollo normativo.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Three million elderly Americans experience clinically significant mental impairment or dementia. In approximately 15%, impairment is believed to stem from undetected yet potentially reversible underlying causes. Another 20 to 25% are estimated to have contributing conditions for which some form of therapeutic intervention other than symptomatic treatment is important. Common, potentially reversible causes of dementia include medication toxicity, depression, metabolic or infectious disorders, brain trauma and disease, and environmental and psychosocial elements. Early investigation of confusion and other symptoms of delirium or dementia is urgent because permanent injury to brain cells may occur, or because an undetected reversible disorder may worsen a chronic condition. Nursing interventions should promote early detection, prevention and treatment of reversible causes of dementia.",

      "title": "Exploring acupuncture as a therapeutic approach for tic disorders: a review of current understanding and potential benefits",
      "abstract": "Tic disorders (TD) refer to a condition where individuals experience recurring motor movements (e.g., eye blinking) and/or vocalizations (e.g., throat clearing). These disorders vary in terms of duration, cause, and manifestation of symptoms. Tourette's syndrome (TS) involves the presence of ongoing motor and vocal tics for a minimum of 1 year, with fluctuating intensity. Persistent chronic motor or vocal tic disorder is characterized by either motor or vocal tics (not both) present for at least 1 year. Provisional TD presents with either motor or vocal tics (not both) that have been present for less than 12 months. Though medications like Aripiprazole and dopamine receptor blockers are frequently prescribed, their potential unwanted consequences increase, may result in low adherence. In an effort to improve and broaden the care available for children diagnosed with TD, alternative methods such as acupuncture are being investigated and considered. Acupuncture is a method of traditional Chinese medicine that includes the placement of thin needles into particular areas of the body in order to correct any disruptions or irregularities. Research has demonstrated that acupuncture can help regulate abnormal brain function and relieve tic symptoms in individuals with TD. Additional studies are required to fully evaluate the usefulness of complementary treatments in addressing TD in young individuals, despite its common usage. Herein, we summarized the therapeutic effects of acupuncture in the treatment of TD.",

Psychodermatological conditions can be classified as either primarily psychiatric disorders which manifest via skin disease, for example delusional infestation, or primarily dermatological disorders, for example psoriasis, which may be caused by, or associated with profound psychiatric morbidity (e.g. anxiety, depression).",

It can suppress your immune system, cause a heart attack, or stroke, increase your risk of cancer, delay wound healing, promote inflammation, cause you to gain weight, impair your memory, cause depression, exacerbate diabetes and worsen your sexual function. Stress also makes you age faster….Dean Ornish MD : The Spectrum Stress is a physical or emotional reaction / response to any kind of change which may be external, internal or both. External pressure for example can be due to job stress, competition, challenges or frequently changing government policies etc. Internal pressure is mainly due to negative thoughts, fear, and anxiety. There is a individual variation in stress response. Many people have inner strength or resilience to manage day to day stress and cumulative stress well. People who have learned to manage stress also minimize the effect of stress. Those who do not have good inner strength and who have not learned the management of stress suffer a lot because of stress.Whenever there is stress, brain tells the body to release some chemicals so that the body is ready for the fight or flight reaction to deal with immediate danger.",

      "abstract": "The spectrum of bent spine disorders\n\nHead ptosis (drop) results from weakness of the neck extensor, or increased tone of the flexor muscles. It is characterised by marked anterior curvature or angulation of the cervical spine and is associated with various neuromuscular (table 1) and extrapyramidal disorders.12–15 Camptocormia or the bent spine syndrome was first described in hysterical soldiers in 1915 by the French neurologist Souques.16 Typically there is marked anterior curvature of the thoracolumbar spine. In some patients the spine is angulated forward, the arms propped against the thigh for support. More cases, all among soldiers, were reported during the first and second world wars. These patients responded well to psychotherapy. Recently camptocormia arising as a result of weakness or abnormality in the tone of the paraspinal muscles has been described (table 2). In contrast with other skeletal disorders of the spine such as kyphosis, the deformity in head ptosis and camptocormia is not fixed and is corrected by passive extension or lying in the supine position. It is not possible to straighten the neck or back voluntarily. The evaluation of these disorders can indeed be challenging and often no definite diagnosis is made, as illustrated by four cases of head ptosis and camptocormia seen by us at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\nView this table:\n\n Table 1 \nNeuromuscular causes for head ptosis\n\n\n\nView this table:\n\n Table 2 \nCauses of camptocormia\n\n\n\nAn 80 year old man developed head ptosis insidiously over a period of few weeks.

The most constant course is myotonia, a tonic spasm of muscle, followed by atrophy. The myotonia is usually demonstrable by voluntary, mechanical, or electrical means in the muscles of the forearms, hands, tongue, and jaw. Myotonia occurs when the muscle is strongly stimulated as in a tight grip; it disappears with repetition of the stimulus; and it is intensified by cold. When the patient is",

Il testosterone (T) e la prolattina (PRL) sono i piu importanti\r\nfattori ormonali implicati nel controllo del desiderio sessuale. In quest’articolo descriviamo come altri fattori psico-biologici, individuati attraverso l’utilizzo dell’intervista strutturata SIEDY, siano associati al DDSI in un campione di pazienti maschi che si rivolgono ad un ambulatorio andrologico riportando un disturbo della sessualita. Diversi fattori relazionali (riduzione della capacita orgasmica e libidica della partner come percepita dal paziente, presenza di malattie nella partner, relazioni prolungate e conflittuali) e stressogeni ambientali\r\n(soddisfazione sul lavoro e/o presenza di conflittualita familiare) sono risultati significativamente associati con il DDSI. Tra i fattori ormonali, una iperprolattinemia severa (>700 mU/l), sembra giocare un ruolo maggiore rispetto all’ipogonadismo (testosterone < 12 nM) sulla\r\npatogenesi del DDSI (RR= 7.5 [2.5-22.4] vs 1.5 [1.1-1.9], rispettivamente). La presenza di disturbi psichiatrici maggiori o l’utilizzo di farmaci con impatto potenzialmente negativo sulla funzione sessuale sono altri parametri associati al DDSI cosi come la presenza di sintomi\r\nd’ansia e depressivi. In conclusione, il DDSI e associato a diversi fattori organici, intrapsichici e relazionali che possono essere simultaneamente individuati attraverso l’utilizzo di SIEDY.",

Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen das pathologische Spielen und Wetten in den ICD–11 den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen zuzuordnen und nach folgenden Kriterien zu diagnostizieren: 1. Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw. Wettens, nachgewiesen durch suchtspezifische Entzugssymptome oder durch die Aufnahme der gleichen oder einer nahe verwandten Tätigkeit, um Entzugssymptome zu mildern oder zu vermeiden. 4. Nachweis einer Toleranz. um die ursprünglich durch niedrige Dosen erreichten Wirkungen des Spielens bzw. Wettens hervorzurufen, sind zunehmend höhere Dosen erforderlich (ein Beispiel hierfür sind die steigenden „Tagesdosen“ von Spielern, die bei Konsumenten ohne Toleranzentwicklung schon zu einem Aufhören wegen schwerer Beeinträchtigungen, wie z.B. psycho-soziale, finanzielle oder Beziehungsprobleme, führen würden). 5. Vernachlässigung von Interessen zugunsten des Spielens, erhöhter Zeitaufwand, um zu spielen bzw. zu wetten, bzw. entsprechende finanzielle Mittel zu beschaffen, oder sich von den Folgen zu erholen. 6.

      "abstract": "The musculature of the face is innervated by cranial nerves, each with a motor, sensory and/or both function. The Facial nerve (FN) is responsible for the motor innervation of the muscles of the face. Some branches of the trigeminal nerve are responsible for the sensory part of the facial muscles and other branches act on the motor part of the chewing muscles. Traumatic Facial Paralysis (TFP) is the one where there was section or traction or compression or ischemia of the FN, in surgery for tumor resection or trauma in general. In this case occurs the nerve’s section in one surgery. Facial Paralysis (FP) can be evaluated subjectively through the House and Brackmann classification scale (HB) [1]. It is considered a chronic FP when it persists for a period longer than 6 months and leaves sequelae, such as synkinesis, contractures and lack of complete innervation of some nerve branches. Some patients who evolve with chronic FP may also evolve with alteration of the occlusal plane. The occlusal plane is the meeting point between the antagonist teeth, plane that is in the final stop of the masticatory cycle. The rehabilitation of this plan is performed according to the needs of each patient, in this case was made through implant prostheses.",

      "title": "Resolution of stuttering during ketamine treatment: a case report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Stuttering may include repetition of words in whole or part, difficulty saying words, and elongated pauses in speech. Approximately 5% of children stutter for a period lasting 6 months or more. Most of those children stop stuttering as they approach adulthood, but the condition persists in approximately 1% of adults. The cause of stuttering is unknown. Adults who stutter face substantial burdens in many aspects of their lives. Stutterers may choose not to pursue meaningful employment opportunities, may not be hired for positions they seek, or may be denied promotions or positive performance evaluations. Stuttering can cause physical tension from fear of speaking. Social challenges arise when a person who stutters is seen as less capable or of lower intelligence than fluent speakers. Stuttering causes emotional difficulties through the frustration and embarrassment that disfluent speakers feel. Stutterers may experience a general loss of self-esteem and personal satisfaction in life. Speech therapy is the primary intervention for stuttering. Medications have been investigated as treatments for stuttering, but no medication has been identified that has widespread effectiveness. Case presentation A 60-year-old white non-Hispanic woman who had been a near lifelong stutterer was prescribed ketamine for an unrelated condition and experienced an almost immediate resolution of her stuttering. Conclusions Many possible pharmacological treatments for stuttering have been studied. Some medications appear to be effective in some patients; some appear to be more generally effective but have negative side effects. No reporting in relevant literature has addressed a possible role for ketamine in stuttering treatment. On the basis of this case report, research on the effect of ketamine on stuttering would be useful. Any effective treatment for stuttering would have a significant positive effect on quality of life for persons who stutter.",

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "abstract": "The term \"theory of mind\" (ToM) refers to the capacity to infer one's own and other persons' mental states (e.g. their beliefs, feelings, intentions or knowledge). It was found that children in the autistic spectrum have deficits in ToM. One of the suggestions was that unlike autistic people, ToM skills are normally developed in schizophrenia patients, but \"lost\" in the first psychotic episode. The deficit may disappear on remission from the acute phase, as described in some studies. A substantial body of research has highlighted the impaired ToM in schizophrenia. There is good empirical evidence that ToM is specifically impaired in schizophrenia and that many psychotic symptoms--for instance, delusions of alien control and persecution, the presence of thought and language disorganization, and other behavioral symptoms--may best be understood in light of a disturbed capacity in patients to relate their own intentions to executing behavior, and to monitor others' intentions. However, it is still under debate how an impaired ToM in schizophrenia is associated with other aspects of cognition, how the impairment fluctuates with acuity or chronicity of the schizophrenic disorder, and if it is a state or trate marker. The paper reviews the current literature and suggests potential implications and future research areas.",

      "abstract": "Delayed-onset muscular soreness (DOMS), the sensation of pain and stiffness in the muscles that occurs from 1 to 5 d following unaccustomed exercise, can adversely affect muscular performance, both from voluntary reduction of effort and from inherent loss of capacity of the muscles to produce force. This reduction in performance is temporary; permanent impairment does not occur. A number of clinical correlates are associated with DOMS, including elevations in plasma enzymes, myoglobinemia, and abnormal muscle histology and ultrastructure; exertional rhabdomyolysis appears to be the extreme form of DOMS. Presently, the best treatment for DOMS appears to be muscular activity, although the sensation again returns following the exercise. Training for the specific contractile activity that causes DOMS reduces the soreness response. The etiology and cellular mechanisms of DOMS are not known, but a number of hypotheses exist to explain the phenomenon. The following model may be proposed: 1) high tensions (particularly those associated with eccentric exercise) in the contractile/elastic system of the muscle result in structural damage; 2) cell membrane damage leads to disruption of Ca++ homeostasis in the injured fibers, resulting in necrosis that peaks about 2 d post-exercise; and 3) products of macrophage activity and intracellular contents accumulate in the interstitium, which in turn stimulate free nerve endings of group-IV sensory neurons in the muscles leading to the sensation of DOMS.",

Intimacy and sex can become difficult for several reasons. Cancer treatments can also result in the reduction of sexual desire, changing the relationship dynamics for people with cancer and/or their partner.

      "abstract": "During work, a person is exposed to various types of stressors that can negatively affect an individual's health and reduce labor productivity. Irrational organization of work, poor interpersonal relations in the team, too short deadlines for the realization of the work tasks, inadequate microclimatic conditions, non-ergonomic design of equipment and tools, as well as accelerated changes and innovations in technology, which require additional education and acquisition of new knowledge and skills, are just some of the factors that negatively burden the person who works.In response to occupational stress, disorders occur on a physiological, psychological and behavioral level. Under conditions of stress, a person, as a social and emotional being eager for affirmation and proof, turns to some bad habits, such as consuming cigarettes, alcohol, psychostimulant substances or anxiolytics, which additionally have a bad effect on health. Employees who are exposed to chronic stress cannot be expected to achieve the desired professional results because they lose motivation, innovative thinking and increased absenteeism from work. Stress often worsens without the support of relatives, the environment and colleagues. Therefore, early recognition of signs of stress, identification of stressors and taking measures and procedures to combat unwanted factors, as well as providing support are of great importance for both human health and to reduce company costs.In this paper, we surveyed 120 computer operators, 72.5% female, average age 37.6 years, and 27.5% male, average age 39.2 years old. 7.8% had a high school diploma, 8.6% higher education, and 83.6% high education. Among them, 32.5% stated that they have moderate, while 29.2% state that they have a high level of stress at work. Poor working conditions and short deadlines are cited as the most common reasons. Of these, 25.6% associated stress with the current epidemiological situation of Covid-19. A significant percentage, 25.2% feel worn out or exhausted, 10% wake up tired, and 8.3% try to overcome fatigue in order to complete their work tasks.Fatigue, apathy, dissatisfaction, overtime work, „bringing work home― can negatively affect family and social relationships as well as leisure activities. There are a variety of stress management techniques at the individual and organizational levels, including group therapies, support and counseling, and breathing exercises that can help overcome the negative effects of stress. Workplace stress must be minimized, in order to ensure a favorable work environment, as well as the physical, mental and social well-being of the working man",

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

Seizures are paroxysmal, transitory events that alter consciousness or other cortical function, and they result from episodic neurologic, psychiatric, or extracerebral (particularly cardiovascular) dysfunction. Epileptic seizures are distinguished from other such events by their abnormally synchronized electrical discharges in localized or widely distributed groups of cerebral neurons; such hypersynchronous discharges do not occur during organic or psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, certain of which may produce behaviors closely resembling those of epileptic seizures. Many individuals experience a single generalized tonic–clonic seizure at some time in life, which can be caused by electrolyte disturbances, hypoglycemia, or other extracerebral conditions. Epilepsy is diagnosed only when persisting cerebral dysfunction causes recurring epileptic seizures. Approximately 5% of the general population has one or more epileptic seizure during their lifetimes. At any point in time, 1–2% of the population has epilepsy; cumulative lifetime incidence exceeds 3%. Seizures are refractory to control with antiepileptic drugs in more than 30% of all epilepsies, but the incidence of drug refractoriness varies considerably across the wide range of epileptic syndromes.[3]",

      "title": "Hypothyroidism and Brain Developmental Players",
      "abstract": "Most of our knowledge on the mechanisms of thyroid hormone (TH) dependent brain development is based on clinical observations and animal studies of maternal/fetal hypothyroidism. THs play an essential role in brain development and hormone deficiency during critical phases in fetal life may lead to severe and permanent brain damage. Maternal hypothyroidism is considered the most common cause of fetal TH deficiency, but the problem may also arise in the fetus. In the case of congenital hypothyroidism due to defects in fetal thyroid gland development or hormone synthesis, clinical symptoms at birth are often mild as a result of compensatory maternal TH supply. TH transporters (THTs) and deiodinases (Ds) are important regulators of intracellular triiodothyronine (T3) availability and therefore contribute to the control of thyroid receptors (TRs)-dependent CNS development and early embryonic life. Defects in fetal THTs or Ds may have more impact on fetal brain since they can result in intracellular T3 deficiency despite sufficient maternal TH supply. One clear example is the recent discovery of mutations in the TH transporter (monocarboxylate transporter 8; MCT8) that could be linked to a syndrome of severe and non reversible psychomotor retardation. Even mild and transient changes in maternal TH levels can directly affect and alter the gene expression profile, and thus disturb fetal brain development. Animal studies are needed to increase our understanding of the exact role of THTs and Ds in prenatal brain development.",

Head injuries by contrast can occur in many sports and, except those incurred during boxing, are accidental. Unlike other injuries, the effects of which are usually maximal at onset, injury to the head may precipitate a process of intracranial disorder that can convert a mild initial injury into a life threatening condition from secondary complications. Moreover, even mild injuries are often associated with considerable temporary disability, and repeated mild injuries can result in cumulative brian damage. Doctors on sports fields have to decide whether patients with head injury can resume play or, if not, what further immediate management is needed and when they can play again. The answers to these questions depend on a sensible balancing of risks.\n\nIt is damage to the brain that matters when the head is hit. Injuries to the scalp or skull are important only as indicators of the possibility of underlying impact damage or of the risk of complications that could cause secondary brain damage. Either impact or secondary brain damage may be diffuse or focal, and this will influence the clinical features.\n\n(1) Cerebral contusions - Bruising on the brain surface due to the brain's impact with the overlying skull - are the commonest form of impact damage. Contusion may be focal underneath a fracture resulting from a focal impact, blunt or penetrating, or it may be diffuse, resulting from the brain as a whole being thrown against the rough interior surface of the skull and dural dividers. Diffuse contusion results when the head as a whole decelerates, usually by hitting the ground, in which case the contusions are usually bilateral, affecting the tips of both frontal and temporal poles regardless of where the …",

Dentre as capacidades afetadas, a memória é a principal vítima desta condição. Outras capacidades também podem ser acometidas, tais como a linguagem, habilidade visuespacial, o cálculo, o discernimento e a resolução de problemas. Uma das causas da síndrome demêncial é a hidrocefalia normobárica (HNB), a qual afeta principalmente pessoas idosas, sendo possivelmente resultado de algum trauma ou doença, ainda que as causas exatas não estejam totalmentes claras. Esta pode ser apresentada com a clássica tríade: distúrbio de marcha (atáxica ou apráxica), demência e incontinência urinária e, é definida pelo acúmulo do líquido cefalorraquidiano (LCR ou líquor) nas cavidades ventriculares cranianas. O LCR banha o cérebro e a medula espinhal tendo como uma de suas finalidades a de evitar que possíveis traumas atinjam e comprometam o funcionamento adequado do sistema nervoso central (SNC). O diagnóstico dessa doença pode ser difícil e, muitas vezes ser confundido com outras patologias como o mal de Parkinson e o Alzheimer, além disso, o quadro clínico destas doenças podem estar sobrepostos e, muitas vezes, pacientes tratados para HNB podem estar sofrendo também de outra condição.

      "abstract": "IntroductionNeuromuscular disease is a very broad term that encompasses many diseases and aliments that either directly, via intrinsic muscle pathology, or indirectly, via nerve pathology, impair the functioning of the muscles.Neuromuscular diseases affect the muscles and/or their nervous control and lead to problems with movement.Many are genetic; sometimes, an immune system disorder can cause them.As they have no cure, the aim of clinical treatment is to improve symptoms, increase mobility and lengthen life.Some of them affect the anterior horn cell, and are classified as acquired (e.g.poliomyelitis) and hereditary (e.g.spinal muscular atrophy) diseases.SMA is a genetic disease that attacks nerve cells, called motor neurons, in the spinal cord.As a consequence of the lost of the neurons, muscles weakness becomes to be evident, affecting walking, crawling, breathing, swallowing and head and neck control.Neuropathies affect the peripheral nerve and are divided into demyelinating (e.g.leucodystrophies) and axonal (e.g.porphyria) diseases.Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is the most frequent hereditary form among the neuropathies and it's characterized by a wide range of symptoms so that CMT-1a is classified as demyelinating and CMT-2 as axonal (Marchesi & Pareyson, 2010).Defects in neuromuscular junctions cause infantile and non-infantile Botulism and Myasthenia Gravis (MG).MG is a antibodymediated autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (Drachman, 1994;Meriggioli & Sanders, 2009).In most cases, it is caused by pathogenic autoantibodies directed towards the skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) (Patrick & Lindstrom, 1973) while in others, non-AChR components of the postsynaptic muscle endplate, such as the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MUSK), might serve as targets for the autoimmune attack (Hoch et al., 2001).Although the precise origin of the autoimmune response in MG is not known, genetic predisposition and abnormalities of the thymus gland such as hyperplasia and neoplasia could have an important role in the onset of the disease (Berrih et al., 1984;Roxanis et al., 2001).Several diseases affect muscles: they are classified as acquired (e.g.dermatomyositis and polymyositis) and hereditary (e.g.myotonic disorders and myopaties) forms.Among the myopaties, muscular dystrophies are characterized by the primary wasting of skeletal muscle, caused by mutations in the proteins that form the link between the cytoskeleton and the basal lamina (Cossu & Sampaolesi, 2007).Mutations in the dystrophin gene cause severe form of hereditary muscular diseases; the most common are Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD).DMD patients suffer for complete lack of dystrophin that causes progressive degeneration, muscle wasting and death into the www.intechopen.com",

      "title": "A case series of closed head trauma with pituitary stalk disruption resulting in hypopituitarism",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in young trauma patients with resultant multi-organ effects. Hypopituitarism following TBI can be debilitating and life threatening. TBI which causes hypopituitarism may be characterized by a single head injury, such as from a motor vehicle accident, or by chronic repetitive head trauma, as seen in combative supports including boxing, kick-boxing, and football. In the majority of cases, a diagnosis of hypopituitarism can be entirely missed resulting in severe neuro-endocrine dysfunction. We present a case series of two patients diagnosed with hypopituitarism after TBI and treated appropriately with favorable outcome. The first case is a 34 year-old male, who presented to the emergency department with blunt head trauma after a motor vehicle accident while riding his bicycle. He suffered from severe cranio-facial injuries, resulting in multifocal hemorrhagic contusions, epidural hematoma, and extensive cranio-facial fractures involving the sinuses. The patient developed persistent hypotension with a blood pressure as low as 60/40 mmHg on hospital day three. The second case is a 56 year-old male with a history of schizophrenia, who suffered traumatic brain injury after he was hit by a train. The patient sustained multiple facial fractures, pneumocephalus and C2/7 transverse processes fractures. He also had persistent hypotension, unresponsive to standard treatment. Investigation revealed a deficiency of anterior pituitary hormones resulting from pituitary axis disruption. Hypopituitarism is becoming an increasingly recognized complication following TBI, ranging from total to isolated deficiencies. Traumatic Brain Injury is a major public health problem and is one of the leading causes of disability. Understanding and recognizing pituitary dysfunction after TBI can lead to better outcomes and improved quality of life. Patients with major head injury and, in particular, those with fractures of the base of the skull, must be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of endocrine dysfunction. Appropriate dynamic pituitary-function screening should be performed.",

This formulation would appear to be a legacy from several different sources: from the stimulus-response model in experimental animal psychology, from traditional engineering mechanics (eg, the greater the load or \"stress\" on a spring, the greater the displacement or \"strain\" of that spring), and, finally, from what is implied by the infectious disease model in medicine itself (ie, the greater the number of infecting organisms innoculated into a host, the more serious is the ensuing infection likely to The manifestations of this reasoning are varied.

Outcome can be psychological and physiological disturbances that can slow down progress or even downgrade performance.\r\n Prevalence of the syndrome is higher among professional runners because of setting higher demands on their bodies, indispensable for achieving top results. But syndrome also targets beginners or recreational runners.\r\n Excessive physical overload is considered to be the main cause of overtraining syndrome, but every other psychological and social stressors can atribute. In fact, accumulation of all the stressors causes collapse of the adaptation mechanisms and long term negative symptoms occur. Individual capacity for stress plays an important role in the development of the syndrome.\r\n Diagnosis of the overtraining syndrome is clinical and accomplished through history, which should demonstrate the following: (1) decreased performance persisting despite weeks and months of recovery, (2) disturbances in mood, and (3) lack of signs and symptoms or diagnosis of other possible causes of underperformance.\r\n Recovery last for weeks, often even months.\r\n It is hard to predict which runner will develop overtraining. Therefore, prevention is the key.\r\n Main components of prevention are education and follow up.\r\n Balance between optimal training and recovery is a strategy of success.\r\n Right amount od training overload and enough time to rest will result in an additional motivation, as psychological, and as physiological set out for new triumph.",

Peterson, MD (238:2072,1977), to the question whether the onset of tinnitus in a 48-year-old man might be related to myelography or one of the several drugs he was taking, it might be helpful to know that this symptom is often seen by dentists in persons suffering from chronic headache patterns or recent trauma. The source of the dental cause is a dysfunctional relationship between the temperomandibular joint and the dentition or dental prosthesis. The dysfunction (which may have been asymptomatic) is then exacerbated by a behavioral pattern. The usual pattern is simply clenching the teeth in response to pain elsewhere in the body. There are many modifications to this pattern, including biting the incisal edge of the front teeth, grinding the teeth, and biting two particular teeth (eg, cuspids).

      "title": "Clinical Holistic Medicine: Mental Disorders in a Holistic Perspective",
      "abstract": "From a holistic perspective, psychiatric diseases are caused by the patients unwillingness to assume responsibility for his life, existence, and personal relations. The loss of responsibility arises from the repression of the fundamental existential dimensions of the patients. Repression of love and purpose causes depersonalization (i.e., a lack of responsibility for being yourself and for the contact with others, loss of direction and purpose in life). Repression of strength in mind and emotions leads to derealization (the breakdown of the reality testing, often with mental delusions and hallucinations). The repression of joy and gender leads to devitalization (emotional emptiness, loss of joy, personal energy, sexuality, and pleasure in life).The losses of existential dimensions are invariably connected to traumas with life-denying decisions. Healing the wounds of the soul by holding and processing will lead to the recovery of the person's character, purpose of life, and existential responsibility. It can be very difficult to help a psychotic patient. The physician must first love his patient unconditionally and then fully understand the patient in order to meet and support the patient to initiate the holistic process of healing. It takes motivation and willingness to suffer on behalf of the patients in order to heal, as the existential and emotional pain of the traumas resulting in insanity is often overwhelming. We believe that most psychiatric diseases can be alleviated or cured by the loving and caring physician who masters the holistic toolbox. Further research is needed to document the effect of holistic medicine in psychiatry.",

      "title": "Challenging the Role of pH in Skeletal Muscle Fatigue",
      "abstract": "Muscle fatigue is frequently defined as a temporary loss in force- or torque-generating ability because of recent, repetitive muscle contraction (1). The development of this temporary loss of force is a complex process and results from the failure of a number of processes, including motor unit recruitment and firing rate, chemical transmission across the neuromuscular junction, propagation of the action potential along the muscle membrane and T tubules, Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), Ca2+ binding to troponin C, and cross-bridge cycling (for detailed reviews, see Bigland-Ritchie and Woods(1), McLester(2), and Favero(3)). Muscle fatigue may limit the time a person can stand, the distance a person can ambulate, or the number of stairs a person can ascend or descend. In practical terms, however, we cannot know what actually leads to a decline in function for a given patient. For a phenomenon that may have profound clinical implications, muscle fatigue often receives inadequate attention in physiology textbooks, many of which contain a page or less of information on the entire topic (4-8). In addition, many textbooks report that muscle fatigue is mainly the result of a decrease in pH within the muscle cell due to a rise in hydrogen ion concentration ([H+]) resulting from anaerobic metabolism and the accumulation of lactic acid (6-8). Recent literature, however, contradicts this assertion (9-10). The purpose of this update, therefore, is to provide a brief review of the role of pH in the development of muscle fatigue.",

There are noninvasive mechanisms that are used to treat pain such as heat and cold application, other thermal or electrical modalities, stretching to soft tissue, or manual therapy. Dry needling is a mechanism that is used to treat muscle trigger points that refer pain to areas within the body. Trigger points can cause irritation to skeletal muscle or fascia and affect function. Dry needling is used to reduce pain by achieving a local twitch response to release muscle tension, normalize electrical dysfunction of the motor end plates, and assist with return to activities or rehabilitation. There are many modalities available for pain management and dry needling is one of many used to target soft tissue and manage pain. Using a multimodal approach is an effective method of treatment to consider for many musculoskeletal or neuromuscular conditions.",

The classification of CP is based on the motor deficit rather than the underlying etiology.

      "abstract": "It is common knowledge that women often get depressed after childbirth. Yet there has been little evaluation of what this depression amounts to. Transitory tearfulness in the early puerperium, as observed in maternity wards, is commonplace; has been designated “the Blues”—3rd, 4th or 10th day, Maternity or Mother's—and is generally regarded as a normal phenomenon. It has been variously attributed to psychological difficulties and physical discomfort at the onset of lactation, “narcissistic loss before rediscovery of the child” (Sclare, 1955), perineal soreness and hormonal changes.",

      "abstract": "Kleptomania is the inability to refrain from the urge to steal items for reasons other than personal use or financial gain. The disorder is frequently under-diagnosed and is regularly accompanied by other psychiatric disorders; particularly anxiety disorders, eating disorders and affective disorders. Our patient is a 19-year-old female, who was referred to our hospital from a general state hospital. She suffered from a desire to steal things such as makeup materials and perfume. She also complained carrying out inappropriate sexual behavior. She had depressive and obsessive-compulsive symptoms and attempted suicide three times in past years. She knew her grandmother as her mother, despite living in the same household. According to classical psychoanalytical theory; kleptomania is a defense against unconscious impulses, desires, conflicts and needs. The individual who is prone to narcissistic injury tries to prevent the self from disintegrating by the way of stealing behavior. Among psychodynamic theories, ego psychology, self-psychology and object relations theory also have explanations for kleptomania. This case has symptoms that belong to other psychiatric disorders. Thus, the case presented here is important for its emphasis on the fact that categorical and symptom oriented approaches are far from considering patients as a whole.",

      "title": "Perioperative Hearing Impairment",
      "abstract": "PERIOPERATIVE hearing loss is a rarely reported phenomenon. However, it occurs more frequently than most anesthesiologists suspect. Perioperative hearing impairment is often subclinical and may go unnoticed unless audiometry is performed. 1–3It can be conductive or sensorineural, unilateral or bilateral, and transient or permanent. 4–8Hearing loss has been reported following virtually every type of anesthetic technique. The hearing mechanism may be less susceptible to acoustic trauma during general anesthesia, 9but other mechanisms are capable of causing both conductive and sensorineural hearing losses (SNHL) in the perioperative period. The etiologies include mechanical, traumatic, noise-induced, changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, nitrous oxide, embolism, pharmacologic, and other miscellaneous causes.The cochlea is the auditory portion of the inner ear. It is a snail-shaped structure of 2.75 turns with an uncoiled length of approximately 3 cm (fig. 1). The cochlea is divided into three channels. The two outer channels, the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, contain perilymphatic fluid and communicate at the apex through the helicotrema. The middle channel, the scala media (cochlear duct), contains endolymphatic fluid. In the conventional cross-sectional view of the cochlea (fig. 2), the scala media is triangular in shape. Its upper boundary, the vestibular or Reissner's membrane, attaches to the osseous spiral lamina and to the outer wall of the cochlea, separating it from the scala vestibuli. The lower boundary, the basilar membrane, also attaches to the osseous spiral lamina and the outer wall of the cochlea. The basilar membrane supports the hearing organ, the organ of Corti, and separates the scala media from the scala tympani. The lateral wall of the scala media is the highly vascular stria vascularis. At the base of the cochlea, the perilymph of the scala vestibuli contacts the oval window and the perilymph of the scala tympani contacts the round window (figs. 1 and 3).Arterial blood is supplied to the inner ear by the internal auditory artery, which arises from either the basilar or the inferior anterior cerebellar artery and passes through the internal auditory meatus with cranial nerve VIII. The arterial supply to the cochlea is via end vessels, with no collateral circulation. The afferent special somatic exteroceptive cochlear nerve provides innervation. The peripheral processes arise in the organ of Corti, their cell bodies forming the spiral ganglion of the cochlea in the osseous spiral lamina. The processes converge, traversing the modiolus to form the cochlear nerve, which passes through the internal acoustic meatus with the vestibular nerve. A smaller number of efferent nerve fibers arise from the olivary complexes and terminate axodendritically on the afferent dendrites that innervate the inner hair cells.The cochlear fluid system is made up of two fluids, perilymph and endolymph (fig. 2). Perilymph fills the scala vestibuli and scala tympani and has an ionic composition, low in potassium and high in sodium, similar to interstitial fluid and nearly identical to CSF. 10There are two theories regarding its origin: (1) it is filtrate produced by capillaries in the spiral ligament; and (2) it is CSF communicated to cochlea through the cochlear aqueduct, a small channel in the temporal bone near the round window, which connects the scala tympani directly to the subarachnoid space. The endolymphatic fluid is unique to the inner ear. It has a high concentration of potassium and a low concentration of sodium, similar to intracellular fluid. The stria vascularis is believed to be the source of the unique endolymph ionic composition. Although there is slow longitudinal flow of endolymph, maintenance of the critical ionic environment for the organ of Corti is due to local radial flow between the stria vascularis and nearby cells. Endolymphatic absorption takes place in the endolymphatic sac, a specialized structure of the membranous labyrinth. The endolymphatic sac is located in the subdural space and communicates with the membranous labyrinth via the endolymphatic duct (fig. 1). It is thought to participate in balancing endolymphatic pressures with changes in CSF pressure. Two-way flow through a patent cochlear aqueduct provides relatively rapid perilymphatic pressure equilibration with the CSF. Endolymphatic pressure regulation is considerably slower, being primarily a function of production and absorption. Only minor and temporary pressure adjustments are made by the endolymphatic sac.The organ of Corti, the hearing transduction mechanism, is located in the cochlear duct (scala media). The sensory cells of the organ of Corti are mechanoreceptors with stereocilia projecting from the top of the cells into the endolymph. 11There are two types of hair cells, outer (OHC) and inner (IHC) hair cells (fig. 2). They differ in morphology, microanatomical location, and function. The IHCs and OHCs initiate the transduction process by transforming the acoustic signal into neural activity. Activation of the hair cells causes neurotransmitter release that depolarizes afferent dendrites causing an all-or-none spike discharge in individual auditory nerve fibers. Overlying the organ of Corti is a gelatinous flap, the tectorial membrane. The tectorial membrane is attached on its medial edge to the spiral limbus and laterally is in contact with the stereocilia of the OHCs. Since the tectorial membrane and basilar membrane have different medial attachment locations, upward or downward displacement of basilar membrane induces shearing displacements of the hairs in contact with the tectorial membrane. These various bending movements of the OHC stereocilia can cause excitation or inhibition. Excitation initiates the transduction of acoustic energy into neural signals. In contrast to OHCs, the stereocilia of the IHC are not embedded in the tectorial membrane but rest in a groove near the undersurface of the tectorial membrane. The IHC do not respond to displacement of the basilar membrane, but they do respond to the velocity of displacement of the basilar membrane. The neural signals initiated by the IHCs and OHCs are transmitted through the acoustic division of cranial nerve VIII ultimately to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe.A simplified diagram of the cochlea uncoiled is usually used to describe cochlear mechanics (fig. 3). On the left is the base of the cochlea with the stapes and oval window. Below these structures and adjoining the scala vestibuli is the round window of the scala tympani. In the diagram, the uncoiled cochlea is divided horizontally by a line representing the scala media, Reissner's membrane, the organ of Corti, and the basilar membrane. However, this line, for purposes of understanding cochlear mechanics, can be thought of as simply the basilar membrane. Above the dividing line is the scala vestibuli, and below is the scala tympani. Because of the inertia of the fluid mass and frictional resistance to fluid flow in the narrow channels of the scala, inward or outward motion of the stapes against the oval window causes a pressure wave to travel down the scala; there is no fluid flow. Since the fluids are incompressible within the bony cochlea, the pressure wave traveling down the scala vestibuli causes the basilar membrane to deflect downward toward the scala tympani for positive pressures and upward for negative pressures. The flexible round window compensates for pressure changes transmitted to the scala tympani. For the acute changes caused by pressure waves in the audible frequencies, the connection between the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, the helicotrema, functions as though it were closed. The helicotrema is only involved in very slow equalization of pressures between the two scalae.The most important property of the basilar membrane is its ability to separate various frequencies. The compliance of the basilar membrane changes by a factor of greater than 100 from base to apex. At the base, near the oval window, the basilar membrane is narrower and thicker, making it less compliant (fig. 3). It is wider and thinner at the apex, resulting in greater compliance. Since a system's resonant frequency is directly proportional to stiffness and inversely proportional to mass, the stiff base responds maximally to high frequencies (> 4,000 Hz), and the compliant apex responds maximally to low frequencies (< 1,000 Hz). In short, the basilar membrane functions as a sharply tuned bandpass filter, performing a spectral analysis on the incoming sound (pressure) waves. The effect is to translate the frequency of incoming sound into distance along the basilar membrane, a frequency-to-place or tonotopical transformation. Therefore, both IHCs and OHCs at a specific point along the basilar membrane respond to a very specific, narrow frequency range. Excited hair cells depolarize specific acoustic neurons, and the information is finally interpreted in the auditory centers.Clinical or subclinical hearing loss following spinal anesthesia or lumbar puncture has been reported frequently(table 1). 4,6–8,12–24Despite many reports, few anesthesiologists appear to be aware of the possibility of this complication. Since there has been no large-scale audiometric study of hearing loss associated with spinal anesthesia, the precise incidence of clinical or subclinical hearing loss is unknown but may occur more frequently than appreciated. Further, the specific presentation and onset of the hearing deficit after spinal anesthesia can vary widely.The first case of hearing loss associated with spinal anesthesia 25was reported in 1914. In 1956, Vandam and Dripps 26reported that of 9,277 patients who had spinal anesthesia, 0.4% experienced auditory difficulties, such as impaired hearing, tinnitus, buzzing, or roaring. Few specific data were gathered, and no audiometry of these patients was performed. Michel et al. 27described nine cases of hearing loss following myelography, diagnostic lumbar puncture, and spinal anesthesia. The hearing deficits were almost uniformly in the lower frequencies (125–1,000 Hz). The deficits were bilateral in six of the nine patients. Six of the nine patients had full recoveries in less than 1 month without treatment.In addition to these case reports, there have been several studies of hearing loss related to spinal anesthesia. In one study, 6 of 14 patients had audiometrically detectable mild hearing deficits in the low-frequency range that resolved spontaneously in 1–7 months. 28Walsted et al. 29tested 34 patients with audiometry before and after spinal anesthesia. Most of the patients had a small but significant threshold shift at 500 Hz. However, one patient developed a considerable unilateral hearing loss in the low-frequency range, which persisted until an epidural blood patch was performed. Gultekin et al. 30used pure tone audiometry to test hearing before and after spinal anesthesia for hernia repair. Fourteen patients (32%), despite being unaware of it, had audiometrically measurable low-frequency hearing losses. All spinal anesthetics were performed with 22-gauge Quincke needles (needle gauge and design are discussed in the next section), and the authors suggested that hearing loss was less frequent when the anesthetic agent was bupivacaine rather than prilocaine. In 35 patients undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia (24-gauge Sprotte needle), pure tone audiometry revealed that five patients had developed low-frequency hearing loss on the first postoperative day. 31The deficits were unilateral in three patients and bilateral in the other two. All patients had full recovery without treatment by the fifth postoperative day. In contrast, Finegold et al. 32found no audiometric hearing decrement postoperatively in 44 patients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Half of the patients' spinals were performed with 25-gauge Quincke needles; 24-gauge Sprotte needles were used for the other half. This is the only study of 13 found that failed to show a relationship between spinal anesthesia and hearing loss. Hearing acuity is affected by hormonal changes, 33,34but peripartum changes have not been documented. The explanation for this singular result may be in the study's methodology.In a study of 100 patients undergoing elective urologic procedures under spinal anesthesia, eight patients experienced noticeable hearing impairment. 18Audiometry was performed on three of the patients and revealed a 30-dB loss in the low-frequency range. Hearing deficits resolved within a short time without treatment. In another study of 100 patients undergoing elective general or urologic surgery under spinal anesthesia, 16 had audiometrically documented hearing losses. 3The hearing loss typically affected only the frequencies between 125 and 2,000 Hz. The deficits were usually detected on the second day after the spinal anesthetic and in all cases resolved within 3 days without treatment. The incidence of hearing loss after spinal anesthesia for men under 30 yr of age was compared to that in men over the age of 60. 35Fifty-two percent (13 of 25) of the younger and 16% of the older patients had significant hearing losses (≤ 10 dB) confined to the low-frequency range (125–500 Hz). There was no hearing impairment in the speech frequencies (500–2,000 Hz) and higher frequencies for either group. No patient was aware of a hearing deficit, and no patient developed a post–dural puncture headache (PDPH). In a recent study of hearing loss following spinal versus general anesthesia, there were audiometric losses in both groups, although the spinal group had significantly greater hearing losses, particularly in the low-frequency range. 36Interestingly, in the spinal group, increases in the low-frequency audible threshold were inversely related to the preoperative low-frequency audible threshold.Overall, it appears that 10–50% of patients receiving spinal anesthesia experience an audiometrically measurable low-frequency hearing deficit. Less than one fourth of these patients have a clinical, or noticeable, hearing loss.The size of the needle used for dural puncture appears to play a role in postspinal anesthetic hearing impairment. The hearing loss may be a result of CSF leakage even when the CSF loss is insufficient to cause a PDPH. Fog et al. 2found that 13 of 14 patients whose spinal anesthetics were performed with a 22-gauge needle had a 10-dB or greater hearing loss across the audible frequency range with significantly greater losses in the low-frequency range. Only 4 of the 14 patients in whom a 26-gauge needle was used had similar hearing impairment, and none had significant (> 10 dB) losses. When spinal anesthesia was performed with a 26-gauge needle, 37only one of nine patients was found to have a low-frequency hearing loss, which was severe but transient. Interestingly, this patient also experienced a PDPH. In another study of 100 patients, 50 had spinal anesthesia using either a 20- or a 22-gauge needle. Of these, 10% had significant decreases in audiometric values in the 250- to 500-Hz frequency range on the first postoperative day that resolved spontaneously within 5 days. 38In the 50 patients in whom 24- and 25-gauge needles were used, no decrement in audiometric values occurred. Oncel et al. 1used pure tone audiometry at 125 Hz preoperatively and postoperatively to assess hearing loss. Three groups of 15 patients were studied. One group received epidural anesthesia. In the other two groups, spinal anesthesia was performed with either a 22- or 25-gauge needle. No hearing impairments were detected in the epidural group. There was significantly greater hearing loss in the 22-gauge group versus the 25-gauge spinal group. None of the study patients developed a PDPH. The authors suggested that pure tone audiometry may be a more sensitive indicator of CSF leakage than the presence of PDPH.Needle design may also play a role in hearing impairment following lumbar puncture. Using audiometry, Sundberg et al. 39compared the effect of 22-gauge cutting-tip (Quincke) to 22-gauge pencil-point (Whitacre) needles on postspinal hearing loss. A hearing loss of at least 10 dB at two or more frequencies below 1,000 Hz was observed in 6 of 25 (24%) patients in the Quincke group as compared to only 2 of 23 (9%) in the Whitacre group. In addition, of those patients with hearing deficits, the mean hearing level was significantly worse in the Quincke group. This study suggests an association between the design of the spinal needle tip and postoperative hearing dysfunction that is similar to the relationship between the needle types and the incidence of PDPH, implying a similar pathogenesis. Lamberg et al. , 40using audiometric testing, compared hearing losses after a single-shot spinal with a 25-gauge Quincke needle with those following a continuous spinal anesthetic (19-gauge Touhy-type needle and 22-gauge catheter). None of the patients developed a PDPH or were aware of a hearing loss. However, nine (43%) of the single-shot patients and seven (37%) of continuous spinal patients had hearing deficits in excess of 10 dB when tested postoperatively. This result also seems to parallel experience with the cause and incidence of PDPH.In summary, hearing impairment following neuraxial anesthesia seems to be related to the same factors (age, needle gauge, and needle type) that are implicated in CSF leakage and PDPH. 41Two of the studies cited above included a total of 27 patients who received epidural anesthesia. Audiometric testing did not reveal measurable postoperative auditory impairment in any of these patients. On the other hand, the consensus of the studies indicates a consistent rate (10–50%) of SNHL in the low frequencies after lumbar puncture. Also, postspinal hearing impairment resolved without treatment, usually within several days, again suggesting an etiology common with that of PDPH. Interestingly, in two reports, patients who received epidural blood patches for PDPH had simultaneous reversal of their postspinal, low-frequency hearing loss. 4,29Cerebrospinal fluid leakage can cause a decrease in the CSF pressure that may be transmitted to the inner ear. A relative balance in the endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressures maintains the normal structural conformation in the inner ear. Disruption of this pressure balance can cause hearing impairment as well as impairment of semicircular canal function. A change in CSF pressure is promptly transmitted through a patent cochlear aqueduct to the inner ear perilymph (fig. 2). 6,42–45A decrease in CSF pressure following a dural puncture and CSF leak would cause a rapid and similar decrease in perilymph pressure. The endolymphatic system, however, responds much more slowly. Endolymphatic pressure–volume adjustments are primarily the result of altered endolymph production at the stria vascularis or altered absorption at the endolymphatic sac. Therefore, an acute drop in CSF pressure could result in endolymphatic pressure sufficiently exceeding that of the perilymph to cause distortions of both Reissner's membrane and the basilar membrane. The consequent disruption in the position of the hair cells results in hearing impairment. 10This mechanism has been postulated in several reports. 3,6,8,46Walsted et al. 47proposed such a mechanism in 1991. Later, in controlled prospective studies of neurosurgical patients and in animal studies, she showed the relationship between CSF loss and low-frequency hearing impairment. 48–52The finding that the degree of hearing impairment is correlated with the size of the spinal needle further supports the theory that postspinal hearing loss and PDPH share a common etiology: leakage of CSF from the subarachnoid space. 1,2Distortion of the basilar membrane and hearing loss could also be caused by acute increases in CSF pressure transmitted to the perilymph. In a case report, Hardy 53postulated that injection into the epidural space caused an acute increase in CSF pressure that was immediately transmitted through the cochlear aqueduct to the perilymph, thus distorting the basilar membrane and causing an acute low-frequency hypoacusis.Finally, if the mechanism of postspinal hearing loss is the same as for PDPH, several questions arise: why do we not see as many patients with vestibular symptoms; why does not every patient with a severe PDPH experience hearing impairment; and why are some hearing losses unilateral? In response to the first question, not only are the changes in CSF pressure transmitted less rapidly to the vestibular apparatus, but the vestibular apparatus is somewhat less sensitive than the cochlea to perilymph–endolymph pressure imbalances. Further, the hearing deficit may be subclinical, not obvious without audiometric testing. In answer to the second question, as many as 7% of adults have an anatomically obstructed cochlear aqueduct, and as many as 30% have a functionally obstructed aqueduct. 44,45,54For these patients, CSF pressure changes are not transmitted to the perilymph, and, therefore, a severe PDPH could exist without a hearing deficit. This mechanism may also explain the cases of unilateral hearing deficit. In addition, restricted cochlear aqueduct flow and the mechanical compliance of the cochlear windows can limit the stress of CSF pressure changes.The reports cited above indicate that the great majority of hearing deficits that result from lumbar puncture or CSF loss occur in the low frequencies and, in most cases, bilaterally. We propose that this is the result of the physical characteristics of the basilar membrane. At the cochlear base, where higher frequencies are transduced, the basilar membrane is narrow, thick, and stiff, and therefore resistant to pressure changes that are not in its resonant frequency range (fig. 3). At the cochlear apex, where low frequencies are transduced, the basilar membrane is much more compliant. Changes in CSF pressure transmitted to the perilymph can cause significant static displacement of the basilar membrane, disrupting the normal OHC relationship to the tectorial membrane and resulting in low-frequency hearing loss. Hearing loss confined to the low frequencies is unlikely due to CSF pressure–mediated stretch or pressure injury to cranial nerve VIII.It is interesting to note that the low-frequency hearing loss observed in Ménière's syndrome involves a similar mechanism. In Ménière's syndrome, instead of a decrease in perilymphatic pressure relative to endolymphatic pressure, there is an increase in endolymphatic pressure (endolymphatic hydrops). This imbalance in pressures would cause a similar distortion of the basilar membrane with the greatest effect at the cochlear apex and resulting, at least in the early stages, in a hearing loss (low frequency) similar to that which can occur after spinal anesthesia.Presuming that hearing impairment following spinal anesthesia or dural puncture has the same etiology as PDPH, i.e. , loss of CSF or decreased CSF pressure, then the treatment and prognosis should be similar. Figure 4indicates that untreated hearing impairments following dural puncture recover fully greater than 95% of the time. Several authors have noted improvement in auditory symptoms after an epidural blood patch. 4,29,55Lybecker et al. 46prospectively studied the effects of an epidural blood patch on hearing in patients with severe PDPH caused by dural puncture. They performed audiometry at several frequencies 1 h before and 1 h after an epidural blood patch. Twelve of the 16 patients had significant audiometric improvement in hearing. Simply changing position from sitting to supine improved hearing in half of the patients in the absence of the blood patch. This study offers clear evidence of the potential efficacy of epidural blood patch for post–dural puncture hearing loss. In another case report in which conservative measures followed by two epidural blood patches failed to relieve a severe PDPH and bilateral low-frequency hearing loss, an epidural dextran 40 infusion relieved the headache and reversed the hearing loss. 56Rosenberg et al. 57performed an audiometric study of 20 patients undergoing surgery with interscalene brachial plexus block anesthesia. Four of the patients (20%) experienced hearing impairment at various frequencies on the side of the block. The low frequencies (250–500 Hz) were affected in only one patient who also had hearing threshold decrements on the opposite side of 15–20 dB measured in the 6,000- to 10,000-Hz range (table 2). Farrell et al. 58described four patients with sudden permanent deafness following anesthesia for dental surgery. Anesthesia for three of the patients was local infiltration or nerve block, and the fourth had general anesthesia. The patient who had general anesthesia had bilateral SNHL, while the three other patients had ipsilateral SNHL. Similarly, Shenkman et al. 59reported a case in which permanent neurologic symptoms, ipsilateral hearing impairment, a facial nerve palsy, and ataxia occurred following an inferior alveolar nerve block. These findings are summarized in table 2.Within 24 h after the interscalene blocks, all four of the patients had spontaneous resolution of their hearing deficits. 57The authors postulated that the mechanism of hearing loss involved an effect due to sympathetic blockade. Vasodilation caused by the sympathetic block may have developed, resulting in edema of the mucosal membranes of both the Eustachian tube and the middle ear and producing a hearing decrement on that side. The hearing loss resolved within 24 h without treatment in all four patients.With regard to the hearing deficits following dental procedures, the authors 58,59could not identify a specific etiology for any of the cases. Several possibilities were considered. Noise-induced hearing loss from dental drills is known to result in temporary, noise-induced, bilateral hearing deficits. 60Dental extractions are known to cause microemboli that could reach the cochlear vasculature and cause temporary or permanent hearing impairment. 58Vasoconstrictors are usually used with local anesthesia for dental procedures. Intravascular injection could cause vasospasm of the cochlear division of the internal auditory artery. 58Finally, nociceptive afferents or autonomic nerve fibers could initiate a reflex vasoconstriction of critical vessels to the hearing structures. Hearing loss during dental procedures appears to be quite rare and usually temporary.Hearing impairment after general anesthesia for non–cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is rare. Our review of the English language literature through 2001 revealed only 35 reported (29 documented audiometrically) cases of hearing loss after general anesthesia (table 3).Evan et al. 61reported three cases of SNHL following general anesthesia; one patient recovered, and the other two sustained permanent hearing loss. The authors were unable to elucidate the etiology in any of the patients. Cox and Sargent 62reported three cases of hearing loss following nonotologic surgery. Two patients had permanent, profound unilateral hearing loss, and one patient had moderate bilateral hearing loss. Velazquez 63described a case of acute unilateral hearing deficit following abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Other authors have described bilateral hearing impairment immediately following minor abdominal surgeries. 64,65It should also be noted that some patients who receive general anesthesia come to the operating room from an intensive care unit having already sustained an unrecognized hearing loss. Halpern et al. 66have discussed the myriad causes of hearing loss in the critical care setting.Although the etiology of hearing loss associated with general anesthesia often cannot be ascertained, there are a number of potential etiologies: changes in middle ear pressure, vascular pathology, CSF pressure changes, embolism, ototoxic drugs, and other miscellaneous causes.Excessive or sudden changes in middle ear pressure can disrupt the tympanic membrane, the round window, and the conducting structures. Excessive middle ear pressure can cause the round window to rupture, resulting in significant hearing loss. 67,68This type of injury has been described as occurring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 69Two patients who were successfully resuscitated developed partial deafness, one from disarticulation of the incomalleal joint and the other from an oval window perilymph fistula. It was postulated that during vigorous mask ventilation, excessive pressure was suddenly transmitted through the Eustachian tube causing the middle ear injuries.Nitrous oxide (N2O) anesthesia was shown in the late 1960s to be capable of causing oscillations of middle ear pressures that could result in tympanic perforation and cause hearing loss. 70,71Depending on the uptake or elimination phase, N2O can displace tympanic membrane grafts outward or inward and disrupt reconstructed middle ear conducting structures. Segal et al. 72described a case of labyrinthine membrane rupture and sustained SNHL due to elevated intratympanic pressure during general anesthesia with N2O. The degree of intratympanic pressure fluctuation is a function of N2O concentration and its rate of change. Several cases of middle ear injury have been described as resulting from sudden changes in intratympanic pressure during general anesthesia with N2O. 73–77Further, the patency of the Eustachian tube may play a role in potential injury during N2O anesthesia. During N2O elimination, Eustachian tube obstruction can result in significant negative middle ear pressure and tympanic perforation. 78A vascular pathogenesis is another possible mechanism for hearing impairment after general anesthesia.

      "abstract": "Hemiplegia/ hemiparesis is the paralysis of either right or left side of the body with loss of functions. The main cause of hemiplegia is cerebrovascular attack (CVA) or stroke. Stroke is the third main cause of the death & disability in India. There are two major categories of brain damage in stroke i.e. ischemia & haemorrhage. The aim of rehabilitation in subjects with hemiplegia is to promote recovery of lost function, independence, and early reintegration into social and domestic life. Many stroke patients have a number of serious disorders such as hemiplegia, motor disturbance, sensory disability, and cognitive impairment. Stroke rehabilitation is the process by which those with disabling strokes undergo treatment to help them return to normal life as much as possible by regaining and relearning the skills of everyday living. Physiotherapy treatment includes conventional therapies & neurophysiological approaches. Conventional therapies(Therapeutic Exercises, Traditional Functional Retraining) comprises of: Range Of Motion (ROM) Exercises i.e. passive followed by active assisted, active then active resisted exercises, Muscle Strengthening Exercises to reduce flaccidity, Stretching techniques to reduce spasticity, Mobilization techniques, Fitness training & Compensatory Techniques. Neurophysiological Approaches: 1. Muscle Re-education Approach. 2. Neurodevelopmental Approaches: – Sensorimotor Approach (Rood, 1940S), Movement Therapy Approach (Brunnstrom, 1950S), NDT Approach (Bobath, 1960-70S), PNF Approach (Knot and Voss, 1960-70S). 3. Motor Relearning Program for Stroke (1980S). 4. Contemporary Task Oriented Approach (1990S). We conclude that above all the techniques, Bobath, NDT, PNF, Roods approach, speech therapy, robotic devices, balance training and kinesiotapping are effective in the improvement of patient’s condition.",

Motor disorder the most frequent effect of optic thalamus lesions, except those extensive enough to produce hemianesthesia. Hyperkinesis and neural tissue-simplification. A possible structural correlate of depression. II. MATERIAL OF THE STUDY, WITH BRIEF REMARKS UPON THE THALAMUS. Cases of totally destructive or focally destructive lesions omitted from consideration.- Endeavor to study cases of diffuse chronic conditions of partial loss or absence of mechanisms (atrophy, aplasia) such that the throughroutes for sensory impulses are preserved. Impossibility at present of imitating such lesions by experimental methods such as extirpation by scalpel or by electrolysis. Summary of structures whose lesions were reviewed. Summary of symptoms reviewed. III. HYPERKINESIS AND DIFFUSE CHRONIC THALAMIC LESIONS. Hyperkinetic symptoms are here defined as including psychomotor excitement, violence, destructiveness, homicidal acts, irritability and exaltation.24 of 29 cases showed one or more of these hyperkinetic symptoms. Study of the exceptions shows that two cases had also lesions of the thalamocortical neurone systems, that one case was an instance of pulvinar lesions, and that one was a case with lesions hardly extensive enough (“vacuoles”) to be included. But one case out of the remaining 25 failed to show such symptoms (a stuporous general paretic). Comparison of this group with a group of 261 cases with normallooking brains shows that the thalamic series excels the normallooking brain series in violence, homicide, and irritability. On the other hand the thalamic series showed fewer depressive symptoms (including suicidal tendencies and apprehensiveness) than the normal-looking brain series. IV. GENERAL RESULTS.",

      "title": "The challenge of sleep management in military operations.",
      "abstract": "It has long been known that short-term (days) insufficient sleep causes decrements in mental effectiveness that put individuals at increased risk of committing errors and causing accidents. More recently, it has been discovered that chronic poor sleep (over years) is associated with a variety of negative health outcomes (metabolic syndrome, obesity, degraded behavioral health). Implementing an effective sleep health program is, therefore, in the best interests of active duty personnel and their families both in the short- and long-term. Like managing physical activity or nutrition, effectively managing sleep health comes with its unique set of challenges arising from the fact that individuals who routinely do not obtain sufficient sleep are generally desensitized to feeling sleepy and are poor at judging their own performance capabilities--and individuals cannot be compelled to sleep. For these reasons, an optimally effective sleep health program requires 3 components: (1) a rigorous, evidence-based sleep education component to impart actionable knowledge about optimal sleep amounts, healthy sleep behaviors, the known benefits of sleep, the short- and long-term consequences of insufficient sleep, and to dispel myths about sleep; (2) a nonintrusive device that objectively and accurately measures sleep to empower the individual to track his/her own sleep/wake habits; and (3) a meaningful, actionable metric reflecting sleep/wake impact on daily effectiveness so that the individual sees the consequences of his/her sleep behavior and, therefore, can make informed sleep health choices.",

      "title": "Stress physiology and impact of stress on coronary atherosclerotic heart diseases",
      "abstract": "Large number of epidemiological studies including Framingham's study have documented that stress is a important risk factor of Atherosclerotic coronary heart disease. Even and above our day to stresses related to home and job we have witnessed major acute stressful events i.e. earth quack, tsunami, flood, terrorist attacks, civil war, riots, nuclear blasts…. Historical point of view Hans Selye a father of the study of stress, established relationship between chronic stress and effects on the body. He described three stages of stress response as General Adaptation Syndrome” [GAS]. The three stages are 1] Alarm: Fight or Flight” reaction: body mobilizes resources to combat threat; activates the sympathetic nervous system 2] Resistance: Enhanced ability to fight stressor via moderate physiological arousal; ability to withstand additional stressors (e.g., infection) is reduced. 3] Exhaustion: Depletion of resources brings on diseases and disorders (e.g., chronically high heart rate and blood pressure increase chances of heart attack and stroke). Stress activates the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, a group of structures that help the body cope with stress. The hypothalamus activities the pituitary gland, which in turn releases hormones that stimulate the adrenal glands to release the stress hormones epinephrine, nor epinephrine, and cortisol. There is release of catecholamine epinephrine (adrenaline), nor epinephrine (noradrenalin) with stimulation of Sympathetic Nervous System. Incidentally majority of studies are epidemiological. Recently there more studies explaining the pathophysiological mechanism how the stress causes CHD. Endocrinal abnormalities especially hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and inhibited sex steroid result an elevated waist/hip circumference ratio (WHR) and visceral obesity,combined with insulin resistance is hall mark of metabolic basis of CV disease. Insulin resistance and other risk factors dependent on the hyperinsulinemia following insulin resistance are associated with dyslipideamia i.e. increase LDL cholesterol and triglyceride and decrease, are hallmark or culprit of atherosclerosis. Chronic stress is associated with reduced physical activity and sedentary life style further induces a state of insulin resistance. When beta cells are no longer able to compensate for insulin resistance by adequately increasing insulin production, impaired glucose tolerance appears, characterized by excessive postprandial hyperglycemia. Impaired glucose tolerance may evolve into overt diabetes another risk factor of CHD.. Because all these conditions are also accompanied by the presence of an oxidative stress, oxidative stress one of the pathogenic mechanism linking the stress insulin resistance with dysfunction of both beta cells and endothelium, eventually leading to overt diabetes and cardiovascular disease. There is evidence that chronic stress may induce a chronic inflammatory process culminating in atherosclerosis. These increased oxidative stress and inflammatory events, caused by stress, may account for the approximately 40% of atherosclerotic patients with no other known risk factors. A heightened state of cardiovascular activity, injured endothelium, and induction of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells to which recruited inflammatory cells adhere and translocate to the arterial wall. Shedding of adhesion molecules and the appearance of cytokines, and APRs in the blood are early indicators of a stress-induced APR and may be predictors of future cardiovascular disease. The most important things are 1] stress is everywhere and each and every one are exposed to stress 2]CHD is multi factorial disease and stress is one modifiable risk factor. Stress management interventions studies have further supporting the fact such successful intervention of stress management is associated with up 74% reduction in cardiac events",

      "title": "Mental Retardation: Biologic Aspects of Concern to Pediatricians",
      "abstract": "1. Approximately 3% of the population (6 to 7 million persons in the United States) is mentally retarded. Of these, severe mental retardation (IQ &amp;lt;50) occurs in about 10% (3 or 4 per 1,000 persons) and mild mental retardation (IQ 50 to 70) in 90%. 2. The high familial occurrence, the continuously variable phenotype shading into normality, and various genetic studies suggest that most of mild mental retardation represents the left end of the normal IQ distribution curve. Virtually no such cases can be found in the group of the severely retarded, either within or outside the institutions, suggesting that the majority of severe mental retardation represents discontinuous phenotypes due to chromosomal, environmental, mendelian, and multifactorial causes. 3. Some mild mental retardation represents syndromal occurrence (ie, mild PKU, rubella syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome); however, in most cases no anomalies are found, chromosomes are normal, height and head circumference fall within normal limits, and few have neurologic deficits, such as cerebral palsy and/or seizures. In the mildly retarded, personal, emotional and psychosocial problems predominate. The severely retarded are a biologically different group with a high incidence of gross neurologic disturbances, growth failure, abnormal head circumference, single or multiple malformations, and metabolic diseases. 4. The severely retarded are generally infertile, the mild retarded less fertile than average; however, a small minority among the latter contributes a disproportionately large number of retarded offspring to the next generation. 5. Most mental retardation can be evaluated on an outpatient basis for causal, pathogenetic, and prognostic factors. The evaluation can be economic, quick, reliable, painless, and efficient in most instances; however, CNS degenerative diseases may require a brief inpatient stay for biochemical evaluation. By all odds the most informative items in the work-up of the retarded are the (family and past) history and the (physical and neurologic) examination. Metabolic screening is usually not indicated in the malformed, neither are cytogenetic studies in the nonmalformed. 6. All patients with mental retardation deserve a diagnostic/causal evaluation and their families prognostic/genetic counseling. 7. Some 70% of mental retardation in the general population can be attributed to genetic causes. Genetic counseling in severe mental retardation is to prevent recurrence in siblings; in the mildly retarded much greater emphasis is placed on the prevention of retarded offspring.",

      "abstract": "Task-specific tremor (TST) is a specific type of tremor that occurs when performing or attempting to perform a specific task, such as writing or playing a musical instrument. The clinical entity of TST remains heterogeneous. Some TSTs can only be induced by conducting a specific task, while others can be elicited when adopting a particular position simulating a task. The pathophysiology of TST is controversial. Whether TST is an isolated tremor syndrome, a spectrum of dystonic tremor syndrome (DTS), or essential tremor (ET) is not yet clear. Evidence from electrophysiological studies suggests that TST patients have normal reciprocal inhibition responses but abnormal motor cortical excitability, especially relating to the maladaptive long-interval intracortical inhibitory circuitry. The blink recovery study and eyeblink classical conditioning studies demonstrated possible hyperexcitability of the brainstem circuits and cerebellar dysfunction in patients with TST. Functional MRI studies have further shown that patients with TST have reduced functional connectivity in the cerebellum, similar to patients with DTS and ET. Due to variable methodologies and the sparsity of functional MRI studies in TST, it remains uncertain if patients with TST share the connectivity abnormalities between the cortical or subcortical areas that have been demonstrated in patients with DTS. Comprehensive electrophysiological and functional neuroimaging studies may help to elucidate the pathophysiology of TST.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury is an injury which can temporarily or permanently damage the brain function. Brain trauma has a relatively poor prognosis and such patients will often have reduced work ability and a high possibility to stay temporarily or permanently disabled. That is why such injuries are a major public health issue since even less severe brain injuries can result in permanent neuropsychological disorders that affect work ability and quality of life. Traumatic injury can be divided into two phases, primary and secondary. Primary injury is the result of the mechanical force that acts upon the head and brain structures. The development of secondary injury begins after the emergence of the primary and lasts for several days. During this period the damage increases and it is of vital importance to try to reduce the extent of the damage to the affected tissue. Hyperoxia is defined as a greater than normal oxygen percent in the tissues and organs, caused by increased delivery of oxygen or increased percentage o fit in the arterial blood. It can be achieved in normobaric and hyperbaric conditions. Normobaric hyperoxia is achieved under atmospheric conditions, whereas hyperbaric is achieved at pressures higher than atmospheric.\r\nIn the treatment of traumatic brain injury, the main goal is to preserve brain function and reduce the extent of tissue damage. Most important thing is, except ICP control, to maintain proper tissue perfusion and to provide aerobic metabolism. Studies have shown that hyperoxia leads to improved oxygenation and increased aerobic metabolism of injured tissue. In conclusion, further research in this area is needed in order to clearly identify groups of patients that should be recommended for hyperoxia treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Capacity assessments are performed when there is suspicion that a person is unable to adequately care for their physical, medical, or financial well‐being. The purpose of these assessments is to inform the legal system as to whether or not guardianship may be necessary. It is well established that certain mental illnesses, such as neurocognitive disorders (dementia) or psychotic disorders (like schizophrenia), may diminish capacity and, in some cases, lead to the need for establishment of a legal guardian. However, personality disorders are another common category of mental illness which may impair decision‐making. There is very little information in the literature about how or why these disorders could impair capacity, and thus, it can often be difficult to discern whether clients with personality disorders are substantially unable to care for themselves—versus unwilling to act in a way contrary to their ingrained habits. We present a series of three cases in which clients are determined to lack capacity primarily mediated by a personality disorder diagnosis. They are demonstrated to have mild deficits in cognitive functioning, but they show impaired decision‐making out of proportion to these deficits. In all three cases, it is apparent that the personality disorder is substantially impairing their ability to care for themselves. Discussion includes consideration for ways to incorporate evaluations of cognitive function, activities of daily living, and personality considerations into capacity assessments, and how to approach recommendations (such as guardianship vs. less restrictive option) based on both level and scope of impairment.",

The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

      "abstract": "Thyroid hormone is essential for the growth and maturation of many target tissues, including the brain and skeleton. As a result, abnormalities of thyroid gland function in infancy and childhood result not only in the metabolic consequences of thyroid dysfunction seen in adult patients, but in unique effects on the growth and /or maturation of these thyroid hormone-dependent tissues as well. In most instances, there are critical windows of time for thyroid hormone-dependent development and so the specific clinical consequence of thyroid dysfunction depends on the age of the infant or child. For example, newborn infants with congenital hypothyroidism frequently have hyperbilirubinemia, and delayed skeletal maturation, reflecting immaturity of liver and bone, respectively, and they are at risk of permanent mental retardation if thyroid hormone therapy is delayed or inadequate; their size at birth, however, is normal. In contrast, hypothyroidism that develops after the age of three years (when most thyroid hormone-dependent brain development is complete) is characterized predominantly by a deceleration in linear growth and skeletal maturation but there is no permanent effect on cognitive development. In general, infants with severe defects in thyroid gland development or inborn errors of thyroid hormonogenesis present in infancy whereas babies with less severe defects or acquired abnormalities, particularly autoimmune thyroid disease, present later in childhood and adolescence. In the newborn infant , thyroid function is influenced not only by the neonate ’ s own thyroid gland but by the transplacental passage from the mother of factors that affect the fetal thyroid gland.",

Flat head syndrome, or plagiocephaly, because the condition is medically known, occurs when a flat spot develops on the back part or lateral side of a child's head. Positional plagiocephaly occurs whenexternal forces acts unevenly on the developing child's skull. This can occur during fetal life, but most of the cases of positional plagiocephaly develops after birth/delivery. Its incidence and prevalence among the population has increased considerably in recent years, and its repercussions can extend to the medium-long term, implying that, every day, there is more research on its approach and the effectiveness of different treatment modalities. Kinetic treatment has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of plagiocephaly, especially since neck stiffness is often the primary cause of plagiocephaly, whether it is related to birth or uterine position, early treatment may be fundamental.",

Sleep disorders are one of the most common clinical problems encountered in outpatient settings and inpatient settings. Lack of sleep can lead to the inability to concentrate, memory complaints, and deficits in neuropsychological testing. Additionally, sleep disorders can have serious consequences, including fatal accidents related to sleepiness. Disturbed sleep can be a primary diagnosis itself or a component of another medical or psychiatric disorder. Narcolepsy is plausibly caused by an abnormality of REM-inhibiting mechanisms, and recent research involving hypocretin, a neurotransmitter, suggests that hypocretin is significantly reduced in narcolepsy patients. Patients with delayed and advanced sleep phase insomnia can be treated with proper timing of bright light and behavioral changes. Hypersomnia related to a mental disorder is usually found in a variety of conditions such as the early stages of mild depressive disorder, grief, personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and somatoform disorders.",

MDD is characterised by periods of depressed mood and/or loss of interest or pleasure that lasts at least two weeks. These symptoms are accompanied by a number of somatic symptoms (changes in sleep, libido, energy and vigour, appetite and psychomotor function, etc) as well as cognitive symptoms (feelings of worthlessness, concentration or decision making difficulty, poor concentration and suicidal thoughts) that cause clinically significant distress or impairment of everyday functionality.",

Directly age-related changes have to be distinguished from indirect modifications which are caused by simultaneous thyroidal or non-thyroidal illness or other physiological or pathophysiological states whose incidence increases with age. In summary, direct changes of the hypothalmo-pituitary-thyroid axis seem to be subtle and suggestive of a decreased hypothalamic stimulation of thyroid function. In parallel, disease-specific alterations such as the development of thyroid autonomy or changes in energy intake or sleep lead to pronounced alterations of thyroid function with age which may dominate the underlying ageing of the hypothalmo-pituitary thyroid axis itself. The following article attempts to delineate some aspects of the interplay of the regulation of thyroid function and the ageing process.",

      "abstract": "IntroduçãoA trombose venosa cerebral (TVC) é uma forma rara de acidente vascular cerebral, mais prevalente entre as mulheres. Seu diagnóstico, muitas vezes, é desafio clínico devido aos seus variados padrões de apresentação; por essa razão, pode ser negligenciado não apenas por médicos gerais, mas também em alguns casos por neurologistas. Vários sintomas, incluindo dor de cabeça grave, visão anormal, desmaio ou perda de consciência, fraqueza da face, membros e convulsões podem ocorrer. Embora possa ser apresentada com diferentes sintomas neurológicos, na TVC normalmente não ocorrem alucinações.Relato de CasoUm homem saudável de 59 anos foi internado com queixas de episódios recorrentes de dor de cabeça no último mês e subsequentes alucinações visuais, especificamente prosooometamorfopsia - ele relatou ter visto imagens distorcidas de rostos e objetos. Não foi associado a nenhuma reclamação sensorial ou motora. O exame médico e neurológico geral na admissão estava intacto, incluindo estado mental, exame fundoscópico, nervos cranianos, motor, sensorial, coordenação e reflexos. Ele não tinha meningismo. O exame de sangue revelou uma alteração na proteína C-reativa (9,4 mg/L) e o líquido cefalorraquidiano apresentou apenas pleocitose linfocítica. Realizada a tomografia computadorizada de crânio que mostrou uma lesão cortical hipodensa mal definida na região temporal e occipital direita. A ressonância magnética confirmou a presença de trombose venosa cerebral nos seios sigmoides e transversais. Paciente foi tratado com heparina de baixo peso molecular seguido de varfarina, mas as alucinações visuais permaneceram. Optou-se por iniciar corticosteroide. Após excelente recuperação dos sintomas, em uma investigação mais aprofundada para trombofilias, ele foi considerado positivo para a mutação no gene da protrombina. O paciente assinou o Termo de Consentimento Livre e Esclarecido e foram utilizados apenas prontuários médicos para a elaboração desse relato.ConclusãoPor essa razão, as ilusões devem ser adicionadas ao já amplo espectro de apresentação clínica da trombose venosa cerebral. Esse diagnóstico pode ser considerado, ainda, em pacientes que apresentam alucinações auditivas e visuais súbitas, particularmente no contexto de cefaleia e com fatores de risco convencionais para trombose venosa cerebral.",

      "title": "HAND SURGERY IN CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY",
      "abstract": "Pediatric hand surgery in general requires special considerations and this is even more true when planning surgery in children with CP. It is important for the surgeon to realize that the functional problems these children exhibit have their cause in a brain damage which is not amenable to hand surgical treatment. Therefore it is crucial to carefully analyze each child’s impairment including the voluntary motor control and the child’s specific needs before endeavoring into surgery. Associated impairments, such as mental retardation, nutritional problems, epilepsy, dystonia or severe sensory deficits may influence decision-making, but the crucial factor is often the child’s own wish for an improved function. A child that completely neglects his or her extremity is usually not helped by surgery, at least not in an attempt to get a better hand function. Hand surgery in CP mainly comes down to three techniques: 1. Reducing strength in spastic muscles by release operation, either at the origin of the muscle, at the insertion or as a fractional lengthening at the musculo-tendinous junction, 2. Increasing strength in weak antagonists by tendon transfer or 3. Stabilizing joints through an arthrodesis or a tenodesis. Most often a combination of these techniques is used. Almost all hand surgeons in this field have acquired their personal choice of procedures and scientific support for the benefits of the different techniques is scarce. My personal arsenal will be described in the panel but includes biceps-brachialis muscle release at the elbow, pronator teres rerouting, flexor carpi ulnaris to extensor carpi radialis brevis (Green’s) transfer and adductor pollicis muscle release in the palm combined with extensor pollicis longus rerouting for the thumb-in-palm deformity. In my mind, it is not most important which tendon transfer that is selected, but the choice of which child to operate and at what age. It is also important to tension the tendon transfers exactly right and to plan the postoperative treatment properly. The surgeon should, of course, also make sure that the child’s and the parent’s expectations on the results are realistic. Botulinum toxin A has now been used for several years in the treatment of children with cerebral palsy and the drug has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing muscle tone both in the lower and the upper extremities. It has been more difficult to show effects on hand function especially in the long-term perspective. I will present our treatment protocol for botulinum toxin injections. In 1994, a population-based health care program for children with CP was started in Lund in southern Sweden. All children in our region with a diagnosis of CP, born after Jan 1st 1990 are invited to follow the program which includes regular measurements of range of motion in extremity joints, standardized radiographic examinations of the hip joints and registration of surgery and spasticity treatments. The program, called CPUP has been very successful in the prevention of spastic hip dislocation, wind swept position and contractures. Some early results from the upper extremity part of CPUP will be presented. We believe that the program in time will give us valuable information on the natural course of joint motion and impairment of hand function in children with CP.",

      "title": "Chronic Migraine, Classification, Differential Diagnosis, and Epidemiology",
      "abstract": "( Headache 2011;51;S2:77‐83) Chronic migraine (CM) is the most disabling of the 4 types of primary chronic daily headache (CDH) of long duration, a syndrome defined by primary headaches 15 or more days per month for at least 3 months with attacks that last 4 hours or more per day on average. CDH of long duration includes CM, chronic tension‐type headache, new daily persistent headache, and hemicrania continua. CM affects approximately 2% of the adult population in Western countries, imposing substantial burdens on individual sufferers and their families and, more broadly, upon society. Although this disorder is highly disabling and prevalent, it remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated. Diagnosing CM requires a systematic approach that includes these steps: (1) exclude a secondary headache disorder, and (2) diagnose a specific primary headache syndrome based on frequency and duration, for example, short‐duration episodic, long‐duration episodic, or long‐duration chronic. CM usually develops as a complication of episodic migraine after a period of increasing headache frequency. This migraine transformation is associated with a number of risk factors, some of which cannot be modified, including age and race. Other risk factors for CM are modifiable, such as obesity, snoring, head injury, stressful life events, and overuse of opioids and barbiturates. However, risk factor modification has not yet been shown to decrease the likelihood of CM onset. According to a cross‐sectional analysis of data from the American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention study published this year in Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry , when compared to patients with episodic migraine, patients with CM were significantly less likely to be employed full‐time and almost twice as likely to be occupationally disabled. In addition, patients with CM were nearly twice as likely to have anxiety, chronic pain, or depression. Furthermore, patients with CM had higher cardiovascular and respiratory risk, were 40% more likely to have heart disease and angina, and were 70% more likely to have a history of stroke. These findings highlight the paramount importance of clinical vigilance, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate, effective management – including treatment or referrals – to improve patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

The severity of disease can be described in many different ways, ranging from the patient’s perception, the degree of physiological disturbance, the consequent disability, and handicap caused, to the burden on society (Stein et al. 1987). The severity of a stroke may be assessed in terms of the amount of brain damaged, the size of the lesion(s) demonstrated on CT scanning, or the number and severity of the neurological impairments. At the level of disability, the severity of a stroke may be measured by ability to walk, the ability to climb stairs, or the ability for self-care. At the level of handicap, severity may be measured by impact on work, enjoyment of usual sex life, or social engagement. The aetiological and pathogenetic differences between types of stroke, together with the wide range of possible consequences, make a simple classification of severity difficult.",

      "abstract": "Istifragh or tanqiya-e-badan (body waste clearance) is an important therapeutic modality, prevalent in Unani System of Medicine, applied to treat various chronic diseases. Brain, like other parts of the body, needs to maintain homeostasis to function properly, and that requires continuous removal of toxic wastes. Brain possesses specific waste disposal system. The glymphatic system serves as a brain waste disposal system. BBB also facilitates the efflux of toxic metabolites out of the brain.The brain’s waste consists of metabolites, and proteins such as amyloid- beta, tau and alpha- synuclein proteins etc., which can form aggregates that are deleterious to brain. Sleep deprivation , aging and many other brain pathologies (i.e. stroke, ischemia, tumour, injury etc.) may disrupt glymphatic function. Some non-pharmacological therapeutic modalities such as exercise, sleep, sleeping posture, intermittent fasting and dietary regimens (omega-3 fatty acids, resveratrol etc.) are powerful drivers of glymphatic transport. Unani herbal drug, Ustukhuddus (Lavandula stoechas L.) is also used for istifragh-e-dimagh or tanqiya-e-dimagh in Unani System of Medicine since long time.This review addresses current scientific knowledge regarding understanding and significance of Istifragh-e-dimagh with special reference to prevention and / or treatment of chronic neurodegenerative diseases.",

A much higher number of lawyers likely fall on the languishing end of the mental health spectrum. If you are languishing, you may be at a higher risk of sliding into impairment. Mental health is assessed on a continuum, ranging from languishing to flourishing. Languishing has been described as feeling uninspired, joyless, and lacking the power to function at full capacity. And languishing may increase your risk of mental illness, such as major depressive episode, generalized anxiety, panic attacks, or substance use disorder. Lawyers may suffer from several obstacles to mental strength, including lack of self-awareness, perfectionism, imposter syndrome, social comparisons, trained pessimism, inability to regulate emotions, and inauthenticity from a failure to understand or leverage their temperament and personality strengths. Features of the lawyering culture may augment these obstacles and lead to lawyer languishing.",

In later life, insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common. Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described. Good sleep should be understood as a substrate for psychological health and a reasonable expectation in later life.",

High rates of burnout have been observed in a wide range of professions, including healthcare and teaching; burnout has also been observed in unpaid work such as caregiving and parenting. Burnout is associated with reduced work performance and poor self-image, in addition to adverse mental and physical health outcomes ranging from major depressive disorder to type 2 diabetes. Burnout may influence health outcomes primarily via changes in health behaviors, such as increased alcohol consumption, but some evidence suggests that burnout can impact health independently of health behaviors. While the physiological underpinnings of burnout remain poorly understood, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation and changes in DNA methylation patterns may be involved. Various interventions to reduce or prevent burnout have been tested; while mindfulness- and exercise-based interventions appear promising, results have been inconsistent. Further prospective research using higher-quality designs is needed to improve the scientific understanding of the causes and consequences of burnout.",

      "title": "Psychiatry",
      "abstract": "Psychiatry is a speciality of medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and study of mental diseases or disorders. Its practitioners are psychiatrists (in the United States, physicians who complete four years of approved training following their 148graduation from medical school). A number of professionals from other disciplines treat patients with psychiatric disorders. The most important of these are clinical psychologists, psychiatric social workers and psychiatric nurses. They commonly refer to those who seek help as 'clients' rather than 'patients'. These professionals may work in various collaborative relationships with psychiatrists or as independent practitioners. They employ the same verbal therapies as psychiatrists. Psychiatry differs from these specialities in being a medical discipline whose practitioners are physicians. As such, psychiatrists are specifically trained to (1) make precise syndromal or aetiological diagnoses, whenever possible, and distinguish one syndrome from another; (2) diagnose (or know when to refer to other physicians) those organic conditions which mimic psychiatric disorders such as brain tumour, cancer of the pancreas, and hyperthyroidism (these conditions can present as anxiety or depressive disorders); (3) treat particular psychiatric disorders with psychotropic medications or other somatic treatments; (4) manage untoward psychological reactions to medical illness; and (5) integrate the biological with the psychological and social dimensions of mental disorders. In addition, the psychiatrist's training in medicine may encourage a research career in the biology of mental disorders. American psychiatrists as a whole have a high level of expertise in psychological treatments, particularly the psychodynamic approach. This is due to the impact of psychoanalytic theory on academic psychiatry especially since 1945, when many distinguished psychoanalysts assumed the chairs of academic departments.",

This statement may be true in the sense that the mood of depression may occur in almost any mental illness; but it cannot be true in the sense that the depressive syndrome may enter into almost any mental illness, since the term depressive syndrome has already, at least by implication, been used to denote a particular symptom:sign cluster which differentiates it from all other symptom:sign clusters.

HIPOTESI: Les alteracions neurosensorials vinculades a la ST son degudes a les alteracions cromosomiques que presenten aquestes pacients, i varien segons el grau d’afectacio cariotipica. Els efectes produits per l’hipoestrogenisme congenit son reversibles amb terapia hormonal substitutiva. OBJECTIUS: Definir el tipus i la causa de la hipoacusia descrita en dones amb ST a l’edat adulta, aixi com esbrinar si existeixen alteracions olfactories i gustatives associades a aquesta sindrome. Demostrar que pacients amb altres hipogonadismes congenits sense alteracio cariotipica no presenten aquestes comorbiditats. METODOLOGIA: es va dissenyar un estudi analitic observacional de tres cohorts independents, amb dones entre 20 i 50 anys: dones amb ST; dones amb altres hipogonadismes congenits i cariotip normal; i un grup control amb dones sanes que prenien contracepcio hormonal. Les dones amb hipogonadismes es tractaven amb terapia hormonal substitutiva. Es van recollir dades cliniques, presencia d’estigmes fisics de la ST i antecedents de comorbiditats associades. Les pacients van omplir dos questionaris, un de qualitat de vida (SF-36) i l’altre de sexualitat (FSFI). Per a estudiar l’audicio, es va realitzar una microotoscopia, una audiometria estandard, i uns potencials evocats auditius als hipogonadismes. Amb el test validat BAST-24 es va avaluar la sensibilitat i sensorialitat olfactoria i la gustometria. RESULTATS: Una perdua auditiva progressiva precoc s’associa a la ST, essent l’hipoacusia neurosensorial el patro mes frequent en les dones adultes. L’etiologia d’aquesta hipoacusia es heterogenia, i l’edat, la genetica i l’antecedent d’otitis mitjana cronica recurrent durant la infancia son factors influents. Existeixen alteracions de sensorialitat olfactoria associades a la ST, de fisiopatologia desconeguda. Malgrat que la sensibilitat olfactoria no sembla afectada en aquestes pacients, les hormones sexuals tenen un paper en la percepcio de la intensitat i la irritabilitat de les olors. No semblen existir alteracions en el sentit del gust en les pacients amb ST i altres hipogonadismes congenits. Les pacients amb ST i altres hipogonadismes congenits presenten pitjors puntuacions ens els dominis fisics dels questionaris de qualitat de vida, comparades amb controls sans. Nomes la meitat de les dones amb ST refereixen mantenir qualsevol tipus d’activitat sexual i, les sexualment actives, nomes puntuen baix en el domini d’excitacio. La funcio sexual no es correlaciona amb les caracteristiques fisiques o les comorbiditats associades a la ST, tot i que les dones sexualment actives presenten alcades superiors. Les dones amb altres hipogonadismes congenits presenten puntuacions baixes en gairebe tots els dominis de la funcio sexual, malgrat el tractament hormonal. El cultiu de cel•lules urotelials a partir de mostres d’orina presenta dificultats i limitacions tecniques, a mes d’una perdua d’informacio cromosomica que empitjora la seva correlacio amb el fenotip. Existeix una correlacio parcial entre el cariotip en sang i el fenotip. IMPLICACIONS CLINIQUES: - Cal comptar fins a 50 metafases en els estudis citogenetics en sospita de fallida ovarica. - Cal fer audiometries periodiques a la ST durant l’edat adulta. - Cal investigar la qualitat de vida i la funcio sexual de les pacients amb hipogonadismes. - Es recomana que les pacients amb hipogonadismes congenits es visitin en unitats especialitzades.",

      "abstract": "On the basis of several studies, some psychophysiological activation abnormalities in schizophrenia are explained. These abnormalities give rise to at least three therapeutic aims: (1) As some psychophysiological systems may be under- and others overaroused in schizophrenic patients compared to normal controls, therapeutic interventions should approach the systems selectively. (2) The ability to modulate the psychophysiological activation, which is diminished in schizophrenic patients, should be improved. (3) Schizophrenic patients need a more differentiated perception of their own state of activation. These aims contrast somewhat with past therapeutic studies, which tried to change activation for the purpose of tension reduction. It seems advisable to link basic psychophysiological research more closely to the development of therapies.",

It differs from fatigue induced by other causes, because doesn't decrease after period of rest. The fatigue reported by cancer patients is usually described as an unusual, excessive, whole-body experience that is disproportionate or unrelated to activity or exertion and is not relieved by rest or sleep. Cancer related fatigue is multidimensional, subjective experience that has profoundly negative effect on patients' quality of life. Fatigue today is the most commonly reported symptom, for some patients the most unpleasant symptom, and the most distressing side-effect in connection with cancer and/or its treatment. The prevalence of fatigue in patients receiving anti-cancer treatment has been estimated to be more than 80 per cent. The fatigue can be pervasive: patients report that fatigue begins with treatment, continues during the course of chemotherapy or radiation treatment, and declines somewhat--but frequently sustains at a higher-than-baseline rate- after treatment is over. It may also persist for several years even in patients with no apparent disease. Despite of the prevalence of fatigue and its profoundly negative effect on patients quality of life, little is known about the specific mechanisms that underline fatigue in cancer patients or how to prevent it and treat it effectively.",

A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.",

On estime ainsi qu’entre un et deux tiers des épisodes dépressifs majeurs ne répondront pas à un premier antidépresseur prescrit. Mais avant de parler d’inefficacité d’un traitement, il est important d’évaluer certains aspects susceptibles d’entraver l’efficacité de ce dernier. Un examen clinique complet ainsi que certains examens complémentaires (TSH par exemple) seront dans un premier temps nécessaires afin de d’éliminer une pathologie organique responsable d’une symptomatologie dépressive, qui pourra régresser une fois cette pathologie traitée. Une cause iatrogène médicamenteuse devra aussi être éliminée, ainsi qu’une cause toxique (abus de substances). L’entretien clinique nous permettra ensuite de confirmer le diagnostic d’épisode dépressif majeur et de son évolution sous traitement, ainsi que d’éliminer des diagnostics psychiatriques différentiels (un trouble bipolaire par exemple) ou certaines comorbidités psychiatriques, tels qu’un trouble de la personnalité. Après s’être assuré que la posologie prescrite et la durée de traitement antidépresseur sont adéquates, l’un des critères fondamentaux à évaluer est l’observance du traitement prescrit. Il est de plus indispensable d’évaluer le contexte de vie et les facteurs de stress parfois responsables d’une chronicisation de la symptomatologie dépressive. Il est donc nécessaire de prendre le temps d’évaluer globalement la situation pour s’assurer que le traitement antidépresseur mis en place est réellement inefficace, avant de passer à une autre stratégie thérapeutique.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex clinical phenomenon. (Raji) The classic designations of mild, moderate, or severe TBI are based on the acute clinical presentation and do not necessarily predict the long-term outcome. The long held assumption that the mild forms of this condition recover rapidly and without consequence is not supported by more recent literature. The effects of several mechanisms for TBI lead to neurophysiological changes, cellular depolarization, and apoptosis that occur on a continuum and can progress over a protracted period of time. Mild TBI (mTBI), particularly repetitive mild TBI, can create neuropathology that contributes to long-term increases in morbidity and mortality. People with TBI have an increased risk of death by suicide (3-4 times greater), higher suicide attempts and suicide ideation. (Simpson) Repetitive mild TBI, also known as ‘‘repetitive concussion,’’ can lead to a progressive deposition of tau protein in neural tissues (tauopathy), now known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). At this point this is an irreversible and deadly condition.\r\nThe diagnosis of TBI, particularly mild TBI (mTBI), remains a challenge clinically. There is overlap between the symptoms of mild TBI and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Symptoms can include headache, dizziness, irritability, sleep disturbances, sensitivity to light and noise, impulsivity, judgment problems, visual disturbances, emotional outbursts, depression, and anxiety. \r\nImaging using MRI, neuroimaging, is one focus to identify changes in brain function. Changes in brain structure are a late change in most neurological disorders, such as dementia. Structural changes able to be seen on MRI are frequently insensitive to the earliest changes seen in disease progression. \r\nIn TBI, a recent study showed that changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) preceded changes in MRI diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). CBF abnormalities persist even in chronic TBI. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) can identify early changes in neurological diseases through regional CBF. This may be predictive of damage. But, SPECT is not widely available, expensive and not covered by insurance.\r\nIt’s actually likely, given the limitations of every technology, that multiple approaches are necessary to produce a complete picture.",

      "abstract": "A head injury can be broadly defined as an acute traumatic insult to the head by an external force.While any part of the head can be injured in this way, the focus of this chapter is injuries to the scalp, skull, brain parenchyma, and their associated anatomic structures. Acute head injuries thus covers a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from benign contusions to intracranial hemorrhage, whichmay result in increased intracranial pressure, brainstem herniation, and death. The term traumatic brain injury (TBI) has also been used to encompass the alteration in brain function resulting from a blunt or penetrating force to the head, manifesting as confusion, altered level of consciousness, seizure, coma, or focal sensory or motor neurologic deficit. Head injuries can be classified in many different ways. Isolated injuries to the scalp, skull, and brain can and do occur. However, injuries to more than one structure are commonly encountered. As such, a system of classifying injuries solely on the basis of anatomic location lacks clinical utility. Similarly, classifying injuries on the basis of mechanism (e.g. ‘‘blunt vs. penetrating’’) fails to define head injuries in a clinically meaningful way, as each type of mechanism does not exclusively result in either an open or closed head injury. Therefore, one should not assume that a given mechanism of injury is consistently synonymous with a particular type of injury incurred. Distinguishing open from closed head injuries is another system that is commonly used. Open head injuries occur when blunt or penetrating trauma transgress the scalp and skull, exposing the brain to the external environment. By definition, all open head injuries require emergent neurosurgical consultation. With closed head injuries, on the other hand, the traumatic sequelae or the condition of the intracranial contents may not be readily apparent. Care of these patients will depend on their clinical condition and may also depend on the results of diagnostic imaging. In summary, no single classification system captures all the relevant clinical information of head injuries. The most clinically useful method of categorizing head injuries incorporates elements of all these systems, and includes an assessment of clinical neurologic status (e.g. GlasgowComaScale).",

La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico.

Continuous deep sedation predictably suppresses brainstem vital centers and shortens life. Continuous deep sedation remains controversial as palliation for existential suffering and in elective death requests by discontinuation of chronic ventilation or circulatory support with mechanical devices. Continuous deep sedation contravenes the double-effect principle because: (1) it induces permanent coma (intent of action) for the contingency relief of suffering and for social isolation (desired outcomes) and (2) because of its predictable and proportional life-shortening effect. Continuous deep sedation should be distinguished from common sedation practices for palliation and characterized instead as physician-assisted death.",

      "abstract": "Dementia is an increasing global issue, currently affecting an estimated 50 million people worldwide. This number is predicted to increase to 82 million by the year 2030, due to the ageing global population. Theoretically,\r\npreventing late-onset dementia may seem extremely difficult as the greatest risk factor, age, is unmodifiable.\r\nHowever, it is estimated that a third of dementia cases could potentially be prevented or delayed by removing\r\nor reducing modifiable risk factors. Increasing evidence suggests that chronic stress, which may arise from\r\nexperiencing a traumatic event or daily stress, may be a potential risk factor for dementia. Whilst it may not play\r\na vital role in causing the syndrome, stress may contribute to the progression of cognitive decline, which is the\r\nmain symptom of dementia. The primary stress hormone, cortisol, may have detrimental effects on cognitive\r\nbrain regions when its levels are elevated for long durations. Preliminary evidence suggests that stress may\r\nhave different effects on brain structure and function, depending on the individual’s age when exposed to the\r\nstress. Stress during early and later life may lead to more permanent brain changes, which may contribute to\r\ncognitive decline in later life. Limited evidence links chronic stress or major trauma at specific stages of the\r\nlifespan, with cognitive decline and incidence of dementia. Whether or not an accumulation of stress across\r\nthe lifespan influences later life cognition and risk of dementia, still remains to be determined. Understanding\r\nto what extent stressful events are risk factors for later-life cognitive decline and dementia will be crucial to the\r\nimplementation of targeted psychosocial interventions efforts.",

Other systems base ratings by physical findings or diagnosis. Criteria for posttraumatic headache are proposed in the form of a mnemonic: IMPAIRMENT. Intensity, Medication use, Physical signs/symptoms, Adjustment, Incapacitation, Recreation, Miscellaneous activity of daily living, Employment, Number (frequency), Time (duration of attacks). Each are scored from 0 to 2 points. There are three physician modifiers, scored from 0 to -4 points: Motivation for treatment, Overexaggeration or overconcern, Degree of legal interest. Case examples will illustrate how impairment ratings are determined, along with further details on scoring. Proposed criteria for posttraumatic headache impairment are understandable, easy to utilize and reproducible.",

Survivors need time to process grief longer than the others due to the lingering guilt related to the 'failure' to save the suicide victim. One of the psychiatric disorders that appears comorbid with this grief is major depression, especially major depression with psychosis. This research is a case study of how empty chair therapy can be applied to suicide survivors who experience depression with psychosis. The results showed that empty chair therapy was able to help participants identify the source of unfinished business which caused participants to feel guilty and harbor it, risking one to suicidal ideation and auditory hallucinations. Empty chair therapy was also able to facilitate participants to channel feelings of guilt and help gain a new perspective on the situation through changing roles in therapy.Penyintas bunuh diri merupakan anggota keluarga atau teman dekat yang mengalami kehilangan sosok yang dicintai akibat bunuh diri. Penyintas membutuhkan waktu untuk memproses kedukaan lebih lama daripada sosok lainnya akibat rasa bersalah yang berkaitan dengan ‘kegagalan’ menyelamatkan sosok terkait. Salah satu gangguan psikiatri yang muncul komorbid dengan kedukaan ini adalah depresi mayor, terkhusus depresi mayor dengan psikotik. Penelitian ini merupakan studi kasus penerapan terapi kursi kosong pada penyintas bunuh diri yang mengalami depresi dengan psikotik melalui single case method dengan desain penelitian A-B yang mengukur perbedaan perilaku sebelum dan sesudah intervensi.. Hasil menunjukkan bahwa terapi kursi kosong mampu membantu partisipan untuk mengidentifikasi sumber unfinished business yang menyebabkan partisipan merasa bersalah dan memendamnya sehingga memunculkan ide bunuh diri dan halusinasi auditori. Terapi kursi kosong juga mampu memfasilitasi partisipan untuk menyalurkan perasaan bersalah dan membantu mendapatkan perspektif baru dari situasi tersebut melalui perubahan peran dalam terapi.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

Osim ostecenja dijelova tijela, nakon politraume osoba može imati i traumatsku ozljedu mozga koja ce utjecati na oporavak i daljnje funkcioniranje bolesnika, ovisno o stupnju i težini ozljede. Bolesnik nakon politraume zahtijeva dugotrajnu hospitalizaciju i lijecenje te samim time dugotrajnu ili cak i trajnu promjenu životnih navika. Psiholoski ucinak ozljede ukljucuje razvoj akutnih i dugorocnih mentalnih problema kao sto su posttraumatski stres, depresija i anksioznost. Posttraumatski stresni poremecaj (PTSP) je najcesce istraživani problem mentalnog zdravlja nakon zadobivanja tjelesnih ozljeda. Prepoznavanje rane pojave poremecaja i ranih simptoma pružaju mogucnosti za rano otkrivanje i prevenciju. Anksioznost se također javlja kod preživjelih nakon politraume, a neki karakteristicni simptomi anksioznosti ukljucuju povecano uzbuđenje i fizicke simptome kao sto su tahikardija, tahipneja i suhoca sluznice usta. Osnovna patofiziologija depresivnog poremecaja nije jasno definirana. Postojeci dokazi upucuju na složenu interakciju između neurotransmitera i regulacije receptora te osjetljivosti koja leži u pozadini afektivnih simptoma. Iako su manje proucavane, posljedice depresije nakon traumatske ozljede ukljucuju povecane stope poremecaja i problema s rehabilitacijom, a za one s istovremenom ozljedom mozga, posljedice depresije ukljucuju vece interpersonalne poteskoce, vece stope nezaposlenosti, vece razine boli i umora. Uloga medicinske sestre kod bolesnika s psihickim poremecajima nakon politraume je prepoznati simptome koji dovode do određenog poremecaja, te provođenje intervencija prema odredbi lijecnika, uz stvaranje empatijskog odnosa prema bolesniku te pružanje sigurnosti i emocionalne potpore.",

Since fibromyalgia patients do not usually look ill and on superficial examination appear strong, complaints of difficulty performing the job can be hard to believe. This chapter will review definitions as they apply to disability, impairments reported in fibromyalgia patients, and constructive approaches that allow individuals with the syndrome to work most effectively. The World Health Organization defines disability as a limitation of function that compromises the ability to perform an activity within a range considered normal. Efforts to manage work disabilities consider issues such as age, sex, level of education, psychological profile, past attainments, motivation, retraining prospects, and social support systems. Additionally, work disability issues take into account work-related self-esteem, motivation, stress, fatigue, personal value systems, and availability of financial compensation. An impairment is an anatomic, physiologic, or psychological loss that leads to disability. Impairments include pain from work activities (e.g., heavy lifting), emotional stress (e.g., working in a complaint department), or muscle dysfunction (e.g., cerebral palsy).",

The duration of loss of consciousness is usually 20–30 seconds, after which the person regains consciousness on his own. After fainting, there may be a feeling of general weakness, feelings of weakness, fatigue, and the occurrence of retrograde amnesia is characteristic for older people. In the vast majority of cases, syncopal conditions are of reflex origin, and only about 15 % of fainting are associated with pathology of the central nervous and cardiovascular systems.

      "abstract": "Myotonia dystrophica is a familial disease, transmitted by an autosomal dominant gene with incomplete penetrance and variable expression. It is found most frequently in young adults of both sexes (Thomasen, 1948; Welsh et al., 1964), but can begin from childhood (Dodge et al., 1965). The main symptoms are myotonia, i.e. the continued active contraction of a muscle persisting after the cessation of voluntary effort or stimulation, and weakness and wasting of voluntary muscles. The disease affects mainly the muscles of hands and feet, as well as the facial, ocular and oropharyngeal muscles. The most telling symptom of myotonia is a slowness of relaxation after a forceful contraction such as a handshake. The electromyographic pattern of the involved muscles is characterized by bursts of fibrillation-like potentials, elicited by insertion of the recording needle, by a slight voluntary effort or by muscle percussion (Fig. 200A). Their frequency is high at the beginning and then decreases, giving the characteristic dive-bomber sound in the loudspeaker. The dystrophic process is manifested by the short duration and the weak amplitude of the action potentials, and by the increased number of polyphasic spikes (Dumotjlin and Aucremanne, 1959). Smooth muscles and cardiac muscle are also frequently involved. The esophagus is the most frequently affected gastrointestinal organ; stomach, small intestine, colon and gallbladder are less often abnormal. The muscles of the uterus and of the urinary bladder can also be weakened (Welsh et al., 1964; Schuman et al., 1965; Harvey et al., 1965; Goldberg and Sheft, 1972). Involvement of the internal anal sphincter is characterized by myotonic contraction instead of relaxation after rectal distension (Schuster et al., 1965). On histological examination, lesions of the smooth muscle cells are found whereas the intramural nerve plexuses seem to be intact (Goldberg and Sheft, 1972).",

By \"ordinary human intervention\" I mean those maneuvers involved in human give-and-take by which people understand and influence one another by using language, thinking, imagination, logic, and so on, as distinguished from \"nonhuman\" or magical attempts at solution, such as lo-bot-omy, electric shock treatment, burning of incense, and so on. The medical student's first practical learning experience, in which he glimpses the euphemistically named \"continuous-treatment\" ward of a mental hospital, is usually sufficient to indoctrinate him to the viewpoint of inexorableness. When evidence of an optimistic nature cannot be overlooked, it is still interpreted in the framework of rigidity; that is, favorable changes have occurred because the diagnosis of schizophrenia was incorrect, or else these changes have taken place<i>in spite of</i>an",

It is known that skin diseases may also cause sexual problems. Sexual activity remains important for most men throughout their adult lives and into old age. Impairment in their sexual experience can cause significant personal and interpersonal distress at any age. Sexual dysfunction in chronic systemic diseases has become a popular and important health concern in recent years. This subject is quite new in the specialty of dermatology.

There are many physiological changes in sleep such as fall in blood pressure, decrease in heart rate, reduction in pH of the blood, reduction in urine secretion, decrease in metabolic rate, slow and regular breathing, muscular relaxation and the disappearance of deep reflex actions, but almost any of these physiological changes may be absent in a sleep which is normal in all other respects. It is therefore more accurate to refer to the physiological accompaniments than to the physiology of sleep (Gillespie, 1929).",

It may have a beneficial, protective function to prevent exhaustion and overexertion. Sometimes fatigue can even be experienced as a pleasant feeling if it is of reasonable duration. On the other hand, fatigue as a pathological condition is always experienced as an ,unpleasant sensation. Asthenia is perceived as an unpleasant sensation whenever it exceeds one’s physiological resources, such as rest that must be recuperated. In a number of nontumor-associated conditions, asthenia, experienced as fatigue and/or weakness, is definitely a component or even a leading symptom (Table 9.1).",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

      "title": "Occurrence of Sick Euthyroid Syndrome in ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction and Their Prognostic Significance",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nSick euthyroid syndrome can be described as abnormal findings on thyroid\r\nfunction tests that occur in the setting of a nonthyroidal illness (NTI) without\r\npreexisting hypothalamic-pituitary and or thyroid gland dysfunction.\r\nA decreased level of serum total triiodothyronine (T3) is the most common thyroid\r\nfunction abnormality in patients with acute illness[14] and can be detected within 2\r\nhours after the onset of severe physical stress.[15] As the severity of illness\r\nprogresses, there is gradual development of a more complex syndrome associated\r\nwith low levels of T3 and thyroxine (T4). Levels of thyrotropin (TSH) remain\r\nunchanged or slightly reduced. The conversion of the pro-hormone (Thyroxine,\r\nT4) to the active form is reduced due to decreased 5’-deiodinase activity\r\nperipherally and production of reverse T3 (rT3), the inactive metabolite, is\r\nincreased.\r\nThese thyroid hormone changes may be mediated in part by cytokines or other\r\ninflammatory mediators, acting at the level of the hypothalamus and pituitary, the\r\nthyroid gland, and the hepatic deiodinase system, as well as on binding of\r\nthyroxine to thyroid binding globulin. (TBG)\r\nIt remains unresolved whether the hormone responses in the sick euthyroid\r\nsyndrome represent part of an adaptive response, which lowers tissue energy\r\nrequirements in the face of systemic illness, or a maladaptive response, which\r\ninduces damaging tissue hypothyroidism.\r\nConsequently, the use of thyroid hormone therapy in the sick euthyroid syndrome\r\nis controversial.\r\nRecovery from the underlying illness is accompanied by disappearance of the\r\nthyroid abnormalities.\r\nAltered thyroid hormone levels have been reported in starvation, acute and\r\nchronic medical illnesses, bone marrow transplantation, surgery,\r\ntrauma, myocardial infarction 4 and, in fact, can be seen in any severe systemic\r\nillness.\r\nThe more profound the changes in hormone pattern, the poorer the prognosis.\r\nSick euthyroid syndrome has also been demonstrated in acute myocardial\r\ninfarction and a correlation between the severity of the cardiac damage and the\r\ndegree of the change in thyroid hormones was postulated.\r\nThe aim of the present investigation is to study the occurrence of Sick Euthyroid\r\nsyndrome in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction and to evaluate\r\nwhether the presence of sick euthyroid syndrome in these patients have any\r\nprognostic significance in determining severity of AMI.\r\nAIMS & OBJECTIVES:\r\n1. To find out the occurrence of sick euthyroid syndrome in acute ST elevation\r\nmyocardial infarction patients admitted to the coronary care unit at the Government General Hospital, Chennai.\r\n2. To find out the prognostic significance of sick euthyroid syndrome positivity in\r\nacute ST elevation myocardial infarction patients admitted to the coronary care\r\nunit at the Government General Hospital, Chennai.\r\nMATERIALS & METHODS:\r\nSetting:\r\nThis study was conducted in the coronary care unit, GGH, Chennai in collaboration of institute of internal medicine, institute of Cardiology and institute\r\nof Biochemistry. It was a prospective study done during the period from January 2009 – October 2009 .50 patients with history, clinical features suggestive of ST elevation myocardial infarction were selected irrespective of age and sex.\r\nStudy Duration:\r\nThis study was conducted for a period of eight months from 1st January 2009 to October 30, 2009.\r\nStudy Design:\r\nTo find out the occurrence of sick euthyroid syndrome in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction patients and prognostic significance of sick euthyroid syndrome positivity in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction patients ; a single centre prospective cohort study.\r\nInclusion Criteria:\r\n1. Acute ST elevation myocardial infarction patients admitted to the coronary care unit.\r\nExclusion Criteria:\r\n1. Patients with past or present history of thyroid dysfunction.\r\n2. Patients taking drugs that will affect thyroid function.\r\n3. Patients with chronic renal failure.\r\n4. Patients with decompensated liver disease.\r\n5. Patients with thyroid function test suggestive of primary Hypothyroidism and Hyperthyroidism.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nOccurrence of sick euthyroid syndrome was common in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction patients.\r\nOur study shows that of 42% acute ST elevation myocardial infarction patients had sick euthyroid syndrome positivity.\r\nThe commonest abnormalities is found to be a low level of total T3 as demonstrated in our study where 71% of the patients had low level total T3.\r\nThe next most common abnormalities is found to be both low level of total T3 &total T4(24%)\r\nAs the severity of the illness increases sick euthyroid syndrome positivity rate was increased. (KILLIP 1 sick euthyroid syndrome positivity was 25%, in KILLIP 2\r\npatients positivity was 59%, in KILLIP 3 patients was 67% and KILLIP 4 patient was 100%. patients presented with LVEF 50 was 24%).\r\nThe degree of T3 decrease is proportional to the severity of cardiac damage and may have a possible prognostic value. (LVEF 50 Mean T3 level 0.9ng/ml).\r\nThe changes in the thyroid hormone status return to normal once the patient recovers from the critical illness.\r\nThough these patients have abnormalities in the thyroid hormone status they are clinically euthyroid.\r\nThyroid hormone system is rapidly down regulated in acute myocardial infarction.\r\nThis may be beneficial during acute ischemia.\r\nThe sick euthyroid syndrome positivity rate is proportional to the severity of cardiac damage (as evidenced by KILLIP class and Ejection fraction) and may have a possible prognostic value. Thus sick euthyroid syndrome positivity may contribute to the elaboration of an AMI severity index. The role of thyroid hormone replacement as a method of treatment of sick euthyroid syndrome is still controversial and there are no proper studies to recommend this. Treatment of underlying condition is the treatment of choice.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

He considered RLS to be caused by \"convulsive distempers,\" such as epileptic activity. However, he did not suggest whether it was an inborn or an acquired condition. Progress over the following two and a half centuries was slow, with RLS having been mostly understood as a psychogenic disorder (3-5). In the 1940s, RLS was ascribed to various medical conditions, such as a vascular cause (6) or a familial origin with exacerbation during pregnancy (7).",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a very integral part of our functioning with normal adults sleeping for about 1/3rd of their lives. Sleep disorders are a group of conditions that alter the ability of a person to get appropriate sleep which can alter the day-to-day functioning. In the present day and age sleep disorders irrespective of the reason the growth in the sleep disorders is alarming. Although many people tend to experience sleep disturbances on an occasional basis owing to stressful life situations, alterations in job schedules, traveling, and many other external influences, but when these issues occur regularly and become an impedance in the day-to-day activities, it may be suggestive of a sleeping disorder. A deficiency of a good quality sleep can have overall undesirable consequences on the vitality, temperament, attentiveness, and well-being of an individual. Sleep difficulties are linked to both physical and emotional problems. Sleep problems can both contribute to and exacerbate existing mental problems as well as serve as an important indicator of other mental health conditions. While the various sleep problems may resolve on its own or eventually conclude after a successful course of therapy, in a few resistant cases the treatment normally involves a combination of medical treatments and lifestyle changes.",

      "abstract": "Background: Chronic pain can affect patients in innumerable ways, ranging from compromised self-esteem and fraught personal relationships, to lowered affect, and skewed personal insight. It is estimated that over 35% of Irish adults experience chronic pain, the treatment of which represents a significant financial burden on the health care system. It has been found that people who suffer from chronic pain also experience high levels of shame associated with their condition. Shame can be described as internalised stigma. It is a painful feeling of humiliation or distress caused by the self-consciousness of wrong or foolish behaviour. People who experience shame perceive themselves as wholly negative. Such judgement can further exacerbate feelings of worthlessness, leading to social avoidance, withdrawal and a deterioration of functioning in patients with chronic pain. Furthermore experiencing shame can dramatically impact the health-seeking behaviours of patients.",

The interdependence of this thyroid disorder with disorders of the mind and emotions, as well as with mental disorders, is not being given the required consideration in many clinical settings. Similarly, many clinical symptoms suggesting thyrotoxicosis are sometimes overlooked, such as palpitations, agina, breathelessness, tremor, infertility, pruritus, bone pains, excessive sweating and insomia. In addition, a lot of metabolic derangements can be secondary to thyrotoxicosis, such as hyperglycemia, hypercalcemia, hypoparathyroidism, hypocalaemia and hypocholesterolaemia. Despite the enormity of the several problems associated with a thyrotoxic condition, very inadequate attention is given to these problems in many clinical settings. Although both hyperthyroidism (thyrotoxicosis) and hypothyroidism are the two common thyroid disorders, thyrotoxicosis is more prevalent. Therefore, thyrotoxicosis should be part of regular differentials in any clinical setting and hence there is need for a review of this endocrine metabolic disorder. This review discusses thyrotoxicosis and its various clinical manifestations, its relationships with the mind and emotions/mental disorders and finally the metabolic manifestations. It also highlights on the approach to handling suspected cases of thyrotoxicosis.",

This chapter describes the advancements in noninvasive techniques that are able to detect trauma-induced structural and functional damage, great strides in understanding the pathophysiology of TBI have been made. Despite variable long-term outcomes across the range of severities based on the Glasgow Coma Scale classification, the majority of TBI cases, approximately 75%, are diagnosed as mild TBI. The primary injury to the brain is a result of sudden acceleration, deceleration, and/or rotational forces. The acceleration and deceleration of the brain can cause cortical contusions and hemorrhages when the brain hits the skull. In TBI, the secondary injury cascade ultimately results in necrotic or apoptotic cell death that contributes to measurable cerebral atrophy due to neuronal loss.",

Walsh (Understanding Brain Damage: A Primer of Neuropsychological Evaluation. Churchill Livingstone, London, 1985) suggests that these individuals can maintain the ‘appearance of intactness’ in many situations of everyday living. The lowering of adaptive abilities often remains concealed until a novel situation is encountered (e.g. treatment or recovery from drug/alcohol misuse). Subtle deficits in learning and cognitive flexibility may then be misinterpreted as ambivalence or absence of motivation to change.

      "title": "Testosterone Deficiency and Mood in Aging Men: Pathogenic and Therapeutic Interactions",
      "abstract": "AbstractIn contrast to women, men do not experience a sudden cessation of gonadal function comparable to menopause. However, there is a progressive reduction in hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) function in aging men: testosterone (T) levels decline through both central (pituitary) and peripheral (testicular) mechanisms and there is a loss of the circadian rhythm of T secretion. In cohorts of men 75 years of age, mean plasma T levels are 35% lower than comparable young men, and more than 25% of men over 75 appear to be T-deficient. Such age-associated T deficiency, which has been termed 'andropause', is thought to be responsible for a variety of symptoms experienced by elderly men, such as weakness, fatigue, reduced muscle and bone mass, impaired haematopoiesis, oligospermia, sexual dysfunction, depression, anxiety, irritability, insomnia and memory impairment. However, it has been difficult to establish correlations between these symptoms and plasma T levels. Nevertheless, there is some evidence that T replacement leads to symptom relief, particularly with respect to muscle strength, bone mineral density and haematopoiesis. Studies to date on the specific association between psychiatric symptoms, such as depressed mood, and T levels have been methodologically flawed. Overall, data suggest that although hypogonadism is not central to major depressive disorder (MDD), HPG hypofunction may have aetiological importance in mild depressive conditions, such as dysthymia.Key Words: andropausetestosterone deficiencydepressionmalegeriatric Additional informationNotes on contributorsStuart N SeidmanJoyce Laing works in the Department of Child and Family Psychiatry, Playfield House, Cupar, Fife, and is a Consultant Art Therapist to Psychiatric Hospitals and Prisons and Chairwoman of the Scottish Society of Art and Psychology.Dr Niculescu Dan, Centrul de Reumatologie, Str.

The common causes of TBI are due to falls, sports injuries, and car or motorcycle crashes. TBI can be classified into several types, ranges from a mild concussion to severe permanent brain damage. Nevertheless, the impacts of TBI are quite devastating not only to the patient but also on the family. It may last for several years, hence the affected patient definitely requires ongoing care which is normally provided by informal caregivers, such as spouses, parents, or other family members. In addition, TBI can cause drastic changes to the life of the family members. The caregiver’s stresses including psychological problems, family burdens, changes in behavior and changes in social roles will be discussed critically in this article. Based on the literature, many caregivers lack good coping strategies in dealing with their stress. More well-designed interventions is an absolute necessity among TBI family caregivers to lessen the stress and improve their social well-being and functioning.",

      "title": "Personality constellations in suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "Since the majority of patients with psychiatric disorders do not commit or even attempt suicide, it seems that while psychiatric disorder may be a necessary risk factor for suicide, it is not sufficient in itself. One of the most urgent issues for clinical research in the area of suicide is to determine what factors, in addition to and beyond psychiatric disorders, predispose a person to suicide. Three areas of research : Post-mortem psychological studies of adolescents from eighteen to twenty-one years of age who committed suicide while performing their military service in the Israeli army. Clinical work with suicidal adolescents in a full-time hospital ward for adolescents. Work in the emergency room of a large general hospital during an epidemiological study of conducts associated with suicide. Our hypothesis is that three groups of personality types form the basis for the tendency toward suicide : (1) personalities that are narcissistic, perfectionist, unable to tolerate failure and imperfection ; (2) those characterized by impulsiveness and aggression associated with extreme sensitivity to minor life events ; (3) those characterized by underlying depression, usually the consequence of a psychical affliction, such as mood disorder, anxiety, schizophrenia or mental anorexia. These results seem to reinforce the conclusions that we presented in earlier papers (Apter et al., 1995). We think that suicidal conduct in depressed adolescents differs from that of borderline adolescents. The well-known relationship between impulsiveness, aggression and suicidal tendencies (Apter et al., 1993) may indeed be linked to borderline state and conduct disorders (Apter et al., 1995). This has important consequences for research on adolescent suicide in general, since additional results regarding associated trauma, sexual abuse, family break-up, and drug use may also be linked to specific types of suicide. We can no longer view suicidal conduct as a homogenous set of conducts. Although the non-nosiographical approach developed by Van Praag et al. (1987) has been a very fruitful one, diagnosis and personality differences may play a role in the understanding of suicide.",

Treatments aimed at improvement of depressive symptoms do not automatically lead to functional recovery in terms of return to work, and if they do, there is generally a long time lag. Several approaches have been suggested to improve return to work, that generally imply that the sick-listed employee should not wait for remission before resuming work, but rather try to return gradually. Personal as well as work factors influence the outcome of such a process, so that this approach has interpersonal as well as workplace implications that should be addressed at the same time as personal factors and the depressive symptoms.",

      "title": "Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex category of clinical conditions defined by a functionally significant alteration of brain function and/or structure resulting from the application of external physical force (including acceleration/deceleration and/or blast forces). TBI occurs along a continuum of injury severity and can produce a broad range of neuropsychiatric disturbances of variable duration. The heterogeneity and complexity of both TBI and its sequelae present challenges in clinical care, research, public policy, and medicolegal proceedings. Some persons with TBI (particularly those with very severe injuries) experience lifelong, disabling cognitive, emotional, behavioral, motor, and sensory impairments. Other persons with TBI (particularly those with history of a single mild TBI) can expect to return to baseline functioning within days to weeks postinjury (Carroll et al. 2004, 2014; Cassidy et al. 2014). The effects of injury and the course of recovery vary, with injury severity (mild, moderate, or severe), comorbid or complicating neuropsychiatric conditions, and psychosocial circumstances all potentially influencing outcomes. Competent clinical practice requires that clinicians consider all of these factors when evaluating persons with neuropsychiatric disturbances after TBI in order to identify opportunities to diagnose and treat common neuropsychiatric conditions, including those that bear no meaningful causal relationship to TBI. In this chapter, we aim to provide guidance toward those ends through a brief review of the definitions of TBI and the essential neurophysiology and relevant neuroanatomy of TBI and syntheses of evidence-based assessment and treatment for individuals living with TBI-related neuropsychiatric disturbances.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a disease, a mood disorder which influences emotions, cognitive function and actions of an individual. It is the 4th leading health problem worldwide. More than 350 million people in the world suffer from depression. Depression causes persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest, possibly leading to numerous emotional problems and to deterioration of physical health. The most common symptoms of depression are feelings of grief or a depressive state, outbursts of anger over minor issues, a loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities or an inability to experience pleasure from them, changes in appetite – weight loss or weight gain, sleeping disorders – insomnia or hypersomnia, lack of energy or an increased feeling of fatigue, aimless actions or sluggish movements and speech, a feeling of worthlessness or a misplaced feeling of guilt, problems reasoning or focusing properly, thoughts of death or suicide, physical pain without a clear cause. It is a known fact that it is normal to feel depressed sometimes. However, it is very important to recognize these feelings in due time. Depression is a serious public health issue because of its high morbidity and mortality rates. Fifteen percent of individuals suffering from depression commit suicide. It is important for affected individuals to seek help from a health care professional in order to rule out different causes of depression, establish an accurate differential diagnosis and provide safe and efficient treatment.\r\n The aim of this study was to establish to what extent the participants are familiar with symptoms of depression and to see to what extent they perceive them in their own emotional experience. The study population consisted of 242 individuals, 179 (74%) female and 63 (26%) male. At the completion of the study we concluded that the majority of participants are familiar with depression as a disease. One third of participants (32%) experienced symptoms of depression at some point of their life. Worldwide statistical data show that the percentage of individuals suffering from depression in the Republic of Croatia is 5,1% for men and 6,2% for women. It is quite clear that this percentage is substantially higher among individuals who participated in the study poll. Numerous studies have shown that depression is a disease with an increasing incidence rate. It is expected that depression will become the second most frequent disease in the coming years.",

L'amelioration etait attribuee a l'interruption d'un mecanisme excitateur recurrent a longue boucle, impliquant les afferences musculaires qui sont connues pour relayer dans la region thalamique ou les lesions etaient pratiquees. La nature specifique de ces effets etait confirmee par les resultats de lesions operees dans des regions thalamiques se projetant sur l'ecorce, y compris le cortex moteur, mais de facon non specifique. Non seulement aucune amelioration n'apparaissait, mais c'etait au contraire une aggravation, quelquefois incontrolable, qui se manifestait dans tous les cas.

      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

      "title": "Incidence Of Post-Operative Delirium In Geriatric Patients Undergoing Hip Replacement Surgery Using Pre-Operative Haloperidol",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

[1] reported that hypothyroidism can cause asymptomatic smallfiber sensory neuropathy.In fact, it has been proposed that congenital hypothyroidism increases the rate of sensorineural hearing loss and motor disability in childhood and adulthood.More interestingly, several authors reported that hypothyroidism can cause a demyelination in the peripheral nerve, sensorimotor neuropathy or polyneuropathy, and fibrillation, diminish the nerve conduction velocity, and delay the relaxation phase of deep tendon reflexes.On the other hand, adult-onset hypothyroidism in humans can cause deafness and multiple defects in taste and smell.Alternatively, adult-onset hypothyroidism in mice can cause several defects in odor discrimination, and decrease the hearing capabilities at adulthood.Thus, it is also worth noticing that normal sensorineural development in early life is favorably dependent on the levels of maternal THs.As well, maternal hypothyroidism may be associated with multiple sensorineural defects and brain disorders.Therefore, the ideal regulation of gestational thyroid function is significant not only for her own health but probably also for the long-term health of her child.Also, motor proficiency ought to be achieved in preschool age children to distinguish the sensorineural deficits early.Further studies are required to describe the mechanisms of maternal thyroid-associated sensorineural disease .",

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

Skeletal muscle is a unique tissue whose function is dependent in great part on its ultrastructure. Repeated intense muscular contractions, especially those resulting in muscle lengthening, can lead to alterations in muscle structure (i.e., muscle damage) and subsequent decline in contractile force. The damage-induced decline in contractile force can have a significant impact on exercise performance during an athletic performance. In some disease conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the muscles are more vulnerable to contraction-induced damage than normal muscle. In the case of the respiratory muscles, for example, the diaphragm, the consequences of muscle weakness secondary to damage are profound in that respiratory failure leading to premature death often ensues. In normal skeletal muscle, damage is followed by an inflammatory response involving multiple cell types that subsides after several days. This transient inflammatory response is a normal homeostatic reaction to muscle damage. In contrast, a persistent inflammatory response is observed in dystrophic skeletal muscle that leads to an altered extracellular environment, including an increased presence of inflammatory cells (e.g., macrophages) and elevated levels of various inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, TGF-β). The signals that lead to successful muscle repair in healthy muscle may promote muscle wasting and fibrosis in dystrophic muscle. Preliminary data indicate that immunosuppression in dystrophic (mdx) mice has beneficial effects on some indices of muscle dysfunction, thereby indicating that targeted immunosuppression may offer some promise in delaying the pathological progression of this insidious muscular disease.",

Subclinical hypothyroidism (HSC) is defined as a condition with elevated levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and normal levels of free thyroxine (T4). Although the role played by thyroid hormones in the pathophysiology of mental disorders is unclear, it has been suggested that small changes in thyroid hormone levels, even within the normal range, may be related to altered brain function in depression. Currently, there are 2 explanatory hypotheses: serotonin deficit and noradrenaline deficit in the central nervous system caused by hormonal disorders. It is important to emphasize that the thyroid-psychic pathway is bidirectional, therefore, both thyroid alterations can cause depressive symptoms or exacerbate a previous psychiatric pathology, and depression can promote thyroid disorders, the latter being less frequent. Thus, the role of thyroid function in depressive illness is unclear. Although there is some evidence that mild thyroid alterations predispose to cases of depression, the specific abnormalities involving the thyroid and depressive conditions remain poorly understood. However, there is a causal link.",

Patients may also show cramps when going to bed and getting up, tingling in hands and feet, infertility, depression and cognitive disorders such as memory loss and difficulties to concentrate or pay attention. These symptoms are frequent in hypothyroidism, including subclinical hypothyroidism (SHT) and other endocrinological pathologies such as clinical symptoms of hyperprolactinemia. Many of these patients consult the endocrinologist after having seen clinicians and/or gynecologists and/or dermatologists, etc.However, when tests are conducted, not all the consulting patients will be treated since their tests show a normal endocrinological function. Therefore, many patients are excluded from medical assistance, even though they mention symptoms affecting their quality of life but with no specific endocrinological cause.This article will explain that even though the symptoms described by twelve patients had no direct relationship with endocrinological disorders, they were actually associated to a condition of vulnerability to stress.It can be thus gathered that said patients should not be excluded from the health system, implying the rethinking of intervention techniques proposing more integrating strategies that would include treating these patients from a psychological perspective.\r\nKey words: Stress, Nonspecific symptoms, Vulnerability.",

In today's competitive domain, mental pressure and tension is a critical problem. The deficiency of sleep can frequently lead to a share of ailments one of which is insomnia. All sorts of insomnia can lead to daytime tiredness, deprived attentiveness, automobile related misfortunes and also the incapability to feel revitalized and relaxed in the dawn etc., merely due to tiredness or one will have trouble concentrating. Insomnia is a complicated and tricky condition at the best of times. There is no lone therapeutic or medical definition of the term. The National Sleep Foundation for instance, tends to define insomnia in the broadest of terms i.e. \"difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep\".In numerous cases, individuals use heavy dosage of drug to solve, majority of which are damaging for the human body. There are countless approaches to treat insomnia. Lately, researchers are trying to unravel the same by means of electromagnetic field therapy. With the steadiness of preceding studies, here is a circuit designed to generate and exude an electromagnetic field of small frequency across a radiator coil and observe them. In this way, our mind is bounded by an ideal atmosphere for a thorough sleep. This paper describes the model developed for an inexpensive and accessible system that aids oneovercome insomnia.",

      "title": "Editorial: Protecting and repairing the brain: central and peripheral strategies define the New Rehabilitation following traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "A dawn of a new era in traumatic brain injury (TBI) rehabilitation is emerging, and the articles presented in this ‘update’ should provide confidence that a wealth of novel targets and approaches are available for more effective treatment for this often disabling affliction. HURDLES TO PROGRESS IN TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY TREATMENT Traumatic brain injury represents a spectrum of pathophysiological severity operationally defined in its acute presentations as mild to severe, although as pointed out in the article by Prough et al. (pp. 672–680), mild TBI can have severe consequences for long-term function [1]. In our view, at least three major hurdles have prevented greater progress in developing therapeutics for a condition with growing, world-wide prevalence. First, diagnosing mild TBI is often a challenge because exposure (trauma) combined with one of a number of nonspecific neurological symptoms (e.g. headache, dizziness, difficulty concentrating) is often used to diagnose concussion [2]. Second, with the exception of alterations in consciousness observed in more severe forms of brain injury, a circuit-based framework for reducing distinct impairments following TBI has yet to be established [3]. Third, the brain is not like the kidney or the liver wherein strategies to repair the ‘hardware’ are sufficient to restore function. Once the circuits are repaired or replaced, function and skill likely need to be retrained to be optimally restored [4]. Each hurdle presents an opportunity for neuroscientific advance and potential synergies in translational applications as explored below. SYSTEMIC PERIPHERAL AND DEEP BRAIN INTERVENTIONS AS THERAPEUTICS FOR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY Traumatic brain injury is the result of focal and more diffuse damage to the brain, although both the focal and diffuse lesions can give rise to nonlocalizing symptoms. The presence of nonlocalizing symptoms with both kinds of injury does raise the question of whether such symptoms following trauma emanate from a more general disruption of patterns of electrical activity or autonomic regulation, manifest as decrements in cerebral blood flow and consequent marked reductions of neuronal activity, which disrupt but do not destroy function in a number of functional domains within the central nervous system (CNS) [5]. The exciting work emerging from Leddy et al. (pp. 681–686) suggests that a host of nonselective symptoms are related to autonomic dysfunction that limits ventilatory drive in response to exercise. This results in paradoxical increases in blood carbon dioxide levels, which can lead to a host of nonspecific neurological symptoms including exercise intolerance. Leddy et al. (pp. 681–686) have developed several strategies described in their chapter herein for using exercise to overcome autonomic dysfunction and disabling symptoms following sports-related concussion. At the other end of the pathophysiological spectrum, bilateral thalamic stimulation has been effectively used to improve function in those who are minimally conscious years after the injury. In a rigorously blinded study, it was demonstrated that stimulation of the deep nuclei could overcome impairments of arousal as well as improve limb control or oral feeding behaviours [6]. Current efforts underway are focused on using deep brain stimulation (DBS) for patients with independent outcomes of severe to moderate brain injuries that continue to limit vocational re-entry or continuing education [7]. To our knowledge, no one has looked at whether DBS has effects on ventilatory drive or autonomic function seen by Leddy et al. (pp. 681–686) in milder, sports-related TBI, but DBS of deep nuclei is believed to affect autonomic function in patients with Parkinson's disease [8]. Enhanced global activity in the CNS could not only be achieved by bilateral thalamic stimulation but also via pharmacological supplementation with D-cycloserine. D-cycloserine is a small molecule modulator of the glycine/serine site of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor [9]. Treatment of animals with experimentally induced TBI with this clinically approved compound leads to augmented plasticity and function and is discussed by Shohami et al. (pp. 687–692) in an article herein. More generally, activation of glutamatergic neuronal populations has the advantage of stimulating long-range excitatory projection systems damaged in TBI [10]; the only current Class I evidence for clinical efficacy of a neuromodulator exists for another NMDA-sensitive agent, amantadine [11]. AXONAL SUICIDE FOLLOWING TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY DEFINES A WHOLE PANOPLY OF NEW TARGETS FOR PROTECTING AND REPAIRING THE BRAIN Although targeting autonomic function or brain activity globally are promising new directions, an equally exciting development in TBI research is the growing recognition that axonal disruption following trauma is not simply the result of passive injury to neuronal connections as a result of shear forces created by different densities in the brain gray versus white matter. Rather, disruptions in the cytoskeleton that accompany trauma appear to lead to a form an axonal suicide driven by activation of a protein called SARM1 (Sterile Alpha and TIR-motif containing protein 1 [12,13] covered elegantly by the article by Simon and Watkins (pp. 693–701). Although SARM1 was classically defined as a protein that is involved in innate immunity, a host of recent studies have shown that it is able to drive the activation of a host of kinases [including dual leucine zipper (DLK) kinase, microtubule-associated protein (MAP) kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)] that lead to controlled destruction of the axons via local effects on calcium-dependent proteases and nuclear-driven death genes. The upstream trigger mediated via SARM1 appears to be local destruction of nictonamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) [14]. NAD is composed of two bases, adenine and nicotinamide and the oxidized form (NAD+) and the reduced form NADH are involved in number redox reactions throughout the cell. This pathway of cell death predicts that enzymes that are involved in NAD synthesis in the axons (e.g. NMNAT2) should tilt the balance away from axonal destruction towards axonal repair. In fact, NMNAT2 overexpression protects axons from degeneration, although there is debate about the domain within NMNAT2 required for its protective effects. From a repair perspective, recent studies suggest that NAD-consuming enzymes such as poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase are present in the axon and are activated after injury, and that inhibiting those enzymes can foster local protection and repair via effects on microtubule acetylation [15]. Many of these targets have been validated in fly and mouse models of axonal injury, including those initiated by trauma and provided needed preclinical validation for these targets in an integrated system such as the intact brain. These validations have led to the conclusion that secondary injury mechanisms of axonal destruction can take up to 3 days to be executed providing an extended therapeutic window for treatment. CAN BIOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO MAINTAIN CIRCUIT FUNCTION SYNERGIZE WITH TREADMILL TRAINING OR DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION? The elucidation of molecular targets ripe for protecting axons following trauma has created momentum towards clinical trials that could test the validity of these targets in humans. It has further given rise to the notion that combinatorial studies in which SARM1 inhibition or NAD augmentation is combined with treadmill training or DBS might result in clinical benefits not seen with either agent alone. Moreover, there is considerable evidence to suggest that combining axon protective approaches with strategies that used technology and training to reduce specific impairments (e.g. vision loss, paralysis, cognitive dysfunction and pain) could also lead to benefits not observed with either agent alone. Training devices which not only standardized training but also act as strategies to quantitate outcomes with high sensitivity and specificity and high dynamic range. These devices have improved effect size and reduced sample size in stroke therapeutics and they could do the same for TBI research. OMICS AND BIG DATA AND THE FUTURE OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY Big data and novel analytical methods have been essential to validation of studies involving electroencephalogram use for studies of consciousness in TBI [16]. Similar methods are now being applied to multimodal data sets from patients as described by Ferguson et al. in this issue (pp. 702–708). These data sets offer the opportunity to develop novel predictive models about variables (clinical, serum or imaging) that closely associate with outcome. They also offer the opportunity to enhance transparency and rigor in data sharing across sites and to increase the reporting of negative data (’Dark data’). As proteomics, genomics and metabolomics become more widely available at lower cost, these discovery-based approaches, when applied in the correct way [see article by Sowers et al. (pp. 709–717)] combined with big data analytics, will facilitate our ability to extract signal from noise in this disease with heterogenous cause and clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION Traumatic brain injury is complicated in that it often combines focal and diffuse injury to the brain leading to focal and diffuse symptoms. The articles in this issue provide a conceptual framework for understanding how emerging therapeutic approaches that affect brain activity globally or autonomic function systemically might be used to treat traumatic TBI. Ultimately combining these approaches, or therapies that protect or repair axons in combinations with task-specific training may offer synergies and the best hope for effectively treating this highly prevalent and heterogenous malady.

Alopecia might not be reported by some people, but physicians should be aware of this potential problem which may contribute to noncompliance. Lithium causes hair loss in 12-19% of long-term users. Valproic acid and/ or divalproex precipitates alopecia in up to 12% of patients in a dose-dependent relationship. Incidences up to 28% are observed with high valproate concentration exposures. These pharmaceuticals also can change hair color and structure. The occurrence of carbamazepine-induced alopecia is at or below 6%. Hair loss is less common with other mood stabilizers. Tricyclic antidepressants, maprotilene, trazodone, and virtually all the new generation of antidepressants may on rare occasions lead to alopecia. The same applies to haloperidol, olanzepine, risperidone, clonazepam, and buspirone, but not to other neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates, selected antihistamines, and antiparkinsonians. Discontinuation of the medication or dose reduction almost always leads to complete hair regrowth. The therapeutic value of mineral supplements remains unclear.",

      "abstract": "I have described a group of patients who are seemingly successful in their professional and social lives, and who seek analysis ostensibly for professional reasons or for minor difficulties in their relationship. However, sooner or later they reveal phenomena which are strikingly similar to those observed in so-called autistic children. These autistic phenomena are characterized by an almost impenetrable encapsulation of part of the personality, mute and implacable resistance to change, and a lack of real emotional contact either with themselves or the analyst. Progress of the analysis reveals an underlying intense fear of pain, and of death, disintegration or breakdown. These anxieties occur as a reaction to real or feared separation, especially when commitment to analysis deepens. In the case I have described in detail the patient used various projective processes to deflect painful emotions either into other people, including the analyst, or into their own bodies. As a consequence the various objects or organs of the body swell up and became suffused with rage as a result of having to contain the unwanted feelings. This process leads in turn to intense persecutory fears and a heightened sensitivity to the analyst's tone of voice and facial expression. It would seem that the initial hypersensitivity of part of the personality is such as to lead it to anticipate danger to such an extent that it expels feelings even before they reach awareness. The sooner the analyst realizes the existence of this hidden part of the patient the less the danger of the analysis becoming an endless and meaningless intellectual dialogue and the greater the possibilities of the patient achieving a relatively stable equilibrium. Although the analyst has to live through a great deal of anxiety with the patient I feel that ultimately the results make it worth while.",

In addition to physical discomfort, pressure injuries can lead to psychological and social problems hurting patients' quality of life and are further associated with greater health costs; management of pressure injuries is therefore recognized as an important indicator of the quality of care in health care facilities. However, studies have shown that the progress of skin changes in terminal patients and patients receiving palliative care tends to be more rapid than that of pressure injuries, which usually needs to go through redness and blistering before evolving into a wound covered by eschar. In this article, we reviewed recent studies regarding prevention of pressure injuries and management of pressure injuries in patients receiving palliative care. Also performed was a literature review of terminal skin injuries, including Kennedy terminal ulcer and 3:30 syndrome, skin changes at life's end, Trombley-Brennan terminal tissue injuries, and skin failure. Skin failure in terminal patients needs to be distinguished from pressure injury. The validity of the ＂Skin Failure Clinical Indicator Scale＂ merits further investigations before the scale can be expected to be widely applied in clinical settings.",

Delusional thinking may occur in severe cases. Behaviourally, depression reflects helplessness or appeasement that arise from feelings of inferiority, entrapment, or defeat. Non-verbal behaviour in depression resembles ancient strategies of vertebrates to signal submission. At the cognitive level, people with depression often engage in ruminating thoughts, often involving self-derogation or worthlessness. Depression may occur in situations when one’s social status is threatened or an actual fall in rank has taken place. This is often accompanied by a reduction of serotonin availability. Genes conferring risk for depression when coupled with adverse early experiences may even protect against depression when associated with supportive parenting, suggesting genetic plasticity. Aside from ethological considerations, depression may also be linked to a dysfunction of the immune system.",

      "title": "Demoralization",
      "abstract": "It is common for human beings to feel overwhelmed and give up! This phenomenon is usually temporary and short-lasting, and most people bounce back. However, in a small proportion of people, especially those facing challenging life situations, this may be a persistent feeling requiring clinical attention. This is clinically understood as demoralization. According to the Cambridge dictionary, demoralization is understood as the \"process of making someone lose confidence, enthusiasm, and hope.\" Understanding demoralization in medical and psychiatric disorders is very important, as it is highly prevalent and often requires clinical attention. In addition, the clinicians can also feel demoralized in dealing with the stress, and it is often considered a forerunner of burnout.[1] Unfortunately, the majority of the clinicians do not consider the clinical possibilities that are not covered by the recognized nosological systems; hence, these are either ignored or miscategorized. Demoralization is one such clinical condition. The term \"demoralization\" was introduced in the psychiatric literature by Jerome Frank in the context of psychotherapy, irrespective of the psychiatric diagnosis.[2] He described it as a state of mind in which a person is deprived of spirit or courage, is disheartened, bewildered, and thrown into disorder or confusion.[2] The person experiences incessant feelings of subjective incompetency or failures to meet their expectations or those of others and cannot cope and solve the emergent problems. The core problem responsible for demoralization is the inability to cope, leading to feeling trapped and hopeless.[3] Hope is understood as one of the most fundamental aspects of life, and loss of hope precedes death.[3] Although the concept of demoralization was initially described in psychotherapy, later on, it has been understood and evaluated across various medical illnesses and psychiatric disorders. In the context of medical illnesses, any physical illness or mental disorder can lead to demoralization. In the context of medical illnesses, demoralization is understood as the feeling of disempowerment (i.e., not able to perform at one's previous level of functioning) and a sense of futility (i.e., a feeling that the condition is never going to improve and hence the dysfunction is going to continue).[4] However, it is essential to note that demoralization in the context of medical illnesses is understood as a dimensional concept, varying from normal reaction to the illness to an impairing clinical phenomenon requiring attention.[4] Over the years, many authors have tried to describe the clinical features of demoralization. They have characterized it by features of anxiety, apprehension, low mood, distress or existential distress, sense of isolation, hopelessness, helplessness, low self-esteem, personal incompetence, loss of purpose or meaning of life, and inability to cope.[4] In terms of clinical characterization, demoralization is distinguished from depression by the presence of hedonic capacity.[3] It is suggested that the primary deficit in persons experiencing demoralization is the sense of incompetence that leads to uncertainty in the direction of action to be followed. In contrast, persons with depression have low motivation to follow any direction, even when they know the appropriate direction of action.[5] As demoralization is not included in the commonly used diagnostic systems in psychiatry, i.e., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases, a group of researchers formed an international consortium and developed the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research (DCPR) to assess the psychological distress that is seen in persons with various physical illnesses.[6] It listed 12 conditions, demoralization being one of them. According to the DCPR criteria, demoralization is characterized by the patient's awareness of having failed to meet their expectations (or that of others) or being unable to cope with some pressing problems; as a result, the patient experiences feelings of helplessness, hopelessness, or giving up; the feeling state is prolonged, generalized, and present for at least one month; and the feeling is closely preceded by the manifestations of a medical illness or exacerbation of its symptoms.[4,7] In another effort to characterize the demoralization syndrome, Kissane et al.[8] proposed diagnostic criteria for demoralization in the context of palliative care. This included: The presence of affective symptoms of existential distress, which also include features of hopelessness or loss of meaning and purpose of life; cognitive features of pessimism, helplessness, sense of being trapped, a feeling of personal failure, or lacking a worthwhile future; lack of drive or motivation to cope differently; associated social alienation or isolation and lack of support; persistence of features for more than 2 weeks with fluctuation in emotional intensity and lack of presence of a major depressive or other psychiatric disorder as the primary condition.[9] The development of structured scales has furthered the concept of assessing the phenomenon of demoralization. One of the commonly used scales is the demoralization scale (DS), a 24-item scale that has good psychometric properties and has been translated into many languages (Kissane et al., 2004).[9] The DS focuses on the demoralization state findings focusing on the past 2 weeks. The five factors of DS include dysphoria, disheartenment, loss of meaning and purpose, helplessness, and a sense of failure.[9] Other scales while have been designed to assess demoralization in the research setting include Dohrenwend's Psychiatric Epidemiology Research Interview-Demoralization Scale (PERI-D),[10] a scale based on the DCPR criteria[11], and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 Restructured Clinical Scale of Demoralization.[12] Some of the authors consider that these scales assess nonoverlapping aspects or varying stages of demoralization.[5] The PERI-D is a self-report 27-item scale that focuses primarily on nonspecific distress and measures both trait and state demoralization depending on the time frame considered for evaluation. The various dimensions included in PERI-D include sadness, hopelessness-helplessness, poor self-esteem, anxiety, dread, poor self-esteem, psychophysiological symptoms, confused thinking, and perceived physical health.[10] Structured interview based on the DCPR criteria includes 58 yes/no questions, which identifies 12 psychosomatic syndromes, with demoralization being one of them. It assesses demoralization as a state measure, considering the last 4 weeks.[11] In the context of physical illnesses, demoralization has been extensively studied in malignancies.[13,14] A systematic review that included information from 25 studies reported the prevalence of clinically significant demoralization to be 13%–18%.[14] A higher prevalence of demoralization was associated with poorly controlled physical symptoms, poor social functioning, being unemployed, being single, and insufficiently managed depression and anxiety.[14] Some studies also show that demoralization differs from depression.[13] Besides cancer, a high prevalence of demoralization has also been reported in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus[15] and patients who have undergone cardiac transplants.[16] Studies that have assessed the prevalence of demoralization using the DCPR criteria among medical patients with DSM diagnosis of adjustment disorder suggest that the prevalence varies from 28.8% to 39%, with the highest rates among inpatients referred to consultation/liaison services.[17] Demoralization has also been reported to be associated with adverse health outcomes, especially in patients with cardiac ailments in the form of a higher risk of cardiac death or rehospitalization,[18] higher episodes of acute rejection in patients with the cardiac transplant.[16] Demoralization has also been a prodromal symptom of cardiac events.[19,20] In patients with cancer, demoralization has also been associated with more physical symptoms, poorer quality of life, and functioning.[9,21,22] The concept of demoralization has also been evaluated in persons with mental disorders. Initial equivalent terminologies include social breakdown syndrome, noted among patients institutionalized for long for their chronic mental illness.[23] In recent years, some studies have also evaluated demoralization among patients with schizophrenia and suggest prevalence rates to be as high as 94%.[24,25] In terms of factors associated with demoralization, available evidence suggests that higher levels of demoralization be associated with better insight, higher self-stigma, presence of psychotic symptoms, lower level of functioning, and suicidal behavior.[26] These preliminary findings suggest that there is a need to evaluate demoralization in patients with mental disorders too. These findings suggest that clinicians should assess demoralization in the context of all the medical illnesses and psychiatric disorders. Demoralization can be characterized by any one of the currently available criteria or scales. While assessing demoralization in a medical setting, depression and adjustment disorder must be considered differential diagnoses. Some of the authors have discussed the management strategies for demoralization in the context of medical illnesses. Management of demoralization in the context of palliative care involves providing continuity of care and active management of symptoms, exploring the attitude toward hope and meaning in life, balancing support for grief and promoting hope, encouraging a search for a new or renewed purpose and role in life, cognitive restructuring to address the negative beliefs, providing pastoral and spiritual support, encouraging connection with other and improving the family support, enhancing family support and review of treatment goals in the multidisciplinary team meeting.[8] Other treatment strategies in the context of various medical illnesses include supportive, empathetic listening by the health-care providers and cognitive-behavioral techniques.[27] Other authors emphasize the importance of providing psychological support using good interview skills to discern the existential themes of significant concern in the index patient and address the same.[28]",

Pain threshold appears to change in various clinical conditions such as osteoarthrosis of the hip once the painful condition is relieved the threshold may revert back to normal.

Neuere große Studien fanden wenig oder gar keine Anhaltspunkte für negative Effekte einer Chemotherapie auf kognitive Funktionen. Epidemiologische Studien wiesen nach, dass Krebspatienten lebenslang ein erhöhtes Risiko für kognitive Beeinträchtigungen haben, auch wenn sie nicht systemisch behandelt worden sind. Mittlerweile wird deshalb eine multifaktorielle Verursachung der Störungen diskutiert, in der neben verschiedenen Therapien auch die Erkrankung selbst und krankheits- und therapiebedingte Stressbelastungen eine Rolle spielen könnten.

      "abstract": "Introduction Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare chronic disease, frequently accompanied by fatigue, which is an important comorbidity associated with this disease [1]. Patients experience difficulties to manage their daily activities and a reduction in their overall quality of life (QoL) [2]. The causes of fatigue in ITP are not clarified yet and underlying causes seem to be multifactorial. The development of fatigue may not solely be influenced by a decrease in platelet count, but also by unknown factors as well as psychological reasons [3] [4].",

      "title": "Familial Dysautonomia",
      "abstract": "Familial dysautonomia or the Riley-Day syndrome was first described in 1949 with a report of five cases (14). Dysautonomia refers to the characteristic dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system upon which are superimposed both motor and sensory abnormalities; familial refers to the genetic nature of the abnormality, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait occurring almost exclusively in Jewish families of East European extraction (12). The clinical features may be grouped into major categories resulting from apparent dysfunction of the dominantly involved systems: (a) episodic hypertension and postural hypotension, transient (erythematous) blotching of the skin, cool extremities, excessive perspiration, hypolacrimation, episodic unexplained fever, episodic vomiting; (b) disordered swallowing, dysarthria, motor inco-ordination; (c) marked diminution in sensory modalities (notably pain and taste), decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, corneal hypesthesia (leading to corneal scarring). Additional, almost constant features are emotional lability, recurrent pulmonic infection, kyphoscoliosis, and other bony changes. The occasional occurrence of convulsions is noted, but mental retardation is not thought to be an important primary feature of this syndrome. Recent communications have emphasized the probably pathognomonic absence of the fungiform papillae of the tongue with the presumed absence of the associated taste buds; frequently there is concomitant absence of the circumvallate papillae (4, 15). Pharmacologic investigations have revealed hypersensitivity to both norepinephrine and methacholine, absence of normal responses to intradermal histamine, and restoration of many of the abnormal sensory and parasympathetic findings with infused methacholine (4, 16). Despite the wide array of symptomatology and despite the fact that the radiologist is frequently involved with the initial diagnosis of this disease because of the chronic and recurrent pneumonic episodes that often mimic cystic fibrosis, there is a dearth of radiographic literature available concerning this syndrome. Kirkpatrick and Riley in 1957 discussed the general radiographic findings (10). They found that chronic bronchopneumonia was the most common and important radiographic feature. They also reported the skeletal changes of abnormal and retarded growth, of kyphoscoliosis, and of traumatic sequelae in a large percentage of their cases. Of their 7 patients who underwent examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract, none showed any major abnormality, although one patient had nonpersistent pylorospasm. Linde and Westover in 1962 discussed the esophageal and gastric changes seen in their 6 patients (11). Difficulty in swallowing was present in 2.",

His shooting phantom pain disappeared after the first session of breathing-controlled electrical stimulation, and reappeared or was triggered 28 days after an experimental error during which he received sustained electrical stimulation. In other words, painful shooting stimuli may not have been \"cured\" but forgotten and retriggered by a fearful event due to the experimental error. Therefore, this accidental finding provides a unique opportunity to understand sensory and affective components of neuropathic pain, and a novel intervention could modify the affective component of it.

      "abstract": "Dementia and depression are common disorders in old age. Dementia typically manifests itself as a neurodegenerative disease that affects cognitive functions such as memory, orientation and speech. Dementia is common in old age and its frequency increases from 1% in 65 year olds up to 50% beyond 90 years. Depression usually appears as an episodic disease which extends in length from a few weeks up to many years. The core symptoms of depression include depressed mood, loss of interests and pleasure and loss of will to live. Cognitive disorders may accompany depression and are considered separate from dementia, and were thus named pseudo-dementia, presuming that these cognitive disorders will disappear as the depressed mood will remit. Lately it has been documented that depression may precede dementia, particularly in Alzheimer's disease. Although correlation never proves causation we discuss three possibilities, not mutually exclusive: 1) Certain brain changes may manifest first as depression and later as dementia. 2) Depression and dementia have partially overlapping biological causes. 3) Certain biological changes associated with depression may lead to dementia. Dementia and depression show many common biologic features such as white matter changes in the brain, reduction of hippocampus volume, changes in the serotonergic and noradrenalinergic systems and abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",

It refers to a change in cognitive function that is severe enough to compromise an individual's daily function. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) defines dementia as an acquired impairment of cognitive function that includes a decline in memory beyond what would be expected for age and at least one other cognitive function, such as attention, visuospatial skills or language, or a decline in executive functioning such as planning, organization, sequencing, or abstracting. The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities. The deficits should not be accompanied by an impairment of arousal (delirium) or be accounted for by another psychiatric condition, such as depression or schizophrenia.

Teachers sometimes find their students refusing to participate in classroom activities due to “a bad day” or “lack of energy”. They often avoid coming to school and prefer staying at home. Probably, they have depression, which is characterized as the oppression of mental activity, mainly in its emotional-volitional component. Unlike innate neurodiversity, depression is an acquired disorder that can be cured successfully with the help of clinical psychologists or psychiatrists. Nevertheless, it often accompanies the forenamed psychological or neurological disorders.

It is often a chronic, disabling condition that is characterized by a phobic avoidance of most social situations. Social anxiety disorder is the most frequent anxiety disorder (10-15%) that occurs in two subtypes--generalized and specific. It is a disorder that occurs during the adolescence and reflects negatively to the quality of life of an individual. Neurobiological basis of this disorder has not been explored yet. The disorder is frequently burdened with comorbidity with other anxiety disorders, depression and substance-related disorders. Only cognitive-behavioral techniques are desirable in the psychotherapeutic treatment of the disorder and the best results are achieved in combination with pharmacotherapy. The medicaments of choice in the treatment of social anxiety disorder are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Anxiolytics should be used only as a supplementary in the acute phase. Treatment of social anxiety disorder should last at least 3 months up to one year.",

      "title": "Cingulate Cortex Seizures",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epileptic seizures provide a complex contrast to lesions. Destructive lesions typically cause functional deficits. However, the activities of preserved cortical and subcortical areas, released from the influences of the destroyed or impaired tissue, can paradoxically cause focal hyperactivities. Seizures result from excessive synchronous neural discharges that can cause positive (hyperactive such as jerking) or negative (functional impairment such as weakness) changes. Lesions and seizures both provide valuable, but often not straight-forward, insights into brain function. While the correlation between disease and abnormal function is often easily made, the extrapolation from disease to normal function is much more tenuous. Hughling Jackson’s localization of focal motor seizures to primary motor cortex was a remarkable leap for neurology, but his localization of déjà vu, olfactory hallucinations, and dreamy states to the mesial temporal lobe was a larger jump (Jackson, 1931). He recognized in the dreamy states the dual nature of a seizure’s effects on mind. ‘There is not always loss, but there is, I believe, always, at least defect, of consciousness co-existing with over-consciousness (“dreamy state”)’. Just as motor seizures can be excitatory and cause clonic or tonic activity, seizures arising from limbic and associational cortices can cause positive or negative symptoms. When a seizure evokes fear, the paroxysmal occurrence of the emotion without an environmental context is readily identified by the patient.",

Remembering that neurosis means a reaction to something, we, as physicians, must not be content when we label a man neurotic until we have sought behind the scene for the reverse responsible.

The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Chronische Kopfschmerzen, insbesondere chronische Migräne, chronischer Kopfschmerz vom Spannungstyp und Kopfschmerz bei Medikamentenübergebrauch, stellen ein zunehmendes Gesundheitsproblem in unserer Gesellschaft dar. Risikofaktoren für die Entstehung sind v. a. die missbräuchliche Einnahme von Schmerzmitteln, Triptanen und Ergotaminen. Daneben begünstigen auch die hohe Frequenz des primären episodischen Kopfschmerzes, psychiatrische Komorbiditäten wie Depressionen und Angststörungen, niedriger sozialer Status, Adipositas aber auch die Einnahme von Koffein ihr Auftreten. Die genauen pathophysiologischen Entstehungsmechanismen chronischer Kopfschmerzen liegen dabei noch größtenteils im Dunkeln. Erste Erklärungsansätze beinhalten genetische Mutationen, Modifikation der trigeminalen Schmerzverarbeitung, pharmakologische sowie funktionelle und strukturelle zerebrale Veränderungen. Auch ein erhöhter Liquordruck wird als mögliche kausale Ursache chronischer Kopfschmerzen diskutiert. Dieser Artikel will die bisher bekannten pathophysiologischen Mechanismen chronischer Kopfschmerzerkrankungen beleuchten und für die weitere Therapie hoffnungsvolle Behandlungsansätze aufzeigen.",

      "abstract": "RésuméOn présente ici l'évolution des recherches empiriques sur les effets de la chirurgie psychiatrique depuis 1935. Les anciennes techniques de leucotomie frontale aveugle se sont avérées insatisfaisantes; on y avait directement recours surtout contre les psychoses schizophréniques chroniques, mais ces psychoses n'étaient pas soulagées dans l'essentiel de leur symptomatologie par de tels moyens; d'autre part, ces techniques provoquaient des lésions dans la convexité frontale supérolatérale et, de ce fait, étaient la cause de différentes formes de détérioration de la personnalité regroupées sous le syndrome post-leucotomique. Toutefois, durant les vingt dernières années, on a vu se dessiner une indication plus nette des syndromes psychiatriques spécifiques soulagés par lésions limbiques stéréotaxiques précises et judicieuses.Les lésions orbito-frontales, combinées parfois avec des lésions antérieures du cingulum, diminuent les syndromes dépressifs chroniques avec anxiété, syndromes qui sont réfractaires aux autres formes de thérapie. Fait à noter, on constate, dans plus de 50% de ces cas, la disparition permanente des symptomes, que la région visée soit antérieure (déconnexion thalamo-frontale) ou plus postérieure, dans la substantia innominata (déconnexion du système limbique de son extension frontale régulatrice et adaptatrice). Les lésions du cingulum antérieur donnent de bons résultats pour les états obsessionnels d'apparition tardive, surtout lorsqu'ils sont associés à des caractères affectifs et à une atteinte puerpérale. Il semble bien, mais sans certitude, que bon nombre des cas d'aggressivité homicide irrésistible et explosive sont favorablement influencés par une amygdalotomie bilatérale ou par une hypothalamotomie postérieure. Bien différentes des premières opérations aveugles, les lésions limbiques stéréotaxiques précises actuellement pratiquées font apparaître une augmentation post-opératoire de l'intelligence, mesurée à l'échelle Wechsler; elles n'entraînent pas d'extraversion pathologique, mais induisent une baisse du névrosisme.",

Grief occurs not only after a death, but also during chronic or serious illness, infertility, divorce, job changes, surgery, rape, and so forth. Some patients somatize distress, presenting with physical symptoms rather than acknowledging their grief. Bereavement increases the risk of both psychiatric and physical disease and can exacerbate pre-existing illness. In the majority, grief resolves normally, but in some the process becomes morbid. The family physician is in a unique position to identify, educate, assess, and intervene with the grieving patient and his family.",

Migraine headaches, for example, can be terrible. Try to deeply understand the patient’s life to figure out what matters most. (2) Ask the collateral source what is causing the most problems in the patient’s life. Often it is mood instability. “He’s not the same person” is a common complaint. Sometimes, the most important problems following concussion are not immediately apparent to the patient. (3) Look for the “top of the cascade”—one single problem that is the root cause of one or more additional problems. For example, sleep disruption can in turn worsen memory, attention, pain, mood disorders and many other symptoms. Major depression can impair virtually every aspect of life including energy, sleep, pain, attention, and memory.",

The sleep disturbance causes significant distress or impairment of functioning. There may be a feeling of having been awake all night even when getting some sleep.\n\nPeople with comorbid disorders of physical or mental health, such as depression, have higher rates of insomnia. Depression and sleep disturbance are the first and third most common psychological reasons for patient encounters in general practice.4 Untreated, insomnia increases the risk of development or exacerbation of anxiety, depression, hypertension, and diabetes.5 6 This article outlines current concepts in insomnia and provides up to date information on treatment.\n\nMost people will experience sleep disturbance or acute insomnia at some point in any given year. This often occurs around predictable times of stress or when sleep patterns are disrupted, such as with travel, busy periods at work, illness, or emotional upset. While people may be distressed about sleep loss during acute insomnia, once the trigger factors are removed, sleep usually returns to normal.\n\nInsomnia becomes chronic when someone has difficulty either getting to sleep or staying asleep for at least three nights a week (not necessarily every night) for at least three months and is distressed by their sleep symptoms. …",

Third, implicated brain systems must have behavioral functions that fit the psychological characteristics actually seen in schizophrenia. In each case, the evidence is weak or equivocal. However, this does not mean that neurogenic interpretations are untenable. Instead, the primacy of problems associated with the first condition, the need to parse schizophrenia and reduce heterogeneity, must be recognized. Progress in understanding schizophrenia depends on a neurobehavioral approach to resolving the heterogeneity problem.",

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

The epidemiology of chronic illness is not straightforward. The incidence (i.e. number of new cases) may be difficult to assess as the onset is often insidious or not obvious. In many examples there is a spectrum of disease activity and the point at which one is classified as a case is arbitrary, often depending upon individual ‘symptom thresholds’, or other cultural or medical factors. The prevalence (i.e. number of existing cases) may be difficult to assess as the disease may follow a variable course, including changes in severity, remission (i.e. temporary abatement), relapse, recovery, and recurrence. Nonetheless, it is important to have some indicators of both incidence and prevalence to inform both consulting room discussions and health service planning. In general, as opposed to acute diseases, chronic diseases have a low incidence and a relatively high prevalence (See also Chapter 3.).",

      "title": "Pathology of the Epilepsies",
      "abstract": "The pathology of epilepsy is a complex and evolving field, reflecting both rapid developments in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, and the continued difficulties in translating electrical and functional phenomena into traditional categories of morphological disease. A seizure is an acute neurological event due to sudden excessive disorderly discharge of neurons.1 Lesions that are presumed to cause seizures can be either structural, definable by morphological techniques such as radiology and anatomic pathology, or functional, definable by clinical localization, electrophysiology, and, in some cases, functional imaging defining a focus. Causality is inferred by correlation of morphological findings and location with clinical and electrophysiological data and, in some cases, by the cessation of subsequent seizures after removal of the lesion or focus. Epilepsy is intermittent recurrence of seizures. The finding of structural lesions in some forms of epilepsy suggests and supports causality, but our understanding of the chain between the definable structural lesion and the recurrence of seizures is often less clear.2 Causality may be particularly difficult to determine in conditions producing multiple structural lesions such as tuberous sclerosis, where one lesion is epileptogenic and other similar lesions are not. Even determining how a particular electrically active focus propagates to evolve into a particular seizure or series of intractable seizures is also incompletely understood. To add to the difficulty, seizures or epilepsy itself can be causal, resulting in progressive brain damage and self-perpetuating seizures, particularly in some forms of temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, some treatments for epilepsy themselves have been associated with some forms of brain damage.",

      "abstract": "A young couple present to their general practitioner worried that their 4 month old baby’s head “doesn’t quite look right.”\n\nWhat specifically is worrying the parents?— Parents sometimes get concerned that their baby’s head looks smaller or bigger than it should be, is flattened on one side, or is bumpy in places; they may also be worried about the presence or size of the “soft spot” (fontanelle).\n\nIs it posture related?— Many babies have a postural asymmetry of the head (plagiocephaly). The main risk factor is the baby’s preferred resting head position, both in utero and in the first few months after birth, while the skull bones are still malleable.\n\nAre other family members affected?— Microcephaly (head circumference 97th centile) can run in families and are generally without consequence. Spontaneous microcephaly is often indicative of a serious underlying problem such as a neurodevelopmental disorder or craniosynostosis (premature fusion of sutures). Although spontaneous macrocephaly is seldom of clinical relevance, identifying secondary causes is important as this may be due to increased intracranial volume, such as in hydrocephalus or a subdural haematoma as a result of birth trauma, or more rarely congenital tumours. A wide fontanelle that is bulging or other sutures widely open can indicate clinically important macrocephaly, as would any evidence of neurodevelopmental issues such as altered tone or convulsions.\n\nDo the parents have any concerns about the baby’s development?— If so, this may indicate a serious underlying cerebral problem.\n\nAre parents consanguineous?— Metabolic disorders and syndromic disorders occur more commonly in children from …",

      "title": "The molecular fundamentals of neurorehabilitation and their modulation by thyroid hormones",
      "abstract": "Neurological disorders affect a large population, often leading to different levels of disability and resulting in a decreased quality of life. Neurorehabilitation is the process of restoring the functions of the nervous system after injuries, diseases, or other impairments. The molecular basis of neurorehabilitation includes various aspects such as changes in gene expression, regulation of synaptic connections, nerve cell growth, and repair, among others. Typical objectives in rehabilitating the patient with neurologic disease are to minimize pain, reestablish normal neural pathways, prevent secondary complications, and ultimately improve quality of life. It is also essential not to worsen neurologic function or pain in patients with spinal instability. A decreased free triiodothyronine and thyroid stimulating hormone levels upon admission may predict an unfavorable outcome at the end of early rehabilitative treatment. Thus, thyroid hormone levels are not only important during acute treatment but also in prolonged critical illness. Thyroid hormones, specifically thyroxine and triiodothyronine, can influence these molecular processes through their receptors in nervous tissue. Thyroid hormones are essential for the normal functioning of the nervous system, including neurogenesis (the formation of new neurons) and synaptic plasticity (changes in the strength and structure of connections between neurons). Research has shown that thyroid hormones can affect the expression of genes related to the growth and survival of neurons, as well as synaptic plasticity processes, which may be relevant for rehabilitation after nervous system injuries. A deficiency of thyroid hormones such as in hypothyroidism can lead to disturbances in the development and functioning of the nervous system, which, in turn, can complicate the neurorehabilitation process. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of neurorehabilitation and the influence of thyroid hormones can help improve approaches to the rehabilitation of patients with various nervous system impairments.",

      "abstract": "The syndrome of pituitary cachexia has been so completely described and the literature concerning it so thoroughly reviewed in the recent American literature by Silver (1) and Calder (2) that a detailed description of it is unnecessary here. The disease, briefly, is characterized by progessive weight loss and cachexia, loss of libido and potentia, falling of axillary and pubic hair, premature menopause, decrease in basal metabolism, trophic changes in the skin and mental torpor with frequent terminal coma accompanied by hyperpyrexia. Eosinophilia and gastrointestinal disturbances with achlorhydria are not uncommon. Women are affected more frequently than men (about 70 per cent of reported cases) and the symptoms often begin insidiously after a prolonged or difficult labor. The course is chronic, sometimes extending over many years. The primary lesion involves the anterior pituitary; it may be due to a nonspecific atrophy or fibrosis, the degenerative phase of an adenoma or other neoplasm, cysts, tuberculosis, syphilis, or trauma. In a few reported cases no definite structural change has been found in the anterior pituitary; in some instances extension of an adjacent mass lesion occurs, as in the case reported by A. Weinstein (3) in which invasion of an ependymal glioma produced the symptoms. On the other hand, extensive destruction of the anterior pituitary may occur without the syndrome of Simmonds disease. Kaminski (4) has recently described such destruction from extension of a chronic actinomycoticosteomyelitis of the malar bone, invading the basal meninges and pituitary fossa, without any evidence of glandular dysfunction except testicular atrophy. Kaminski attempts to differentiate between ‘exogenous’ and ‘endogenous’ types of pituitary dysfunction, believing that the ‘endogenou’ type is more apt to produce the Simmond’s syndrome.",

      "title": "DYT1 Early-Onset Isolated Dystonia",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics DYT1 early-onset isolated dystonia typically presents in childhood or adolescence and only on occasion in adulthood. Dystonic muscle contractions causing posturing or irregular tremor of a leg or arm are the most common presenting findings. Dystonia is usually first apparent with specific actions such as writing or walking. Over time, the contractions frequently (but not invariably) become evident with less specific actions and spread to other body regions. No other neurologic abnormalities are present. Disease severity varies considerably even within the same family. Isolated writer's cramp may be the only sign. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DYT1 dystonia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous TOR1A pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. A TOR1A three base-pair deletion, c.907_909delGAG, is identified in most affected individuals. Management Treatment of manifestations: Oral medications, either alone or in combination, are usually tried first, including anticholinergics, baclofen, benzodiazepines, and others. Botulinum toxin injections for treatment of focal symptoms can be used in conjunction with oral medications. If oral medications and botulinum toxin injections do not provide sufficient control of symptoms, surgery enabling deep-brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus interna (GPi) should be considered. Prevention of secondary complications: Aggressive medical and surgical intervention to prevent contractures of the joints and deformities of the spine. Surveillance: Follow up with a neurologist specializing in movement disorders several times a year. Agents/circumstances to avoid: The extremities affected by dystonia should not be placed in a brace or cast, unless medically necessary, as this can worsen the dystonia. Genetic counseling DYT1 dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. Offspring of an affected individual or of an asymptomatic individual known to have a TOR1A pathogenic variant have a 50% chance of inheriting the variant and if inherited a 30% chance of developing clinical findings. Once the TOR1A c.907_909delGAG deletion has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis for DYT1 dystonia are possible.",

Quando persiste por mais de 3 meses passa a ser considerada crônica, trazendo morbidade, perda de qualidade de vida e aumentando o risco de outras doenças, como transtornos de humor. Quando falamos de dor crônica, várias classes de medicamentos podem estar indicadas para o seu tratamento, sendo importante entender a farmacologia e características de cada uma para poder individualizar o tratamento e minimizar os efeitos adversos. Os antidepressivos atualmente são considerados peças fundamentais para o tratamento da dor crônica, já que são capazes de modular as vias de dor e reduzir a amplificação dolorosa. Os principais exemplos são os tricíclicos, que aumentam a capacidade da via descendente inibitória da dor, e os duais (inibidores da recaptação da serotonina e noradrenalina), hoje aprovados para o tratamento da fibromialgia e da dor neuropática. Os relaxantes musculares podem ser considerados como adjuvantes no tratamento da dor crônica, sendo boas opções terapêuticas em doenças que causam dor associada à contratura ou espasmos musculares. Já os opioides são uma das principais escolhas no tratamento da dor moderada a intensa, principalmente para a dor de caráter nociceptivo e para a dor oncológica. O conhecimento dos fármacos destas classes é especialmente importante no que tange à escolha da dose, intervalo de administração e efeitos colaterais. Unitermos: Dor crônica. Fibromialgia. Opioides.

The factors initiating the headache included disturbed family patterns, family phobia, differential parenting styles including over expectations or ignoring. The heavy school work lead to fear of studies that in turn affected the attendance and the scholastic performance. To some extent, the surrounding environmental factors also lead to difficulty in social adjustment. These certain issues lead to stress headaches for most of the children almost every day.

      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

      "title": "Nail-Associated Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors: Habit-Tic Nail Deformity, Onychophagia, and Onychotillomania",
      "abstract": "Habit-tic nail deformity, onychophagia (also referred to as nail biting) and onychotillomania (also referred to as nail picking) are body-focused repetitive behaviors that can involve the nails and periungual skin. Patients with habit-tic nail deformity are typically unaware that repeatedly using their nail, often the adjacent index finger, to rub the proximal nail fold and its underlying matrix - usually of one or both of their thumbnails - is the cause of the longitudinal depressed groove that extends along the entire the nail plate. Nail biters usually bite multiple nails - most commonly on the digits of the hands - and the patient is cognizant of their behavior. However, the term onychophagia is a misnomer and onychodaxia would be a more appropriate nomenclature. Nail pickers also often realize that their dystrophic nail results from using other nails or tools to pick, pull, or excessively manicure the affected nail. Individuals with habit-tic nail deformity or onychophagia or onychotillomania may concurrently have other repetitive behaviors involving the skin or the hair or both. Three patients with a nail-associated body-focused repetitive behavior are described who not only presented with dystrophy of their nails but also abnormalities of the adjacent nail apparatus: a 36-year-old woman with habit-tic nail deformity and dermatodaxia, a 64-year-old man with biting of both the nails and the skin, and a 63-year-old man with nail picking and skin picking. The nail dystrophy and concurrent skin biting or skin picking were not the issues that prompted the reported patients to seek evaluation by a physician; the body-focused repetitive behaviors of the nails and skin were incidental findings during their cutaneous examination. The management of nail-associated body-focused repetitive behavior may include non-pharmacologic treatments (such as physical modalities and behavior modifications) and/or pharmacologic agents. The reported woman with habit-tic nail deformity was willing to consider an attempt to modify her repetitive behavior by using paper tape as a physical modality to cover the area on her thumbs that she would unconsciously rub. However, similar to the men in this report with onychophagia and onychotillomania, many of the patients with nail-focused repetitive behaviors do not want to initiate any interventions that might decrease or eliminate their nail condition.",

      "abstract": "So EC: Facial nerve paralysis after cervical traction. Cervical traction is a frequently used treatment in rehabilitation clinics for cervical spine problems. This modality works, in principle, by decompressing the spinal cord or its nerve roots by applying traction on the cervical spine through a harness placed over the mandible (Olivero et al., Neurosurg Focus 2002;12:ECP1). Previous reports on treatment complications include lumbar radicular discomfort, muscle injury, neck soreness, and posttraction pain (LaBan et al., Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1992;73:295–6; Lee et al., J Biomech Eng 1996;118:597–600). Here, we report the first case of unilateral facial nerve paralysis developed after 4 wks of intermittent cervical traction therapy. Nerve conduction velocity examination revealed a peripheral-type facial nerve paralysis. Symptoms of facial nerve paralysis subsided after prednisolone treatment and suspension of traction therapy. It is suspected that a misplaced or an overstrained harness may have been the cause of facial nerve paralysis in this patient. Possible causes were (1) direct compression by the harness on the right facial nerve near its exit through the stylomastoid foramen; (2) compression of the right external carotid artery by the harness, causing transient ischemic injury at the geniculate ganglion; or (3) coincidental herpes zoster virus infection or idiopathic Bell's palsy involving the facial nerve.",

Scientifically, fainting is called a «syncope» state (the word «syncope» comes from the Greek syn meaning «with, together» and koptein — «to cut off, tear off»), and is characterized by a short-term loss of consciousness against the background of transient hypoperfusion of the brain and a drop in muscle tone. The duration of loss of consciousness is usually 20–30 seconds, after which people come to their senses on their own. After fainting, feelings of general weakness, overexhaustion, and fatigue are possible; for elderly people, the occurrence of retrograde amnesia is typical. In the vast majority of cases, syncope is of reflex origin, and only about 15 % of fainting is associated with pathology of the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Notably, in some cases the cause of syncope cannot be established [4].",

The otological pathology in the former case is useful for investigating the internal pathology and sometimes for delivering correct diagnosis. On the contrary, in the latter case, it does not offer elements for any etiopathogenic hypothesis because it happens in almost all cases with an acute onset in an otherwise healthy subject and it is always underestimated because of the minor functional impairment. However, clinical studies in the last years led to a significant evolution of otological findings as an early important symptom in the etiopathogenic study and in the diagnosis of some internal diseases. This is true for connectivitis, in which the disease is often preceded by a sudden cochleovestibular symptom, in some dismetabolic or vascular diseases that sometimes begin with fluctuating hearing loss, or in some cochlear manifestations due to ototoxic origin.",

The predominant feature of this impairment was a supernormal rate of unreinforced (S(Delta)) behavior. Shocks delivered without exteroceptive warning also led to a discriminative breakdown. The effect was a direct function of shock intensity. When behavior was strongly suppressed in the third stimulus by response-correlated shock (\"punishment\"), instead of unavoidable shock, breakdowns were only temporary; as soon as responding recovered from its overall suppression, discriminative performance returned to normal. The discriminative deterioration may be interpreted as an emotional by-product of frequent aversive stimulation, but accidental contingencies could also have played a role.",

      "title": "A review of trisomy X (47,XXX)",
      "abstract": "Trisomy X is a sex chromosome anomaly with a variable phenotype caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome in females (47,XXX instead of 46,XX). It is the most common female chromosomal abnormality, occurring in approximately 1 in 1,000 female births. As some individuals are only mildly affected or asymptomatic, it is estimated that only 10% of individuals with trisomy X are actually diagnosed. The most common physical features include tall stature, epicanthal folds, hypotonia and clinodactyly. Seizures, renal and genitourinary abnormalities, and premature ovarian failure (POF) can also be associated findings. Children with trisomy X have higher rates of motor and speech delays, with an increased risk of cognitive deficits and learning disabilities in the school-age years. Psychological features including attention deficits, mood disorders (anxiety and depression), and other psychological disorders are also more common than in the general population. Trisomy X most commonly occurs as a result of nondisjunction during meiosis, although postzygotic nondisjunction occurs in approximately 20% of cases. The risk of trisomy X increases with advanced maternal age. The phenotype in trisomy X is hypothesized to result from overexpression of genes that escape X-inactivation, but genotype-phenotype relationships remain to be defined. Diagnosis during the prenatal period by amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling is common. Indications for postnatal diagnoses most commonly include developmental delays or hypotonia, learning disabilities, emotional or behavioral difficulties, or POF. Differential diagnosis prior to definitive karyotype results includes fragile X, tetrasomy X, pentasomy X, and Turner syndrome mosaicism. Genetic counseling is recommended. Patients diagnosed in the prenatal period should be followed closely for developmental delays so that early intervention therapies can be implemented as needed. School-age children and adolescents benefit from a psychological evaluation with an emphasis on identifying and developing an intervention plan for problems in cognitive/academic skills, language, and/or social-emotional development. Adolescents and adult women presenting with late menarche, menstrual irregularities, or fertility problems should be evaluated for POF. Patients should be referred to support organizations to receive individual and family support. The prognosis is variable, depending on the severity of the manifestations and on the quality and timing of treatment.",

Malocclusion disturb the aesthetic appearance of the patient, causing functional disorders and pathological changes. The problem ofprevention and treatment ofdentoalveolar anomalies has not only medical, but also a social value. Many patients understand the needfor timely treatment to the dentist. Beautiful and straight teeth have become part of modern life, his well-being, health and social status. Any abnormalities always affect the psyche. Patients with dental system pathology suffer from changes in appearance, violations of phonetics, chewing function and this formed the difficulties in communication. Mental and emotional state plays an important role in human life, which affects the predictions of success and the development of treatments. Do not unimportant role in the treatment plays a dentist, his mood affects the man, and he has concluded on the basis of suggestion or self-hypnosis. The mood doctor can specifically change the whole picture of the disease, and set up a patient in a positive way. Therefore, the physician should become familiar with the individual characteristics of the patient and adjust it to the correct understanding of the disease that would yield results.",

The diagnosis is usually straight-forward on clinical grounds, but whereas sleep paralysis is non-specific, it is difficult to sustain a diagnosis without cataplexy (Parkes et al., 1995). ‘Jelly attacks’ with laughter, or in the anticipation of laughter, is how it is often described, and the muscles around the face might jerk.",

      "title": "What attitude towards a patient with somatoform disorder?",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of a somatic symptom disorder must be based on both a negative approach - eliminating another psychiatric or non-psychiatric disorder that would better explain the symptoms - and a positive one, which is, based on the search for characteristic thoughts, emotions or behaviours as well as biological or psychological factors that may promote, trigger or sustain the disorder. Additional tests and specialized medical consultations should not be prescribed solely to reassure the patient; they may actually worsen the condition. The management will move away from the outdated notion of \"medically unexplained symptoms\" to rely on: the acknowledgment of the painful, debilitating and involuntary nature of the symptoms; the proposal of a positive diagnosis acceptable by the patient and an explanatory model compatible with his or her representations, aimed at putting an end to dysfunctional health care utilization; the proposal of therapeutic objectives aimed at functional rather than symptomatic recovery; the negotiation of pharmacological (selective or mixed serotonin reuptake inhibitor if necessary) and non-pharmacological interventions, especially when it comes to limiting the factors that sustain the disorder; the coordination of the various healthcare professionals.Le diagnostic de trouble somatoforme doit reposer sur une démarche tout autant négative – éliminer un autre trouble psychiatrique ou non psychiatrique qui expliquerait mieux les symptômes – que positive, c’est-à-dire fondée sur la recherche de pensées, d’émotions ou de comportements caractéristiques et de facteurs biologiques ou psychologiques pouvant favoriser, déclencher ou pérenniser le trouble. Examens complémentaires et avis médicaux spécialisés ne doivent pas avoir pour seul but de rassurer le patient ; ils peuvent en effet s’avérer iatrogènes. La prise en charge doit se détourner de la notion désuète de « symptômes médicalement inexpliqués » pour s’appuyer sur : la reconnaissance du caractère pénible, invalidant et non volontaire des symptômes ; la proposition d’un diagnostic positif acceptable et d’un modèle explicatif compatible avec les représentations du patient, visant à mettre un terme à l’errance diagnostique ; la proposition d’objectifs thérapeutiques visant un rétablissement fonctionnel plus que symptomatique ; la négociation des moyens pharmacologiques (inhibiteur sélectif ou mixte de recapture de la sérotonine si nécessaire) et non pharmacologiques, en particulier la lutte contre les facteurs d’entretien du trouble ; la coordination des soins entre les divers intervenants",

      "title": "Kronična migrena kao socioekonomski problem današnjice",
      "abstract": "Chronic migraine (CM) is a disabling primary headache with the prevalence in the world between 0.9 to 5.1%. It is defined by ICHD-3 criteria as headache that lasts 15 or more days per month for at least 3 months while an 8 days headache per month fulfills the criteria for migraine. CM is typically a progressive episodic migraine (EM), ranging 2.5 – 3 % per year, with a slowly increase in headache frequency and migraine associated symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia). There are several risk factors that increase the risk of transformation in CM. One of them is the excessive use of medication, which initiated the discussion regarding the causal or consequential association with CM or with chronic daily headache (CDH). It is believed that CM is, among the four types of CDH, the most debilitating type of long duration CDH (the duration of seizures ≥4 hours), and also a most common form of CDH. Compared with episodic migraine, patients with CM have a significantly lower productivity and more frequent absences from work, school, social activities, and generally reduced quality of life. Also, compared to EM, CM patients visit physicians more often, either due to primary disease, or because of numerous comorbidities. It is estimated that the total cost is four times higher than in patients with EM. Pathophysiologically, frequent headache attacks induce pain modulation system and anatomical damage. As the frequency of headaches rises, the recovery of neurological functions between headache episodes becomes less sufficient. Unfortunately, CM is often an undiagnosed and untreated disorder. In therapy, multidisciplinary approach is essential. In addition to the mandatory prophylactic treatment for reducing migraine attacks, it is necessary to decrease risk factors and comorbidities and also to limit the intake of acute symptomatic drugs. ----- The aim of this paper is to emphasize the importance of socioeconomic aspect of CM through the comparison with EM, underlining the importance of risk factors in transformation into the CM. Also, this paper will present an overview of the changes in classification and nomenclature and give a review of the pathophysiological changes, diagnosis and treatment of CM, based on the most recent evidences.",

The content of obsessions is ego‐dystonic, meaning that they are experienced as intrusive, unwanted, and generally inconsistent with one's self‐image, values, beliefs, and behaviors. Obsessions differ from ego‐syntonic thoughts about everyday problems (e.g., recurrent thoughts or worries about finances, occupation, relationships, and the like) and should be distinguished from the “brooding” ruminations that are common in depression. Typical obsessions include doubts about whether one did something adequately (e.g., turned off the stove); intrusive sexual, aggressive, or religious thoughts or images (e.g., horrific image of stabbing a friend); thoughts about contamination; and excessive concerns about symmetry or exactness. Individuals with Obsessive‐Compulsive Disorder (OCD) experience frequent obsessions that are severe enough to cause significant functioning impairment and try to suppress or neutralize their obsessions with other thoughts or compulsive actions. Unlike individuals with psychotic or delusional disorders, individuals with OCD generally recognize their obsessions as senseless and know that the obsessions originate in their own minds.",

      "title": "Anger Disorders",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Anger is a frequently experienced emotion for most people (1). When mild to moderate in intensity and expressed in constructive, nonhostile ways, anger can lead to positive, adaptive behaviors such as expressing feelings; asserting one's rights, thoughts, and feelings; problem solving; redressing concerns; setting appropriate limits on the behavior of others; and motivating effective behavior (1,2). Anger, however, is a double-edged sword, often leading to many negative outcomes. For example, chronic anger and hostility are associated with health problems such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, compromised immune functioning, dental problems, and overall mortality (3). Intense anger is often associated with marital discord, abusive parenting, intimate partner violence, and other relationship problems (4,5). Anger has also been implicated in school violence, bullying, and disrupted teen relations. Anger may also lead to major or minor property damage (4), and an overall propensity to aggression and violence (6). Anger is also associated with reduced work effectiveness and problems such as being placed on probation, demotion, and termination (7). For some angry individuals, their anger is totally externalized and entirely justified, leaving their sense of self untouched. For others, however, their anger impairs their sense ofpsychological well-being; they feel out of control and overwhelmed by their anger and feel anxious, embarrassed, guilty, ashamed, and depressed by their anger and anger-related reactions. While these are but a few examples, anger and its dysfunctional expression affects the physical, psychological, interpersonal, educational, and vocational lives of many people.",

      "abstract": "Stereopsis is the ability to perceive the visual objects in depth (in the third dimension), which occurs when horizontally disparate retinal images are stimulated simultaneously. The fusion of such disparate images results in a single visual impression perceived in as depth. It has been now more than three decades, the real significance of stereoscopic vision was questioned, and today it is evident that it is crucial for visuomotor coordination and fine and precise task in our day to day life.[1] Stereopsis is disrupted by blur (refractive error), amblyopia, and strabismus due to the inability to form high-quality foveal images in both eyes. Refractive error is the most prevalent ocular pathology in the general population, and uncorrected anisometropia is seen frequently.[2] The graded increase in anisometropia, there is a proportionate decrease in stereoacuity, which has been proven without a doubt by several studies on the effect of experimental anisometropia and stereopsis.[3] Acquired anisometropia, leading to monovision, can be therapeutic or iatrogenic. We have used it, especially for presbyopia treatment, with contact lenses, refractive surgery, and Iatrogenic anisometropia can occur even after any intraocular surgical procedure. Having understood the stereoscopic vision and the effect of anisometropia, we can take advantage of this faculty of stereopsis for professions like ours as an ophthalmic surgeon, requiring heightened visual function and good hand-eye coordination. In today's world, with the emergence of virtual classrooms, 3D movies, and games, the training in ophthalmology surgery has shown a paradigm shift from pure apprenticeship towards surgical simulators and wet laboratories.[4] Multiple studies have shown that surgical simulators help to shorten the learning curve of the residents, decrease surgical morbidity by reducing the risk of iatrogenic trauma to ocular tissues, and overall surgical performance in ophthalmic surgery like phacoemulsification.[45] There have been instances of questioning the accuracy of the simulation of tissue anatomy, no objective assessment, repeatability, and reproducibility.[67] This has been addressed to a greater extent by the recent development of computer simulators like VRMagic EYESiOphthalmosurgical Simulator (VRmagic Holding AG, Mannheim, Germany). This device provides a real-life situation using the virtual reality technique along with didactic instructions.[7] There are no studies that evaluate the impact of uncorrected anisometropia on the stereopsis of these patients and their ability to perform the delicate task. In this issue of the journal, Singh et al. tried to address this by studying the anisometropia induced loss of stereopsis with its effect on tasks that require binocular vision and stereopsis, such as ophthalmic surgery in a simulated environment. The authors recommend that refractive correction is of paramount importance for ophthalmic surgeons because even 1D of anisometropia leads to a drop in surgical scores in a simulated virtual environment. It would also be prudent to include stereopsis as a regular part of the screening procedure for candidates pursuing professions that require skilled and delicate visuomotor tasks.[8] To put things in perspective, Singh et al.'s study does show the statistically significant deterioration with increasing values of each diopter of induced anisometropia for spherical as well as cylindrical lenses. However, the results of this study have to be carefully interpreted in the background of the small sample size; results might vary in cases with long-standing uncorrected anisometropia. Also, the impact of aniseikonia due to higher anisometropia, and the most important is the measurement of surgical task scores in a simulated environment can predict but not precisely reproduce the measuring surgical proficiency in a real-life situation. In the context of surgical training of ophthalmology residents in India, this study would highlight the importance of possible use of the virtual reality to improve the performance of ophthalmic surgeries by increasing the skills of the novice residents and shortening their learning curve. The future is not far away from establishing a single wet laboratory center with virtual reality simulators at a regional institute of ophthalmology in every state considering the cost, time, and resources. This wet lab center could cater through the skill transfer program for the medical colleges in rotation during the first years of their residency program.",

      "title": "The concussion crisis in the national hockey league",
      "abstract": "Litigation against the National Hockey LeaguePresently, the culture of sports praises athletes who persevere through injury and personal hardship. As a result, an athlete may do whatever it takes to achieve recognition, thereby reducing the importance of possible future consequences as being inconsequential. A prime example of an athlete doing whatever it takes to make it in professional sports may be the case of NHL hockey player, Derek Boogaard.Boogard v. National Hockey League (2013)Athletes have been known not to report their own concussions because of the win at all cost mentality, their desire to continue to play or worry about losing a spot on the (Shoalts, 2011). The machismo culture of many sports which has been described as -uniformly aggressive and humourlessly chauvinistic (Giulianotti, 1999, p. 155), could contribute to athletes being over-motivated thereby pushing themselves beyond their normal physical capabilities. On numerous occasions, players, coaches, or broadcasters refer to the warrior mentality of the athletes. Often those who incur a concussion and do not report it or return to play too soon are portrayed as -the hardest worker on the team or determined to prove himself -to be the best. However, that mindset can work against such a player during a violent, collision activity such as hockey.Derek Boogaard was a tough hockey player who died of a prescription drug overdose in Minneapolis, Minnesota on May 13, 2011 at the age of 28. His parents, Len and JoAnne Boogard (last name spelled differently than their son) have sued the NHL Players Association alleging that the NHL was negligent in monitoring Derek Boogaard for brain trauma during his NHL career. The complaint further states that the brain trauma caused chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) as well as pain and suffering and loss of a normal life (Boogard v. National Hockey League, 2013). According the complaint, Boogaard was specifically drafted as an -enforcer on the ice and not for skill in skating or shooting a hockey puck. An enforcer is a person on a hockey whose main assignment is to engage in fist fights with players from the opposing (Boogard v. National Hockey League, 2013). The complaint alleges that Boogaard was drafted by an NHL because of his ability fight which, in turn, would enhance ratings, earnings and exposure of the sport of professional hockey. In fact one hockey owner once quipped, -We're gonna have to do something about all this violence, or people are gonna keep buying tickets (Darby, 1994, B9). After years of fighting on the ice of hockey rinks, Boogaard turned to the doctors who dispensed pain pills without conditions so he could deal with his pain. The complaint further alleged that once Boogaard became addicted to these narcotics, the NHL promised his family that it would take care of him and it did not (Corboy & Demetrio, 2013).Alleged NegligenceThe Boogard complaint alleged that the NHL was negligent in its dealing with Boogaard and other players in the league. According to the Restatement of Torts (1965), negligence is -conduct which falls below the standard established by law for the protection of others against unreasonable risk of (p. 282). A negligent situation is generated when an unreasonable risk of harm through inadvertence is present (Dobbs, 2000). To prove negligence four elements must exist: 1) duty; 2) breach of that duty; 3) proximate cause; and 4) damage. All four elements must exist for negligence to be present (Dobbs, 2000).DutyA duty is a special relationship betweenn two or more parties that may be created by statute, contract, or common law (Dobbs, 2000). Regarding the duty that an organization has for professional athlete, the court in Turcotte v. Fell (1986) reported that the duty of care owed to a professional sports participant was to avoid reckless or intentional conduct, not negligence. The Boogard complaint alleges that the NHL had a duty to inform players about the high rate of injuries resulting from playing professional hockey and the higher rate of injuries sustained by enforcers in the NHL. …",

      "abstract": "Pain is a primary symptom driving patients to seek physical therapy, and its attenuation commonly defines a successful outcome. A large body of evidence is dedicated to elucidating the relationship between chronic stress and pain; however, stress is rarely addressed in pain rehabilitation. A physiologic stress response may be evoked by fear or perceived threat to safety, status, or well-being and elicits the secretion of sympathetic catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinepherine) and neuroendocrine hormones (cortisol) to promote survival and motivate success. Cortisol is a potent anti-inflammatory that functions to mobilize glucose reserves for energy and modulate inflammation. Cortisol also may facilitate the consolidation of fear-based memories for future survival and avoidance of danger. Although short-term stress may be adaptive, maladaptive responses (eg, magnification, rumination, helplessness) to pain or non-pain-related stressors may intensify cortisol secretion and condition a sensitized physiologic stress response that is readily recruited. Ultimately, a prolonged or exaggerated stress response may perpetuate cortisol dysfunction, widespread inflammation, and pain. Stress may be unavoidable in life, and challenges are inherent to success; however, humans have the capability to modify what they perceive as stressful and how they respond to it. Exaggerated psychological responses (eg, catastrophizing) following maladaptive cognitive appraisals of potential stressors as threatening may exacerbate cortisol secretion and facilitate the consolidation of fear-based memories of pain or non-pain-related stressors; however, coping, cognitive reappraisal, or confrontation of stressors may minimize cortisol secretion and prevent chronic, recurrent pain. Given the parallel mechanisms underlying the physiologic effects of a maladaptive response to pain and non-pain-related stressors, physical therapists should consider screening for non-pain-related stress to facilitate treatment, prevent chronic disability, and improve quality of life.",

      "title": "Drug- and cell-based therapies for targeting neuroinflammation in traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "TBI pathology: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by an external force to the head, resulting in trauma to the brain. Approximately 1.7 million Americans suffer from TBI every year. Out of the 1.7 million suffering from TBI, an estimated 52,000 injuries result in death, leaving a mass amount of people with symptoms that could last a few days, a few years, or their entire life (Faul et al., 2010). TBI can be classified as mild, moderate and severe. Depending on the classification and the extent of the injury, TBI can cause both physical symptoms and cognitive disorders (Lozano et al., 2015). The most common physical symptoms include headaches, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, sleep disruption, hearing problems and visual disturbances. Cognitive disorders include attention deficit, memory and executive functioning problems. Brain damage occurs following TBI as a result of direct neural cell loss. Within minutes following the initial injury, secondary cell death occurs, exacerbating the damage and worsening the symptoms (Campolo et al., 2013). Neuroinflammation is one of many factors that can lead to neurodegeneration and cause secondary cell death, indicating that TBI presents with equally debilitating symptoms as a chronic disease in addition to the widely accepted pathological manifestations acutely after injury (DelaPeña et al., 2014). TBI-induced secondary death mechanisms and neuroinflammation: The immune system has a critical role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders, including TBI and neurodegenerative diseases, mitigating the neural environment via cytokines with opposing roles, ones which aid cellular repair and others that drive molecular damage. While the mode of injury in TBI is predominantly ascribed to the acute stage, it is now being recognized that there is a massive chronic neuroinflammation that propagates the secondary cell death over a prolonged period of time after the initial insult (Frugier et al., 2010; Acosta et al., 2013). Chronic neuroinflammation initiates an upsurge of pro-inflammatory cytokines that drive neuronal cell death, increase reactive oxygen species and reduce neurogenesis (Acosta et al., 2014). Patients with a history of TBI require long-term care, and unfortunately a treatment does not yet exist that can ameliorate the long-standing effects of neuroinflammation. Whereas the primary insult in TBI occurs at the moment of impact as mechanical cell destruction (Frugier et al., 2010), the secondary injury commences thereafter and may persist for months and even years via chemical and molecular cell death-propagating processes that impede host brain repair and lead to progressive cell death reminiscent of neurodegeneration with co-morbid symptoms. Following the acute injury, activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 rise, followed by increases in tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) in the ensuing weeks after injury (Frugier et al., 2010). One of the best studied cytokines and the one released in the greatest amounts involved in TBI is IL-6, an important inducer of the acute phase reaction. Immediately following impact in TBI, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of IL-6 have already doubled (Frugier et al., 2010). A diffuse axonal injury coincides with vigorous cytokine response following injury, independent of the macroscopic injury pattern as evidenced in a study of human patients (Frugier et al., 2010). In tandem, inflammation in chronic TBI upregulates active microglia both proximally and distally to the location of injury, a study of chronic TBI by Acosta et al. (2013) demonstrated multiple sites of increased neuroinflammation in sites adjacent to and remote to the injury origin. In addition, there is a decrease in cell proliferation in areas of the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ), sites of endogenous stem cell growth (Acosta, 2013). Current drug treatments for TBI: Currently there are limited treatment options for TBI, leaving most patients relying on rehabilitation therapy. Damage resulting from the initial injury is almost impossible to treat; therefore for this practical reason, the logical target for treatment intervention to afford clinically relevant benefits is to sequester the secondary cell death. Due to the delay in damage derived from secondary cell death, it allows a wide therapeutic window (Lozano et al., 2015). Among the secondary wave of biochemical cascades, targeting neuroinflammation appeals to this extended time for treatment initiation (Lozano et al., 2015). There have been a variety of drugs that have been reported to reduce inflammation in the central nervous system, including melatonin, minocycline and statins. Melatonin, derived from the pineal gland, has been shown to provide neuroprotection for brain and spinal cord trauma. Melatonin is a lipophilic enzyme, meaning it does not need a specific binding site or a receptor on the cell brain causing the drug to be more flexible than others (Campolo et al., 2013). Melatonin exerts anti-neuroinflammatory effects through its capability to inhibit microglial activation and lower proinflammatory cytokine secretion (Lozano et al., 2015). Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, also possesses anti-inflammatory properties and has been shown as an effective neuroprotective agent in many animal models of neurological disorders. This drug has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier, decrease damaged tissues, and reduce inflammation (Lozano et al., 2015). Minocycline suppresses proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion, and inhibits activation of detrimental microglial cells thereby limiting the progression of secondary cell death (Lozano et al., 2015). Statins have also been demonstrated neuroprotective properties. This class of drugs is typically used to lower cholesterol, but renders inactivation of cell death-associated microglia and astrocytes. With this deactivation, statins are able to dampen the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and improve the inflammatory response in the damaged tissues (Lozano et al., 2015). Stem cell therapy for TBI-mediated neuroinflammation: Neuroinflammation has been observed in TBI patients up to 17 years after the initial impact (Giunta et al., 2012). As discussed previously, this inflammatory response involves immune cells, microglia, cytokines, chemotactic cytokines, and other cells that exacerbate the evolution of cell death temporally and spatially (Lozano et al., 2015). In addition to drugs, stem cell therapy offers a novel option in reducing the aberrant inflammation. While stem cells have been originally explored as a key component of regenerative medicine for brain disorders, including TBI, via their ability to replace dead or dying cells and to stimulate endogenous repair mechanism, accumulating evidence implicates robust anti-inflammatory effects of stem cells (Lozano et al., 2015). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in particular have been widely studied in vitro and in vivo for the treatment of TBI. Co-culture of MSCs with purified immune cells causes an increase in production of the anti-inflammatory interleukins IL-4 and IL-10, while decreasing the amount of TNF-α and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) (Walker et al., 2009). The upregulation of IL-4 along with the decrease in IFN-γ promotes a shift in the helper T cell subsets, from cytotoxic Th1 cells to Th2 cells (Walker et al., 2009). Additionally, a decrement in TNF-α with an elevated IL-10 could lessen the maturation of dendritic cells, while increasing the number of regulatory T cells that promote an anti-inflammatory or tolerant response (Walker et al., 2009). Studies in TBI experimental models have shown that stem cell therapy suppresses inflammation through their secretion of TNF-α-stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6). This secretion interferes with the signaling pathway involved in the activation of toll-like receptors and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), the latter known to be involved in the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Lozano et al., 2015). Thus, the NF-κB pathway is inhibited along with further pro-inflammatory cascades that follow (Lozano, 2015). Other benefits of MSCs in dampening the inflammatory response include the inactivation of hyaluronan, modulating pro-inflammatory cytokines to producing anti-inflammatory cytokines, and limiting the influx of devastating chemokines into the brain (Lozano et al., 2015). Among many other stem cells, human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBCs) also have the potential to treat TBI as evidenced through extensive studies in which inflammation is attenuated. HUCBCs suppress lymphocyte, granulocyte, and monocyte infiltration (Arien-Zakay et al., 2011). Suppression of astrocytic and microglial activation in the parenchyma is also accomplished by transplanted HUCBCs, coincident with an increase in the production of IL-10 and the decrease in IFN-γ (Arien-Zakay et al., 2011). A combination therapy involving stem cells and drugs for arresting inflammation in TBI should also be considered. Stem cells afford neuroprotection, however, they cannot survive in a hostile environment by themselves (Lozano et al., 2015). Adjunctive treatment with growth factors that will improve the environment and further enhance the regeneration of damaged tissue can be achieved by using granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) (Lozano et al., 2015). G-CSF enhances endogenous stem cells and promotes stemness maintenance, affords an anti-inflammatory effect, reduces brain edema, and improves the control of glutamate levels (Lozano et al., 2015). Accordingly, a combination therapy, as opposed to stand-alone treatment, may prove as an optimal regimen to combat neuroinflammation, as well as the other multi-pronged cell death mechanisms in TBI in order to produce a robust and longer-lasting sequestration of progressive neurodegeneration. Future directions of research on neuroinflammation for TBI: Drugs and cell based-therapies are being investigated as potential treatments for TBI. The recognition of acute and chronic phases of TBI is paramount to truly capturing the pathological manifestations of the disease. Among the many secondary cell death processes associated with TBI, neuroinflammation offers a wider therapeutic window. Immune cells, astrocytes, cytokines and chemokines are all necessary for brain repair. However those are the same cells that cause secondary cell death and further damage to TBI when they reach excessive levels. Drugs, such as melatonin, minocycline and statins, may render anti-inflammatory responses in TBI. Stem cell therapy has also emerged as a promising therapeutic intervention for TBI, and recently stem cells been implicated as vehicles of anti-inflammatory factors. Further investigations are necessary to find the optimal regimens for drugs, stem cells, or a combination thereof in order to sequester the TBI-mediated secondary cell death mechanisms, especially inflammation. Discovering, understanding and transitioning secondary cell death factors from being detrimental to serving as an anti-inflammatory brain repair mechanismis likely to provide a therapeutic benefit for TBI.",

      "title": "Readdressing Short Stature in India: The “Long and the Short” of it",
      "abstract": "Stature is one of the widely used indices of overall health and well-being in children. Short stature (SS) can be defined either on the basis of comparison with the normal population (less than 2 SD or the 3rd centile) or with respect to the genetic potential (derived from parental stature) of a given individual. Deviation from standard height percentiles using calculated height velocity is one of the earliest indicators of short stature, irrespective of etiology. SS evaluation is one of the most comprehensive assessments in endocrinology and entails detailed history, physical examination, and biochemical, hormonal, radiological investigations, and genetic testing when indicated. It is also the clinical situation with multiple dilemmas, bearing in mind that 25% to 90% of children referred for short stature are not actually short, reassurance is the treatment of choice in nearly half the cases, and the limited scope of the use of growth hormone (GH) therapy in idiopathic short stature (ISS), Turner syndrome (TS), and skeletal dysplasias.[12] SS is broadly divided into normal variant short stature (NVSS) (which includes constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) and familial short stature (FSS)) or pathological short stature (causes include endocrine, syndromic, or chronic-disease related). However, FSS is increasingly being classified as a pathological variant with the recognition of hitherto undiagnosed genetic conditions such as GH resistance (GHR), collagenopathies, RASopathies, and aggrecan gene mutations.[3] RASopathies denote developmental syndromes occurring due to germline mutations in the Ras–RAF–MEK–ERK/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and include Noonan, Leopard, and the cardio-facio-cutaneous syndromes.[4] Aggrecan is a proteoglycan constituent of the growth plate cartilage and mutations in it have been found to be the underlying cause in a proportion of patients with FSS.[5] Current understanding implicates growth plate chondrocytes as one of the central parameters of both normal growth and normal variations of growth at the intraindividual (pubertal growth spurt) and interindividual (varied normal height in the population) levels. However, there is a lack of evidence on the trends in the etiological spectrum of SS across nationwide studies. Dynamicity in the prevalence and patterns of SS is expected, considering the change in nutritional status, recognition of endocrine causes in primary care settings as well as increasing focus on identifying genetic causes of underlying growth hormone deficiency (GHD) and/or hypopituitarism. Furthermore, whether the age of identification and diagnosis of SS is decreasing, suggesting improved surveillance or awareness of this chronic problem, remains unexplored. Studies reporting the etiology of SS in community or outpatient settings in India were analyzed and stratified on the basis of duration of study and date of publication. There were four studies in the second decade of the twenty-first century, including our unpublished survey in 2191 school children in the community,[678] and two major studies in the first decade.[910] NVSS accounted for the most number of cases of SS. Hypothyroidism was the most common endocrine cause of SS and the second most common cause overall. This evidence was consistent, irrespective of the geographical location (north and south of the country) of the participants. On the other hand, there was a discrepancy in contemporary reports from north India itself, with one study reporting skeletal dysplasia as the most common etiology of SS, followed by ISS and TS in their cohort. The variance, despite a similar time frame and similar geographic location, is intriguing but may be indicative of the settings of the study (genetic referral clinic).[8] Nationwide trends revealed a greater preponderance of pathological SS in the first decade of the twenty-first century, which has transitioned to NVSS over the second decade. The earlier predominance of pathological SS was uniform, irrespective of consecutive admissions or referral for SS.[11] This shift may possibly be due to increased awareness and access to health care, improved trends in nutrition as well as early diagnosis and management of chronic diseases and endocrinological conditions which are implicated in SS. The overall prevalence of hypopituitarism including GHD has seemingly halved with time, from 22.6% in the twentieth century to under 10% in more recent studies, but there are/is no similar evidence available for Turner's syndrome.[910] Pathological SS is expected to be more discernible owing to greater deviations of height from the normal or clinical features associated with the primary condition (systemic or syndromic disease or hormonal cause). Hence, improved knowledge about the problem may be one of the contributors to this transition. Inherent differences between community-based and clinic-based assessments are expected owing to referral bias, as children with greater severity of SS and pathologic causes are more likely to present in hospital settings. Etiological differences may also mirror the socio-economic and literacy status of the community as malnutrition and chronic diseases are more likely to affect children from the lower strata of society. This impact of nutrition on stature is well-evidenced by the fact that the earlier reported entity of GHR, of which poor nutritional status is a cause, is virtually absent from recent studies.[1012] Interestingly, the prevalence of SS has remained virtually unchanged over the past two decades in India (varying from 2.8% to 3.7%). Furthermore, the variability in growth charts between different studies has not posed a significant effect on the overall prevalence of SS. Despite this reassuring data suggesting a transition to a predominantly physiological etiology of SS, the higher age at presentation in some reports is a cause of concern.[7] The authors performed the largest community-based study in the country to generate normative reference range intervals for IGF-1. In this study, stature was assessed among other anthropometric parameters in healthy school-going children in the community between the ages of 5 and 18 years. The final enrolment was 2191 children, with 47.92% (n = 1050) girls. We found a 2.42% (n = 53) prevalence of short stature, as defined by height < 3rd centile on the revised Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) growth charts,[13] and the mean age of diagnosis of SS was 11.8 ± 4.5 years. Based on gender, the prevalence of SS was 2.54% (n = 28) in boys at a mean age of 10.5 ± 4.4 years and 2.38% (n = 25) in girls at a mean age of 13.3 ± 4.2 years. In this SS cohort, low weight (60.7%) and normal weight (39.3%) was noted in boys, but in girls, the major proportion (72%) was constituted by normal-weight individuals. Prepubertal status was present in 58.6% of the boys and 20.8% of the girls. On analyzing the causes, CDGP was present in 28% of the boys irrespective of the chart used to compute bone age (Greulich Pyle (GP) or Tanner Whitehouse (TW) charts), but the prevalence was 12% in girls when using GP charts and 16% when using TW charts. Familial short stature (FSS) was present in a higher proportion in boys (25%) than in girls with SS (20%) when using the IAP criteria and 14.2% and 8% in boys and girls, respectively, when using the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) criteria.[14] Among pathological causes of SS, hypothyroidism was more common in girls (16%) than boys (10.7%). The overall prevalence of celiac disease in the study (defined by IgA anti-TTG) was 1.55% (n = 34), but there were no cases among children with SS. This was most likely attributable to the early pick-up/detection as they were identified in the presymptomatic phase. It may also be due to the fact that the prevalence of the coeliac disease is higher in hospital settings as children with gastrointestinal symptoms or anemia are more likely to seek consultation than in community settings where asymptomatic individuals are much more likely. Its controversial to comment so early as the IGF-1 values mismatch yet to be sorted out soon Our study provides interesting insights into the transition in the profile and etiology of SS, which is possibly reminiscent of an upsurge in economy, education, and access to basic health care in the country. Though the prevalence of SS has remained reasonably stable, it is the metamorphosis in the etiological profile that deserves attention. The gender difference between the age of SS in the community is also intriguing, with girls getting diagnosed at a more advanced chronological age than boys, probably reflecting the social fabric in the community. Prior studies conducted in hospital settings from the north reported a relative preponderance of celiac disease, also presenting with SS as a monosymptomatic presentation. The current report of almost similar overall prevalence of celiac disease, but none of them having SS probably points towards early detection or asymptomatic seropositivity, thereby averting long-term complications such as SS in these children. Among endocrine conditions, the prevalence of hypothyroidism has remained unchanged with time. Community-based data such as ours are the true indicators of the burden of the insidious problem of SS and have furnished contemporary evidence on the prevalence and etiological spectrum of SS. Stature being a continuous accrual and cumulative phenomenon is usually diagnosed later than sooner. One of the early clues for the diagnosis of short stature is a derailment of height velocity, which can be easily obtained from regular anthropometric evaluations in school records. Encouraging and educating schools, institutions, vaccine centers, and primary health care providers about the importance of at least annual anthropometry is another area that may aid in timely diagnosis and referral to tertiary care centers. Furthermore, in children with chronic disease of any etiology, referral to the endocrinologist for further evaluation and ruling out concurrent treatable hormone deficiency such as hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency or resistance, can improve final adult height. National policies to target screening for childhood stunting in identified high-risk areas can also be employed.

Timing of decompression have been stratified into four categories: (1) immediate decompression for those compartmental syndromes whose missed therapy would rapidly lead to patient death or extreme disability, (2) early decompression with the time burden of 3–12 h and in any case before clinical signs of irreversible deterioration, (3) delayed decompression identified with decompression performed after 12 h or after signs of clinical deterioration has occurred, and (4) prophylactic decompression in those situations where high incidence of compartment syndrome is expected after a specific causative event.",

      "abstract": "Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a state of reversible hypogonadism common in adolescents and young women that can be triggered by energy deficit or emotional stress or a combination of these factors. Energy deficit may be a consequence of (i) reduced caloric intake, as seen in patients with eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, or (ii) excessive exercise, when caloric intake is insufficient to meet the needs of energy expenditure. In these conditions of energy deficit, suppression of the hypothalamic secretion of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (with resulting hypoestrogenism) as well as other changes in hypothalamic-pituitary function may occur as an adaptive response to limited energy availability. Many of these adaptive changes, however, are deleterious to reproductive, skeletal, and neuropsychiatric health. Particularly, normoestrogenemia is critical for normal bone accrual during adolescence, and hypoestrogenemia during this time may lead to deficits in peak bone mass acquisition with longstanding effects on skeletal health. The adolescent years are also a time of neurological changes that impact cognitive function, and anxiety and depression present more frequently during this time. Normal estrogen status is essential for optimal cognitive function (particularly verbal memory and executive function) and may impact emotion and mood. Early recognition of women at high risk of developing hypothalamic amenorrhea and its timely management with a multidisciplinary team are crucial to prevent the severe and long-term effects of this condition.",

Hot flashes are the symptoms most frequently related to menopause by both physicians and patients. However, it is one of the less common menopausal symptoms. This symptom reflects the neurochemical brain disorders caused by estrogen deficiency. The central nervous system (CNS) is also involved in changes of body composition leading to higher adipose tissue accumulation during climacterium, deteriorating quality of life and increasing the risk for chronic non-transmittable diseases. Menopausal discomfort also overloads health systems increasing the demand for medical services and decreasing productivity by labor absenteeism.

Getting sober from alcohol or other drugs is one of your first recovery tasks. If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream. You also have to stabilize the acute symptoms of your mood disorder, such as mania, depression, or suicidality. Otherwise, it will be harder to stop using substances.",

Dentre esse quadro clinico, destaca-se a dor cronica, como caracteristica mais marcante, podendo levar a incapacidades laborais e declinio na qualidade de vida.\r\nA fisiopatologia da FM ainda e desconhecida, mas acredita-se que existe uma alteracao no mecanismo central de controle da dor, o qual poderia resultar de uma disfuncao dos neurotransmissores2. Assim, essa disfuncao acarretaria uma deficiencia no sistema de neurotransmissores inibitorios em niveis espinhais ou supraespinhais (serotonina, encefalina e noradrenalina), ou uma hiperatividade de neurotransmissores excitatorios (substância P, glutamato e bradicinina)3.\r\nAtraves da analise dos registros do eletroencefalograma (EEG), pode-se observar nas areas envolvidas no processamento da dor, uma hiperexcitabilidade representando um mecanismo importante na manutencao deste sintoma na FM1.

      "title": "Traumatic Brain Injury When Symptoms Don't Add Up: Conversion and Malingering in the Rehabilitation Setting. (Traumatic Brain Injury)",
      "abstract": "There are occasions in rehabilitation when a person presents with symptoms that are inconsistent, exaggerated, do not fit with any known medical diagnosis, or are frankly unbelievable, leading the rehabilitation specialist to label the person as a malingerer. Often, however, people demonstrate symptoms of a psychological that not malingering - the rehabilitation specialist may actually be observing an unconscious psychological need to be ill in some way, i.e., a that conversion or conversion-like. In the literature, there are few articles discussing the presence of conversion in the rehabilitation setting (Speed, 1996; Teasell & Shapiro, 1994), and there a dearth of literature that explores the difficulty of differentiating between conversion (and conversion-like disorders) and malingering. This paper will focus on the special case of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The authors have found those persons with mild, moderate, and even severe TBIs occasionally present with symptoms that are in excess of or inconsistent with what would be expected for their diagnosis. In the case of mild traumatic brain injury, most people experience symptom resolution within one to three months (Dikmen, McLean, & Temkin, 1986; Gentilini, Nichelli, & Schoenhuber, 1989; Levin, Eisenberg, & Benton, 1989). However, 10% to 15% of people with mild TBIs continue to report persistent deficits and impairment after this three month time period (Alexander, 1995). Understandably, total symptom resolution not expected in persons with moderate to severe TBIs. However, cognitive and functional gains are generally made in a more or less linear fashion over the course of months and years, barring significant medical problems. There have been several reasons conjectured to account for the ongoing and at times excessive complaints of persons with TBI. Psychiatric problems are often thought to contribute to symptom exaggeration (Lishman, 1988). Just as often, persons with TBI are misjudged and accused of malingering. It necessary to explore the conversion versus malingering differential as patients reporting unbelievable symptoms are often incorrectly perceived as malingering and not given the treatment they need. This paper serves to outline conversion, malingering, and related disorders, describe assessment tools used to make a differential diagnosis, delineate two pertinent case studies, and discuss treatment options for persons with TBI who are demonstrating and reporting symptom exaggeration. Conversion Conversion falls under a class of disorders known as the somatoform disorders. The common feature of all somatoform disorders is the presence of physical symptoms that suggest a general medical condition ... and are not fully explained by a general medical condition, by the direct effects of a substance, or by another mental disorder (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), 1994). Conversion the unconscious expression of what thought to be psychological conflict through physical symptoms. The DSM-IV (1994) delineates diagnostic criteria for conversion disorder. Namely, the symptoms must cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning, the deficits presented must be motor or sensory, and the symptoms are not due to pain, sexual, or mental disorders (e.g., schizophrenia). In addition, medical diagnoses do not fully account for the symptoms, psychological conflicts and stressors precede the symptoms, and the symptoms are not intentionally produced. The presence of a psychological conflict or stressor a fine, but important, point. The patient may not fully acknowledge the significance of such a conflict or stressor or may deny that the conflict or stressor has affected him or her. Regardless, the role of the conflict/stressor critical. …",

Despite extensive investigations, its etiology is unknown. We argue that chemo brain results from damage to tubulin within microtubules. This damage can occur directly from tubulin inhibitors such as taxanes, epothilones or vinca alkaloids. Other chemotherapies stimulate increased mitochondrial activity and biophoton release. This results in abnormal tryptophan metabolism and excess production of neurotoxic kynurenines, which, in turn, damage microtubules.",

A depressed mood that stays around for a while, without letting up, can change the way a person thinks or feels. Doctors call this depression.Depression is a common, serious illness and not a personal weakness. Depression can happen to anyone, at any age, and to people of any race or ethnic group. It is never a part of life. Depression, which is treatable, can come from chemical imbalances in the brain, hormonal changes, medications or things going on in your life.Although there has been evidence for some time of a sex difference in depression, relatively little research has examined the developmental process by which women come to be at greater risk than men for depression. One out of four women may have depression sometime during their lifetime. Many people suffer with depression but do not seek help.The sense of one's identity or self is an important dimension of individual's personality giving each one of us unique individuality. Women and depression is holding a relationship of much interest over the last two decades. As more and more women enter the work force, they are increasingly exposed not only of the same work environment as men, but also to unique pressure created by multiple roles and conflicting expectations (Nelson & Burke, 2000). It has long been observed that women are about twice as likely to become clinically depressed (to have dysthmia or unipolar depression) as are men. These differences occur in most countries around the world (Nolen - Hoeksemo & Girgus, 1994; Whilelm & Roy, 2003).Depression is normal features of our lives. Modernity brought women education in its wake and she changed the arena of activity. She stepped out of the threshold ofhouse and joined service like man. Now she got admiration, equality and opportunity. But the euphoria was ephemeral as she was supposed to take to this job as an additional responsibility. She not expected to shrink household work. This brought problems like strain and depression (Pillai & Sen, 1998).A women by nature is expressive emotional and sensitive. Physiological social and cultural background of women probably plays a key role in mending a women's attitude and natures towards the external relation we know that women are generally more at risk to develop psychological disorder and depression in particular.Objectives of the study* To find out effect of age on depression among working women.* To find out effect of experience on depression among working womenHypotheses of the study* There is significant variation in depression among employees based on age* There is significant variation in the depression among the employees based on their experience.MethodParticipantsThe study was conducted in Delhi and Gurgaon, India with a sample of 200 women professionals. The sample selection was done by a convenience sampling method. Age ranges from 20-60. Education was not included as the criteria for selection.InstrumentsBeck Depression Inventory (BDI): The depression scale was made by Beck ward, Mendesion, Moch and Drbauge (1961). It is comprised of twenty one items. Although the inventory was designed as a clinical instrument but in practice it is frequently used to dichotomies subjects in to depressed and non-depressed groups. This inventory has test-retest reliability coefficient ranging from 0.74 to 0.83 on different time intervals and positively correlated with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a person r of 0.71.The data collected were analyzed using descriptive one-way analysis of variance and Pearson's correlation test.Results and discussionDistribution of depression based on age: Table 1 depicts the frequency of depression among employees based on age. …",

      "abstract": "Sick building syndrome (SBS) constitutes a group of symptoms that occur in a building affecting occupants, but disappear mostly after leaving the building. Sometimes biological aspects cause SBS, sometimes the chemicals present in your building, but human biological systems are affected. This paper reveal a review of SBS, including symptoms, causes, effects, work-related illnesses, prevention, and control. Sick Building Syndrome (SBS) is a medical condition where people experience unexplained symptoms of illness or discomfort while occupying a building. The severity of these symptoms tends to worsen with prolonged stay in the building, but improves or disappears once they leave. SBS can have significant consequences, including: Impaired work or school performance, strained personal relationships, Reduced attendance, Decreased productivity. SBS can occur in various settings, such as: Offices, Homes, Schools, Nurseries. Common symptoms of SBS include: Eye problems (irritation, watering, dryness), Respiratory issues (runny or blocked nose, sore throat), Skin problems (itching, dryness), Headaches, Fatigue, Lethargy, Poor concentration. Overall, SBS can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life and productivity, making it essential to identify and address the underlying causes of the condition.",

Any disruption of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production, flow, or absorption may lead to alterations in ICP and produce headaches. Severe headaches may accompany conditions of high or low ICP, which may be iatrogenic or pathological in origin. Some disorders produce unique symptoms that aid in their diagnosis, for example, the cough headache associated with hindbrain abnormalities such as Chiari malformations. The International Headache Society (IHS) (Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society, 2004) classifies these disorders as “Headache associated with nonvascular intracranial disorder” (Table 18–1). Patients may have worsening of a preexisting headache or may develop a new form of headache (including migraine, tension-type headache, or cluster headache) in close temporal relationship to a nonvascular intracranial disorder. Causality is not necessarily implied.",

      "title": "Psychogenesis of Emesis",
      "abstract": "1. Emesis, or vomiting, considered historically, can be seen in three roles. First it was induced for convivial reasons, to permit continued gormandizing, secondly, on cultural grounds, as part of purification rites and thirdly for curative purposes in the treatment of illness, including mental disorders. Its importance in medicine stems from the fact that it is probably second only to pain in frequency as a symptom of emotional disturbances. Its importance in psychiatry lies in the fact that it is observed in a variety of situations in which its occurrence has different psychological meanings and since it occupies a controversial position in the conceptualizing about conversion phenomena. 2. The physiology of emesis is reviewed and the sequential participation of autonomic and somatic factors is detailed. Psychophysiological aspects of nausea are briefly considered. The roles of various neurophysiological functions, including the limbic system, are discussed in connection with the psychogenic aspects of emesis. 3. Reference is made to pertinent papers on ‘neurotic vomiting’ and to some offering psychodynamic explanations. The relevance of organ language to emesis or ‘neurotic vomiting’ is mentioned. 4. An endeavour is made to separate reflex from psychogenic emesis and a classification of the latter is presented. This shows an increasing complexity as one passes from states in which the mechanism is characterized as arousal to those designated symbolic, expressive and disintegrative. 5. Some semantic implications of the words symbolic, conversion, hysteria, and expressive, are discussed and the unsatisfactory state of ambiguity which surrounds the first three in the psychiatric literature is noted. 6. Certain psychodynamic characteristics of those patients in whom vomiting was a major psychiatric symptom are summarized from the psychiatric literature.",

      "abstract": "Arterial hypotension discovery (blood pressure < 110/60 mmHg for man and < 100/60 mmHg for woman) on the occasion of medical appointments for faintness is often considered as the cause of the medical problem. That causal relationship is yet far from being always established. If a disease is identified generating arterial hypotension, the symptoms reported such as loss of energy, fatigue and/or depressive mood can of course be the consequence. However, asymptomatic chronic hypotension exists. Symptoms appearance in a hypotensive patient such as fatigue, loss of vital energy, alteration of quality of life must lead to look for another explanation than (chronic) low blood pressure. This article will discuss that point.La découverte d’une hypotension artérielle (pression artérielle < 110/60 mmHg chez l’homme et < 100/60 mmHg chez la femme) lors de consultations pour malaise est souvent considérée comme la cause du problème médical.

Si une pathologie est identifiée créant une hypotension, les symptômes rapportés comme la perte d’énergie, la fatigue et/ou l’humeur dépressive peuvent, bien sûr, en être la conséquence. Cependant une hypotension chronique asymptomatique existe. L’apparition de symptômes, chez un sujet hypotendu préalablement, tels que fatigue, perte d’élan vital, altération de la qualité de vie, doit faire rechercher une autre raison que la baisse (chronique) de la pression artérielle.

Prevalence of this condition is unavailable in developing countries of the world. It is classified as \"L98.1 Excoriation (skin-picking) Disorder\" in ICD-10 and referred in some literature as \"dermatillomania\". ED is characterized by, but not invariably, the compulsive urge to pick, squeeze or scratch skin surfaces experienced by patients. Commonly picked parts of the body include the face (most picked), arms, legs, back, gums, neck, shoulders, scalp, abdomen, chest, the knuckles (via mouth leading to temporary disfiguration of distal and proximal joints of the middle and little fingers) and other extremities e.g. the fingernails, cuticles, and toe nails;5 skin picking may be accompanied by anxiety with depression following picking. It is often triggered by factors that include feeling or examining irregularities on the skin, feeling anxious etc. Complications include infections, tissue damage and sepsis. Rarely, severe cases cause lifethreatening injuries. Risk of self-harm is increased by feelings of intense helplessness, guilt, shame and embarrassment.8 Studies further describe significant associations between ED and suicidal ideation, suicidal attempts and psychiatric hospitalizations.",

The X-linked recessive ED (Christ-Siemens-Touraine syndrome ) is the most common disordere (80%of EDs); it affects males and is inherited through female carriers. It is characterized by the triad of signs comprising sparse hair (atrichosis or hypotrichosis), abnormal or missing teeth (anodontia or hypodontia) and inability to sweat due to lack of sweat glands (anhidrosis or hypohidrosis). The lack of teeth and the special appearance were reported to be major concerns. The incidence in male is estimated at 1 in 100,000 births, the carriers-incidence is probably around 17.3 in 100,000 women Most patients with EDA have a normal life expectancy and normal intelligence. However, the lack of sweat glands may lead to hyperthermia, followed by brain damage or death in early infancy, if unrecognized. Thus an early diagnosis is important. Families with EDA should therefore be offered genetic counseling. Currently the genes and gene products are defined, but the function of the proteins is not fully known. Once the exact function is known, we can understand the embryogenesis and morphogenesis of the ectodermal structures. It is quite possible that these kinds of observations of gene function and interaction may form the basis of new therapeutic methods in the future. For the patients as well as the dentists tooth agenesis and its secondary effects on growth and development of the jaws is often the most significant clinical and therapeutical problem. The course of the treatment is to restore the function and the aesthetics of the teeth, normalise the vertical dimension and support the facial soft tissues.",

He was therefore able to seek employment independently. This transition of symptoms assumes an aspect of adolescent mentality and presents a trial and error approach to establishing a social identity. In general, somatization is assumed to be an immature defense mechanism of individual psychopathology. However, somatization may be a sign of an improvement in one's health. Somatization in adolescence may also be a sign of the beginning of a reintegration into society and have a bridging functional aspect that induces socialization in adulthood.",

The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

Violent sleep-related behaviors have been reviewed in the context of automatic behavior in general, with many well-documented cases resulting from a wide variety of disorders. Conditions associated with sleep-period-related violence fall into two major categories: neurologic and psychiatric. Psychogenic dissociative disorders may arise exclusively or predominantly from the sleep period. Recent interest in the forensic aspects of parasomnias provides sleep medicine professionals with an opportunity to educate and assist the legal profession in cases of sleep-related violence. One infrequently used tactic to improve scientific testimony is to use a court-appointed impartial expert.",

      "abstract": "Depression is defined in diagnostic literature as a mood disorder characterized by depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, significant changes in weight, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, difficulty concentrating, and suicidal ideation and/or attempts. Research suggests a link between depressed mood and monoamine depletion, elevated cortisol, and inflammation, but existing laboratory evidence is inconclusive. Current treatments for depression include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and lifestyle changes; however, more severe forms of the disorder can require other medication, sometimes in combination with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Disagreement persists over how to define and classify depression, in part due to its ambivalent relationship to melancholia, which has existed as a medical concept in different forms since antiquity. Melancholia was reconfigured in 19th-century medicine from traditional melancholy madness into a modern mood disorder. In the early 20th century, melancholia gradually fell out of use as a diagnostic term with the introduction of manic-depressive insanity and unipolar depression. Following the publication of <italic>DSM-III</italic> in 1980 and the introduction of SSRIs a few years later, major depressive disorder became ubiquitous. Consumption of antidepressants have continued to rise year after year, and the World Health Organization notes depression as the leading cause of disability worldwide. At present, internationally recognized systems of classification favor a single category for depressive illness (alongside a circular mood disorder, bipolar I and II), but this view is challenged by clinicians and researchers who argue for the reinstatement of melancholia as a separate and distinct mood disorder with marked somatic and psychotic features.",

Bei einem geringen Teil der Patienten sind die Symptome durch medikamentöse und behaviorale Therapie nicht ausreichend gut behandelbar. Hier kann eine Therapieeskalation erwogen werden. Die tiefe Hirnstimulation (THS) ist ein invasives Therapieverfahren, das bei bestimmten Bewegungsstörungen etabliert ist und für die Therapie des TS zunehmend an Bedeutung gewinnt. Der folgende Artikel fasst die aktuelle Evidenz zur Anwendung der THS beim TS zusammen. Die meiste Erfahrung liegt für die thalamische und pallidale Stimulation vor, wobei bisher keines der Zielgebiete deutlich überlegen war. Die Studienlage zeigt eine durchschnittliche Reduktion der Tic-Schwere unter THS von bis zu 40 % nach einem Jahr. Inwiefern die THS zu einer Besserung der oft begleitenden psychiatrischen Komorbiditäten führt, bleibt aufgrund der geringen Fallzahlen unsicher. Beim TS ist eine erhöhte Anzahl an postoperativen Infektionen aufgefallen, deren Ursache nicht geklärt wurde. Zusammenfassend zeigen die Studien, dass eine THS beim TS eine sichere Therapieoption zur Behandlung schwerer medikamentös nicht behandelbarer Tics darstellt. Die THS sollte an Zentren durchgeführt werden, in denen Expertise sowohl in der Behandlung von Tics als auch für THS vorliegt.",

There are few reports concerning sexual problems in CES, yet they are very common in both men and women. Loss of feeling is a significant source of sexual dissatisfaction, particularly in women. The most frequent sexual disorders reported by men are reduction in orgasm and erectile dysfunction. Ejaculatory disorders are less common. Sexual problems are often accompanied by urinary symptoms. Women most often report reduced or absent lubrication and significantly diminished libido and orgasm, often associated with local pain. Sexual dysfunction in CES is permanent and often incurable.

      "abstract": "There are approximately 1.4 million cases of traumatic brain injury (TBI) per year in the United States, with about 23 000 survivors requiring hospitalization. The incidence of TBI has increased in the patient population of the Department of Defense and Veterans Healthcare Administration as a result of injuries suffered during recent military and combat operations. Within the past few years, TBI has emerged as a common form of injury in service members with a subset of patients experiencing postinjury symptoms that greatly affect their quality of life. Traumatic brain injury can occur when sudden trauma (ie, penetration blast or blunt) causes damage to the brain. Traumatic brain injury produces a cascade of potentially injurious processes that include focal contusions and cytotoxic damage. The results of TBI can include impaired physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral functioning, which may or may not require the initiation of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions when deemed appropriate. Associated outcomes of TBI include alterations in mental state at the time of injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, and alteration of consciousness). Neurological deficits include loss of balance, praxis, aphasia, change in vision that may or may not be transient. Individuals who sustain a TBI are more likely to have or developed co-occurring conditions (ie, sleep problems, headaches, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder) that may require the administration of multiple medications. It has been identified that veterans being discharged on central nervous system and muscular skeletal drug classes can develop addiction and experience medication misadventures. With the severity of TBI being highly variable but typically categorized as either mild, moderate, or severe, it can assist health care providers in determining which patients are more susceptible to medication misadventures compared with others. The unique development of cognitive and emotional symptoms of TBI can lead to significant impairments, so it is important for all health care providers, including pharmacists, to promote proper use of high-risk psychotropic medications among this patient population by providing effective medication education.",

      "abstract": "Most head injured patients arrive in the accident and emergency (A&E) department within a few hours of the injury. This article concerns the investigation of a group that has received less attention: those whose first attendance is delayed, who reattend, or develop complications after a period of observation. Delay in the initial presentation or unplanned return to the A&E department after head injury can occur for a variety of reasons. The abuse of alcohol or drugs may lead to signs of an injury being noted only after the patient wakes up or is found still in coma long after the effects of the agent should have cleared. Sometimes seemingly trivial injury leads to attendance some hours, days, or even weeks later because of persisting or worsening symptoms. Studies in South Africa, England, and Scotland' showed that about 2-3 % of A&E patients reattend after being sent home with an apparently minor head injury (only 0.2% of the total new A&E attenders). Most of these have responded to advice given at the time of discharge and have developed symptoms such as headache, dizziness, or vomiting prompting reattendance within two weeks of the injury. In Scotland in 1979 the annual incidence of an intracranial haematoma undergoing surgery was shown to be 4.5 per 100 000 population.4 Data from a regional neurosurgical unit indicate that one fifth of these are pure extradural haematomas and over two thirds are intradural haematomas, which is the commoner finding at all stages after injury. A report in 1980 showed that over one quarter of surgical intracranial haematomas received surgery after three days (table 1).5 This pattern may have changed with the increased use of computed tomography but intradural haematomas (subdural and intracerebral) still tend to present later than extradural haematomas. Patients with chronic subdural haematoma (a subdural collection of dark fluid occurring at three weeks after injury or later) reach neurosurgical units at the annual rate of one per 100 000 population.6 7",

      "abstract": "High voltage electrical injury can cause considerable damage to the central nervous system. Delayed spinal cord injury is uncommon, usually incomplete, and comprises predominantly motor fallout. The injury can be progressive, with only a few patients showing partial improvement. We present a case report of a 20-year-old male who had a delayed onset spinal cord injury after a high voltage electrical injury. The symptoms started several days postburn with an ascending paralysis, leading to tetraplegia. Gradual recovery became evident at 3 months after the accident, starting with his arms and later showing partial recovery of his lower limbs. The mechanisms of injury and pathophysiology to the spinal cord are poorly understood. Possible explanations for the delayed onset of neurologic complications are given. The exact reasons for the delayed, ascending paralysis and the mechanism of recovery still need further investigation.",

It is now more generally known as hypersexuality or compulsive sexual activity. The word \"nymphomania\" was originally used to characterize women's excessive sexual conduct, although contemporary viewpoints acknowledge hypersexuality as a disorder that can impact people of any gender. This paper addresses the challenges in correctly identifying the illness and distinguishing it from other behavioral or psychiatric diseases. Along with typical clinical manifestations, the underlying reasons of hypersexuality—including biological, psychological, and social factors—are examined. Pharmacological treatments like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and psychotherapy techniques like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic approaches are examples of treatment tactics. This paper underlines the value of comprehensive, multidisciplinary therapy and draws attention to the barriers to effective treatment, such as societal stigma.",

Recent epidemiological studies reveal more than 75% of approximately 30 million American temporomandibular disorder (TMD) sufferers are women. What does the VDT and TMD have in common besides an affinity for the female gender? TMD is associated with numerous risk factors that commonly initiate sympathetic nervous system and stress hormone response mechanisms resulting in muscle spasms, trigger point formation, and pain in the head and neck. Likewise VDT operation may be linked to three additional sympathetic nervous system irritants including: (1) electrostatic ambient air negative ion depletion, (2) electromagnetic radiation, and (3) eyestrain and postural stress associated with poor work habits and improper work station design. Additional research considering the roles these three factors may play In the etiology of TMD and other myofascial pain problems is indicated. Furthermore, dentists are advised to educate patients as to these possible risks, encourage preventive behaviors on the part of employers and employees, and recommend workplace health, safety, and ergonomic upgrades when indicated.",

The underlying pathogenesis of dystonia is less well understood than in Parkinson’s disease, in which deep-brain stimulation is generally expected to provide effective and long-lasting benefit. Furthermore, it is likely that dystonia represents a number of different basal ganglia pathologies. The response of dystonia to deep-brain stimulation is typically delayed for up to weeks or months following a change in stimulation parameters. All of these factors make it more difficult to predict outcomes in dystonia following deep-brain stimulation, thus making patient selection all the more important.",

Fatigue is reported as prevalent in most studied populations including patients with cancer and palliative care patients. The frequency of fatigue has been reported to be approximately 60–90% in patients with advanced cancer whereas prevalence of fatigue is around 20–30% in cancer survivors. Tumors can produce multiple by-products, including proteolytic and lipolytic factors and cytokines capable of interfering with close metabolism and inducing fatigue. The mechanisms by which fatigue is induced or perceived in the central nervous system are poorly understood. Anxiety, depression, and psychological distress may contribute to fatigue. Testosterone deficiency results in the loss of muscle mass, fatigue, reduced libido, and reduced hemoglobin.",

The results show that many of the comorbidities identified may be metabolic risk factors for the development of other diseases or may even predispose to depression, as suggested by other studies in the literature. Patients with multiple comorbidities have a much higher risk of depression, which requires the implementation of a depression screening program and monitoring of patients at risk.

They may be diagnosed in either the presence or absence of individual mental disorders. In some cases, relational problems may interact with genetic vulnerabilities in contributing to the development of psychopathology. Four major constructs have been investigated that describe nodal areas of relational difficulty in the family and marital environment: structure, communication, expression of affect, and problem solving. Relational problems are best observed and treated directly in a family format in which the conflicted family members are present with the therapist. Genetics, neuroimaging, and family studies are important vehicles for deciphering how interpersonal relationships affect the etiology of both physical and mental disorders.",

The resulting hypertonicity and imbalance of forces between muscle groups leads to deformities that impair patient function and can cause significant long-term complications. Symptoms of spasticity can be managed with nonoperative techniques such as physiotherapy, bracing, or medications. Other approaches such as intrathecal baclofen pumps and selective dorsal rhizotomy have also demonstrated efficacy in controlling spasticity. Spasticity that has failed nonoperative management can be treated with orthopedic surgeries that correct deformities by either restoring joint anatomy or re-balancing the forces of spastic muscle groups. Improved mobility and reduced pain after these procedures can help patients with their rehabilitation, function, and independence.",

But that’s getting ahead of ourselves. First, we’ll explore specific causes of dysthymia and factors that make you especially vulnerable. Causes of Dysthymia There is no simple, single reason why some people develop persistent depression and others don’t. Dysthymia is caused by a variety of genetic, biological, psychosocial, and circumstantial factors. Although each person’s profile of risk factors is unique, dysthymia can be thought of as a biopsychosocial disorder, like other forms of depression.",

They typically result from the interplay of the environment, comorbidity, and age-related changes in postural stability. Recurrent falls can be debilitating in terms of physical consequences and in terms of the psychological impact of fear of falling, resulting in restriction of activity leading to a spiral of deconditioning, further loss of function, low mood, depression, and social isolation. Since some falls can be prevented, all older people in contact with healthcare professionals should be asked routinely whether they have fallen in the past year. Management requires a multifactorial approach, directed by the relevant contributors determined in the assessment process. The aim should be to prevent future falls and minimize their consequences, whilst avoiding imposing restrictions to the point that they negatively impact function, independence, and quality of life.",

      "title": "A Young Man with a Limp—Hypothyroidism Presenting with Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis",
      "abstract": "Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) is a hip disorder primarily affecting adolescents, marked by the posterior–inferior slippage of the capital femoral epiphysis from the metaphysis at the pelvic articulation point. Its pathophysiological mechanisms, partially understood, are believed to stem from heightened shearing forces on the proximal femoral epiphysis during puberty, where growth hormones dominate over sex hormones. This condition is often associated with adipo-genital syndrome.[1] Hypothyroidism's link to SCFE may be due to its impact on bone health. Thyroid hormone influences the growth plate, contributing to its closure during puberty through the IHH–PTHrP pathway. SCFE often arises at puberty's end when physis closure is delayed, suggesting that alterations in thyroid hormone levels may disrupt this process.[1] Thyroid hormone deficiency in children delays bone development and growth plate formation, deactivating the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor axis.[2] While SCFE is common in pubertal growth spurts, failure of epiphyseal closure can cause it to manifest later in life. Moyer et al.[2] proposed thyroid function screening for SCFE patients with unconventional presentations. CASE HISTORY A hypothyroid male in his early 20s on T. levothyroxine 50 mcg/day was diagnosed with SCFE. He exhibited a painful limp on the left lower limb for over four months. He recalls growth cessation at the age of 14 years, and since remained considerably shorter than his peers. Typical hypothyroid symptoms including cold intolerance, lethargy, and constipation were present.[3] Clinical findings were short stature, hypertrichosis, delayed puberty, macroorchidism, and musculoskeletal manifestations of severe hypothyroidism [Figure 1a-c].[4] Laboratory findings confirmed severe hypothyroidism [Table 1].Figure 1: Physical examination revealed short stature (a), hypertrichosis (b), and pseudohypertrophy of calf muscles (c)Table 1: Laboratory findings confirming severe hypothyroidismRadiologically, Xray pelvis showed SCFE left side along with epiphyseal stippling and Xray knee joint left showed epiphyseal stippling [Figure 2a,c] suggestive of prolonged untreated hypothyroidism.[5] Bone age estimated from X-ray of the left hand corresponded to 14 years [Figure 2b], suggesting the onset of hypothyroidism had been undiagnosed for at least a decade.Figure 2: The Left hip X-ray showing SCFE [a, yellow arrow] along with epiphyseal stippling [a, red arrow]. Left knee X-ray showing epiphyseal stippling (c). X-ray of the left hand corresponded to bone age of 14 years (b)The patient underwent bilateral hip cannulated cancellous screw fixation, and the thyroxine dose was increased to 75 mcg/day. A follow-up revealed a TSH value of 5.56 microIU/mL one month later. DISCUSSION SCFE typically requires an open growth plate, making it an unusual occurrence in adults. When encountered in adults, an underlying endocrine disorder is often the primary cause. The rarity of an open growth plate in adults should prompt both endocrine evaluation and surgical intervention. In cases of identified endocrine issues, consideration should be given to prophylactic pinning of the opposite side. While previous reports have documented SCFE in adults, we aim to contribute our unique experience to the literature.

Some investigators tend to emphasize the effect of psychologic activity on electroencephalographic activity.† Others tend to regard the psychologic activity as the affected variable and the electroencephalographic activity as the causal agent variable.‡ Psychologic activity (itself a concomitant of some kind of cortical and subcortical neurogenic processes) can possibly have either an inhibiting or a facilitating effect on the functioning of another region of the brain showing abnormal bioelectric discharges. At the same time, a region of abnormal bioelectrical discharge may suppress or facilitate neurogenic activity—and thus psychologic activity—in the same region or elsewhere in the central nervous system.

Our patient is a 50-year-old gentleman who had been working in a company for around 33 years and always had good appraisals. He presented to mental health services with a 5-year history of persecutory beliefs, convinced that his employers were out to damage his reputation. Apart from a diagnosis of polycythaemia, a few months before the onset of abnormal beliefs, there is no personal or family history of psychiatric disorder or medical illness.

      "abstract": "Motor delay is a condition that effects body functions or structure, and make limitation physical activities such as crawling, walking, grabbing or daily activities and may limit the participation and physical activites in children. One of the factors causing motor delayed is the hypothyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone has a vital role in the growth, metabolism, and regulation of body fluids. Thyroid hormone deficiency cause growth failure, and mental retardation. Early detection of motor delay can be done by using Denver Development Screening Test (DDST). This test is done with the purpose to follow the process of child development, to overcome early if found development delay. Physiotherapy is needed to deal with delays in motor development. Therapeutic exercise is one of the modalities of physiotherapy in motor improvement using body movement exercises either actively or passively.\r\nKeywords: motor delay; hypothyroid; therapeutic exercise\r\n\r\nABSTRAK\r\n\r\nMotor delay adalah kondisi yang mempengaruhi fungsi tubuh atau stuktur, dapat membatasi aktivitas fisik seperti merangkak, berjalan, meraih atau aktivitas sehari-hari dan dapat membatasi partisipasi dan aktivitas fisik pada anak. Salah satu faktor yang menyebabkan motor delayed adalah hormon hipotiroid. Hormon tiroid memiliki peran vital dalam pertumbuhan, metabolisme, dan pengaturan cairan tubuh. Kekurangan hormon tiroid dapat menyebabkan kegagalan pertumbuhan, juga dapat mengakibatkan keterbelakangan mental pada penderitanya. Deteksi dini keterlambatan motorik dapat dilakukan dengan menggunakan DDST II (Denver Development Screening Test). Tes ini dilakukan dengan tujuan untuk mengikuti proses perkembangan anak, dan mengatasi secara dini bila ditemukan keterlambatan perkembangan. Fisioterapi diperlukan untuk menangani keterlambatan perkembangan motorik. Terapi latihan adalah salah satu modalitas fisioterapi dalam proses perbaikan motorik dengan menggunakan latihan- latihan gerakan tubuh baik secara aktif maupun pasif. Terapi latihan yang diberikan oleh fisioterapi pada anak dengan hormon hipotiroid, diharapkan dapat memberikan kemajuan perkembangan pada anak tersebut sehingga dapat mencapai tingkat perkembangan yang seoptimal mungkin sesuai dengan usia anak.\r\nKata kunci: motor delay; hormon hipotiroid; terapi latihan",

      "title": "Migraine is a marker for systemic disease",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, We read with interest the article titled \"Retinal arterial occlusions in the young: Systemic[1] associations in Indian population by Ratra et al. Authors have mentioned severe headache, floaters and transient blurring of vision as the presenting symptoms in a subset of patients. Visual aura (migraine) are fully reversible symptoms including positive features (e.g., flickering of lights, spots or lines) and negative features (i.e., loss of vision). A migraine diathesis may be a marker for an underlying defect such as hypertension, hypercoagulability, lupus erythematosis or mitral valve prolapse and therefore might occasionally co-occur with[2] vascular occlusion or retinal vasospasm. Experts disagree whether retinal migraine is a rare or common cause of monocular visual loss and whether the mechanism is spreading depression or vasospasm. Complicated migraine refers to a permanent neurologic deficit whether it is visual, motor or sensory in origin. In some instances the stroke does not respect the usual middle or posterior cerebral artery territories suggesting that a strict vascular mechanism is insufficient to[3] explain all migraine-related stroke phenomena. Cocaine abuse cause hypertensive surges, stroke, arterial and venous thrombosis. Neuroimaging studies in cocaine abusers demonstrated abnormal perfusion involving the infraparietal,[4] temporal and anterofrontal cortex and basal ganglia. Dopamine-rich brain regions appear to be relatively specific targets for cocaine-induced cerebral ischemia. Dopamine is one of the[5] numerous neurotransmitters present in outer and inner layers of the retina. Cocaine abuse,[3] exercise and lupus cause non-migrainous retinal vasospasm and transient monocular visual loss. Authors have documented hypertension, cerebrovascular accident and basal ganglia infarction in a 37-year-old patient. In our practice we routinely inform the possibility of underlying systemic disease and importance of physician consultation in all patients with migraine. Perimetry may be useful to identify coexisting cerebral ischemia in patients with retinal vascular occlusion and normal neuroimaging study. We appreciate the authors' effort and research work.

It is well known that thioridazine, because of its adrenolytic activity, inhibits or prevents ejaculation in some patients. Though not specifically dose-related, this phenomenon is generally more severe at higher dosages. Thioridazine has been shown to cause impotency in males and delay of orgasm in both men and women. Occasionally, thioridazine has been found to be effective in the treatment of premature ejaculation, prolonging the time between insertion and ejaculation. The exact basis of this effect is unknown but may be related to decrease in anxiety or a specific chemical effect on the sexual functioning. Schizophrenics, generally, are most disturbed by any changes in bodily function, whatever the cause, but especially in their sexual functioning. With the use of",

Symptoms of vocal cord paralysis include changes in the voice, such as hoarseness or a breathy voice, ineffective coughing, pain in the throat when speaking, dysphagia, sore throat, aspiration, etc. In Ayurveda, it can be correlated with Swarakshaya based on clinical presentations. It is a condition where voice alteration is brought about, as seen during speech and announcing with high or low pitch, inaudible or distinct sound. Due to various Nidana like Athyuchabhashana (speak in a loud voice), Abhighata (injury), Soka (grief), etc., the aggravated Dosha invades and localizes in the Sabdavahisira (vocal cords) and leads to changes in the functions of the voice box and causing Swarakshaya. Here, a case report of 32- a 32-year-old female presenting with symptoms of difficulty speaking and a low-pitched voice, diagnosed with vocal cord paralysis with respect to Swarakshaya, is narrated. The patient underwent Panchakarma procedures like Nasya for 7 days with Yashtimadhu taila, followed by ksheera dhooma, Gandoosha with Yashtimadhu taila and selected Samana medicines (Jivantyadi gritha).

      "abstract": "Abstract: In euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia high levels of thyroxine (T4) may be either transient or persistent, associated with high, normal, or low levels of tri‐iodothyronine (T 3 ). Euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia may occur: (i) as a response to abnormal plasma binding (thyroxine binding globulin, albumin, prealbumin, or autoantibodies), (ii) because of hormone resistance, (iii) after exposure to drugs such as amiodarone, cholecystographic contrast agents, or propranolol, (iv) during acute psychiatric illness or stress, and (v) in hyperemesis gravidarum. In some instances the cause of persistent hyperthyroxinemia still remains obscure. No single investigation (including free hormone measurement and the response of thyrotropin to its releasing hormone) can distinguish all of these entities from true hyperthyroidism. Hence, re‐evaluation in cases of diagnostic uncertainty should begin with clinical reassessment. Techniques are now available to identify easily some causes of euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia, allowing us to recognise patients and relatives who are at risk of inappropriate treatment. Because measurement of serum T 4 remains the key investigation for diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction, it is important to appreciate the full range of conditions that compromise its specificity",

Ardita can be co-related with facial paralysis on the basis of its signs and symptoms mentioned in texts. Here, temporary suspension or permanent loss of function, especially loss of sensation or voluntary motion of unilateral side of face is considered. It occurs due to any injury or inflammation to facial-VIIth cranial nerve, which leads to partial or total loss of movement of unilateral face.

This progressive disorder can cause significant embarrassment and social withdrawal, and in severe cases lead to functional blindness. The most common cause is direct compression of the root entry zone by an ectatic blood vessel leading to local demyelination. How this demyelination leads to hyperactivity of the nerve is not precisely known, though multiple putative mechanisms exist. Here we review our institutional series of microvascular decompression of the facial nerve for the treatment of hemifacial spasm. We discuss the surgical setup, neurophysiological monitoring (including lateral spread for the purposes of predication of resolution) and postoperative complications. Potential complications include: facial palsy, gustatory or vestibular dysfunction, hearing loss, hoarseness, dysphagia, or recurrence of spasm.",

      "title": "Neuronal and behavioural effects of social isolation in old age",
      "abstract": "espanolEl aislamiento social en los seres humanos se caracteriza por una menor calidad social que se ve agravada aun mas despues de la jubilacion, disminucion en el numero de relaciones por la perdida de amigos cercanos o incluso la viudedad. Por lo tanto, el aislamiento social es particularmente frecuente en las personas de edad avanzada y un problema creciente en los paises con una esperanza de vida media mas larga. En la actualidad, existe evidencia epidemiologica que indica que el aislamiento social es un factor de riesgo para el desarrollo de diversas enfermedades tales como trastornos cardiovasculares, depresion, deterioro cognitivo e incluso aumento de la mortalidad. Mientras que muchos estudios en animales se han investigado los efectos del aislamiento social en el comportamiento durante el periodo pre-destete, solo en unos pocos estudios se han investigado las consecuencias conductuales y cognitivas del aislamiento social en la edad adulta o en la vejez. La principal hipotesis de este trabajo es que el aislamiento social puede considerarse como una situacion estresante que, cuando se produce a finales de la edad adulta o en la vejez, induce cambios en ciertos procesos fisiologicos y neurobiologicos que afectan al comportamiento y exacerban el deterioro cognitivo relacionado con la edad. En la primera parte de este estudio hemos utilizado hembras adultas de Octodon degus para investigar los efectos del aislamiento social a largo plazo sobre la memoria del miedo condicionado al contexto, y la posible modulacion de los niveles sinapticos de NCAM y PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Despues de 6 ½ meses de aislamiento social, las hembras degus adultas mostraron una memoria normal del miedo condicionado al tono, pero un deficit en la memoria del miedo contextual, una tarea dependiente del hipocampo. Posteriormente, se observo una reduccion de los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo de las degus aisladas en comparacion con las agrupadas. Curiosamente, el aislamiento social redujo ademas el volumen de la subregion de CA1 del hipocampo, sin afectar al volumen de la subregion CA3 del hipocampo o la totalidad de esta region. Por otra parte, se detecto una disminucion en el aumento de peso corporal asi como una reduccion del numero de granulocitos en los animales aislados. Nuestros hallazgos indican, por primera vez, que el aislamiento social a largo plazo de las hembras adultas induce la contraccion especifica de la subregion de CA1 y una disminucion en los niveles sinapticos de PSA-NCAM en el hipocampo. Estos efectos pueden estar relacionados con el deficit de la memoria del miedo contextual observada en las hembras degus aisladas. Nuestros estudios con ratas Wistar machos, llevados a cabo en la segunda parte del estudio, indican que el aislamiento social durante el envejecimiento altera progresivamente la actividad simpatica, y aumenta la ansiedad y el comportamiento tipo depresivo. Ademas, las ratas aisladas a largo plazo muestran niveles elevados de corticosterona plasmatica y cambios morfologicos, bioquimicos y electrofisiologicos en el hipocampo que pueden conducir a la alteracion de la memoria espacial observada en estos animales. Tras el aislamiento social a largo plazo, la administracion sistemica de un peptido sintetico que imita algunas de las acciones de la molecula de adhesion celular neuronal fue capaz de revertir el deterioro de la memoria espacial inducida por el aislamiento, lo que indica que este tratamiento farmacologico puede ser de relevancia terapeutica. EnglishSocial isolation in humans is marked by fewer quality social relationships and is agravated after retirement, widowhood and the loss of close friends. Thus, social isolation is particularly prevalent in elderly people and is becoming an increasing problem in countries with a longer average lifespan. At present, there is epidemiological evidence indicating that social isolation is a risk factor for the development of various diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, depression, cognitive decline and even increased mortality. While many animal studies have investigated the eff ects of social isolation during the pre-weaning and juvenile period on behavior, only a few studies have investigated the behavioural and cognitive consequences of social isolation in adulthood or in old age. The main hypothesis of this work is that social isolation can be considered a stressful situation that, when occurs at late adulthood or in old age, induces changes in certain physiological and neurobiological processes aff ecting behavior and exacerbating agerelated cognitive decline. In the first part of this study we used adult female Octodon degus to investigate the effects of long-term social isolation on contextual and cued fear conditioning, and the possible modulation of the synaptic levels of NCAM and PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. After 6½ months of social isolation, adult female degus showed a normal auditory-cued fear memory, but a deficit in contextual fear memory, a hippocampal dependent task. Subsequently, we observed reduced hippocampal synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in isolated compared to grouped-housed female degus. Interestingly, social isolation reduced the volume of the hippocampal CA1 subfield, without aff ecting the volume of the CA3 subregion or the total hippocampus. Moreover, attenuated body weight gain and reduced number of granulocytes were detected in isolated animals. Our findings indicate for the first time, that long-term social isolation of adult female animals induces a specific shrinkage of CA1 and a decrease in synaptic levels of PSA-NCAM in the hippocampus. These effects may be related to the deficit in contextual fear memory observed in isolated female degus. Our studies with male Wistar rats, carried out in the second part of the study, indicate that social isolation at aging progressively alters sympathetic activity, and increases anxiety and depressive- like behaviour. In addition, long-term isolated rats showed elevated plasmatic corticosterone levels and displayed morphological, electrophysiological and biochemical changes in the hippocampus that may lead to the spatial memory impairment observed in these animals. After long term social isolation, systemic administration of a synthetic peptide that mimics some neural cell adhesion activities was able to revert isolation-induced spatial memory impairment, indicating that this pharmacological treatment may be of therapeutic relevance.",

      "title": "1632f Varied criteria for work-related upper extremity disorders in united states",
      "abstract": "In the US, the acceptance of a claim for a work-related MSD is most commonly determined by the employer and insurance carrier with input from the physician's report. For most workers, the process is based on state laws, which vary from state to state. Some states (e.g., California) have adopted the ACOEM Medical Practice Guidelines (2nd Ed, 1). The Guidelines recommend a process for determining work-relatedness based on evidence of disease, evidence of exposure, epidemiology, and other factors (e.g., non-workplace exposures). For example, the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) should consider the presence of numbness/tingling in the median nerve distribution, electrodiagnostic studies (EDS), if available, and non-work factors such as age and BMI. Work-relatedness for CTS and other non-traumatic hand/wrist disorders (e.g., tendinosis, tendinitis, trigger digit) generally requires sustained or repeated forceful (&gt;10N) pinching or gripping and the Guidelines refer to the ACGIH HAL TLV as a risk assessment tool. Other MSDs discussed include epcondylalgia (epicondylosis), ligament sprains, tenosynovitis/tendinosis (including 0de Quervain's), trigger digit, hand arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), ulnar and radial nerve entrapment, ganglion cyst and non-specific hand/wrist/forearm pain. Colorado State developed treatment guidelines for CTS (38-pages), with provisions that are enforceable under workers' compensation rules (2). The roles of history, physical examination and EDS in diagnosis and management are spelled out. For determining work-relatedness, job title alone is not sufficient. Six specific ergonomic hazards, with minimum daily exposure durations (e.g., pinching &gt;18 n more than 3 hour per day) are listed. Washington State has a 13-page diagnosis and treatment guideline for CTS. Diagnosis requires both appropriate symptoms and an abnormal EDS. Work-related risk factors are listed but without the exposure thresholds provided in the Colorado guidelines. Thus, determinations of worker's compensation cases vary from state to state and these differences could influence comparative research studies.",

Vznika v ranem dětstvi, v obdobi tzv. kriticke periody, během niž je zrakový mozkový kortex velmi citlivý na působeni zrakových vjemů. Pokud dojde k abnormalni zrakove stimulaci v tomto obdobi (působeni amblyogennich faktorů: strabismus, anizometropie, opticka neprůhlednost ocnich medii), přenos senzorických vjemů z postiženeho oka do korových zrakových center je porusen. Dochazi pak nejen k dramatickemu sniženi zrakove ostrosti, ale take k postiženi dalsich zrakových funkci (kontrastni citlivost, binokularni funkce). Tradicni terapii je penalizace zdraveho oka ve snaze obnovit přenos a zpracovani vjemů z oka amblyopickeho. Okluzni terapie s sebou přinasi urcite nevýhody, z nichž největsi je skutecnost, že je neucinna po uzavřeni kriticke periody, tj. po ukonceni 8-12 roku věku. Tento fakt je vysvětlovan nedostatkem plasticity dospěleho mozku. Nicmeně výsledky nedavných experimentů na zviřatech a klinických studii představuji velkou výzvu pro tento tradicni koncept. Ukazuje se totiž, že původni předpoklad o absenci plasticity zrakoveho kortexu a tudiž nemožnosti lecby tupozrakosti po 12 roku věku neni zcela definitivni. Podařilo se odhalit netusený potencial mozku pro opětovne zvýseni plasticity i dlouho po uzavřeni kriticke periody. Byly již navrženy různe strategie, ktere dokaži stimulovat potřebnou plasticitu i v dospělem mozku a tak umožni obnoveni normalnich zrakových funkci i davno po uzavřeni kriticke periody. Větsina nazorů se shoduje na klicove roli kortikalni inhibice (utlumu) pro definovani mezi kriticke periody. Možne strategie se zaměřuji na modulaci poměru inhibicniho/excitacniho přenosu v mozku.

It develops in an early childhood during the critical period of brain development. During this time the visual cortex is extremely sensitive to visual input. If the visual input is abnormal, deficits occur and amblyopia develops. Besides low visual acuity there are other visual functions that are affected (stereoacuity, contrast sensitivity, etc.) Traditional therapy approach is patching the good eye. The point is to force the brain to use the input form the amblyopic eye. However, this therapy is has many drawbacks. The new experiments shows there might be another options in treating amblyopia. The key role of inhibition/excitation ratio has been identified and accordingly new treatment strategies have been suggested. Among the most promising is the pharmacological manipulation and the concept of perceptual learning.",

      "abstract": "There has recently been increased occasions to treat patients complicated with psychiatric and nervous disorders, in accordance with the rise of interest in human right and the improved social acceptance of these diseases. In the past, most cases were reluctantly terminated because of the prejudice against diseases and anxiety about the teratogenicity of the drugs. In this paper, the management of pregnancy and delivery including neonatal period are discussed. 1) Epilepsy Epilepsy is one of the most common medical complications of pregnancy with about 0.5%. Pregnancy has no obvious effect on epilepsy. Although the teratogenicity of the antiepileptic drugs has been repeatedly reported, anticonvulsant therapy should be continued during pregnancy. Because the risk of the fetal brain damage from hypoxia under the epileptic convulsion of the untreated patients is higher than that of the teratogenicity of drugs. Phenobarbital or phenytoin are commonly used. Trimethadione which has been used for the petit mal epilepsy should not be used because of the high potent of teratogenicity. The serum concentrations of these drugs tend to decrease in the third trimester. Therefore the frequent monitoring of the serum drug concentration is very important. The monitoring of the blood clotting factors after delivery is also very important to avoid the neonatal vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Vitamin K is administered if required. Breast feeding is not contraindicated. Withdrawal syndrome in the neonatal state should not be overlooked. 2) Schizophrenia Pregnancy has no effect on schizophrenia. The teratogenicity of chlorpromazine or haloperidol in human pregnancy is thought to be negative. The function of the fetal central nervous system is suppressed with antipsychotic drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Single and repeated sports-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also referred to as concussion, can result in chronic post-concussive syndrome (PCS), neuropsychological and cognitive deficits, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However PCS is often difficult to diagnose using routine clinical, neuroimaging or laboratory evaluations, while CTE currently only can be definitively diagnosed postmortem. We sought to develop an animal model to simulate human repetitive concussive head injury for systematic study. In this study, mice received single or multiple head impacts by a stereotaxic impact device with a custom-made rubber tip-fitted impactor. Dynamic changes in MRI, neurobiochemical markers (Tau hyperphosphorylation and glia activation in brain tissues) and neurobehavioral functions such as anxiety, depression, motor function and cognitive function at various acute/subacute (1-7 day post-injury) and chronic (14-60 days post-injury) time points were examined. To explore the potential biomarkers of rCHI, serum levels of total Tau (T-Tau) and phosphorylated Tau (P-Tau) were also monitored at various time points. Our results show temporal dynamics of MRI consistent with structural perturbation in the acute phase and neurobiochemical changes (P-Tau and GFAP induction) in the subacute and chronic phase as well as development of chronic neurobehavioral changes, which resemble those observed in mTBI patients.",

      "abstract": "After many decades of being considered simply a clinical endocrinology “curiosity”, the long-term endocrine consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have in the past few years been the subject of resurgent interest. First reported almost 100 years ago,1 chronic pituitary dysfunction following a head injury was originally thought to be a rare occurrence.2 This viewpoint has been challenged by recent research on adult survivors of severe brain injury. These studies variously report the prevalence of pituitary hormone deficiencies to be between 23% and 69%.3–5 It is clear from these studies that one or any number of hypothalamic–pituitary hormone axes may be impaired in the chronic phase following head injury, with the growth hormone (GH; 10–33%), adrenal (5–23%) and gonadal axes (8–30%) apparently the most vulnerable to problems. Further clinical complexity is also evident from prospective, longitudinal observations, which suggest that for many head-injury survivors pituitary hormone dysfunction may not develop until at least 6 to 12 months after TBI, whereas, in others deficiencies can be transient and resolve spontaneously during the year after the trauma.5 6 Morbidity following moderate-to-severe head injury is high, and many of the chronic problems and symptoms reported in this group of patients (eg, fatigue, poor concentration and depression) are common to the clinical phenotype associated with hypopituitarism.\n\nClose follow-up and screening using appropriate endocrine-testing protocols have recently been proposed for adult patients who survive moderate-to-severe brain injury, not least because the early detection and treatment of partial or complete hormone deficiencies can lead to successful recovery and rehabilitation.7 \n\nWhile data have been accumulating with respect to adult survivors of TBI, evidence regarding children and adolescents with head-injury-induced hypothalamic–pituitary dysfunction is lacking.

      "abstract": "Becoming a nurse and caring for others can be very rewarding and fulfilling. However, caring for those in need can also lead to severe stress in all areas of nursing. In 1992 Joinson, a nurse, described the phenomenon of compassion fatigue (CF) as a unique form of burnout that affects people in caregiving professions. Figley (1995) defined it as a secondary traumatic stress reaction resulting from helping or desiring to help a person suffering from traumatic events. Its symptomology is nearly identical to that of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), except CF applies to caregivers who were affected by the trauma of others. Caregivers with CF may develop a preoccupation with their patients by re-experiencing their trauma; they can develop signs of persistent arousal and anxiety as a result of this secondary trauma. Examples of this arousal can include difficulty falling or staying asleep, irritability or outbursts of anger, and/or exaggerated startle responses. Most importantly, these caregivers ultimately experience a reduced capacity for, or interest in being empathic toward the suffering of others. Scholars differ in their perspectives of CF especially at it relates to burnout. However, they tend to agree that in general CF has a more sudden and acute onset than burnout, a condition that gradually wears down caregivers who are overwhelmed and unable to effect positive change. Understanding CF can empower nurses to utilize preventive measures that promote self care, improve patient outcomes, and optimize therapeutic relationships. Sabo, in her article, Reflecting on the Concept of reports that nurses working in specialty areas, such as intensive care, are quite vulnerable to work-related stress. She focuses on the theoretical conceptualization of CF, positing that care providers' declining ability to provide empathy in a therapeutic relationship is considered a key factor in compassion fatigue. Sabo explores Figley's (2002a) model of CF noting that the personal characteristics of resilience and hope, as well as the nature of relationships, may add more depth to Figley's model. She emphasizes the need to better understand the roles of empathy and engagement as contributors to CF. In Countering Fatigue: A Requisite Nursing Agenda Boyle, as does Sabo, distinguishes CF from burnout. Whereas CF stems from witnessing another's traumatic events, burnout evolves from dissatisfaction with working conditions. The author admits that both constructs result in outcomes associated with nurses' sense of emotional/physical depletion. Boyle, too, values the need to address resilience in CF research initiatives, especially since nurses are considered first responders who often have little or no formal support to counter the effects of CF. She further indicates that available tools for assessing CF are limited in scope and provide minimal help for nurses who are in dire need of onsite workplace interventions, such as counseling, support groups, and/or de-briefing sessions, to address CF. Lombard and Eyre bring an interesting case-study approach to their discussion of CF in Compassion Fatigue, A Nurse's Primer. They emphasize how CF can negatively affect job satisfaction and care providers' health, resulting in decreased productivity and increased turnover, a significant concern as nurses comprise the largest group of healthcare providers in the country. Lombard and Eyre, too, suggest that imbalanced, empathic, relationshipbased care can contribute to CF. Interventions, including a knowledge of CF symptoms and healthy workplace environments, can help to prevent CF among healthcare providers. Ward-Griffin, St-Amant, and Brown introduce an additional population considered to be at risk for CF in their article, Compassion Fatigue within Double Duty Caregiving: Nurse-Daughters Caring for Elderly Parents. Their qualitative study of nurse-daughters identifies the variable of being an informal family caregiver while at the same time working as an employee in a healthcare setting as another contributor to CF. …",

      "title": "What is the Relationship of Traumatic Brain Injury to Dementia?",
      "abstract": "There is a long history linking traumatic brain injury (TBI) with the development of dementia. Despite significant reservations, such as recall bias or concluding causality for TBI, a summary of recent research points to several conclusions on the TBI-dementia relationship. 1) Increasing severity o f a single moderate-to-severe TBI increases the risk of subsequent Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia. 2) Repetitive, often subconcussive, mild TBIs increases the risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative neuropathology. 3) TBI may be a risk factor for other neurodegenerative disorders that can be associated with dementia. 4) TBI appears to lower the age of onset of TBI-related neurocognitive syndromes, potentially adding \"TBI cognitive-behavioral features\". The literature further indicates several specific risk factors for TBI-associated dementia: 5) any blast or blunt physical force to the head as long as there is violent head displacement; 6) decreased cognitive and/or neuronal reserve and the related variable of older age at TBI; and 7) the presence of apolipoprotein E ɛ4 alleles, a genetic risk factor for AD. Finally, there are neuropathological features relating TBI with neurocognitive syndromes: 8) acute TBI results in amyloid pathology and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies; 9) CTE shares features with neurodegenerative dementias; and 10) TBI results in white matter tract and neural network disruptions. Although further research is needed, these ten findings suggest that dose-dependent effects of violent head displacement in vulnerable brains predispose to dementia; among several potential mechanisms is the propagation of abnormal proteins along damaged white matter networks.",

      "abstract": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been clinically known for over 3500 years, but due to political and financial reasons it was referred to by many names, to put the blame for its existence on the weakness of the victim instead of the abnormal hazards of war. Since it entered the DSM-3 as a specific illness entity (1980), the research and treatment methods grew tremendously, yet the way to diagnosis, understanding how the illness affects the victim, his family members and surrounding were left behind. Diagnosis of PTSD is largely based on the subjective reports of the victim. Talking about the trauma goes often in contradiction with the disorders' related feelings of avoidance, shame and guilt. On the other hand, the patient needs the recognition of his illness so that he can be compensated. These aspects lead to under- and over-diagnosis in many cases. Adding to the oddities of the illness in its diagnosis are the chronicity but wavy tendencies of the clinical picture (such as getting worse near the date of the trauma or when the terror rises) and the option of late onset PTSD etc.. One can understand the gaps between the suffering of the victims and the recognition of their handicap level.",

      "title": "Pathophysiology, evaluation and treatment of erectile dysfunction: review article",
      "abstract": "A disfunção erétil (DE) é a incapacidade recorrente de obter e manter uma ereção que permita atividade sexual satisfatória, sendo a disfunção sexual que mais afeta os homens no envelhecimento. Estima-se que 50% dos homens acima de 40 anos apresentem essa disfunção. Como a prevalência é expressiva, torna-se necessária a realização de uma revisão da literatura sobre epidemiologia, fisiopatologia e tratamento acerca da DE, com o intuito de melhor compreensão da doença. A ereção é dependente de vários fatores como o relaxamento do músculo liso do corpo cavernoso, o aumento do fluxo arterial e a restrição do fluxo venoso de saída. Esses mecanismos podem estar prejudicados em várias doenças, sendo que, em alguns casos, a DE pode ser considerada como marcador precoce de problemas mais graves. Essa disfunção sexual apresenta várias etiologias: vascular, endócrina, neurológica, psicológica/psiquiátrica e relacionada às drogas ou às intervenções cirúrgicas. O próprio tratamento de algumas doenças de base pode ser a causa ou o agravamento da DE, como alguns anti-hipertensivos e antidepressivos. A principal explicação para a DE é a redução da disponibilidade de óxido nítrico, um importante vasodilatador. Contudo, fazem também parte de sua fisiopatologia a obstrução mecânica dos vasos sanguíneos e problemas de transmissão de estímulos neurológicos. A DE é primeiramente avaliada pelo método clínico, mas existem instrumentos avaliativos multidimensionais, sendo o Índice Internacional de Função Erétil considerado o padrão-ouro. O tratamento pontual para esta doença deve ser fundado na sua etiologia. Existem várias linhas de tratamento, sendo os inibidores da fosfodiesterase-5 e a psicoterapia (para DE psicogênica ou mista) os de primeira escolha, associados ou não à reposição de testosterona. Como segunda-linha, tem-se a injeção intracavernosa de substâncias vasoativas. Caso essas terapias não produzam resultado, a prótese peniana pode ser indicada.",

The specific sounds reported during episodes of exploding head syndrome are quite variable and can include perceptions of fireworks, lightening cracks, or nondescript screaming. Visual experiences (e.g., light flashes) may also be involved. A variety of etiological theories exist for exploding head syndrome, but the most popular of these implicates abnormal surges of neuronal activity within the brainstem during sleep-wake transitions—surges which then are perceived as the loud and startling sounds. Although episodes are more common than initially thought and can have important clinical impacts on sufferers, exploding head syndrome is still a relatively unknown disorder. Further, its characteristic symptoms have also been incorporated into several current conspiracy theories, of which many clinicians may be unaware.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic spasmodic torticollis is a form of focal dystonia affecting the neck. It is characterised by involuntary repetitive or sustained neck muscle contractions leading to abnormal head postures and impaired control of head movement.1-3 With an estimated prevalence of 9/100 0004 spasmodic torticollis is the most common focal dystonia. Onset peaks around the age of 40 and there is a female preponderance with a sex ratio of about 1.5:1.5 Symptoms typically start gradually over a period of days or weeks and remain largely confined to the neck although spread of dystonia to the face (blepharospasm, oromandibular dystonia), larynx (laryngeal dystonia), and arms (dystonic arm postures and writer's cramp), but not the legs, can occur.1 Abnormal head and neck postures in spasmodic torticollis cause considerable disability, often interfering with the patient's ability to work, and cause pain, social stigmatisation, and depression.6 Most cases are sporadic. However, a family history is reported in about 15% of patients1 and several families with more than four affected members have been described,7-12 all of whom showed autosomal dominant inheritance. Thus genetic factors seem to have some aetiological importance.\n\nThe pathophysiology of spasmodic torticollis is still unclear. In idiopathic spasmodic torticollis no structural lesions are found in the CNS. However, there are two lines of evidence that dysfunction of the basal ganglia plays a part. Firstly, spasmodic torticollis can be seen either in isolation or as part of a more widespread hemidystonia after lesions of the basal ganglia or its connections.13-16Secondly, it is sometimes part of the clinical presentation in generalised primary torsion dystonia,17 in which functional imaging data and neurophysiological studies have shown abnormalities in the basal ganglia and its projections.18-21 \n\nIf focal dystonias, including spasmodic torticollis, were solely caused by dysfunction of the basal …",

      "abstract": "We describe some physiotherapeutic techniques and manoeuvres releasing the increased tone of spastic and shortened muscles. The techniques can be generally characterised and summed up into three groups as follows: I. First types of manoeuvres consists in setting up the extremity or segment into the position usually opposed or antagonistic to the limited direction. This position is held for several tens of seconds. After this, partial of the originally limited range of motion could be observed. A modification of this approach is effective for persistent extensor spasticity of the lower extremities. Extremity is taken up into the internal rotation and flexion of the hip joint, into the maximal flexion of knee joint and into dorsiflexion of ankle joint, and this position is held at least for 30 seconds. After this, the extensor spasticity is usually diminished and also the voluntary movements and gait pattern improved. II. Short active jerk (not exceeding 1/2 sec) in the free direction, alternatively against mild resistance, followed by 3-4 second release and slow stretch into the restricted range. It is essentially important that the initial jerk is as brisk as possible but performed with no special effort. In case the resistance is applied, it should be only slight. Then the therapist must grasp a \"melting\" of the hypertonus and cautiously guide the segment into the slow and gentle stretch. III. Pressure stimulation of the particular active zones. The application of these manoeuvres and its combinations are demonstrated in case reports.",

Special stress was put on the bioelectrical background or phenomena accompanying epilepsy and depression. Current knowledge about biochemical and structural background of depression is wide and enough well recognized. In contrast, studies on bioelectric conditions of depressive disorders are quite poor, despite the fact that the bioelectric phenomena are--beside biochemical processes--the immanent feature of nervous cells. Currently--apart from the kindling phenomenon--there is a lack of theories or hypotheses trying to explain the origin of depression (affective disorders) with perturbation of bioelectrical functions in neurons. Certain bioelectrical phenomena accompanying the different forms of antidepressant therapy (e.g. changing in the threshold level) are recognized as accidental side effects or not possessing the clinical meaning. The analysis conducted shows a necessity of intensifying experimental and clinical investigations over explaining the usefulness of the electric phenomena in the pathomechanism of depressive disorders.",

Manusia tidak secara tiba tiba menjadi tua, tetapi berkembang dari bayi, anak-anak, dewasa dan akhirnya menjadi tua. Masa tua merupakan masa hidup manusia yang terakhir atau periode penutup dalam rentang hidup seseorang, masa ini di mulai usia enam puluh sampai meninggal yang di tandai dengan adanya perubahan fisik, psikologis, sosial dan spiritual yang semakin menurun. Penyakit yang sering dijumpai pada lansia adalah hipertensi berdampak pada jantung dan stroke. Pengobatan hipertensi berlangsung seumur hidup sehingga harus dikombinasikan dengan pengobatan non farmakologis yaitu relaksasi napas dalam.  Proses menua akan terjadi perubahan-perubahan baik anatomis, biologis, fisiologis maupun psikologis. Gejala-gejala kemunduran fisik antara lain kulit mulai mengendur, timbul keriput, mulai beruban, pendengaran dan penglihatan berkurang, mudah lelah, gerakan mulai lamban dan kurang lincah masalah tersebut akan berpotensi pada masalah kesehatan baik secara umum maupun kesehatan jiwa adalah satu kesehatan jiwa yang terganggu adalah mengalami kecemasan. Rasa cemas ini merupakan keadaan mental yang tidak enak berkenaan dengan sakit yang mengancam atau yang dibayangkan, ditandai oleh kekawatiran, ketidakenakan dan perasa tidak baik yang tidak dapat dihindari, disertai perasaan tidak berdaya karena merasa menemui jalan buntu dan kemampuan untuk menemukan pemecahan masalah terhadap masalah yang diahadapi. Tujuan relaksasi nafas dalam adalah mencapai keadaan relaksasi menyeluruh, mencakup keadaan relaksasi secara fisiologis, secara kognitif, dan secara behavioral. Secara fisiologis, keadaan relaksasi ditandai dengan penurunan kadar epinefrin dan non epinefrin dalam darah, penurunan frekuensi denyut jantung (sampai mencapai 24 kali per menit), penurunan tekanan darah, penurunan frekuensi nafas (sampai 4-6 kali per menit), penurunan ketegangan otot, metabolisme menurun, vasodilatasi dan peningkatan temperature pada extermitas. Kata Kunci : Cemas, Lansia, Hipertensi, Relaksasi Nafas Dalam ABSRACT Elderly (elderly) is part of the human development process. Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation. The aging process will result in anatomical, biological, physiological and psychological changes. Symptoms of physical deterioration include sagging skin, wrinkles, graying, reduced hearing and vision, fatigue, slow movement and less agility.These problems will potentially lead to health problems both in general and mental health is a disturbed mental health. is experiencing anxiety. This anxiety is an uncomfortable mental state with regard to threatening or imagined pain, characterized by unavoidable worry, displeasure and bad feelings, accompanied by feelings of helplessness due to feeling stuck and the ability to find solutions to problems. faced. The goal of deep breath relaxation is to achieve a state of complete relaxation, including a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral state of relaxation. Physiologically, a state of relaxation is characterized by decreased levels of epinephrine and non-epinephrine in the blood, decreased heart rate (up to 24 times per minute), decreased blood pressure, decreased breathing frequency (up to 4-6 times per minute), decreased muscle tension, decreased metabolism, vasodilation and increased temperature at extermitas.

Postural hypotension may be a presenting feature in certain autonomic disorders (such as pure autonomic failure), it may be a pointer towards an alternative diagnosis (as in multiple system atrophy presenting with parkinsonian features), and it may complicate drug therapy (as with levodopa). Postural hypotension is associated with increased morbidity and also mortality, especially in elderly people, in whom falls result in injuries. Advances have resulted in a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes, and in the treatment of postural hypotension.\n\nPostural hypotension usually is considered when there are characteristic features resulting from cerebral ischaemia such as loss of consciousness (fainting, syncope). Other symptoms may occur (table1).2 Measuring blood pressure while lying and after 2 minutes of standing often confirms a postural fall. However, the lack of a fall, in the presence of suggestive symptoms, should warrant further investigation. There are various disorders, including the chronic fatigue syndrome and the postural tachycardia syndrome, in which postural intolerance may not be accompanied by hypotension. Additional factors may be needed to unmask postural hypotension (table2), especially in mild to moderate autonomic failure.\n\nView this table:\n\nTable 1 \nSome of the symptoms resulting from postural hypotension, and impaired perfusion of various organs\n\n\n\nView this table:\n\nTable 2 \nFactors that may influence postural hypotension\n\n\n\nFurther evaluation is best undertaken in an autonomic laboratory.

Often referred to as myxedema psychosis, it is less frequently reported in the subclinical form of hypothyroidism compared to the clinical form, and rarely presents as its first manifestation, in the absence of any physical symptoms or signs. Our case report concerns a 46-year-old woman, with a medical history of a total thyroidectomy and irregular adherence to thyroxine treatment, who presented with a first-episode psychosis of subacute onset dominated by persecutory delusional ideas, formal thought disorder and emotional lability, without evident hypothyroidism signs or symptoms. Investigations revealed an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and a normal free T4 (FT4). Other medical causes of acute psychosis were excluded, and the diagnosis of psychosis associated with subclinical hypothyroidism was assumed. Treatment with oral levothyroxine combined with olanzapine was initiated, leading to a rapid improvement, with complete remission of symptoms after ten days, concurrently with a gradual normalization of thyroid function. Antipsychotic treatment was suspended three months after discharge, with maintained remission of psychotic symptoms during the two-year follow-up. This clinical case highlights the importance of considering hypothyroidism in the differential diagnosis of a first-episode psychosis, even in the subclinical form and in the absence of physical signs or symptoms. The hormonal replacement therapy, combined or not with antipsychotic medication, leads to excellent prognosis in the majority of cases.",

Symptoms start shortly after the triggering acoustic incident and can be short-lived or can last for a considerable time. If persistent, the condition can lead to significant disability. Proposed mechanisms include involvement of the tensor tympani muscle, hyperexcitability of central auditory pathways, and a precursive state of raised anxiety or arousal. A formal treatment programme has not yet been proposed, but the potential utility of modern therapeutic techniques for tinnitus and hyperacusis are considered.

This condition is common, with a lifetime prevalence of up to 13%, and one third of affected persons have major dysfunction. <i>Methods:</i> The English-language literature on social anxiety disorder indexed on MEDLINE was searched using the phrases \"social phobia\" or \"social anxiety disorder;\" this search was supplemented with other data sources, such as recent textbooks, to determine common clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and management in the primary care setting. <i>Results:</i> Recognition and treatment of social anxiety disorder is poor; only a small minority of patients with this condition have it appropriately diagnosed or treated. Primary care physicians should suspect social anxiety disorder in patients who have specific symptoms and signs (such as hyperhidrosis, flushing, tremor, and white-coat hypertension), in patients who have symptoms of anxiety (such as chest pain, palpitations, or dizziness), or in patients who have another known anxiety disorder, depression, or substance abuse. Drug treatment consists of serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or high-potency benzodiazepines. A specific type of psychotherapy called cognitive behavioral therapy is another effective treatment, but it is not acceptable or accessible to most patients. <i>Conclusions:</i> Because social anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and treatable, primary care physicians should intensify their efforts to recognize it.",

A dor e definida pela Associacao Internacional para o Estudo da Dor como “uma experiencia sensorial e emocional desagradavel associada a dano tecidual real ou potencial”. E a causa mais comum de incapacidade, sendo frequentemente acompanhada por mudancas dramaticas na qualidade de vida. Atualmente, o manejo da epilepsia com os farmacos antiepilepticos e o controle da dor com o uso de analgesicos derivados ou nao do opio apresentam diversos efeitos adversos, fazendo com que a busca por novos farmacos que atuem no controle destas afeccoes seja um desafio da terapeutica atual. Dessa forma, diversos estudos vem sendo realizados para investigar tais propriedades em compostos de origem natural.

A 4-hidroxicumarina (4HC) e um precursor imediato de anticoagulantes naturais e sinteticos, mas tambem, possui efeito antitumoral. Devido as propriedades farmacologicas ja atribuidas as cumarinas e as necessidades apresentadas quanto a descoberta de farmacos promissores que possam atuar no controle da dor e da convulsao com menores efeitos adversos, esse trabalho tem como objetivo avaliar a atividade anticonvulsivante e antinociceptiva da 4-hidroxicumarina em modelos experimentais.

A administracao do veiculo, 4-hidroxicumarina (nas doses de 50, 75, 100 e 200 mg/kg) ou dos controles positivos aconteceram trinta minutos antes da realizacao dos testes farmacologicos. O trabalho foi submetido e aprovado pela COMISSAO DE ETICA NO USO DE ANIMAIS (CEUA) da Universidade Federal do Vale do Sao Francisco – UNIVASF, registrada com o no 0001/240818. A atividade anticonvulsivante foi avaliada por meio do teste das convulsoes induzidas pelo pentilenotetrazol (PTZ) e a atividade antinociceptiva analisada por meio de modelos quimicos de nocicepcao, como o teste das contorcoes abdominais induzidas pelo acido acetico, o teste da dor orofacial induzida pela formalina e pelo glutamato. No teste do PTZ, a 4HC na dose de 200mg/kg nao aumentou a latencia para inicio das convulsoes quando comparado ao grupo controle. Na avaliacao antinociceptiva, a 4-HC diminuiu o numero de contorcoes abdominais induzidas pelo acido acetico nas doses 50, 75 e 100mg/kg, o que pode estar relacionado ao impedimento da liberacao ou antagonismo da acao dos mediadores inflamatorios nos neuronios sensoriais. No teste da formalina reduziu o comportamento nociceptivo nas duas fases do teste nas doses de 75 e 100mg/kg evidenciando controle nos mecanismos centrais e perifericos da dor, e apresentou reducao significativa no comportamento nociceptivo no teste do glutamato em todos os grupos tratados (50, 75 e 100 mg/kg). Dessa forma, conclui-se que a 4-HC nao possui atividade anticonvulsivante, entretanto, foi constatada atividade antinociceptiva por meios dos testes de nocicepcao quimica, sugerindo mecanismos de acao central e periferica e atuacao na via glutamatergica.",

Typically, brief attacks are triggered by talking, chewing, teeth brushing, shaving, a light touch, or even a cool breeze. The pain is nearly always unilateral, and it may occur repeatedly throughout the day. The diagnosis is typically determined clinically, although imaging studies or referral for specialized testing may be necessary to rule out other diseases. Accurate and prompt diagnosis is important because the pain of trigeminal neuralgia can be severe. Carbamazepine is the drug of choice for the initial treatment of trigeminal neuralgia; however, baclofen, gabapentin, and other drugs may provide relief in refractory cases. Neurosurgical treatments may help patients in whom medical therapy is unsuccessful or poorly tolerated.",

In a review of 27 cases (11♂, 16♀, 22 families) the cytogenetic and clinical data were tabulated and analyzed. Diagnosis is established by karyotype: there is always partial or apparently “total” trisomy of the short arm of chromosome 4. In 19 families a parent carried either a balanced translocation (16 times) or a pericentric inversion (3 times); 3 patients had de novo duplication of 4p. In several cases, additional deletions or trisomies were present. From the analysis of all cases, but particularly of the “pure” trisomies, the phenotypic spectrum of this condition was observed and found to be a specific multiple congenital anomaly/mental retardation (MCA/MR) syndrome. Its main features are a characteristic facial appearance, postnatal growth retardation, severe psychomotor retardation with or without seizures, microcephaly, and various major and minor anomalies.",

When an acute headache occurs repeatedly or episodically it is often a primary headache with migraine and tension-type headache being the most frequent cause in children and adolescents. A chronic or very frequent headache may be secondary to migraine. Headache disorders can affect the lifestyle of both the child and his or her family resulting in significant disability. This can include time lost from school and parental absence from work, while also affecting the child and parent interaction at home and the child’s social interaction with peers. The majority of children and adolescents with headache never consult a physician (Sillanpa¨a¨ et al., 1991).",

This technique has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of chronic pain. The authors present a review of the literature, focusing on surgical technique, device programming, safety, and efficacy, and suggest some initial guidelines for standardization of these aspects.

      "abstract": "Background: Overactive bladder syndrome is a urinary disorder that occurs more frequently in women andolder people and is characterized by feeling an urge to urinate (sudden urge to urinate, with the feeling thatyou cannot get to the bathroom in time), doing it many times throughout the day (more than six) or havingepisodes of urinary incontinence (involuntary loss of urine) and nocturia (waking up several times duringthe night to urinate). In addition, other secondary symptoms may also occur, such as headache, dry mouth orblurred vision, among others. It is a problem that has a clear impact on the quality of life of those who sufferit and that can lead them to significantly reduce their social activity and negatively condition their work.Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence,nocturia, and/or frequency in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology. Sacral neuromodulation is anewer surgical therapy for refractory OAB.Aim of Study: Is to assess the sacral neuromodulation (SN) safety and efficacy in refractory overactivebladder patients.Patients and Methods: In the period from November 2015 to May 2017. the unit of neurogenic bladderand neuromodulation in (Gazi Al_Harriry) surgical specialty hospital, medical city complex 27 patient agedfrom (17—55) year old were complaining from refractory overactive bladder. All the 27 patients underwentstage1 &amp; stage2 SNS devices implantation.Results: Patients of urgency incontinence (group1) demonstrated that the number of leak was significantlyreduced (p=0.01) after implantation of SN, (11.6_2.7) leak/day pre&amp; post SN, numbers of pads (6.9 _ 0.8)pad/day pre&amp;post SN. Patients with urgency frequency (group 2), numbers of voids/day pre &amp; post SNimplantation decreased significantly (p=0.01) (14.7 _ 6) voids /day. The voided volume increased significantly(p=0.02) from (136.4 _ 371.8) ml/void. The urgency episodes were decreased significantly (p=0.01) from(6.4 _ 2.1) episode/day. The complications occurred in 5 patients (18.5%). Two patients (7.4%) developedpain after trauma to the back, lead migration, lack of efficacy of device, treated by reprogramming thedevice, one patient (3.7%) get infection at the site of device implantation, SN was removed , there was onefemale patient (3.7%) got pregnancy and devise was deactivated. One patient (3.7%) complaining from painand discomfort at the device site was treated conservatively.Conclusion: Sacral neuromodulation is FDA approved as option for treatment of refractory OAB. There isexpanding of utilizing of SN in the past two decades. According to multiple studies in addition to our studyresults. The sacral neuromodulation is safe and efficacious treatment option for refractory OAB.",

      "abstract": "'Trauma' tends to exceed human understanding. It disrespects boundaries, interrupts all kinds of units and makes them blend, it disturbs bodily and psychic organisms and upsets social and historical organization. Some characteristics of the history of trauma have their origin in this situation. One of them is the gradual extension for instance of the notion of 'trauma' which makes the surgical 'wound' (greek: trauma) evolve into a bio-psycho-social phenomenon. Other characteristics of the history of trauma are its association with questions of endogenous versus exogenous causes of suffering and with the issue of guilt and its recurrent falling into oblivion. The paper traces the history of traumatogenic illness from the simple wound to forensically important damages like the 'railway-injuries' entitling to claims for damages, to 'traumatic-' and 'war-neuroses' and finally to the more or less endemic 'posttraumatic stress syndrome' of present time.",

This was characterized by intense burning pain in the area supplied by the injured nerve. The pain, evoked by the lightest touch, has the peculiar characteristic of becoming agonizingly severe with emotional stimuli and exposure to cold (or tropical heat, as observed by Denny-Brown in Burma). Trophic changes develop with glossy skin and atrophy from disuse. The so-called minor causalgia results from nonpenetrating and often relatively mild trauma to an extremity, most often the wrist, hand, or ankle.

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medical disorders can give rise to disturbances of sleep and alter sleep architecture. Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

      "title": "[Administration of thyroid hormones in therapy of psychiatric illnesses].",
      "abstract": "This review tries to give the state of the art of the therapeutic use of thyroid hormones in psychiatric disorders, mainly in depression. Four hypotheses suggest an effect in these ailments: 1) a local relative T4 excess present (or better postulated to be present) in the brain of depressed patients is lowered by triiodothyronine (T3), by lowering serum levels of thyroxine (T4), 2) the effect of a depression-mediated cerebral lack of catecholamines is compensated by the T3/T4 induced activation of beta-receptors, 3) a postulated depression-induced local cerebral hypothyroidism can be counteracted by T3 and T4. 4) thyroid hormones increase the cerebral content of serotonin. This may be beneficial in depression, where shortage of serotonin in the brain is accused to be etiologically important. Thyroid hormones have been used so far in the following ways: 1) as T3 monotherapy in depression; 2) initial additive T3 for acceleration of the response to treatment with tricyclic antidepressants (TCA); 3) additive T3 for augmentation of the response to TCA in therapy-resistant patients with depression, 4) as high-dose (250-500 micrograms/die) T4-treatment of \"rapid cycling bipolar disorder\". Low dose (5-50 mg/die) T3 \"augmentation therapy\" is the best documented form of treatment with thyroid hormones in depression. The results suggest a convincing benefit for a varying percentage of non responders to therapy with TCA. For the other forms of treatment placebo-controlled double blind studies are not yet available or give conflicting results.",

      "title": "Treating Bipolar Mania in the Outpatient Setting: Enlist the Help of Family, Employ Evidence-Based Pharmacologic and Psychotherapeutic Strategies",
      "abstract": "Manic episodes, by definition, are associated with significant social or occupational impairment. (1) Some manic patients are violent or engage in reckless behaviors that can harm themselves or others, such as speeding, disrupting traffic, or playing with fire. When these patients present to a psychiatrist's outpatient practice, involuntary hospitalization might be justified. However, some manic patients, in spite of their elevated, expansive, or irritable mood state, never behave dangerously and might not meet legal criteria for involuntary hospitalization, although these criteria differ from state to state. These patients might see a psychiatrist because manic symptoms such as irritability, talkativeness, and impulsivity are bothersome to their family members but pose no serious danger (Box, page 40). Box Manic, but refusing inpatient treatment Accompanied by her husband and mother, Mrs. W. age 31, is seeking help for insomnia and anxiety. She reports that she has been unable to sleep more than a few hours a night for the last 2 weeks and is having spontaneous panic attacks. Her affect is elevated, she is hyperverbal and loud, and she repeatedly stands up and paces during the interview. Mrs. W's husband tells you that she doesn't sleep. has spent $1,000 in the last week on random items, is calling her friends and her doctors all day and night. and is so easily distracted that she cannot safely take care of their infant. These behaviors are abnormal for Mrs. W when she is well, he reports. but also occurred during a previous manic episode. He says she is doing nothing dangerous and she hasn't voiced any threats of self-harm or violence toward others. Mrs. W's family is concerned about her behavior. Because you are unable to involuntarily commit Mrs. W to a psychiatric hospital. you recommend that she voluntarily check herself into a hospital. Her family strongly supports this idea, but Mrs. W refuses. In this situation, the psychiatrist can strongly encourage the patient to seek voluntary hospitalization or attend a partial hospitalization program. If the patient declines, the psychiatrist is left with 2 choices: initiate treatment in the outpatient setting or refuse to treat the patient and refer to another provider. Treating non-dangerous mania in the outpatient setting is fraught with challenges: * the possibility that the patient's condition will progress to dangerousness * poor adherence to treatment because of the patient's limited insight * the large amount of time required from the psychiatrist and care team to adequately manage the manic episode (eg, time spent with family members, frequent patient visits, and managing communications from the patient). There are no guidelines to assist the office-based practitioner in treating mania in the outpatient setting. When considering dosing and optimal medication combinations for treating mania, clinical trials may be of limited value because most of these studies only included hospitali7ed manic patients. Because of this dearth of knowledge, we provide recommendations based on our review of the literature and from our experience working with manic patients who refuse voluntary hospitalization and could not be hospitali7ed against their will. These recommendations are organized into 3 sections: diagnostic approach, treatment strategy, and family involvement. Diagnostic approach Making a diagnosis of mania might seem straightforward for clinicians who work in inpatient settings; however, mania might not present with classic florid symptoms among outpatients. Patients might have a chief concern of irritability, dysphoria, anxiety, or insomnia, which may lead clinicians to focus initially on non-bipolar conditions. (2) [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] During the interview, it is important to assess for any current DSM-5 symptoms of a manic episode, while being careful not to accept a patient's denial of symptoms. …",

      "abstract": "Presbylarynx refers to age-related structural changes of the vocal folds that include muscle atrophy, reduced neuromuscular control, loss of superficial lamina propria layer, and reduced pliability. The changes result in thin and bowed vocal folds, increased vocal effort requirements, breathy voice, change in habitual pitch, and strain. The primary treatment options are voice therapy focused on strengthening breath support and the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, and optimization of resonance; injection augmentation of the vocal folds; and type I thyroplasty. Functional dysphonia is defined as change in voice quality in the absence of structural or neurological abnormalities of the larynx. Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) is a subtype of functional voice disorders and involves laryngeal muscle tension imbalance due to excessive or dysregulated activation resulting often in strained or breathy voice. MTD can be divided into primary (psychological etiology or vocal misuse) and secondary (compensatory for organic laryngeal pathology). The mainstay of treatment for MTD is voice therapy, along with medical or surgical treatment of the underlying vocal pathology in secondary MTD. Mutational falsetto, or puberphonia, is a functional voice disorder where a high-pitched, pre-adolescent voice fails to transition to the lower pitch of adulthood.

Aspects of behavior not meeting these criteria but relevant to a study of aggression should be described using appropriate terms such as social dominance, initiative, etc. With these conventions, examination of the heterogeneous literature on lithium treatment of aggression demonstrates that lithium ion exerts an antiaggressive effect in man. A number of hypotheses for the antiaggressive effect are examined using previous studies and new behavioral and biochemical data. It is concluded that the antiaggressive effect is not due to any of the following: lithium toxicity or side effects; subjective or objective weakness; increased reaction time; reduced coordination or motor performance; frank cognitive deficits; hypothyroidism; reduction of serum testosterone; placebo effect; or underlying manic‐depressive illness. Putative “thymoleptic” properties of lithium are too ambiguous to constitute an explanation of lithium's actions in man.",

They represent inhibitions in the appetitive or psychophysiologic changes that characterize the complete adult sexual response and are classified into four major categories: (1) sexual desire disorders (hypoactive sexual desire, sexual aversion disorder), (2) sexual arousal disorders (female sexual arousal disorder, male erectile dysfunction), (3) orgasmic disorders (inhibited male or female orgasm, premature ejaculation), and (4) sexual pain disorders (dyspareunia, vaginismus).Articles about the sexual dysfunctions were obtained from a search of MEDLINE files from 1966 to the present using the categories as key words, along with the general key word \"sexual dysfunction.\" Additional articles came from the reference lists of dysfunction-specific reviews.Cause and pathogenesis span a continuum from organic to psychogenic and most often include a mosaic of factors. Organic factors include chronic illness, pregnancy, pharmacologic agents, endocrine alterations, and a host of other medical, surgical, and traumatic factors. Psychogenic factors include an array of individual factors (e.g., depression, anxiety, fear, frustration, guilt hypochondria, intrapsychic conflict), interpersonal and relationship factors (e.g., poor communication, relationship conflict, diminished trust, fear of intimacy, poor relationship models, family system conflict), psychosexual factors (e.g., negative learning and attitudes, performance anxiety, prior sexual trauma, restrictive religiosity, intellectual defenses), and sexual enactment factors (e.g., skill and knowledge deficits, unrealistic performance expectations). Understanding the cause and pathophysiology of sexual disorders will help primary care physicians diagnose these problems accurately and manage them effectively.",

      "abstract": "Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) refers to any situation in which an individual is unable to completely close the nasal airway during speech.The velopharyngeal mechanism is comprised of a complex group of structures that act in unison to control airflow through the nose and mouth by elevation of the soft palate and constriction of both the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls (►Fig. 1).Any disruption in this mechanism may result in abnormal, poorly intelligible speech.VPD can manifest as hypernasality, nasal emission, decreased vocal intensity, and/or facial grimacing. 1Moreover, patients who suffer from VPD will frequently develop maladaptive articulations to compensate for their speech difficulties. 2umerous etiologies can be responsible for this failure of normal speech production.Myoneurogenic problems can impair muscle control or affect muscle programming.Anatomic irregularities can present as a tissue deficit, structural problems that affect function, or even mechanical interference preventing normal closure.Mislearning comprises a host of etiologies whereby the patient has developed abnormal usage of the velopharyngeal mechanism despite the absence of other pathology. 3elopharyngeal dysfunction is a carefully chosen term that simply denotes the presence of incomplete velopharyngeal closure without making suggestions as to its cause.Use of this nomenclature has gained increasing favor by experts, replacing the previous designation, velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI).This helps to avoid confusion, as VPI has been differentially interpreted as denoting insufficiency, incompetence, and inadequacy-terms that may be similar, but are not synonymous and potentially implicate the cause of the dysfunction rather than describe the clinical finding.VPD is seen in roughly 20 to 30% of individuals who have undergone cleft palate repair, 4,5 and 5 to 10% of patients with a submucous cleft palate (SMCP). 6",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "title": "Closed Head Traumatic Brain Injury Drives Protracted Inflammation and Remodeling of Serotonergic Architecture in the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus",
      "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) presents a monumental public health burden that affects over 3 million Americans annually, with mild TBI (mTBI)/concussion being the most common form of closed head injury. Chronic neuropsychiatric sequalae are common following TBI, with many individuals spontaneously developing persistent depression, anxiety, social withdrawal and/or PTSD, disorders that have been previously linked to alterations in serotonin (5-HT) signaling. Currently, the effects of various forms of TBI on the function of the 5-HT signaling system within the CNS are poorly understood and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fail to mitigate the clinical neuropsychiatric sequalae elicited by TBI. The lack of any FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of acute or chronic symptoms of TBI necessitates a greater understanding of how TBI alters the environmental milieu of the CNS, including normal, physiologic 5-HT signaling. We hypothesize that TBI drives the formation of aberrant behavioral states linked to neuropsychiatric disorders through alterations of normal, physiologic 5-HT signaling stemming from 5-HT neurons located within the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). To test this hypothesis, adult, wild type C57Bl/6J mice were subjected to a single, blast induced mTBI or sham treatment, followed by behavioral and/or molecular analyses 0-10 days post-injury (dpi). mTBI subjects exhibited significantly increased righting reflex times (RRT) compared to their sham counterparts immediately post-injury. Ten dpi, mTBI subjects exhibited significant reductions in sociability and social dominance as compared to their sham counterparts in the Crawley three chamber sociability assay and tube test, respectively. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed a time-dependent increase in total levels of 5-HT and its metabolite, 5HIAA within the DRN 10 dpi. No effect of mTBI on 5-HT or 5HIAA levels were found in prefrontal cortex (PFC) or somatosensory cortex (SSC), areas of high 5-HT innervation. Ten dpi, DRN punches were subjected to RNA-sequencing to delineate differential gene-expression profiles elicited by mTBI. Genes indicative of cellular remodeling, cell-to-cell adhesion, monoaminergic processing, and proliferation were identified. Crucially, genes involved in ongoing inflammation including those relevant to peripheral immune recruitment and blood brain barrier permeation were found to be differentially expressed. Quantitative real-time PCR was subsequently used to confirm differential expression of genes of interest, notably Vegfc, Slc18a1, and Icam1. These studies provide critical insight into ongoing molecular processes following closed head injury that may impact normal, physiologic 5-HT signaling within the DRN. Further, these studies may provide critical insight into regulation of 5-HT neuron function within the DRN and yield novel drug candidates for ameliorating the neuropsychiatric complications elicited by TBI.",

      "abstract": "Neurotrauma means head or spine injury caused by an external force. Neurotraumatology care requires coordinated teamwork on the part of specialists, including psychological care as part of the multidisciplinary treatment team. Psychological interventions in the field of neurotraumatology aim to address the psychological consequences and challenges associated with head or spine injury. These interventions play a vital role in crisis intervention, promoting recovery, enhancing quality of life, and supporting individuals and their families in coping with the psychological impact of neurotrauma. Serious physical injuries always cause severe psychological consequences, both in short and long term. A critical accident is a sudden, unexpected, often directly life-threatening event that exceeds the individual's ability to respond and can create a potential crisis response, including suicidal risk, as well as the development of psychological disorders, in most cases acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Psychological interventions in neurotraumatology are often provided by a multidisciplinary team that may include psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and other healthcare professionals. These interventions are tailored to the unique needs and circumstances of each individual, with the goal of reducing psychological symptomps, promoting psychological well-being, adjustment, and overall recovery following neurotrauma. It is essential that not only patients who have experienced severe physical trauma, but also their family members have access to expert psychological support. This study summarizes psychological interventions during the treatment of neurotaruma patients at the intensive care unit.",

      "abstract": "Tidur merupakan kebutuhan penting bagi seorang individu, tidur menjadi indikator untuk pemulihan stamina dan pembentukan daya tahan tubuh. Diperlukan waktu 6-8 jam perhari agar mendapatkan kualitas tidur yang baik. Insomnia merupakan persepsi atau keluhan atas kualitas tidur yang buruk ditandai dengan kesulitan memulai tidur, mempertahankan tidur, dan terbangun terlalu dini di pagi hari yang dapat menyebabkan kelelahan, kecemasan, kurang konsentrasi, hingga depresi yang dapat mengganggu aktifitas harian. \r\nData prevalensi insomnia sangat beragam di indonesia 10% dari total penduduk mengalami gangguan sulit tidur atau insomnia dan 15% diantaranya adalah kasus insomnia kronis. Insomnia sendiri diklasifikasikan ke beberapa hal. Berdasarkan waktu insomnia terbagi menjadi insomnia transien, insomnia jangka pendek, dan insomnia kronis, sedangkan berdasarkan etiologinya insomnia dibedakan menjadi insomnia primer dan insomnia sekunder.\r\nDalam TCM insomnia dapat diakibatkan karena defisiensi Qi jantung dan kandung empedu yang bisa diakibatkan karena pola hidup yang kurang baik, terlalu lama menderita penyakit, atau mengkonsumsi obat terlalu sering sehingga dapat menguras Qi dan darah. Penanganan insomnia dapat dilakukan menggunakan terapi kombinasi pijat swedia, tuina dan nutrisi olahan daun kelor. Pemberian pijat kombinasi adalah untuk memberikan efek relaksasi dan memanipulasi langsung kedalam titik akupuntur sedangkan pemberian nutrisi olahan daun kelor sebagai asupan tambahan sehingga insomnia dapat berkurang. Terapi pijat dilakukan menggunakan teknik swedia pada seluruh tubuh dan teknik tuina pada beberapa titik akupuntur seperti Jueyinshu (BL14), Xinshu (BL15), Pishu (BL20), Weishu (BL21), Shenshu (BL23), Fengchi (GB20), Jianjing (GB 21), Yintang (EX-HN3), Taiyang (EX-HN5), Shenting (GV24), Jingming (BL1), Cuanzhu (BL2), dan Sibai (ST2) yang dilakukan 21 kali terapi. Terapi pijat dilakukan setiap hari selama 21 hari. Terapi nutrisi yang diberikan menggunakan olahan daun kelor (Moringa oleifera) yaitu sayur bening daun kelor yang diberikan kepada pasien dengan takaran 238 gram per hari. Nutrisi daun kelor diberikan setiap hari selama 21 hari. olahan kelor diberikan 2 kali sehari dengan 1 kali pemberian mengandung 115 gram berupa sayur bening daun kelor.",

Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

It is generally assumed that these subjects are quite helpless and that they suffer general deterioration. This is at variance with results of training and rehabilitation during which many thus affected subjects become independent, which is essential for their social integration. Despite this they have to experience sociopsychological attitudes which are prejudices with a typical stereotype which ignore the unique structure of everybody's potential who lost eyesight. The source of prejudices is general lack of information of people as regards actual sequelae of loss of eyesight and the emotional reaction of people with normal eyesight. A certain part is also played by tradition which does not take into account results of modern care of thus affected subjects. Prejudices cause in subjects with severely affected eyesight and in blind persons mental stress and render their actual social integration (employment, partnership etc.) more difficult. The solution is to train resistance against prejudices in thus affected subjects and to intensify health education on the given problem.",

      "title": "Influencia de la fatiga en la calidad de movimiento de personas con lesión medular",
      "abstract": "La fatiga es un fenomeno fisiologico complejo por el que se limita la capacidad del individuo para mantener una actividad fisica concreta (Bigland-Ritchie y Woods, 1984). En individuos sanos el desarrollo de la fatiga esta ligado al ejercicio fisico siendo la causa principal que limita la duracion del mismo. Ademas, la fatiga aparece como parte de la patologia de diferentes enfermedades y su efecto es igualmente limitador de la actividad fisica. El estudio de un fenomeno tan complejo se ha realizado con distintos abordajes experimentales y en distintos niveles fisiologicos con individuos sanos, lo que ha permitido distinguir tres tipos basicos de fatiga: a) fatiga periferica, producida en el sistema neuro-muscular, b) fatiga sistemica producida por la respuesta neuro-endocrina, c) fatiga central que se produce en el sistema nervioso central (Taylor y Gandevia, 2008; Zwartz et al, 2008). Una lesion medular (LM) es un dano del sistema nervioso central (SNC), tanto de las vias motoras y reguladoras del movimiento, de las vias sensoriales o ascendentes, como de importantes circuitos del sistema nervioso autonomo. La alteracion de estas estructuras a medio y largo plazo genera modificaciones fisiologicas tanto en la corteza cerebral sensoriomotora (dolor neuropatico, miembro fantasma, etc) como en la medula espinal (espasticidad, hiperreflexia, dolor neuropatico, hyperreflexia simpatica etc). Las personas con LM (PLM) sufren una fatiga general (Fawkes-Kirby et al 2007 ; Anton et al 2008) asociada a su enfermedad. Por lo tanto una LM debe modificar el desarrollo y/o la intensidad de la fatiga central, lo cual no se ha estudiado hasta la actualidad. \nLas posibles causas de la excesiva fatiga central en el lesionado medular pueden ser de origen nervioso pero tambien de origen sistemico. La disautonomia de los pacientes lesionados medulares puede provocar una alteracion de los mecanismos homeostaticos sistemicos de la temperatura, electrolitos, etc y asi producir una excesiva fatiga cental tambien por encima del nivel de lesion. Asi que un estudio comparado de la fatiga central en individuos sanos y en individuos con lesion medular (a nivel supralesional) podria aportar conocimientos sobre el problema general de la fatiga central y en particular de los cambios a nivel central que un dano medular produce en las personas. \nEn este sentido, el uso de tecnicas no invasivas para estimulacion y registro del SNC ha permitido avanzar en el estudio de la fatiga central (Di Lazzaro, Oliviero et al 2003, Racinais et al 2007). Estas nuevas tecnicas, junto a las clasicas de electromiografia de superficie permiten, sobre todo a nivel de la corteza cerebral y en la medula espinal, evaluar la participacion del SNC en el desarrollo de la fatiga para ayudar a generar conocimiento en torno a como la enfermedad puede afectar la calidad de movimiento. \nEn base al marco teorico que estudiamos, la hipotesis inicial que se establecio fue que el comportamiento de los mecanismos de desarrollo de la fatiga central en personas con LM cursarian de forma diferente a los desarrollados por personas sanas sin patologias durante tareas de tipo agudo. Como hipotesis secundaria se senalo que para la misma tarea propuesta, la fatiga medida por via periferica en personas con LM presentaria valores similares o incluso inferiores que las personas sin lesion. \nPara lograr dar respuesta a las hipotesis planteadas, el objetivo principal de la tesis fue describir la influencia que la fatiga tiene en la calidad de movimiento de PLM a traves del estudio de los mecanismos de desarrollo de la fatiga central y periferica durante una CMV en personas con LM frente al comportamiento de los mismos en personas sin discapacidad (GC) y el objetivo secundario se centro en establecer criterios objetivos que cuantifiquen y describieran los mecanismos de desarrollo de la fatiga central y periferica en poblacion con LM a traves del estudio del SN.\nEn este sentido y tras llevar a cabo la fase experimental de la presente Tesis Doctoral, el analisis de resultados y su posterior discusion, se confirman ambas hipotesis, cumpliendo en su desarrollo tanto con la ejecucion del objetivo principal como del secundario. Las conclusiones a las que se han alcanzado tras la discusion de resultados son:\n• La fatiga no tiene aparentemente ninguna influencia de tipo negativo en la calidad de movimiento de PLM a traves del estudio de los mecanismos de desarrollo de la fatiga central y periferica durante una CMV en personas con LM frente al comportamiento de los mismos en personas sin discapacidad (GC).\n• Las PLM presentan menor fatiga tanto por via central como por via periferica frente al GC, resultando incluso significativamente inferior la fatiga central que las PLM presentan tras el esfuerzo con respecto a la manifestada por el GC.\n• Sin embargo, los mecanismos de desarrollo de la fatiga tanto por via cortical como periferica cursan de forma diferente en PLM frente a las personas sin discapacidad (GC).\n• La respuesta que las PLM obtienen tras el test de isometria continua propuesto, tiende a ser significativamente aumentada con respecto a la normalidad, registrandose tras la CMV una sobreactivacion tanto de las vias corticales como de las espinales.\n• Las personas con LM inferior a D6 son capaces de producir valores de fuerza similares al GC en acciones que impliquen la FPM.\n• La fatiga cronica descrita en la poblacion con LM podria deberse a la sobreactivacion que actividades de corta duracion y alta intensidad como las que se dan en sus actividades de la vida diaria sobre la SR provocan tanto a nivel cortical como periferico.",

      "title": "Sexual side effects of drugs.",
      "abstract": "The number of persons with drug induced sexual dysfunction has risen simultaneously with the unending increase in the number of commercially available drugs. Sexual dysfunction may seriously impair the human psyche. Patients do not often admit to sexual dysfunction, however, so physicians often miss the symptoms entirely. In addition, they may attribute them to other causes, such as depression. Drugs disrupt all 3 neurophysiologic phases of sexual response (desire, excitement, and orgasm), especially in men, either causing a decrease or loss of libido, impotence (the most common symptom), or failure of ejaculation or anorgasmia. The mechanisms involved are not well understood. Researchers do know, however, that the drug cimetidine (Tagamet) blocks androgen receptors, decreases testosterone synthesis, and induces higher circulating levels of estradiol resulting in impotence and breast enlargement in men. Antihypertensive drugs have a higher frequency of causing sexual dysfunction, particularly impotence, than other drugs. Some also induce or worsen depression that can in turn cause or intensify sexual dysfunction. Both legal and illegal psychoactive drugs act on multiple sites thus often stimulating sexual dysfunction. Further, some hormonal drugs also induce sexual side effects, such as norethindrone and progesterone. Physicians who prescribe a drug associated with sexual side effects should inform patients about their possible occurrence and recommend that they be aware of the symptoms. They should ask these patients do not usually offer this information themselves. If sexual dysfunction develops, physicians can reduce the dosage or switch to an alternative drug. At that time, they should express optimism that the sexual dysfunction will cease.",

      "title": "Asking “why me?” and second-guessing God",
      "abstract": "Abstract Patients commonly struggle to fit serious disease into their prior life story. They yearn for coherence and meaning and, like the Biblical Job, often ask, “Why me?” This statement can reflect anger and depression, and can also represent several different questions: (1) Why am I singled out? (why me vs. someone else); (2) What did I do to cause this, and what if I had acted differently? (3) Is this punishment? and (4) Does this fate reflect some kind of order, rather than mere randomness? Many patients wonder if they somehow deserve bad outcomes, and sometimes feel that they do, related to guilt, anger, and fear, even if recognizing, intellectually, that such emotions are unhelpful. Physical explanations of illness (e.g., genetics) often don’t feel fully satisfying. Psychotherapy can potentially ease but not necessarily eliminate these ponderings, and not everyone can afford it. Countless patients and families struggle in ways with which chaplains can assist.",

Conflicting results in previous studies might be due to the low number of clinical trials plus an indiscriminate application of different techniques.

Future research should address the evaluation of specific physical therapy procedures for each headache disorder, and the identification of those subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular intervention.",

      "title": "Lithium for Bipolar Disorder: A Re Emerging Treatment for Mood Instability: Low Dosage, Slow Titration Might Mitigate Side Effects",
      "abstract": "Lithiwn is among the most effective therapies for bipolar disorder (BD), and enthusiasm for this simple molecule is waxing. The history of lithium is fascinating, (1) and recent considerations include that this element, the third on the periodic table, has few, if any, industry champions. The recent renaissance is caused by a groundswell of appreciation for the clinical efficacy of lithium and an increasing number of providers who are willing to manage patients with lithium. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Target: Bipolar disorder The target illness for lithium is BD, a spectrum of mood disorders with characteristic features of unstable mood and affect. Shifts in mood include recurrent episodes of mania, which are pathologically energized states with misguided volition and behavior with intoxicating euphoria (or irritability).(2) Psychomotor activity is elevated and out of character; speech and body movements are revved up, with a diminished need for sleep. The social, personal, and vocational consequences often are disastrous. The most common mood state of BD is depression. Depressive episodes consist of pathologically compromised energy and volition with a slowing of bodily functions, most prominently cognition and concentration; a pervasive depressed or sad mood is common but not always present. Presence of mixed states, when features of depression and mania are present simultaneously, is one of the many challenges of treating BD; an elevated volitional or energized state may occur with a depressed, dysphoric mood. Evidence for lithium Efficacy studies of lithium have focused on managing mood disorders, treating mania and depression, and prevention or maintenance care. (3) Most were performed during the 1970s and 1980s, (3) but recent studies have been comparing lithium with other mood stabilizers (4-7) and searching for a genetic basis for lithium response.(8-10) Other researchers have examined the use of lithium to prevent suicide. (11) Some have suggested a neuroprotective effect of lithium, which may have profound implications for neuropsychiatry if valid. (12-14) Results of additional studies, which are at different stages of completion, will clarify lithium use, (15), (16) and characterize the genetic makeup of individuals who respond to lithium. (17) The primary evidence for lithium, however, is for maintenance treatment of BD and for preventing manic and depressive episodes. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Biochemistry and physiology of lithium. rhe biochemical and physiological effects pf lithium are complex, wide-ranging, ind likely to affect hundreds, if not thou-;ands, of genes and gene products. The mechanisms of action remain a focus of aca-lemic pursuit (for a review of hypotheses 7elated to these mechanisms see Goodwin and Jamison(2) and Can et al (18)) Lithium is involved in cell signaling pathways that involve complex molecular mechanisms of inter- and intracellular communication; (19) some neural receptors are down-regulatee (20) and others show inhibition (21) which is thought to be a mechanism of lithium. The hypothesized neuroprotective effect of lithium (22) may be mediated through an increased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in brain tissue. (14) Recently, investigators using induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons have shown that patterns of calcium-related cell signaling in bipolar neurons are affected specifically by lithium in the culture media. (23) There likely are many mechanisms through which lithium's effects are mediated, including a series of dynamic pathways that vary over time and in reaction to the internal and external environments of the cell and person. The lithium renaissance In the past decade, there has been an increase in interest and use of lithium because clinicians recognize its efficacy and advantages and can monitor serum levels and gauge the patient's response and side effects24 against the lithium level. …",

Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person′s family,work or school life and general health. Approximately 3. 4% of the patients with major depression commit suicide. Major depressive disorder is thought to result from the complex interplay of multiple inherited genetic factors and subsequent exposure to a wide range of environmental variables throughout life. The reciprocal connections between various brain regions and the neurochemical messengers involved in these connections are being increasingly studied from a systematic perspective. Furthermore,researchers are increasingly considering the impact of an individual psy- chosocial environment on brain chemistry,activity and anatomy,and vice versa.

In their developmental sequence there is at first crying, then a long, sustained expiratory cry without a succeeding inspiration; cyanosis replaces the previous flushing of the face (although sometimes pallor is more marked than cyanosis); then there is a stiffening of the limbs, usually in extension, followed by loss of consciousness, relaxation, inspiration, and, in a short time, recovery. In some cases, loss of consciousness is followed by generalized clonic movements of the extremities. In nearly all cases, the precipitating factor is either injury or frustration and the resulting anger, or a combination of both.

However, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression, is characterized by a persistent low mood or loss of interest or pleasure in one’s usual activities in conjunction with other symptoms, such as decreased energy, disturbances in sleep and appetite, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. Such symptoms are persistent and cause significant distress and/or interference with one’s functioning (see Table 3-1 below for the primary criteria used to diagnose a major depressive episode.) Major depression is frequently a recurrent disorder1,2 and in 12%-20% of cases is a chronic one. 3,4 However, it is treatable in many cases. There is increasing evidence that “subclinical or subsyndromal” depression, which reflects a constellation of symptoms that may not meet the full criteria identified below but which persists, is associated with significant morbidity. This chapter is primarily concerned with clinical depression. Research that has been conducted on depressive symptoms and may have implications for clinical depression is also discussed.",

      "abstract": "M.Tech. (Homoeopathy)%%%%Neck pain is a common condition usually experienced due to mechanical or degenerative problems (Colledge et al., 2010). The onset of neck pain may be acute and associated with asymmetrical restriction of neck movements and a history of awkward posture or sudden onset. Acute neck pain is an aching pain in the cervical paraspinal muscles and ligaments. It is associated with muscle spasm, stiffness and tightness in the upper back and shoulders that lasts up to six weeks. Headaches may be present (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009). Causes of neck pain can be mechanical, inflammatory, metabolic, neoplastic, due to referred pain or other underlying aetiologies (Colledge et al., 2010). The most common treatments for neck pain are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, chiropractic adjustment or therapeutic massage (Taylor, 2010). The NeuroTrac® MultiTENS device provides a non-invasive, drug-free method of controlling acute pain by transmitting mild electrical impulses via surface electrodes through the skin (Verity Medical Ltd., 2013). There have been many studies done on Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) devices, but little on its immediate effect on acute neck pain. The aim of this study was to determine the immediate effect of the NeuroTrac® MultiTENS device on acute neck pain, using the Neck Pain Disability Index, Visual Analogue Scale and the Cervical Range of Motion (CROM). This study was an unblinded, single-group experimental design (Brink, 2010). The study took place at the University of Johannesburg Campus Clinic. Recruitment took place by means of advertisements (Appendix H) placed at the University of Johannesburg campuses. Inclusion criteria consisted of males and females between the ages of eighteen to fifty years. Participants had to be suffering from aching pain in the cervical paraspinal muscles and ligaments with associated muscle spasm, stiffness and tightness in the upper back and shoulders that was present for more than one day and no longer than one week, with decreased range of motion on CROMs (Appendix G) and a minimum score of 10 on the Neck Pain Disability Index (Appendix D). Exclusion criteria consisted of participants suffering from severe headaches with meningeal signs associated nausea, blurred vision, photophobia and phonophobia or fever; a history of thrombus formation or transient ischaemic attack (Longmore et al., 2010); if they had a pacemaker or if they have had any head and neck surgery; if they suffered from cardiac arrhythmia or myocardial infarction; pregnancy or suspected pregnancy; if they had a general skin sensitivity or known allergy to adhesives or if they have had a recent chiropractic adjustment. A total of forty participants were selected. The participants acted as their own baseline control. The researcher was only required to see participants once for one forty minute session to determine the immediate vi effect of the NeuroTrac® MultiTENS device on acute neck pain. Participants were asked to fill in an Information (Appendix…",

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

      "abstract": "A brain undergoing Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) suffers damage to almost all areas, and the pattern of lesions reflects the forces on the skull at the moment of the trauma; different symptoms result after every single trauma. The common problem for those afflicted by TBI is how to overcome the sudden change in emotions and how to accept their new situation with memories in the body still corresponding to the time before the accident. Members of the Austrian Association of TBI suffering from TBI were questioned concerning their situation after TBI. The change in life affects personal capacities, family and work relationships, ability to work, and financial/social situation and results in a change in relationships with key people in their life. The burden of change is more important if the person was previously a strong, body-oriented person who had to define himself through a hierarchic system, e.g. military organisation. The TBI patient may feel a resulting emptiness in their life, inside and out, and has to reorient himself with a reduced brain capacity. Most people, the injured and families alike, feel a sense of loneliness after TBI. Caregivers and case managers are not skilled enough to deal with emptiness, reorientation, the mourning process and the issue of responsibilities resulting from medical, therapeutic and social consequences after TBI. Reorientation Syndrome is a considerable condition after each TBI that has to be respected to understand how to help TBI patients and their families successfully reintegrate into a functional life after TBI.",

Acute insomnia lasts from 1 night to a few weeks. Chronic Insomnia - it happens at least 3 nights a week for 3 months or more. Insomnia may be a contributory factor in the development of a wide range of mental health problems. Primary causes of insomnia include stress due to a job loss or change in bad habits. A secondary cause of insomnia includes mental health issues like depression and anxiety, Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia. Psychotic experiences commonly occur in mild forms and have been linked to disrupted sleep. Chronic insomnia higher rates in patients with comorbid conditions (e.g., hypertension, 44%; cardiac disease, 44.1%; breathing problems, 41.5%) it is glopally. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapeutic treatment; CBT for insomnia (CBTI) targets those behaviours, cognitions, and associations and is effective across a variety of populations, including those with medical and psychological comorbidities. CBT-I is a collaborative process and the skills learned in sessions require practice. The Society of Behavioural Sleep Medicine (www.behavioralsleep.org) and the American Board of Sleep Medicine also approved this type of treatment for Insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Burnout has been viewed as a syndrome developing in response to chronically adverse working conditions. Burnout is thought to comprise emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Historically, however, burnout has been difficult to separate from depression. Indeed, the symptoms of burnout coincide with symptoms of depression. Evidence for the discriminant validity of burnout with regard to depression has been weak, both at an empirical and a theoretical level. Emotional exhaustion, the core of burnout, itself reflects a combination of depressed mood and fatigue/loss of energy and correlates very highly with other depressive symptoms. Work-related risk factors for burnout are also predictors of depression. Individual risk factors for depression (e.g., past depressive episodes) are also predictors of burnout. Overall, burnout is likely to reflect a \"classical\" depressive process unfolding in reaction to unresolvable stress.",

The nervous system is affected frequently, as are other systems that depend on high levels of cellular energy production. The mitochondrial disorders also commonly present with nonspecific complaints, such as weakness, fatigue, exercise intolerance, muscle pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, cognitive difficulties, and/or failure to gain weight. The mitochondrial disorders are caused by mutations in genetic material and most often are inherited from the mother. The presentations of the mitochondrial disorders are highly variable since they are actually a varied group of disorders. In addition, even in related individuals who have inherited the same mutation, there is much variation in symptomatic expression.",

Durante una consulta médica, muchos adultos mayores no mencionan sus dificultades para andar, algunos no se refieren a haberse caído ya porque consideran que éste es un problema normal que forma parte del envejecimiento y porque desconocen las intervenciones que puedan minimizar el problema. La inestabilidad postural es considerada un síndrome geriátrico con señales, síntomas propios y con etiología multifactorial. Una caída en un adulto mayor puede considerarse un evento centinela o una señal de alerta que anuncia un declive funcional, un cuadro infeccioso asintomático, o el efecto adverso de un medicamento o una patología subyacente sin señales y síntomas clásicos. El examen físico de un adulto mayor comienza incluso antes de su ingreso en el consultorio. El médico debe estar atento a la manera en la que él se levanta de la silla y anda, si necesita ayuda para levantarse o si usa algún aparato para ayudar a la marcha. La evaluación del equilibrio y de las alteraciones de la marcha, así como la investigación de la ocurrencia de caídas en adultos mayores debe ser muy cuidadosa; durante la entrevista clínica el médico debe preguntar abiertamente sobre los problemas de equilibrio, marcha y ocurrencia de caídas, así como conocer las circunstancias en que acontecieron. Habitualmente, las caídas son consecuencias de perturbaciones del equilibrio y de la marcha, algunas de éstas son típicas de patologías específicas, por esto, la observación cuidadosa de la marcha puede ayudar al médico a elaborar hipótesis diagnósticas más probables a fin de proponer intervenciones preventivas.",

      "abstract": "Since the diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was introduced in DSM-III in 1980, a variety of psychotherapeutic approaches have been developed to address the specific problems and needs of traumatized patients. Successful treatment of PTSD requires a well thought-out therapeutic attitude. The therapist must find a well-balanced position between over-identification and turning away out of helplessness. A sensation-seeking attitude should be avoided as should the danger of vicarious traumatisation. In many instances, PTSD can not be treated sufficiently by psychotherapy alone: a comprehensive, multi-modal treatment plan may include pharmacotherapeutic, physical, social, legal, and other interventions. Early psychotherapeutic interventions in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event follow the rules of crisis intervention (immediacy, focus on the current problems, time limitation). Special attention should be paid to the issues of developing a trusting therapeutic relationship, creating an atmosphere of safety, helping the patient to regain control over and/or distance himself from intrusive recollections. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) and other \"power therapies\" can offer quick relief from symptoms. After collective traumatization, psychological debriefings are widely used although the evidence for their usefulness in preventing PTSD is questionable. In patients with chronic PTSD, the psychotherapist should not work exclusively on the traumatic event and its sequelae: treatment should be oriented towards the future rather than the past. Instead of exploring, the therapist should try to activate the patients' resources and help them to find new meaning in their future life.",

LBP adalah masalah kesehatan yang umum, namun terkadang dianggap masalah kecil. LBP dapat menyebabkan terbatasnya aktivitas dan ketidakhadiran dalam bekerja yang dapat berdampak pada beban ekonomi yang besar. Individu dengan LBP lebih memiliki pekerjaan yang menuntut fisik dan aktivitas pekerjaan fisik yang tinggi, namun aktivitas fisik yang kurang selama waktu luang. Lebih jauh lagi, mereka lebih sering tinggal di dalam komunitas yang kecil, pendidikan yang kurang, perokok, dan memiliki Indeks Masa Tubuh (IMT) yang lebih tinggi. LBP dapat disebabkan oleh strain otot. Tipe LBP ini bervariasi, dapat dull atau tajam, dan dapat bertambah buruk pada posisi duduk, berdiri, saat berjalan, atau gerakan lainnya. Berbaring biasanya dapat membantu memperbaiki keadaan. Faktor-faktor penyebab LBP dibagi menjadi tiga faktor, yaitu faktor pekerjaan, faktor individu, dan faktor lingkungan. Faktor individu yang dapat menjadi faktor penyebab LBP contohnya adalah kebiasaan merokok dan aktivitas olah raga. Sedangkan yang termasuk faktor pekerjaan yang dapat menyebabkan LBP contohnya adalah melakukan pekerjaan yang bersifat statis, seperti duduk yang lama secara statis. Ketiga faktor tersebut dapat menyebabkan LBP. Kebiasaan seseorang melakukan aktivitas olah raga, kebiasaan merokok seseorang, dan duduk secara statis dalam waktu yang lama dapat mempengaruhi terjadinya Low Back Pain .

The other major groups of TLOC are generalized epileptic seizures, “functional” or behavioral events (mimicking either epilepsy or syncope), and a group of miscellaneous disorders. Various causes of syncope may often coexist in elderly patients. Recurrent unprovoked syncope provoked by startle or exercise, or family history of epilepsy or sudden death in young patients suggest an inherited channelopathy. The evaluation of patients with TLOC consists of a careful history, physical examination, standard ECG and, in specific cases, head-up tilt test, autonomic reflex screen, Holter monitoring; echocardiogram, and video-EEG monitoring. The treatment of reflex syncope includes explanation and reassurance; avoidance of triggers; maintenance of appropriate water and sodium intake; regular exercise; and use of isometric counterpressure maneuvers. Drug therapy is of limited and unproven value.",

      "title": "Unravelling The Cause and Consequences of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder: A Comprehensive Review",
      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder caused by experiencing or witnessing traumatic or potentially life-threatening events, that has grown in prevalence due to global conflicts, natural disasters, and domestic violence. When a victim experiences trauma such as death or serious injury, three dimensions of PTSD develop: re-experience the event, Symptoms of trauma may include distressing memories, dreams, flashbacks, and physical distress, as well as avoidance of triggers and increased arousal. Traumatic events cause stress, which leads to a variety of psychosocial and physiological outcomes. PTSD has significant psychobiological correlates that can impair a person's daily life and be life-threatening. Given current events (for example, extended combat, terrorism, and exposure to certain environmental toxins), a significant increase in PTSD diagnoses is expected over the next decade. PTSD is a serious public health concern, necessitating the development of new paradigms and theoretical models to gain a better understanding of the condition and develop new and improved treatment interventions. therefore, understanding the specific causes of PTSD and how it affects patients is critical for both clinical practice and scientific research. To treat PTSD, nonpharmacologic interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy, antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), antianxiety medications, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics are recommended. This review of PTSD will help readers gain a better understanding of the PTSD condition and probable causes that contribute to PTSD disease and explore the influence on the patient himself after suffering from PTSD. It discusses the ways to improve the ability to recognize and treat it, appreciate the internist's role in managing it, and help to enhance the quality of life of people suffering from PTSD.",

      "abstract": "✓The authors report a case of trigeminal trophic syndrome (TTS) that occurred as a complication of a neurosurgical procedure. Three years after a second surgical treatment for a meningioma of the cerebellopontine angle, this 32-year-old woman developed TTS with progressive skin ulcers on the left ala nasi and the left side of the forehead and chin. Trigeminal trophic syndrome is an extremely rare cause of facial ulceration. It occurs as a consequence of trigeminal nerve damage or impaired central sensory connections. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of lesions in the dermatomes of all three branches of the nerve after a neurosurgical procedure. Early recognition of this disorder is important, as treatment is difficult and often unsatisfactory. Many clinicians are not aware of this disease, thus, it may be more common than previously thought. The importance of recognizing and diagnosing TTS, as well as its treatment, are discussed.",

He is also known to have severe intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy since the age of 18. At the age of 30, he was admitted for the first time to a psychiatric crisis unit dedicated to mental disabilities for challenging behavior such as self-aggression (forceful vomiting, scratching himself, pulling out his toe and fingernails or banging his head against the wall), agitation, screaming, dropping to the ground, damaging electronic items, or even displaying hetero-aggressive gestures (trying to bite or pull hair, scratching, kicking, or punching) associated with a drop in mood, withdrawal from usual activities, a drop in social interaction and a tendency to doze off during the day. The introduction of Pregabalin leads to rapid stabilization of the clinical state, almost complete improvement in challenging behavior and gradual withdrawal of other treatments (class 2 analgesics, neuroleptics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines). At the neurological check-up 9 months after discharge from hospital, clinical stability was confirmed by the surrounding team and the medical observation, with almost complete disappearance of auto-aggressive gestures.",

A wide range of sporting activities exist where serious injury and death are potential outcomes with risks varying depending on the nature of the underlying activities. The possibility of unexpected collapse and death from occult or diagnosed/treated medical conditions also exists with, for example, exercise adding additional stress to certain cardiovascular conditions provoking lethal arrhythmias. Drug screening should be undertaken at autopsy in deaths related to sports as stimulants such as amphetamines that may have been taken to enhance performance may also have had a cardiotoxic effect. Genetic screening will also be required in certain cases.",

      "abstract": "Les exigences operationnelles du metier de pilote sont susceptibles d'engendrer de la somnolence et des niveaux de charge mentale inadequats (i.e., trop faible ou trop eleve) au cours des vols. Les dettes de sommeil et les perturbations circadiennes liees a divers facteurs (e.g., longues periodes de services, horaires de travail irregulier, etc.) demandent aux pilotes de repousser sans cesse leurs limites biologiques. Par ailleurs, la charge de travail mental des pilotes presente de fortes variations au cours d'un vol : elevee au cours des phases critiques (i.e., decollage et atterrissage), elle devient tres reduite pendant les phases de croisiere. Lorsque la charge mentale devient trop elevee ou, a l'inverse, trop faible, les performances se degradent et des erreurs de pilotage peuvent apparaitre. La mise en oeuvre de methodes de detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale en temps quasi reel est un defi majeur pour le suivi et le controle de l'activite de pilotage. L'objectif de la these est de determiner si la voix humaine peut permettre de detecter d'une part, l'etat de somnolence et d'autre part, le niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Dans une premiere etude, la voix de participants a ete enregistree lors d'une tâche de lecture avant et apres une nuit de privation totale de sommeil (PTS). Les variations de l'etat de somnolence consecutives a la PTS ont ete evaluees au moyen de mesures auto-evaluatives et electrophysiologiques (ElectroEncephaloGraphie [EEG] et Potentiels Evoques [PEs]). Les resultats ont montre une variation significative apres la PTS de plusieurs parametres acoustiques lies : (a) a l'amplitude des impulsions glottiques (frequence de modulation d'amplitude), (b) a la forme du signal acoustique (longueur euclidienne du signal et ses caracteristiques associees) et (c) au spectre du signal des voyelles (rapport harmonique sur bruit, frequence du second formant, coefficient d'asymetrie, centre de gravite spectral, differences d'energie, pente spectrale et coefficients cepstraux a echelle Mel). La plupart des caracteristiques spectrales ont montre une sensibilite differente a la privation de sommeil en fonction du type de voyelles. Des correlations significatives ont ete mises en evidence entre plusieurs parametres acoustiques et plusieurs indicateurs objectifs (EEG et PEs) de l'etat de somnolence. Dans une seconde etude, le signal vocal a ete enregistre durant une tâche de rappel de listes de mots. La difficulte de la tâche etait manipulee en faisant varier le nombre de mots dans chaque liste (i.e., entre un et sept, correspondant a sept conditions de charge mentale). Le diametre pupillaire - qui est un indicateur objectif pertinent du niveau de charge mentale - a ete mesure simultanement avec l'enregistrement de la voix afin d'attester de la variation du niveau de charge mentale durant la tâche experimentale. Les resultats ont montre que des parametres acoustiques classiques (frequence fondamentale et son ecart type, shimmer, nombre de periodes et rapport harmonique sur bruit) et originaux (frequence de modulation d'amplitude et variations a court-terme de la longueur euclidienne du signal) ont ete particulierement sensibles aux variations de la charge mentale. Les variations de ces parametres acoustiques etaient correlees a celles du diametre pupillaire. L'ensemble des resultats suggere que les parametres acoustiques de la voix humaine identifies lors des experimentations pourraient representer des indicateurs pertinents pour la detection de l'etat de somnolence et du niveau de charge mentale d'un individu. Les resultats ouvrent de nombreuses perspectives de recherche et d'applications dans le domaine de la securite des transports, notamment dans le secteur aeronautique.",

      "abstract": "The incessant repetition of disturbing monoideistic thoughts which cannot be eliminated from the patient's mind is a symptom of a variety of psychiatric conditions. The persistent monoideistic preoccupation tends to acquire the quality of a repetitive hypnotic suggestion or \"inner commands\" and creates an altered state of consciousness that transcends the limits of volitional control. The one-sided ideational context permeates interpersonal relations, intensifies family conflict and drains a considerable portion of available psychic energy. Disregard or an incorrect approach to this factor may result in painful therapeutic failure, since no exploratory psychotherapy or verbal intervention technique will be able to penetrate the monoideistic armour. THe continuous repetition of the dominant idea functions as a cumulative suggestion stimulus leading to disruption of spontaneous processes and self-defeating thinking, behavioral, motivational, and affective changes. The monoideistic preoccupation may be total and pervade the individual's entire life. Any comprehensive form of therapy should offer formulations and precise procedures--for the identified patient, nuclear family, and network of significant others--to block the feedback supplying system attached to the monoideistic pattern.",

      "title": "Trauma as a life event and its impact on suicidal behaviour",
      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

Este fatopode estar relacionado, as acoes de saude publica, mudancas comportamentais, alem dos avancos nas pesquisas cientificas e recursos tecnologicos na area da saude. Com o avanco da idade, ocorre tambem a chegada de doencas cronicas nao transmissiveis, como a depressao. A depressao e uma sindrome de natureza multifatorial, que se caracteriza pela associacao de condicoes clinicas e psiquicas, tendo como principais sintomas o humor deprimido e o isolamento de forma gradual e continua. Na populacao idosa, a depressao associa-se ao proprio processo de envelhecimento (deficits fisicos e cognitivos relacionados a idade) e a comorbidades, uso continuado de alguns medicamentos, adversidades emocionais e mudancas de estilo de vida. Por outro lado, a depressao piora a comorbidade, diminuindo a qualidade de vida e aumentando a mortalidade. Esse trabalho tem como objetivo relatar a abordagem com um grupo de pessoas idosas sobre depressao na terceira idade. Desenvolvimento do trabalho: Relato de experiencia tendo como abordagem utilizada a roda de conversa. A acao educativa foi realizada comoito idosos, integrantes do grupo UnAPI (Universidade aberta a pessoa Idosa), da Universidade Federal do Mato Grosso do Sul.O grupo proporciona diversas atividades que priorizam a educacao em saude, alem da troca de conhecimento entre os idosos e discentes dos mais diversos cursos de graduacao da UFMS.A acao educativa foi realizada no dia 2 de agosto de 2017. Resultados: Foi iniciado com uma apresentacao e avaliacao do grau de conhecimento previo a respeito da depressao, posteriormente abordamos o mesmo tema , dando enfoque na epidemiologia da doenca, principais sinais e sintomas e tratamento.Notou-se a participacao constante dos integrantes no decorrer da atividade educativa, havendo uma boa integracao entre os mesmos, onde relataram suas vivencias pessoais e de conhecidos com depressao, demonstrando interesse nos esclarecimentos de duvidas quanto ao tema tratado. Consideracoes finais: Abordar temas emergentes de saude como a depressao, tem se mostrado de grande valia na conquista de autonomia em saude da populacao idosa. Os idosos participantes da acao apresentaram diversas duvidas e relataram suas experiencias acerca do tema, tal fato mostra que os mesmos nao estao alienados no que tange o assunto. Pode-se observar atraves desta acao, que as vivencias individuais e a maneira de como e realizado o enfrentamento dos problemas cotidianos interferem intrinsicamente na qualidade de vida e na prevencao da depressao na terceira idade. A abordagem do tema para com este publico se mostra necessaria e pertinente, servindo como medida terapeutica e educativa nos campos da saude mental.",

Padahal dampak psikologis, jika tidak ditanggulangi dengan baik akan berpengaruh buruk terhadap kualitas hidup individu korban bencana alam tersebut dalam jangka panjang. Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) merupakan salah satu kasus psikologis yang sering dialami oleh individu korban bencana alam. Hal ini menjadi tantangan para psikolog ataupun psikiater untuk memberikan intervensi yang tepat, guna membantu pemulihan kejiwaan korban bencana alam ini sehingga kualitas hidupnya bisa pulih bahkan meningkat pasca bencana. Dalam konteks kebutuhan kesehatan mental yang sangat ekstensif ini (terkait pemulihan PTSD), model intervensi yang hanya mengandalkan psikoterapi tatap muka tampaknya masih belum mencukupi baik itu di negara maju ataupun di negara dengan pendapatan menengah sehingga diperlukan metode lain untuk menunjangnya. Sekitar 40% dari populasi global memiliki akses terhadap Internet. Tingginya penetrasi teknologi dan akses internet serta perangkat telepon pintar, ke dalam banyak sendi kehidupan kita seperti dalam aktivitas belanja, bersosialisasi, aktivitas perbankan bahkan bidang kesehatan merupakan potensi yang bisa dimanfaatkan untuk menunjang proses penyembuhan penderita PTSD.

      "abstract": "THE PRESENCE OF COMORBID CONDITIONS among persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI), with headache as the most frequent condition,1 is associated with worsened outcomes in chronic phases. Recent work has highlighted that TBI in the presence of comorbid chronic pain is significantly associated with greater disability, lower levels of community reintegration, and poor psychological health (depression and decreased satisfaction with life).2–4 Given the limited treatment options for reversing the morbidity of TBI, addressing chronic pain in the aftermath of TBI has the potential to improve neurologic and psychosocial outcomes as well as overall quality of life.5–7 Pain can result from a variety of concurrent injuries after TBI including soft tissue or musculoskeletal pain (eg, wounds, sprains, burns, fractures), neuropathic sources (eg, spinal cord injury and peripheral nerve injury), and pain related to the TBI itself (eg, headache, spasticity, other neuropathic/central pain, and heterotopic ossification). There is a paucity of research investigating the overlap in these pain conditions for those with comorbid chronic pain and TBI. Individuals with TBI are a population of concern in the current focus on opioid addiction in the United States. There is evidence of high opioid use by individuals with TBI to manage pain after trauma both during and after hospitalization.7–9 Therefore, more in-depth knowledge of chronic pain is essential. We included assessment of opioid use and misuse to help better understand how opioid use interacts with multimorbidity, TBI indices, and overall outcomes that may inform changes in clinical practice. Such changes could lead to reduction in negative outcomes from pain and substance misuse in a population at risk for both.2,10–12 The National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research (NIDILRR) TBI Model Systems Collaborative Grant mechanism funded a multicenter study addressing key gap areas in our understanding of TBI and chronic pain. Leveraging the TBI Model Systems National Database, the largest longitudinal study of TBI in the world (www.tbindsc.org),13 this study co-enrolled persons in the NIDILRR and VA TBI Model Systems14 (>3800) from 18 centers across the United States. Two of 3 study aims addressed epidemiology, associations, and extreme outcomes. A cohort of providers (n = 63) were enrolled in the third aim using a mixed-methods design to understand determinants (facilitators and barriers) to chronic pain care. The rich data associated with the study have generated 4 manuscripts15–18 to date, with 10 more included in this topical issue. The valuable data associated with the mixed-methods approach of this project are being archived for future use at the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). Leveraging the largest moderate-to-severe TBI cohort to date, the first article in this special issue describes the prevalence of chronic pain (46% current chronic pain; 14% past chronic pain), which remains high across all follow-up intervals postinjury (from 1 to 30 years).19 This article suggests that for those with current chronic pain, multimorbidity is common with a median of 4 pain locations and that the most common treatments utilized were medical in nature. The second article highlights that after adjusting for traditional TBI covariates, the presence of comorbid current chronic pain is associated with greater severity of psychological health distress (posttraumatic stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) as well as poorer sleep quality across both military and civilians alike.20 Findings support the importance of access to care for these conditions to improve overall outcome after TBI. The next series of articles used a methodology from precision medicine, which defines persons experiencing extreme outcomes (best and worst) relative to disease progression, severity, or treatment responsiveness.21 This series of articles describes varied risk factors and modifiable covariates associated with extreme responses on pain interference and perceived improvement.22,23 We also used a similar methodological approach to examine extreme phenotypes on a stakeholder prioritized domain of psychosocial outcome.24 This novel approach provides a potential pathway to better characterize the experience of pain as well as to compare interventions in those who have chronic pain after TBI. With a majority of the epidemiologic cohort reporting chronic pain in the decades post-TBI, a dearth of information exists regarding access to high-quality chronic pain care. Informed by a conceptual framework for accessing healthcare, 2 articles describe the determinants to identifying, perceiving, seeking, reaching, and utilizing high-quality healthcare for chronic pain.25,26 These articles report the perspectives of a national provider cohort that completed semistructured interviews that revealed 48 determinants to accessing chronic pain healthcare. Identification of 33 facilitators highlighted successful practices to improve access, including tailoring treatment to the unique needs of persons who have had a TBI––discussed by 100% (saturation) of the sample. The primary challenge to delivering chronic pain healthcare was the cognitive disability that persons with TBI experience (67% saturation) and the likely contribution to high rates of noncompliance and poor follow-up in receipt of chronic pain healthcare (62% saturation).26 Results will inform future interventions at the patient, system, and policy levels of healthcare. These interventions can be tailored to healthcare settings (VA, civilian) and types of providers (rehabilitation therapists, psychologists, and medical). With the large number of determinants identified, Haun and colleagues27 engaged stakeholders to identify implementation strategies to overcome the leading barriers to accessing chronic pain care. The 3 articles combined will inform translational work to improve access to chronic pain healthcare services for those with greater TBI morbidity. Finally, 2 supplemental articles examine (1) potential predictors of headache both early and later after injury and the relationship of headache to psychosocial factors,28 and (2) the interaction of opiate misuse and marijuana use on behavioral health outcomes.29 These articles highlight 2 primary areas of interest for those with TBI, their families, and healthcare providers who work with this population. The first provides important evidence for the need to consider risk factors during clinical evaluation and the importance of addressing headaches, given their impact on psychosocial outcomes. The second provides information on the prevalence of opiate misuse and marijuana use as well as the negative association between substance use and behavioral outcomes. Further work is needed to develop clinical practice guidelines, but the initial step in better understanding the multiple causes of chronic pain and how individuals differ in their response to pain significantly adds to our understanding of the experience of chronic pain after TBI. Advancements in treatment of chronic pain in this population may allow amelioration of functional disability by using protocols that are individualized to treatment responder subtypes. This precision will, in turn, lead to a decrease in pain interference. Negative side effects of analgesic medications and interventional treatments will be minimized by identifying patients who are likely to exhibit optimal responses to such approaches. Ultimately, findings from this large multicenter study can inform policy, healthcare infrastructure, and care delivery of chronic pain management after TBI. This topical issue also highlights the basic (precision medicine), clinical, health services, and implementation science research that is needed to inform management of chronic pain in persons with TBI.",

To partially reverse the physiological adaptive effects that result from chronic pharmacological stimulation, medication holidays have been hypothesized to \"resensitize\" neurons to the acute pharmacological effects of a drug.

      "title": "Lithium Treatment of Chronic Nail Biting",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Nail biting or onychophagia has been variously described as a habit to release tension, self-mutilation behavior, or an impulse control disorder. In the DSM-5, nail biting is classified as an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder.1 Studies have found that between 28% and 33% of children between ages 7 and 10 years, 44% of adolescents, and 19%–29% of young adults engage in nail biting.2 Nail biting usually occurs in combination with other problematic body-focused repetitive behaviors such as hair pulling disorder and skin picking disorder. Nail biting in adults is underrecognized because patients often fail to seek help due to feelings of shame and embarrassment, and, consequently, the disorder has received little attention in the psychiatric literature.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, nail biting seems to be only a cosmetic issue, and no treatment is required. But, in severe cases, untreated nail biting can result in a host of complications such as severe damage to the cuticles and nails, paronychia and secondary bacterial infection, dental problems, and temporomandibular dysfunction.3 Studies on drug treatment of nail biting are sparse and limited to antidepressants and N-acetylcysteine.4 We present a case of chronic, severe onychophagia comorbid with bipolar II disorder and substance use disorder and discuss the successful treatment of these disorders with lithium monotherapy.\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, a 28-year-old woman, was referred by her family physician for assessment and management of depression. She met DSM-5 criteria for bipolar II disorder and was noted to be in remission for substance use disorder (alcohol dependence and cocaine use). At the time of initial assessment, Ms A endorsed various symptoms of depression including thoughts of suicide. Due to concerns regarding her safety, lithium 900 mg daily was started, and the dose was optimized to achieve a serum level of 0.7 mmol/L. Within 2 months of lithium treatment, Ms A experienced remission of depression and has been symptom free for 2 years. A serendipitous finding was remission of symptoms of chronic nail biting that Ms A had struggled with since she was 12 years old. Various strategies including habit reversal training, self-monitoring, and competing response had been ineffective.5 The condition was severe because Ms A had to regularly cover the nail beds with Band-Aids to control the bleeding. Moreover, it affected her self-esteem and caused a great deal of emotional distress. The marked improvement following lithium treatment was noted by Ms A’s family and friends, who had not seen her undamaged nails in at least 15 years.\r\n\r\nClomipramine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are generally recommended in severe cases of nail biting, but the use of these drugs can cause treatment-emergent mania in individuals with bipolar disorder. Thus, the drug choice for onychophagia should be informed by the nature of the comorbid psychiatric disorder. There are reports of effectiveness of lithium in body-focused repetitive behaviors such as hair pulling disorder and skin picking disorder with comorbid bipolar disorder. It is not known if lithium is effective in patients with onychophagia in the absence of bipolar disorder. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of lithium effectiveness in nail biting. Studies are needed to clarify the role of lithium in the management of severe nail biting in the absence of comorbid bipolar disorder.",

      "title": "Cancer- and treatment-related cognitive changes: what can we do now? What lies ahead?",
      "abstract": "The common term “chemobrain” belies the complex nature of the problem of changes in cognitive function experienced by patients with cancer.[1] Multiple factors contribute to these cognitive changes. Moreover, some patients have been found to have poorer cognitive function than their healthy counterparts before they began therapy, pointing to the possibility that factors other than treatment are contributing to the problem.[2,3]\r\n\r\nIn general, whether an individual has cancer or not, more years of education and a higher IQ are related to better cognitive function, while advancing age is related to poorer or declining objectively measured cognitive function.[4] Cognitive function is also interrelated with mood and functional ability. In particular, if someone reports a significant deterioration in cognitive function, they are more likely to also experience worsening mood. Conversely, individuals who are clinically depressed commonly experience poorer attention, learning and memory, and psychomotor slowing.[5,6] Fluctuations in hormone levels that naturally occur over the course of life may also be related to changes in cognitive function. For example, there is evidence that the hormonal fluctuations that occur during a woman’s reproductive cycle and with menopause are related to variations in cognitive function, and particularly to variations in verbal memory.[7,8]\r\n\r\nIt is important to recognize that some patients with cancer are at greater risk for changes in cognitive function. The stress, anxiety, or depressive symptoms they experience across the trajectory of the cancer experience may influence their cognitive function, although clinically meaningful deterioration in objectively measured cognitive function would not be expected unless a patient were experiencing clinical depression meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-V) criteria. It is more common that patient-reported cognitive problems are associated with changes in mood that do not necessarily meet diagnostic criteria for mood disorders.[5,6] Self-reported cognitive problems may also be associated with other symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, and pain.[9–13] Moreover, poorer cognitive function may be related to medications taken to manage these symptoms (eg, analgesics, antiemetics, hypnotics).[14] Factors that may contribute to poorer pretreatment cognitive function in patients with cancer include lingering effects of anesthesia after breast cancer surgery, disease-related factors, comorbidities (eg, diabetes, heart failure), and the medications used to manage comorbid conditions.[1,2]\r\n\r\nPatients who have received cancer treatment in the past are at increased risk for developing cognitive impairments with current treatment, particularly those who experienced cognitive problems with past therapy. [15] Patients receiving higher-dose therapy[16] or a longer duration of therapy, particularly with some biologic agents, such as interferon alfa, are also at increased risk for cognitive impairments.[17–19] Similarly, patients receiving concurrent chemoradiation[20] or therapy delivered directly to the central nervous system are at greater risk.[14] Other factors that increase patients’ risk of cognitive impairments include a history of psychiatric illness, substance abuse, neurological disease, or neurotrauma.[4]\r\n\r\nWhen a patient with cancer complains of cognitive problems, clinicians should keep in mind that these complaints may be associated with mood changes rather than neuropsychological changes. Probing more about depressive symptoms or anxiety may lead to appropriate management strategies. However, when there is concern about clinically significant cognitive impairments, referral for a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment may be warranted.\r\n\r\nBuilding on the progress researchers have made in characterizing this complex phenomenon and identifying risk factors, future research has the potential to improve the identification of patients at different levels of risk for cognitive changes so that targeted interventions may be provided to the patients who need them most. To reach this goal of personalized medicine, we must understand the mechanisms underlying cognitive changes. As noted, while the multiple primary procedures and adjuvant therapies provided to cancer patients could contribute to these changes, at least some of the cognitive changes previously attributed to treatment were evident before adjuvant therapy.[21–23] Subgroups of patients are likely at variable levels of risk due to pretreatment factors (eg, mood changes, cognitive reserve, physical fitness, genomic differences that impact inflammatory processes).[23–26] Moreover, these and other unknown factors may influence trajectories of cognitive changes during treatment.\r\n\r\nA powerful tool for uncovering the mechanisms underlying cognitive changes in these subgroups is neuroimaging (eg, functional MRI). Imaging studies have the potential to provide substantial insight by uncovering brain biomarkers associated with cognitive changes in different subgroups. These brain biomarkers may identify novel targets for screening and intervention. High costs, and challenges such as claustrophobia, make the widespread use of neuroimaging for research and clinical screening unlikely in the near future. However, technological advances will likely obviate these difficulties with time, much as they are beginning to do for the use of genetics in oncology practice.[27,28] Once costs come down and other barriers begin to abate, the powerful combination of neuroimaging and genomic techniques has the potential to provide the detailed risk profiling needed to enable clinicians to offer targeted education and interventions before cognitive changes manifest, which may prevent or minimize these potentially detrimental changes.\r\n\r\nIn summary, much of the existing research into the phenomenon commonly referred to as “chemobrain” has been descriptive, and we know enough now to identify some patients at risk for cognitive changes after a diagnosis of cancer. While we can educate patients about the possibility of these changes, we are just beginning to learn about appropriate interventions that may attenuate changes in cognitive function. Few interventions have been tested, and none have yet shown clear benefits that would warrant their implementation in clinical practice. Studies have explored the efficacy of medications such as psychostimulants and erythropoietin with mixed results.[29,30] Studies using interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive training, and physical exercise are showing initial promise for attenuating changes in cognitive function.[31–34] However, more research is needed to determine the efficacy of these interventions and the optimal doses for the management of changes in cognitive function in patients with cancer.",

      "title": "Recognition of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury among Clinicians and Potential Effects on the Psychotherapeutic Process",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant and prominent disability that affects millions of people every year, ranging widely in severity based on the existence or absence of certain symptoms. More specifically, concussions and other forms of mild TBI (mTBI) have the highest prevalence as they account for about 75% of all TBIs (CDC, 2003), with sequelae occurring in any of several areas of functioning (e.g., emotional, cognitive, relational, personality). Although impairments are likely to attenuate naturally to sub-clinical levels within three months post injury for a majority of individuals, some continue to demonstrate significant problems years after the injury (Hibbard et al., 2001). Sometimes referred to as the silent epidemic, mTBI is likely to be present in many clients presenting for psychotherapeutic services but is not always explicitly related to the clinician, thereby creating a potential obstacle to successful treatment. The purpose of the current study was twofold. First, are clinicians able to effectively recognize and identify a client with possible mTBI when provided with symptoms alone without information about a specific traumatic event? Second, does evidence exist to suggest clinicians' style of clinical judgment has a significant influence upon what information is deemed salient and is therefore utilized in the conceptualization, diagnosis, and treatment of the client? Forty-nine licensed clinicians were asked to read two separate vignettes of a fictional client presenting for services with several typical mTBI symptoms and asked to complete a related questionnaire about their resulting concerns and conceptualization of the client. Although data analyses did not support either hypothesis, there was evidence to suggest that the timing of when clinicians obtain relevant salient information may have an impact on whether it is utilized or even recognized. The data also suggested that clinicians may be engaging in specific types of more informal methods of clinical judgment. Results of the study are significant in that they highlight the importance of identifying salient client characteristics, assessing clients for neurological deficits, and how influential such information can be in the psychotherapeutic process and treatment outcome.",

Although most individuals with BDD are preoccupied with a particular body part (e.g., nose, skin, hair), some are preoccupied with their entire body, thinking it is too small and insufficiently muscular. This concern— sometimes colloquially referred to as bigarexia by body builders and previously termed reverse anorexia in the literature— is perhaps more accurately called muscle dysmorphia.",

Questions The specific questions to be addressed are: - Is spinal mobilisation and manipulation effective in the treatment of tension- type headache, migraine and cervicogenic headache? - What type mobilisation and or manipulation used in tension-type headache, migraine or cervicogenic headache is the most effective; -in reducing headache and promoting comfort -in reducing headache intensity -in reducing headache frequency -in reducing headache duration Inclusion criteria Participants Adult age>18) with headache(s) who are currently receiving or have received manipulation and/or mobilisation as the main part of their treatment. Excluded are participants reporting of: headache due to neurologic compromises, headache due to medical conditions, headache caused by other factors such as tumours Interventions Any type of cervical spine mobilisation and manipulation with a specific physiotherapy background Excluded interventions are: Chiropractic intervention, Acupuncture, Craniosacral therapy, Osteopathy. These interventions are not physiotherapy specific and require specialised skills by the practitioner and hence will be excluded. Comparators The most appropriate comparator would be no manipulation or mobilisation for headaches or other alternative treatment strategies. Outcomes Primary outcome measures:Subjective changes in headache reporting (headache diary) Secondary outcome measures: Other clinical findings which are often reported in combination with headache such as altered range of motion, associated pain symptoms, changes to cervical musculature etc",

It is argued that certain central aspects of the cognitive model may, if adhered to clinically, fail to heal or, at worst, enhance such pathology, with or without the amelioration of observable symptoms, not because of any specific intersubjective circumstance, or therapeutic technique, but because of essential (indispensable) tenets of the cognitive theory itself - the theory itself contains the problem. This paper is a comment on theory, and should not be mistaken for a global evaluation of any kind of therapy or therapists. (editor abstract)",

Elle peut conduire a une augmentation des risques d’accident, une baisse de productivite, et a certaines pathologies comme la depression. L’objectif de ce travail de these etait d’etudier le phenomene de fatigue mentale en examinant plus specifiquement ses marqueurs electrophysiologiques, ainsi que de trouver des strategies de compensation pour limiter et/ou eviter ses effets deleteres.La premiere etude a identifie des modulations de l’activite cerebrale lors d’une tâche prolongee de Stroop modifiee. Une augmentation globale des ondes theta et alpha, ainsi qu’une diminution de l’amplitude des ondes N100 et P300 interpretees comme refletant une baisse de l’attention ont ete observees. La seconde etude a mis en evidence que l’augmentation de la perception de l’effort lors d’un exercice physique d’endurance en presence de fatigue mentale etait liee a une augmentation de l’activite des aires motrices et premotrices (lors de contractions reelles et imaginees). Dans une troisieme etude, nous avons montre que les effets de la fatigue mentale persistaient dans le temps. Les performances lors d’une tâche de pointage etaient de plus en plus alterees apres la tâche mentalement fatigue, et ce malgre un effet de recuperation sur le niveau de fatigue mentale percue. La quatrieme etude a montre que l’utilisation de strategies de compensation, comme l’ecoute de musique agreable ou la pratique d’une activite physique durant 15 min etaient efficaces pour contrer les effets lies a la fatigue mentale et maintenir le niveau de performance motrice. Ces travaux ont montre que la fatigue mentale engendre des modifications de l’activite cerebrale au cours d’une tâche cognitivement exigeante mais egalement lors d’une exercice physique subsequent. De plus, le phenomene de fatigue mentale semble persister dans le temps et impacter de plus en plus nos performances. Cependant des strategies de compensation comme l’ecoute de musique ou la pratique d’une activite physique semblent efficaces pour contrecarrer ses effets deleteres.",

      "title": "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder: An Illness of Recovery",
      "abstract": "Post traumatic Stress Disorder are the disorders caused in reaction to occurrence of some unacceptable, unpleasant incidence leading to intolerable stress/ anxiety.It may be natural or manmade like war, disaster, rape, torture etc.These disorders are found 1 -3 percent in general population.All most seventy percent people of the general population experiences PTSD any time in their life time.Persistent avoidance of stimuli causing trauma is main feature of this entity.It can occur any time in life but most common in young adults.Most people do not experience the post traumatic catastrophic symptoms after passing the traumatic phase or some time after trauma the recovery starts taking place.However, significant number of people continuously experiences such symptoms and needs specialized intervention.The personality of the individual also plays a vital role on experiencing trauma and its recovery.Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition marked by the development of symptoms after exposure to traumatic life events.The person reacts to this experience with fear and helplessness, persistently relives them, and tries to avoid being reminded of it. HISTORICALBACKGROUND-18th Century: During Napoleon's time the Diagnosis of Nostalgia was established to describe Combat Stress Reaction.\"Soldier's heart\" was the name given during the US Civil War to a syndrome similar to PTSD.In 1866 the English Surgeon Erickson in his article he attributed conspicuous psychological abnormalities caused due to railway accidents to micro-traumas of the spinal cord, which later on led to the concept of \"Railway Spine Syndrome\".Jacob Da costa's (1871). in his paper, \"On Irritable Heart,\" described soldiers with this syndrome.\"Trauma Etiology\" given by Charcot and Janet, pointed out the importance of traumatic experience for origin of hysterical symptoms.During the U S Civil War and World War I, same symptoms were referred to as the 'Da costa Syndrome' was noted among soldiers during the time of stress, especially when fear was involved.World War I (1914War I ( -1918)).: Charles Myres, British Psychiatrist introduced the term \"Shell Shock\" caused by direct exposure to shelling or bombing.World War-II veterans, survivors of Nazi concentration camps, and survivors of the atomic bombings in Japan had similar symptoms, was called combat neurosis or operational fatigue.The psychiatric morbidity associated with Vietnam War veterans finally brought the concept of PTSD.During World War II (1939II ( -1945)).PTSD was known as New Syndrome as Combat Stress Reaction, Combat Neurosis/Battle Fatigue.PTSD as a formal Diagnosis was recognized in the year 1980 in DSM III with the emphasis that trauma could produce chronic symptoms in \"normal\" individuals too.Prior to that if symptoms were found persistent it was due to preexisting psychological problem.The official recognition of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). in the DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association, 1980).has prompted considerable body of research into the psychology, biology, epidemiology, and also in the area of its treatment. Epidemiology of PTSD:The life time \"incidence\" of PTSD is estimated to be 9 to 15% and life time \"prevalence\" of PTSD is estimated to be about 8 percent of the general population.Among high risk groups whose members experienced traumatic events, the lifetime prevalence rates ranges from 5 to 75%.The life time prevalence ranges from about 10 to 12 % among women and 5 to 6% among man.Although PTSD may appear at any age but it is most prevalent in young adults, because they tend be more exposed to precipitating situations.(DSM-IV).",

      "title": "Overtraining in endurance athletes: a brief review",
      "abstract": "Overtraining is an imbalance between training and recovery, exercise and exercise capacity, stress and stress tolerance. Stress is the sum of training and nontraining stress factors. Peripheral (short-term overtraining, STO) or peripheral and central fatigue may result (long-term overtraining, LTO). STO lasting a few days up to 2 wk is termed overreaching. STO is associated with fatigue, reduction, or stagnation of the 4 LT performance capacity (performance at 4 mmol lactate or comparable criterion), reduction of maximum performance capacity, and brief competitive incompetence. Recovery is achieved within days, so the prognosis is favorable, LTO lasting weeks or months causes overtraining syndrome or staleness. The symptomatology associated with overtraining syndrome has changed over the last 50 yr from excitation and restlessness (so-called sympathetic form) to phlegmatic behavior and inhibition (so-called parasympathetic form). Increased volume of training at a high-intensity level is likely the culprit. The parasympathetic form of overtraining syndrome dominates in endurance sports. Accumulation of exercise and nonexercise fatigue, stagnation, or reduction of the 4 LT performance capacity, reduction in maximum performance capacity, mood state disturbances, muscle soreness/stiffness, and long-term competitive incompetence can be expected. Complete recovery requires weeks and months, so the prognosis is unfavorable. Other optional or further confirmation requiring findings include changes in blood chemistry variables, hormone levels, and nocturnal urinary catecholamine excretion. Based on the findings reported, recommendations for training monitoring can be made, but their relevance in the practice must still be clarified.",

It is usually caused by accidental events and only very rarely due to suicidal events. A 37-year-old female with major depressive disorder attempted suicide by placing her forearms on a railroad track, resulting in traumatic bilateral upper extremity amputations. Emergency Department resuscitation was initiated as the patient was taken immediately to the operating room; however, restoration of the limbs was unfeasible, and the patient had successful debriding and fashioning a flap to the distal ends of the upper extremities after hemostasis was achieved. Depression may still be an undertreated clinical entity in our society, and many preventable causes of suicide are attempted each year. Evidence exists that suggests severe suicide attempts occur generally in men and minor suicide attempts, or so-called suicidal gestures, occur generally in women. This case questions this notion.",

However this paper will explore the most relevant ptosis to aesthetic nurses, drug-induced ptosis, which is a known complication that can develop post administration of botulinum toxin injections. Drug-induced ptosis can be an iatrogenic consequence of the practitioners’ clinical practice, a result of poor patient concordance in relation to post-injection after care instructions, or an idiosyncratic physiological or structural patient characteristic.",

      "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) also referred to as clinical depression, is a significant medical condition that can affect many areas of your life. It impacts mood and behavior as well as various physical functions, such as appetite and sleep. People with MDD often lose interest in activities they once enjoyed and have trouble performing everyday activities. Occasionally, they may also feel as if life isn’t worth living. Some people with MDD never seek treatment. However, most people with the disorder can get better with treatment. Medications, psychotherapy, and other methods can effectively treat people with MDD and help them manage their symptoms. The exact cause of MDD isn’t known. However, there are several factors that can increase the risk of developing the condition. A combination of genes and stress can affect brain chemistry and reduce the ability to maintain mood stability. Changes in the balance of hormones might also contribute to the development of MDD. MDD may also be trigged by alcohol or drug abuse, certain medical conditions, such as cancer or hypothyroidism, particular types of medications, including steroids. MDD is often treated with medication and psychotherapy. Some lifestyle adjustments can also help ease certain symptoms. People who have severe MDD or who have thoughts of harming themselves may need to stay in the hospital during treatment. Some might also need to take part in an outpatient treatment program until symptoms improve. This article explains how Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains one of the most effective interventions for MDD.",

      "abstract": "Disability is a multifactorial phenomena in chronic pain disorders, as it is for other painful and nonpainful medical conditions. Socioeconomic factors are important determinants of disability, although this aspect of disability in chronic pain disorders is often ignored. Lower socioeconomic status has been shown to be associated with an increase in the frequency and severity of disability, and the rate of progression to disability in patients with chronic pain. Work disability in lower socioeconomic groups is associated with issues of physical work demands and work flexibility (ie, the ability to control the pace of work, take unscheduled breaks or engage in modified work). Workplace interventions, particularly in the subacute phase, that are geared to workers′ limitations offer the best opportunity to reduce the current burden of disability. Where such work modifications are not available, disability will be problematic.",

      "title": "What Are Nurses Doing to Help PMS Patients?",
      "abstract": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a hot topic these days but the disorder remains an enigma. Many women suffer, to some degree, the cyclic signs of PMS-irritability, depression, anxiety, impaired concentration, breast swelling and tenderness, headache, binge eating and/or craving for sweet or salty foods. But why? Is the cause hormonal and/or biochemical imbalance, poor nutrition, underlying psychiatric disorder, or some other unknown factor(1-3)? syndrome is defined as a complex of symptoms-somatic, behavioral, and emotional-occurring in the luteal phase. This phase usually begins in midcycle with ovulation, when the follicle is changed into corpus luteum, and ends at (or shortly after) menstruation(l). In many ways, PMS mimics dysmenorrhea; the key differences are in the timing of symptoms and in pelvic cramping. Although headache, nausea, edema, and fatigue are common to both, pelvic cramping is specific to, and the principal sign of, dysmenorrhea, which generally begins a day or two before menses and peaks in severity on the first or second day of flow. PMS has a wider variety of symptoms (150 having been identified in the literature)(4). syndrome also begins earlier in the cycle than does dysmenorrhea, and PMS is abruptly relieved at menses. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of women of childbearing age suffer some premenstrual symptoms. However, it is also believed that only 5 to 15 percent have very severe symptoms(5). Many theories have been proposed on specific etiology. An estrogen/progesterone imbalance, excessive prostaglandins, abnormal magnesium metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, reactive hypoglycemia, and neuroendocrine changes in the hypothalmic-pituitary axis are among them, but no theory has been conclusively proved(1-8). Theories on effective treatment also abound. AJN asked nurses, physicians, and researchers involved in the treatment and study of PMS what methods they used, and to what effect. It became clear that nurses are playing the key role in the management of patients with PMS, and that they can back up their advice on methods with solid evidence. Michelle Harrison, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, author of Self-Help for Premenstrual Syndrome, advises physicians that nurses are ideally qualified to handle patients with PMS(9). Guy E. Abraham, a California PMS specialist known for significant research on nutritional and vitamin treatment for the disorder, agrees: The in PMS treatment is that the patient has most of her contact with a nurse. Total nurse management is not unusual, unless a medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible disease. predominant model might describe Mary Ann Wilson, RN, C, a nurse practitioner who has seen over 100 PMS patients in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health maintenance organization (HMO) in East Hartford, Connecticut. department is staffed by five nurse practitioners, four physicians, and two RNs who do phone follow-up. Wilson says PMS patients are referred to the nurse practitioners. We do all the screening and counseling, unless a medical problem is indicated, or the patient requests an MD, she reports. initial PMS consult is scheduled during the patient's asymptomatic follicular phase (which runs from menses to ovulation), Wilson explained, since a PMS patient is then under less stress and she'll have much more energy to do what you suggest. Some women, says Wilson, will first call during an emergency. We'll do a 'validating' visit; we will talk and calm them and advise a visit when they don't feel so bad. If the patient seems in crisis, particularly if she is suicidal, we will send her immediately to the mental health department for counseling. Most HMO patients have had a thorough physical within six to 12 months of seeking help for PMS. nurse reviews the patient's chart for health problems that could be contributing to, or confused with, PMS. A nutritional history is taken, with particular attention to excessive alcohol, salt, and caffeine intake.

      "title": "Convulsiones y epilepsia—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Las convulsiones son causadas por un ataque de actividad excesiva en el cerebro. Un niño que tiene una convulsión puede perder el conocimiento (desmayarse) durante un período breve, temblar violentamente con todo su cuerpo, tener movimientos corporales reiterados y poco comunes, sufrir crisis atónicas (episodios de caída), tener convulsiones mientras duerme o tener la mirada perdida.La epilepsia se define como 2 o más convulsiones en las que el niño no tiene fiebre ni ningún otro motivo médico para sufrir una convulsión.Alrededor de 1 de cada 4 niños con trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés) tiene convulsiones. Las convulsiones suelen comenzar en la primera infancia o en los primeros años de la adolescencia. Los niños con TEA que tienen un coeficiente intelectual más bajo o que no pueden hablar son los que corren mayor riesgo de tener convulsiones.Con frecuencia los niños con TEA tienen movimientos reiterativos y episodios en los que se quedan mirando el vacío. A menudo un médico puede detectar qué comportamientos reiterativos podrían ser convulsiones. Una prueba llamada electroencefalograma (EEG) puede registrar la actividad eléctrica del cerebro y ayudar a un médico a verificar la presencia de convulsiones. El electroencefalograma puede registrar la ocurrencia de una convulsión solo cuando el equipo de EEG está conectado al niño. No es posible detectar con un EEG las convulsiones que ocurran en otros momentos. A veces es necesario hacer un EEG durante un tiempo prolongado para ver si los movimientos o desmayos son convulsiones.La mayoría de los niños con TEA no necesitan un EEG. Es probable que el médico solicite un EEG si un niño tiene desmayos que el médico crea que son convulsiones o si el niño perdió recientemente destrezas de habla o de otro tipo. El electroencefalograma se hace generalmente cuando el niño está despierto y luego dormido. Hay distintos tipos de EEG; algunos se completan durante una visita más corta al hospital y otros se realizan durante toda la noche en el hospital o en el hogar. El médico decidirá qué tipo de EEG es adecuado para cada niño.En la mayoría de los casos, los medicamentos llamados anticonvulsivos pueden ayudar a controlar las convulsiones. Por lo general estos medicamentos reducen la cantidad de convulsiones, pero no siempre pueden eliminarlas. Algunos niños obtienen resultados anormales en sus EEG, pero no tienen convulsiones evidentes. Aún no está claro si los anticonvulsivos pueden ser útiles en esas situaciones.Uno de 2 tipos específicos de aceite de cannabidiol (conocido como aceite CBD) está actualmente aprobado por la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (US Food and Drug Administration) para el tratamiento de convulsiones en niños con 2 tipos de epilepsia grave (los síndromes de Lennox-Gastaut y de Dravet). El aceite de cannabidiol no está aprobado para el manejo del TEA en niños que no padezcan las afecciones específicas que se mencionaron anteriormente.Para obtener más información sobre las convulsiones, comuníquese con la Epilepsy Foundation (www.epilepsyfoundation.org).La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra.

      "abstract": "La hiperacusia se define como la intolerancia a ciertos sonidos cotidianos que causa angustia y discapacidad significativas en las actividades sociales, ocupacionales, recreativas y otras actividades cotidianas. Los sonidos pueden percibirse como incÃ³modamente fuertes, desagradables, atemorizantes o dolorosos. Se encuentra presente en aproximadamente un 3% poblaciÃ³n general, y aumenta significativamente en trastornos del espectro autista (TEA), alcanzando entre un 15% a 40%. Los mecanismos fisiopatolÃ³gicos no son del todo claros, pero se ha propuesto, una alteraciÃ³n en el funcionamiento de mecanismos reflejos y de regulaciÃ³n, tanto a nivel de la vÃ­a auditiva perifÃ©rica, como central, incluyendo estructuras no relacionadas directamente con la vÃ­a auditiva. El siguiente texto tiene como objetivo analizar la relaciÃ³n entre hiperacusia y TEA, enfatizando en la frecuencia en que se presentan como comorbilidades, en los posibles mecanismos fisiopatolÃ³gicos, y en actualizaciones en el abordaje diagnÃ³stico y terapÃ©utico. Se realiza una revisiÃ³n bibliogrÃ¡fica cualitativa en Pubmed con artÃ­culos entre los aÃ±os 2008-2020 utilizando los tÃ©rminos: âhyperacusis autismâ, âsistema olivococlearâ, arrojando 39 artÃ­culos, de los cuales se seleccionaron en base a la temÃ¡tica de cada uno, evaluada por los autores. A pesar de una significativa relaciÃ³n entre hiperacusia y TEA, los mecanismos fisiopatolÃ³gicos de ambas patologÃ­as siguen siendo un misterio. Existen estudios que sugieren pruebas de screening no invasivas que relacionan ambas patologÃ­as, pero debido a los sesgos de selecciÃ³n, todavÃ­a no son factibles de usar en forma universal. El abordaje terapÃ©utico ha sido poco explorado, y no se dispone de fÃ¡rmacos que hayan demostrado su efectividad, por el contrario, algunos de ellos empeoran la sintomatologÃ­a. Se recomienda al tratante, seguir un camino largo, en conjunto con el paciente, donde las terapias no farmacolÃ³gicas como la terapia cognitivo conductual han mostrado tener buenos resultados.",

Moreover, chronic pain can be an accompanying symptom of largely irreversible underlying disease, such as degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis), spinal stenosis, or compression fracture resulting from osteoporosis in older people. Chronic pain can also be a primary complaint of clinical conditions such as fibromyalgia and trigeminal neuralgia, for which neither the aetiology nor mechanism is currently well understood.\n\nChronic pain is therefore not simply a chronological extension of acute pain and requires different diagnostic approaches and management strategies.

      "title": "Dementia: A Cross-Cultural Perspective on Risk Factors",
      "abstract": "Dementia is one of the most devastating mental illnesses that affect older adults, accounting for a large proportion of new cases of mental illness in old age and causing significant distress to individuals and their families. This paper provides a review of research on the frequency of dementia and the factors that put people at risk, with implications for prevention and intervention. Where possible, we address ethnic or cultural differences. However, while ethnic minority elders are a rapidly growing group in the United States, too little research has been conducted about dementia in these groups, including differences in rates of the disorder and risk-factor profiles. DEFINITION AND PREVALENCE According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual/Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), dementia is a decline in memory and other cognitive abilities whereby the decline interferes with daily, social, and occupational functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Other cognitive disturbances include aphasia (especially problems remembering names of people or things), apraxia (impaired physical movements despite intact physical capability), agnosia (trouble identifying objects), and problems with executive functioning (e.g., difficulty with planning or thinking abstractly). Dementia has a number of causes, which makes this complex disorder difficult to diagnose. For diagnosis, it is important to rule out other reasons for cognitive impairment such as delirium, depression, malnutrition, medication side effects, alcohol abuse, and infections. The overall prevalence of dementia in adults aged 65 and older ranges from 1.8 percent to 6.7 percent (Chui, 1998). The prevalence of dementia increases with age, doubling every 5. years until age 95 (Jorm, Korten, and Henderson, 1987). The two most common types of dementia are Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder that impairs multiple areas of cognitive functioning and worsens over time. Onset of the disease is typically insidious, usually beginning with loss of recent memory, then progressively affecting other areas of cognition such as language production and comprehension. The clinical diagnosis typically entails a neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment, evaluation of the course of cognitive and behavioral impairments, neuroimaging, and exclusion of other potential causes of cognitive impairment (Reisberg et al., 1997). Vascular dementia is based on the understanding that cerebrovascular types of diseases like stroke can cause brain injury and lead to cognitive impairment. A diagnosis of vascular dementia requires the following: (i) the presence of dementia, (2) evidence of cerebrovascular disease, and (3) onset of the dementia soon after a vascular event (Roman et al., 1993). Unlike the course of Alzheimer's disease, the course of vascular dementia may not be smoothly progressive but rather may be characterized by plateaus. Researchers have observed ethnic and crossnational differences in the frequency of these types of dementia. In general, overall rates of dementia are similar cross-nationally and crossculturally, but notable differences exist in rates of different subtypes of dementia. For example, in the United States and Northern Europe, Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, followed by vascular dementia (Skoog, 1998), whereas Japan and China have higher rates of vascular dementia, followed by Alzheimer's disease (Joan, iggi; Yoshitake et al., 1995). Within ethnic groups in the United States, African Americans tend to have higher rates of vascular dementia than whites (Yeo, Gallagher-- Thompson, and Lieberman,1996). In addition, mixed dementia (with features of both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease) may be more common among African Americans than among whites. Some findings suggest that rates of different types of dementia vary by gender. …",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Body dysmorphia disorder (BDD) is defined as a preoccupation with an imagined or a very slight defect in physical appearance that causes significant distress to the individual. Patients with body dysmorphia may approach cosmetic surgeons or dermatologists seeking surgery or medical treatments, and this places the doctor at risk of having a patient who is continually dissatisfied with whatever is done. Symptoms: With BDD there is preoccupation with the supposed appearance problem. The patient takes actions to “hide” the defect or avoid certain situations because they feel ugly and do not want to be seen by others. Many patients with BDD also suffer from depression and from obsessive compulsive disorders, such as eating disorders, anxiety disorders, trichotillomania (hair pulling), and abuse of drugs or alcohol. There is a high rate of suicidal ideation. Discussion: Serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are a group of medications that appear to be useful and effective in patients with BDD. Cognitive behavioral therapy appears to be an effective treatment for BDD. The behavioral component consists of exposure and response prevention, where the patient exposes his or her defect in situations that they would usually avoid and response prevention involves helping the patient stop the compulsive behavior related to the defect. Conclusion: Treatment for patients with BDD is medication, usually SRIs, or psychiatric care with cognitive behavioral therapy. Surgeons need to identify patients with BDD before surgery, tell them that surgery is not the treatment for their problem, and refer them to a psychiatrist for treatment.",

The study of its etiology, usually, signs to situations where the individual is feeling weak, especially related to losses, mourning and melancholy. The emotional aspect seems to play great importance in the etiology, and that is the reason why it is considered a psychosomatic disease. In this context, the pain appears as a repetition of some experience already lived before, that repeats again in unconscious way. This study had the aim to articulate the theoretical presuppositions of medicine and of psychoanalysis to get a more deep understanding about the enigma that is expressed in the fibromyalgia. This disease, in medical aspects, has defined its characteristics, the methods of diagnosis and treatment, even though the etiology remains unknown. On the other hand, the psychoanalysis shows as cause of this disease, the difficulties in the psychicological structure organization, especially, the failure of the paternal function and the difficulties of the subject to deal with his anguish, his demands and his desires. In the expression of the disease, one can observe clearly the connection mind-body in its genesis – psychosomatic disease, and, therefore, it must be studied the diagnosis and the treatment according to the rules established by psychosomatic, aiming at a clinical action that allows the subject to rescue his well-being, through the overcoming of his misunderstanding, his impasses and, consequently, the existential pain.",

El motivo de abandono no siempre es conocido, en esta investigacion se aborda si viene mediado por los trastornos de personalidad o son los problemas psicosociales los que llevan un mayor peso. Los resultados muestran como los trastornos del eje IV (psicosociales) resultan mas determinantes en el abandono de procesos. Como principal conclusion se establece la necesidad de tratamientos de corte mas psicosocial que aborden la problematica individual de las personas sin hogar.",

      "abstract": "To make a diagnosis of concussion, you need a reliable history of 2 things: (1) An acute external physical force applied to the brain AND (2) An impairment in the function of the brain directly caused by the external physical force. One or the other is not enough. You need both. You do not need a scan or lab test to make the diagnosis. No scan or test can “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

      "abstract": "Use of the term overuse injury should be avoided until there is definite proof of the cause of the injury\n\nInjuries are often categorised as being due to trauma or overuse. When no moment of trauma is recalled, then an assumption is made that an injury is the result of overuse. In this article, I will argue that there is insufficient evidence to support this extensive use of the term “overuse” and that there are problems associated with using it. Thus, we should avoid the term, which implies the cause of the injury, until we have proof of the cause.\n\nOveruse injury is now categorised in medical subject headings as “cumulative trauma disorder (CTD)”. This is a subcategory of sprains and strains. CTD is defined as a “Harmful and painful condition caused by overuse or overexertion of some part of the musculoskeletal system, often resulting from work-related physical activities. It is characterized by inflammation, pain, or dysfunction of the involved joints, bones, ligaments, and nerves.” The term includes overuse injury, overuse syndrome, repetition strain injury, repetitive strain injury, and repetitive motion disorders. As CTD is defined as being caused by overuse, this definition fails to clarify the meaning of overuse injury. Overuse probably implies there is an amount of use that is excessive, and if use reaches or exceeds that amount then injuries arise.\n\nConsider now this term as used in sports medicine. Traumas, such as a fractured tibia caused by a tackle in soccer, are likely to be most common among players who play or train most. Yet, overuse is not said to be the cause of this injury. Injuries arising from obvious trauma are excluded from the category of overuse injuries. Such a trauma may be witnessed or may be felt as an acute moment of injury. An …",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

However, to our knowledge, no reports have been published describing hair pulling during sleep as a symptom of epilepsy and its pharmacological treatment. In this case report, we present the hair-pulling behavior during sleep as an ictal manifestation of complex partial seizure in a 12-year-old girl and its successful treatment with levetiracetam.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nBody Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a disorder characterized by distressing or impairing preoccupation with slight or imagined defects in one’s physical. All around the world in the past 100 years, BDD has been found to be not so uncommon in clinical presentations.\r\nAn Italian physician in 1891 Enrico Morselli called this disorder as “dysmorphophobia”.BDD is underrecognized even today. This is because there are patients with BDD who suffer with substantial impairment in functioning and other comorbidities and they do not seek medical help.\r\nPatients with BDD report to doctors that they are ugly, unattractive, malformed, abnormal but in the contrary most of them look normal in reality and sometimes strikingly beautiful too.The patients perceive certain abnormalities concerning to various parts of the body namely skin (eg scar because of acne), hair (eg.,excessive facial hair or balding),nose(eg., shape and size). These abnormalities exist as preoccupations in the patients which keep on torment them all day long. The preoccupations are accompanied by repetitive behaviours or mental acts. They are mirror checking, skin picking, excessive grooming, comparing with others etc. Because of this patients feel anxious when going out for recreation. This study aims to understand the prevalence of BDD in patients attending dermatology outpatient department and associated depression, anxiety, psychosocial functioning.\r\nMETHODS :\r\nA cross sectional descriptive study was carried out in male and female patients attending cosmetology Outpatient Department of Government Stanley Medical CollegeTaking prevalence as 6.7% and a error of 6% sample size was calculated and found to be 70. 85 patients were taken up for the study. Consecutive sampling was the method of sampling. Data was collected using the following tools;A structured Performa to collect the socio demographic details and clinical profile; Body Dismorphic Disorder Questionairre, Dysmorphic Concern Questionairre , BDD YBOCS, Brown Assesment of Beliefs Scale, SF 36, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale .Descriptive statistics and frequency for calculation of mean and median was done. Chi square test was used for comparing between sociodemographic variable and prescence of bdd, sociodemographic factors and disease factors with presence or absence of anxiety and depression. Correlation analysis was done to find out the relation between anxiety and depression and disease factors using SPSS 20.\r\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION:\r\nAmong the 85 people taken for the study, 41.1% (n=35) had BDD diagnosed with administration of DCQ, BDDQ, YBOCS- BDD\r\nThe age range of patients with BDD ranges from 17 to 45 with a mean age of 23.7. 20% (n=7) patients were less than 18 years of age, 20(57.1%) patients belong to the age group of 18-25, 2 (5.7%) people belong to the age group of 26-35, 6(17.1%) are in the age group of 36-45 years. Of the 35 patients with BDD, 26 male(74.3%), 9 female (25.7%). Among the 35 patients with BDD, 6 patients (17.1%) are married, 28(80%) are unmarried, 1 patient (2.9%) was a divorcee. Out of the 35 patients with BDD, 1 patient each (2.9%) had primary education and postgraduate qualification. 4(11.4%) had secondary education, 13(37.1%) had higher-secondary education, 16 (45.7%) were graduates. Among the 35 patients with BDD, 62.9% (n=22), were students, followed by 17.1%(n=6) did semiskilled work, 14.3%(n=5) did highly skilled work and 5.7%(n=2) did skilled labour. Those 35 patients who had BDD, were administered HADS-A questionnaire and of them, 17 patients (48.6%) had anxiety. Of which 5 people (14.3%) had borderline abnormality and 34.3%(n=12) have severe abnormality in HADS -A score. Out of the 35 patients who had BDD, 17 (48.6%) had anxiety and among the 50 patients who did not have BDD, none were suffering from anxiety. There is more anxiety in those who are suffering from BDD and the difference is statistically significant with p value <0.001.Those 35 patients who had BDD, were administered HADS-D questionnaire and of them, 54.3% (n=19) had no depression, 16 patients (45.7%) had depression. Of which 10 people (28.6%) had borderline abnormality and 17.1%(n=6) have severe abnormality in HADS -D score. Out of the 35 patients who had BDD, 16(45.7%) had depression and among the 50 patients who did not have BDD, none were suffering from depression. There is more depression in those who are suffering from BDD and the difference is statistically significant with p value <0.001.\r\nCONCLUSION:\r\nIn the present study, it was found that BDD was more common in patients attending hospital and comorbidity of anxiety and depression was found to be considerably higher in patients with BDD than those without BDD. Patients with BDD also had notably poor psychosocial functioning in SF36.",

Although sleep occupies one-third of our lives and can be considered to be an important subject, sleep medicine is a young speciality and problems are poorly investigated. Sleeping problems are frequently reported during the menopausal transition. Subjectively women find that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) significantly improves sleep quality. Thus, HRT can be considered as a first-line therapy for insomnia. However, in some cases insomnia coincides with the menopause transition and cannot be considered to result from ovarian failure. Depressive mood, stress and behavioural factors, as well as restless legs and periodic limb movement syndromes may be the underlying cause. Thus, if no relief with HRT has been achieved after a few months, other aetiologies should be explored.",

      "abstract": "Across the globe, in all countries, the number of older adults is increasing. These increases in the elderly population are making frailty an increasing concern for the healthcare system. Frailty is a multidimensional geriatric syndrome, which is characterized by an increased vulnerability to various external stressors. Frailty is associated with multiple adverse outcomes, including mortality, admissions to nursing homes, and falls. It will continue to place a substantial and increasing burden on public health and healthcare systems.Frailty is the result of cumulative cellular damage from diverse etiologies over the life of the individual. Typical aging results in loss of some homeostatic reserve in physiological systems. However, despite the loss of these reserves, individuals still function well with aging. Any homeostatic perturbation in these reserves will result in the older adult decompensating and thus causing frailty. The silent precursor to frailty is pre-frailty or latent frailty. Frailty happens from latent frailty whenever external stressors (e.g., acute illness, injury, or mental stress) occur in the older adult.Frailty can develop due to factors such as (i) socio-demographic influences (e.g. poverty, living alone, low education level); (ii) psychological factors (e.g. depression); (iii) nutritional issues (e.g. malnutrition); (iv) polypharmacy; (v) diseases and complications (inflammatory states, cancer, endocrine disorders, dementia); and (v) low physical activity. Despite the importance of frailty, there is currently no internationally recognized standard definition given its complex etiology; definitions used by different frailty researchers; and the inherent difficulty in distinguishing frailty from both aging and disability. Irrespective of definitions, it is clear that frailty is an important geriatric syndrome, which is dynamic, fluctuates over time, and reflects multisystem dysfunction. Given its importance, since the mid-1990s, frailty combination scores have been developed, wherein a constellation of frailty manifestations was grouped to be able to quantify the degree of disability from frailty.",

      "abstract": "Deep dyspareunia refers to pain with deep penetration or insertion into the vagina, which affects quality of life. The aim of this narrative review was to examine how the underlying conditions that give rise to deep dyspareunia, and the symptoms of these conditions, can affect sexual function and quality of life beyond the deep dyspareunia itself. For example, deep dyspareunia may be associated with gynecological pathologies that cause cyclical pain symptoms (e.g. dysmenorrhea, dyschezia/dysuria), resulting in quality of life changes related to menstrual cycle events such as ovulation or menstruation. Recurrent dysmenorrhea can cause hyperalgesic priming that sensitizes the nervous system, leading to chronic pelvic pain that can be exacerbated with sexual activity. The coexistence of functional bowel or bladder disorders can result in urgency and frequency that affect the sexual response cycle. Myofascial/musculoskeletal origins of deep dyspareunia may affect body positioning during sexual activity. Central nervous system sensitization can underlie these different factors, and also be associated with mental health conditions, which together can cause symptomatology across body systems that can affect all aspects of one's sexual life. Recognition and management of the far-reaching impacts of deep dyspareunia and its associated comorbidities may be important in clinical care to meaningfully improve quality of life. Future research should include a comprehensive empirical validation of the hypotheses and potential mechanisms in this review.",

While the symptom has been regarded as the symbolic representation of the event, its appearance and persistence have been variously attributed to the intensity of the trauma, the circumstances surrounding its occurrence, to the need for the symptoms to substitute for a repressed drive, wish, or fear and to the factor of secondary gain. Our interest in the subject of conversion hysteria originated during a study of the behavioral effects of acute brain injuries, when it was noted that subjects who developed hysterical anesthesias and paralyses recalled their accidents and described their injuries in language of violence. In contrast, patients without hysterical symptoms were either amnestic for or confabulatory about accident and injury, or used language which did not emphasize the physically traumatic aspects of the",

This decline is associated with alterations in body composition; diminished energy, muscle strength, and physical function; reduced sexual function; depressed mood; and decreased cognitive function. Similar changes occur in young men with androgen deficiency and are improved with T replacement therapy. However, the physiological and clinical significance of the aging-associated decline in serum T levels in men is unclear, particularly because T levels may remain within the normal range for young men. From a practical clinical standpoint, it is most appropriate to define “andropause” as an age-related decline in serum T levels in older men to below the normal range in young men that is associated with a clinical syndrome (i.e., symptoms and signs) consistent with androgen deficiency. The decline in T levels is a consequence both of aging per se and age-associated comorbid illnesses and medications that are used to treat them",

      "abstract": "textabstractCancer patients suffer from a variety of problems, somatically, socially and\npsychologically. Somatically, the illness and treatment threaten physical integrity.\nCancer is an insidious disease, in which the patient is severely ill before he\nnotices any symptoms. The (mostly) invasive treatment often results in the patient\nfeeling worse after treatment than before. This means that the confidence the\npatient has in his own body is diminished.\nSocially, the illness, treatment and its consequences (tiredness, lack of energy,\nfeeling ill) may result in social isolation. This can be increased by the fear and\nuncertainty of by-standers how to approach the patient, what to say to him, and\nwhat to expect from him.\nPsychologically, the patient has to cope with the emotional consequences of the\nillness, such as changes in life perspective, mourning his lost health, and anxiety\nand uncertainty about the future.\nThe literature on the prevalence of psychological distress in cancer patients is\nequivocal. The percentages of depressed and/or anxious patients reported in the\nliterature vary widely from 0% to 49% (cf. Bulman, 1992; Omne-Ponten,\nHolmberg, Burns, Adami & Bergstrom, 1992; Devlen, Maguire, Phillips, Crowther\n& Chambers, 1987). It is worthwhile to solve the lack of clarity on this point. This\nleads to the first research question of this thesis: what is the prevalence and\ncourse of psychological distress in cancer patients?",

      "abstract": "Depressive clutters are characterized by diligent sentiments of pity and uselessness and a need of want to lock in in once in the past pleasurable exercises. Sadness isn't a passing blue temperament, which nearly everybody encounters from time to time, but a complex mind/body sickness that meddling with ordinary working. It not as it were obscures one's viewpoint, it is commonly checked by rest issues and changes in vitality levels and craving. It changes the structure and work of nerve cells so that it disturbs the way the brain forms data and deciphers involvement. In spite of sentiments of sadness and worthlessness, depression could be a treatable condition. It can be treated with psychotherapy or medicine, or a combination of both. Depression is a common condition in modern life. According to the National Institutes of Health, each year more than 16 million adults in the United States experience at least one episode of major depression. The likelihood that a person will develop depression at some point in life is approximately 10 percent. Prolonged social stress and major disruption of social ties are known risk factors for depression, and major negative life events such as loss of a loved one, or loss of a job, increase the subsequent risk of depression. Significant adversity early in life, such as separation from parents or parental neglect or abuse, may create vulnerability to major depression later in life by setting the nervous system to over-respond to stress.",

      "abstract": "Blepharospasm is a disease that results in an increased rate of bilateral eyelid closure, mainly attributed to the involuntary contraction of the orbicularis oculi muscles. Blepharospasm is a type of dystonia. Dystonia falls under the classification of movement disorders and is characterized by either sustained or intermittent contraction of a muscle. This leads to abnormal repetitive movements or postures which tend to have a certain pattern and maybe twisting or tremulous in nature. In most dystonias, voluntary action typically leads to exacerbation of dystonia due to overactivation of muscles.Dystonia has the potential to affect any part of the body and can present at a wide range of ages.Dystonia can be classified according to its distribution across the body: Focal dystonia refers to dystonia which affects only one isolated region of the body. Segmental dystonia refers to dystonia which affects 2 or more contiguous regions of the body. Multifocal dystonia refers to dystonia which affects 2 or more non-contiguous regions. Hemidystonia refers to dystonia which affects half of the body. Generalized dystonia refers to dystonia which affects the trunk along with 3 other sites. Dystonia can have a static or progressive course of the disease. Furthermore, the variability of symptoms can be classified according to how often they occur: Persistent dystonia refers to dystonia that persists at the same extent throughout a day Action-specific dystonia refers to dystonia that only occurs when performing a certain activity Diurnal fluctuation refers to dystonia which fluctuates throughout the day with a circadian variation in severity Paroxysmal dystonia refers to sudden episodes of dystonia typically induced by a trigger Examples of focal dystonia include blepharospasm, oromandibular dystonia, writers cramp, spasmodic dysphonia, and torticollis.Blepharospasm is a focal dystonia characterized by the simultaneous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles, resulting in involuntary eyelid closure, the first report of patients with blepharospasm comes from a description of 10 patients, made by Henri Meige in 1910: these patients had involuntary eyelid closure in association with contraction of the muscles of the jaw. In his paper, Maige named this phenomenon Convulsions de la Face (convulsions of the face).This article will review the etiology, epidemiology, history, evaluation, and management of blepharospasm.",

      "abstract": "Myoclonus is een frequent voorkomende hyperkinetische bewegingsstoornis die wordt gekenmerkt door spierschokken (positieve myoclonus) en/of het kortdurend wegvallen van de spiertonus (negatieve myoclonus). De klinische presentatie van myoclonus is heel divers. De schokken kunnen in een of meerdere lichaamsdelen optreden of gegeneraliseerd zijn. Myoclonus kan optreden in het gelaat, de nek, romp en de ledematen. Het kan in rust of juist bij actie optreden en wel of niet stimulusgevoelig zijn. Over het algemeen belemmert myoclonus patienten ernstig in hun dagelijks functioneren, zoals bij eten/drinken, schrijven en lopen. Myoclonus heeft vele oorzaken, zowel verworden als genetisch. Voor het vaststellen van de onderliggende oorzaak en het bepalen van de juiste behandeling is het belangrijk myoclonus te herkennen en te onderscheiden van andere bewegingsstoornissen zoals bijvoorbeeld tremor en chorea. Na het herkennen kan myoclonus op basis van een anatomische classificatie worden ingedeeld in subtypes, i.e. naar de plaats in het zenuwstelsel waar de schokken ontstaan. Dit zijn corticale (hersenschors), subcorticale (diepe hersenkernen/hersenstam), spinale (ruggenmerg) en perifere (zenuwen/spieren) myoclonus. Daarnaast kunnen schokken ook een uiting zijn van een functionele (psychogene) stoornis. Door myoclonus naar anatomische classificatie te groeperen kan diagnostiek gericht ingezet worden. Dit proefschrift biedt een nieuw diagnostische aanpak voor patienten met myoclonus. Het beschrijft de uitdagingen en het belang van het nauwkeurig klinisch fenotyperen van zowel motorische als niet-motorische symptomen en de classificatie van het anatomisch myoclonus subtype. Het klinisch neurofysiologisch onderzoek heeft een belangrijke toegevoegde waarde naast de klinische beoordeling in de (sub)classificatie van myoclonus.",

The fatigue reported by cancer patients is usually described as an unusual, excessive, whole-body experience that is disproportionate or unrelated to activity or exertion and is not relieved by rest or sleep. Cancer related fatigue is multidimensional, subjective experience that has profoundly negative effect on patients' quality of life. Fatigue today is the most commonly reported symptom, for some patients the most unpleasant symptom, and the most side-effect in connection with cancer and/or its treatment. The prevalence of fatigue in patients receiving anti-cancer treatment has been estimated to be more than 80 per cent. The fatigue can be pervasive: patients report that fatigue begins with treatment, continues during the course of chemotherapy or radiation treatment, and declines somewhat--but frequently sustains at a higher-than-baseline rate-after treatment is over. It may also persist for several years even in patients with no apparent disease. Despite of the prevalence of fatigue and its profoundly negative effect on patients quality of life, little is known about the specific mechanisms that underline fatigue in cancer patients or how to prevent it and treat it effectively.",

      "title": "The effects of prolonged endurance exercise on the neurological system in horses",
      "abstract": "Horses compete routinely in endurance-type activities. Many of the various pathophysiological mechanisms which arise during endurance exercise have implications for the health and function of the neurological system. The development of centrally-mediated fatigue is a normal homeostatic physiological event with several possible mechanisms. Development of pathophysiological phenomena such as cerebral oedema may be near-terminal events during or after endurance exhaustion. Cellular damage resulting in cytotoxic cerebral oedema may result from decreases in circulating blood volume (dehydration), blood pressure, oxygen, and glucose, or increases in brain temperature. Vasogenic cerebral oedema arises from changes in cerebral vascular perfusion, tone, and permeability. Increased vascular permeability results from increased brain temperature, poor vascular integrity due to severe dehydration, disseminated intravascular coagulation due to hemoconcentration or endotoxemia, and iatrogenic overhydration during therapy. Clinical signs of intracranial disease after endurance exercise include staggering, shaking, ataxia, paresis, poor tongue tone, facial twitching, collapse, recumbency, seizures, and death. Treatment should include active and aggressive cooling, intravenous polyionic fluids, acid-base imbalance correction, intravenous glucose and calcium supplementation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents once the patient is better hydrated, intra-nasal oxygen therapy if practicable, and achievement of a non-dependent head posture to prevent jugular venous hypertension and further increases in intracranial pressure. The prognosis for central fatigue is good with appropriate supportive care, but the prognosis for successful treatment of cerebral oedema must be considered guarded at best. Prevention is critical and must be through incorporation of mandatory rest stops with sufficient length and veterinary monitoring to allow prevention and detection of exhaustion, excessive dehydration, and neurological signs. Management flexibility in shortening or postponing rides in hot and humid conditions, mandated use of aggressive cooling techniques, and more restrictive entry criteria for upper level Fédération Equestre Internationale races should all be considered as viable options for optimising the safety of endurance horses.",

      "abstract": "During the past few years psychiatric research has focused its interest on the disorders of sweating: hyperidrosis and hypoidrosis/anhidrosis. Hyperhydrosis is the most commonly encountered in practice. In this situation, the total amount of sweat produced is greater than needed for thermoregulation. The disorders of sweating receive the research attention of many medical specialties. This trend is attributed to their high prevalence, their relation with many psychiatric disorders, their effects on the quality of life of patients, but also of the new therapeutic approaches that have been developed (the use of botulinum toxin, surgical methods, etc). Balancing among different suggestions for the treatment of hyperhidrosis, the psychiatrist must be thoughtful for the therapeutic approach. The cases of hypohidrosis and anhidrosis are less frequently mentioned, for which patients hardly ever complain. They are characterized by reduced sweating below the amount needed to cool down an elevated body temperature, or even absent sweating. They may constitute an urgent medical situation leading to hyperthermia and death. Overall, disorders in sweating may be caused by pharmaceutical or hormonal causes. Many pharmaceutical and psychotherapeutic methods have been used for treatment. Therefore, we believe it is useful for the clinical psychiatrist to keep in mind the psychiatric and psychological aspects of the disorders of sweating, and their impact on patient diagnosis, course and treatment.",

      "abstract": "This chapter presents an overview of behavioral disorders. Disorders of the nervous system can ruin the lives of individuals and are of such a magnitude that they create many of our greatest social problems. People become mentally ill, insane, or psychotic and a few such individuals in a society can destroy its fabric. People can become addicted to drugs. They can ruin their lives, and their habits create an underworld willing and able to exploit them. Some people become alcoholics. The chapter discusses about schizophrenia disorder. The primary characteristic of schizophrenia is the impairment of logical thought processes. Speech is often bizarre and confused, reflecting a disturbed mind. Thoughts that are usually only remotely connected emerge together in speech (loose associations), and in extreme cases speech may be completely incomprehensible. Depression is another behavioral disorder. It is diagnosed as being either primarily endogenous or exogenous. The endogenous form of depression refers to severe depression that occurs in the absence of any identifiable external source; the exogenous form of depression results from external stresses.",

      "abstract": "Self-neglect is a condition peculiar to the frail geriatric population when a self-conscious individual voluntarily refuse to address one's basic physical, emotional or social need. The end result is a constellation of findings bearing similarity to physical abuse and neglect. There may be injuries including bruising and fractures, signs of dehydration and malnutrition, presence of decubitus ulcers, poor hygiene in the context of unsanitary living conditions. Underlying psychiatric conditions affecting decision making capacity may be implicated. Normal aging process of organ systems and increased geriatric comorbidities render them vulnerable to accidental injuries and delayed management of treatable medical conditions in an isolated home environment. During medicolegal investigation, it is essential to identify features that differentiate from genuine elder maltreatment. Diogenes Syndrome is an extreme form of fatal self-neglect for individuals in social isolation with hoarding of rubbish or household items. This presents considerable forensic difficulties because of the mysterious circumstances, a lack of medical history, suspicious findings on the body including purging of putrefactive fluids and injuries following falls or post-mortem animal predation in a chaotic scene.",

      "abstract": "Disorders of the skin affect the psyche of a person significantly. The interplay between internal and external world can be depicted through the various skin reactions in regard to psychological or physiological stimuli. Psychocutaneous illness could be exclusively psychological or stress related or due to strong psychogenic factors. As per biopsychosocial model, it could be primary, multifactorial, or secondary to disfigurement. Whichever is the condition, invariably stress is a major contributing factor in prognosis and onset of disorders of the skin. Self-explanation, myth, stigma, and diminished self-confidence often lead to depression and suicidality followed by active avoidance of the workplace, in turn, causing significant disability in the individual. The conflict between self-image and perceived image frequently causes fear of rejection leading to social anxiety, reduced self-confidence, interpersonal communication, and impaired sexual intimacy with a partner. Maladaptive sets of coping strategies such as alexithymia, shame proneness, avoidance, concealment, and escape are very common among the sufferers which impair the attachment with family and friends. Children are the extreme sufferers as they develop inferiority, low self-esteem, loss of body image, and social withdrawal leading to rejection from parents and faulty development of attachment pattern. Hence, disorders of the skin can lead to impaired coping, impaired compliance, limitations in quality of life, negative body image, and stigmatization which invariably cause psychological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety, phobia, and somatoform and adjustment disorders. Hence, there is a direct relationship between skin, mind, and society which we are going to explore in a detailed fashion to understand its impact on the psyche and the society.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

      "title": "From Normative to Deviant Behaviour: Health and Illness Definitions Related to Children and Adolescents’ Perspectives",
      "abstract": "Medical solutions are currently being sought for a variety of behaviours or conditions described as deviant. Thus, since the 1980s, in the USA and UK and more recently in Portugal, diagnosis for health situations understood as problematic seems to have become common. A range of diagnostic, practices such as those related to dyslexia in children/adolescents with reading difficulties, or hyperactivity in others whose behaviours appear as deviating from the normative, among others, are frequently used. This attribution of deviance is part of a historical, social, cultural and economic process of enacting normality and deviance, and it often goes back to the medical sphere. This relates to what Parens describes as medicalisation: 'a process by which \"non-medical\" (or \"life\" or \"human\") problems become understood and treated as \"medical\" problems'. Therefore, this phenomenon 'of making medical' includes a range of activities involved in constructing new deviance definitions for social control. Zola also explains that very often medical intervention as social control seeks to limit, modify, regulate, isolate, or eliminate deviant behaviour with medical means and the interest of health. All of these aspects have a profound impact on children and adolescents' lives, since these still constitute historically invisible groups particularly vulnerable to victimization and labelling. Contrary to this approach, and assuming that children and adolescents are agents and not passive subjects, this chapter explores their perspectives regarding health and illness definitions and practices. The research is based on part of 10 focus group discussions with adolescents between 14 to 16 years from two public schools in Northern Portugal. We expect the results will enable a deeper understanding of the meaning of health and illness, as well as the implications of processes of medicalisation.",

Sympathy goes a long way if used in time, but where it does not bring the proper results drastic treatment is needed. In the case of serious crime, those who cannot or will not learn to conform to society's demands should be eliminated. Crime cannot be eliminated and can be controlled only by appropriate treatment in the form of punishment. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved)",

Since the term TN may encompass several disease entities that are related to one another, yet not exactly identical, a number of classification systems have been suggested and used: classical vs. secondary, typical vs. atypical, type I vs. II, idiopathic vs. iatrogenic, related to multiple sclerosis (MS) or herpes zoster, etc. [2]. To minimize confusion, this chapter will use the classification according to The International Classification of Headache Disorders, third edition (ICHD-3) [3].

      "abstract": "Stress is a necessary component of life. All living things go through periods of stress at some point in their existence. The word \"stress\" has become widely used in everyday speech in recent years. Stress, in Lazarus's definition, is an internal process that arises when an individual perceives that a demand exceeds their capacity to adequately respond to it, and when failing to meet that capacity can have significant negative repercussions [1]. The body reacts to stress in a manner akin to how it reacts to danger. A condition of wellbeing known as mental health can motivate people to make positive decisions. In a similar vein, when someone is dealing with an issue, it negatively impacts their mental health and causes their mental wellness to decline. In industrialized nations, menopause typically begins between the ages of 40 and 58. 52 is the average age in the United States (Trusted Source). Some will experience it sooner as a result of a medical condition or treatment (ovaries removed, for example). Hormonal changes brought on by menopause might result in mood swings, heat flashes, and other symptoms. The main focus of the study was to swot on “Stress among Women during Menopause- Impact on Mental Health”. Women who are in the age group of 45 -55 years were selected for the study. The sample consists of 60 women belongs to Madakasira village, Sathya Sai district for the study. Menopause problems questionnaire was developed by the researcher with the guidelines of subject experts it was pre-tested to other sample before going to actual sample. According to the study, women experience a great deal of irritation and fury during menopause, along with anxiety, forgetfulness, low self-esteem, confidence loss, low mood, and feelings of melancholy or despair. These symptoms are sometimes referred to as \"brain fog\" and/or \"lost words.\"",

Changes in body temperature can be directly induced by external factors, or may result from internal processes, i.e. infection or loss of temperature control. The EEG findings in hypo- and hyperthermia reflect not only temperature effects but also other processes that are happening concurrently. The Harvard criteria for “brain death” require a body temperature of at least 90° F (32.2° C) although cerebral activity has been recorded at much lower temperatures. Hypothermia is used clinically to protect the brain during decreased or absent cerebral circulation, usually during cardiac surgery. Hyperthermia can also cause a decrease in EEG activity, although not as dramatic as that seen with hypothermia. Hyperthermia is used clinically in oncology as an adjunct to chemotherapy.",

Clinical observation during 14 hours a day was repeated with different dosages and different regimes of the drug; these modified the daily variations but did not eliminate the syndrome. The electromyographic studies also revealed the \"on and off\" phenomenon in different patients. When the \"long-term syndrome\" is severe, at times it is necessary to stop the drug; the secondary effects are thus decreased and, when the medication is given again, the therapeutic effectiveness is temporarily restored. When the drug is stopped the patients should be watched, since a \"withdrawal syndrome\" may appear.",

Three systems of organs are involved in the male sexual act, and a disorder in any one of them may prevent its successful completion. The function of the nervous system is most important, particularly in the psychic sphere. While organic lesions of the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves may produce impotence, the latter is usually so overshadowed by other manifestations as to make it incidental. One may summarise the position of the endocrine system by saying that the anterior lobe of the pituitary governs the development and function of the testes which, in turn, control the development and function of the sex characters and accessory sex organs. Thus a reduction in the function of either anterior pituitary or testes will reduce or abolish potency. Impotence due to such disturbances is readily recognised.",

TH is often accompanied by a migraine and an abuse of analgesics and/or ergotamine. In the etiology of TH vascular, muscular and psychogenic factors are assumed. Floating transitions to common migraine are discussed. The increased muscle tension is not specific for TH, but more probably a consequence of TH. In addition a decrease of the pain threshold with a deficiency of the antinociceptive system is supposed. The efficacy of tricyclic antidepressives in TH is based on potentiation of serotonergic and noradrenergic mechanisms and - besides their analgetic potencies - upon an increase of the pain threshold. TH prophylaxis is indicated if patients suffer from TH more than ten times per month. Medication are tricyclic antidepressives of the amitriptyline-type. Prophylaxis of TH can only be successful if a simultaneous abuse of analgesics and/or ergotamine is discontinued. In addition, EMG-biofeedback, as well as relaxation-and vasoconstriction training might be helpful in specific cases.",

Due to its location, there are various anatomic structures that might entrap and potentially compress the lingual nerve. These anatomical sites of entrapment are: (a) the partially or completely ossified pterygospinous or pterygoalar ligaments; (b) the large lamina of the lateral plate of the pterygoid process; and (c) the medial fibers of the anterior region of the lateral pterygoid muscle. Due to the connection between these nerve and anatomic structures, a contraction of the lateral pterygoid muscle, for example, might cause a compression of the lingual nerve. Any variations in the course of the lingual nerve can be of clinical significance to surgeons and neurologists because of the significant complications that might occur. To name a few of such complications, lingual nerve entrapment can lead to: (a) numbness, hypoesthesia or even anesthesia of the tongue's mucous glands; (b) anesthesia and loss of taste in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue; (c) anesthesia of the lingual gums; and (d) pain related to speech articulation disorder. Dentists should, therefore, be alert to possible signs of neurovascular compression in regions where the lingual nerve is distributed.",

The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of psychiatric disorder is well established for the non‐learning‐disabled population. In clinical practice, medication seems to be broadly as effective for people with learning disabilities. The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of challenging behaviours is less well established, although evidence for effectiveness is accumulating for some types of problem behaviour. When treating behavioural problems, medication is often used in combination with other management strategies. Knowledge of side effects is important, because people who have difficulty communicating may not be able to Report problems before they become severe. When using medication, it is important to try to achieve the best benefit: risk ratio, taking into account the person's other health problems and disabilities. It may be necessary to measure treatment effects, using standardised assessments or individual measures of target symptoms or behaviours.",

      "abstract": "Muscle Tension Dysphonia-The Untold StoryHuman voice production involves coordinated functioning of the vocal folds and regulated airflow from the lungs to the oropharynx.A synchronized activity of respiratory, phonatory, resonatory and articulatory systems lead to the optimal phonatory outcome.Smaller intrinsic muscles and larger extrinsic muscles need to work in harmony, to produce voice, which is appropriate to age, sex, and society.The excessive tension of the laryngeal or extralaryngeal muscles or both result in suboptimal phonatory function.Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) is a condition characterized by varying degree of dysphonia and other associated symptoms, primarily due to tension and uncoordinated activity of intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the larynx.This is generally subdivided into primary and secondary type.In primary MTD, there is no structural or neurological abnormality associated with muscle tension.The secondary type usually occurs as a compensatory mechanism for underlying glottic insufficiency or mucosal lesion.On the other hand, long-term untreated MTD may itself turn out to be a precursor of phonotraumatic mucosal lesion.Earlier, these patients with vocal dysfunction with no apparent structural lesion or neurological dysfunction were stamped under the category of functional voice disorders.Subsequently, extensive work by many authors has led to the understanding of this complex condition.Evolution of classification has also resulted in the addition of a plethora of terminologies to the literature namely hyperfunctional dysphonia, muscle misuse voice disorder, musculoskeletal tension dysphonia, hyperkinetic dysphonia, laryngeal isometric disorder, laryngeal tension fatigue syndrome and many more.Finally, \"muscle tension dysphonia\" has emerged to be the universally accepted nomenclature.Multifactorial etiology of this condition is well established.Anxiety and stress, coupled with vocal abuse and misuse are the major causative factors; personality plays an important role.Besides, compensatory maladaptation for any structural lesion can lead to secondary MTD.An MTD, either primary or secondary is one of the most commonly encountered diagnoses in any voice clinic.Patients may present with a mild degree of hoarseness to extremely strained voice, along with odynophonia.A careful history of vocal demand and usage along with any history of underlying stress often provides diagnostic clue.External neck inspection is of paramount importance to detect the position of larynx and muscle tension during phonation.Palpation of suprahyoid, thyrohyoid and cricothyroid space usually elicits tenderness of specific muscles, even at rest.The endolaryngeal examination should ideally be done with a flexible nasolaryngoscope, to detect supraglottic muscle tension during the larynx in action.Stroboscopy helps identify any associated mucosal lesion leading to MTD.Intrinsic muscle tension at the supraglottic or glottic level is usually graded on the basis of various classifications.Management involves voice therapy which may be indirect or direct.Indirect therapy involves educating patients about healthy phonatory habits and training corrective vocal exercises to release tension.Direct therapy is aimed at releasing musculoskeletal tension to promote healthy phonatory posture.Circumlaryngeal therapy, stretch and flow phonation, vocal function exercises and resonant voice therapy are the common techniques used.Medical treatment of associated problems like laryngopharyngeal reflux and surgical treatment of any structural lesion should be undertaken.Role of EMG-guided botulinum toxin injection is also emerging in recent years.Diagnosis of MTD is simple and straightforward, provided the clinician is aware of this condition.However, there is a need for more comprehensive grading system encompassing both external and endolaryngeal findings.This would help in delivering more tailor-made direct voice therapy to correct tension of specific muscles.Use of botulinum toxin injection is also likely to increase, especially for cases refractory to voice therapy.",

      "abstract": "Cytokines whose primary function is that of acting as signaling molecules of the immune system, have been implicated in the provocation or exacerbation of mood disorders such as depression. This position has been supported by several lines of evidence; (1) proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-α) and bacterial endotoxins elicit sickness behaviors (e.g., fatigue, soporific effects) and symptoms of anxiety/depression that may be attenuated by chronic antidepressant treatment. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) induces less profound sickness, but elicits anhedonia, a key symptom of depression; (2) neuroendocrine and central neurotransmitter changes, reminiscent of those implicated in depression, may be elicited by some of these cytokines, and these effects are exacerbated by stressors; (3) severe depressive illness is accompanied by elevations of cytokine production or levels, although these effects are not necessarily attenuated with antidepressant medication; and (4) immunotherapy, using IL-2 or IFN-α, promote depressive symptoms that are attenuated by antidepressant treatment. It is proposed that chronic cytokine elevations engender neuroendocrine and brain neurotransmitter changes that are interpreted by the brain as being stressors, and contribute to the development of depression. Further, the effects of the cytokine treatments may act synergistically with stressors, and cytokines may provoke a sensitization effect so that the effects of later stressor experiences are exacerbated.

      "abstract": "Edisi kali ini ditandai dengan artikel menarik mengenaik cedera otak traumatik. Kecelakaan lalu lintas masih menjadi penyebab utama cedera otak traumatik di negara berkembang seperti Indonesia. Hal ini berbeda dengan negara-negara maju yang menunjukkan bahwa peristiwa jatuh (fall) menduduki peringkat pertama penyebab cedera otak traumatik. Fakta tersebut juga didukung dengan penggunaan obat-obat antikoagulan, terutama oleh pasine lanjut usia. Berbeda halnya dengan di Indonesia, yang sebagian besar pasien cedera otak traumatik merupakan laki-laki usia produktif. Akibatnya, selain disabilitas yang bisa terjadi, terdapat dampak sosial ekonomi yang serius. Pasien tersebut menjadi kesulitan bekerja dan mencari nafkah untuk dirinya dan keluarganya. Secara definisi, segala jenis gangguan fungsional atau struktural di otak akibat proses trauma berupa energi dari luar tubuh termasuk dalam cedera otak traumatik. Hal ini menekankan bahwa terminologi cedera kepala sudah kurang tepat lagi digunakan dalam praktik sehari-hari karena fokus dari masalahnya adalah otak secara spesifik, bukan kepala. Dengan demikian, penilaian klinis pada pasien cedera otak traumatik tidak hanya sebatas abnormalitas pada radiologi, tetapi jauh yang lebih penting juga pada fungsi otaknya. Pada beberapa kasus, hasil CT scan tidak menunjukkan lesi struktural yang bermakna, tetapi pasiennya mengalami nyeri kepala kronik, sulit berkonsentrasi, mudah lelah, atau gangguan mood. Hal lain yang menarik dari cedera otak traumatik adalah mekanisme trauma yang dialami oleh pasien dan hubungannya dengan gangguan yang didapat. Hal ini yang disebut sebagai biomekanisme penting untuk diketahui oleh para klinisi yang merawat pasien karena seringkali data anamnesis dari pasien atau orang lain tidak selalu akurat. Lebih jauh daripada itu, bisa jadi ada kepentingan tertentu dari dari pihak pasien atau lainnya untuk memanipulasi mekanisme trauma. Oleh sebab itu, dengan menguasai pengetahuan ini, dan didukung kemampuan klinis yang adekuat, klinisi bisa mengambil langkah bila terdapat ketidaksesuaian antara mekanisme trauma dengan cedera yang didapat.",

      "title": "What Is a Good Approach to Thinking About a Child With Multiple Dysmorphisms?",
      "abstract": "A dysmorphism is difference in a body structure. If the dysmorphia is truly the only abnormality that you see in the child, further evaluation is often unnecessary. Isolated dysmorphisms are typically caused by malformation (abnormal tissue development), deformation (distortion caused by a mechanic force), disruption (destruction of a normal forming structure), or dysplasia (anomaly of growth and differentiation). A patient with multiple dysmorphisms, however, typically requires further workup to arrive at the cause, which could be chromosomal, genetic, or environmental such as in utero exposure to teratogen or infection. 1 Making the diagnosis relies on recognizing the pattern of dysmorphisms. The 4 major patterns to consider are the following 2 : Association: Physical features that often occur together more often than would be seen by chance alone, but no single etiology is yet known to explain the pattern. Vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac defects, trachea esophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb anomalies (VACTERL) are examples of associations with no unifying etiology. Sequence: A group of defects that stem from a sequential set of events that began with one malformation. An example is Potter sequence with renal agenesis resulting in no fetal urine production, which leads to severe oligohydramnios with the consequences of lung hypoplasia and intrauterine constraint that cause limb deformities and compressed facial features. Syndrome: A cluster of anomalies that occur in a consistent pattern that has a unifying cause, known or unknown. Developmental field defect: A group of malformations caused by harm to a particular region of the embryo. An example is hemifacial microsomia, unilateral facial hypoplasia, and ear anomalies that come from anomalous development of the first and second brachial arch structures.",

      "title": "Trigeminal neuralgia and other facial pain",
      "abstract": "Trigeminal neuralgia and other facial pain Trigeminal neuralgiaEssentialsTrigeminal neuralgia is characterized by paroxysms of intense pain resembling electrical shocks on the other half of the face in the area of one or two of the branches of the trigeminal nerve.Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia is not caused by any other disease and there are no findings in imaging investigations.First line drug is carbamazepine.In some patients, the symptom is relieved within a period of a few months, and thus the medication can be gradually reduced after achieving treatment response.Symptoms Between the attacks the pain is totally absent (remission phase), and in the active phase it may be provoked typically by touching certain areas of the face (trigger zones) or by eating. A new pain episode can be provoked after a refractory period that lasts from some seconds to some minutes. The pain comes in very short attacks of shooting pain or ”pins-and-needles” sensations. Additionally, continuous pain may occur. In the idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia, there are no permanent neurological deficiency symptoms. When at its worst, trigeminal neuralgia may prevent the patient from washing the face or brush the teeth and make her/him unable to speak or even eat and drink. Causes and diagnosis In idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia there is no underlying disease or vascular compression upon the trigeminal nerve causing the condition. About 10% of the patients belong to this group. In the majority of patients the symptoms are explained by vascular compression upon the trigeminal nerve in the brain stem. Symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia has similar symptoms as the idiopathic form but it is caused by another disease, e.g. MS or a brain stem tumour. Classification of trigeminal neuralgiaPotential trigeminal neuralgia: the patient has a unilateral pain resembling electrical shocks, limited to the area of a branch of the trigeminal nerve.Clinically confirmed trigeminal neuralgia: the patient has a unilateral pain resembling electrical shocks, limited to the area of a branch of the trigeminal nerve, and the pain may be provoked by a typical stimulus (e.g. breath of wind, touch, eating, movement of the muscles of facial expression).Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia with confirmed aetiology: in addition to the criteria in item 2, vascular compression upon the trigeminal nerve is detected by MRI, associated with morphological changes in the trigeminal nerve root (requires 3D reconstruction technique).Secondary trigeminal neuralgia: in addition to the criteria in item 2, an MS plaque or a tumour causing trigeminal neuralgia is detected by MRI.Treatment The drug of choice is carbamazepine which is dosed according to response. Oxcarbazepine is an alternative and may be tried especially if carbamazepine causes adverse effects (fatigue, dizziness) or when there is a need to avoid the interactions of carbamazepine with other drugs. It is a derivative of carbamazepine but better tolerated. Oxcarbazepine is as effective as carbamazepine in trigeminal neuralgia. The initial dose for carbamazepine is 100 mg × 2 and for oxcarbazepine 150 mg × 2. The dose can be increased up to 1 200 mg/24h with carbamazepine and up to 1 800 mg/24h with oxcarbazepine. In the beginning follow-up of blood cell counts and liver function tests is recommended. Carbamazepine concentration can be measured if there are signs of overdose (dizziness, tiredness, diplopia or nystagmus).Because trigeminal neuralgia has a tendency for spontaneous remission, a trial may be made to taper off the medication gradually after a few months.If trigeminal neuralgia remains refractory to carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, the patient is referred to specialized care for therapeutic assessment (e.g. department of neurology or neurosurgery). The most commonly used neurosurgical treatment modalities include coagulation of the trigeminal ganglion and microvascular decompression, i.e. microsurgical release of the nerve compression caused by a small nearby artery . Other drugs may be tried if carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine are ineffective or not tolerated and the patient is not willing to undergo neurosurgical treatment. There is evidence on the effectiveness of lamotrigine as an add-on drug to carbamazepine (note: risk for skin rash when increasing thedosage). Also baclofen has been shown to have effect in trigeminal neuralgia. Dosage may be increased up to 80 mg/24h if needed. Phenytoin, clonazepam, valproic acid, gabapentine or pregabalin may be tried as secondary alternatives, but there is no evidence of their efficacy. Intravenous phosphenytoin may be tried for severe exacerbations even if its efficacy has not been proven in randomized controlled trials. After the infusion the medication is continued orally aiming at an effective yet tolerable dosage. When one drug is not enough, a combination of several drugs with different action mechanisms may be tried in patients who are not willing to undergo neurosurgical treatment.Therapy with botulinum toxin A (25–100 units) may be tried in trigeminus neuralgia refractory to the first-line drugs. Other facial pains Other neuropathic pain in the facial area In another type of facial neuropathic pain, a damage to a branch of the trigeminal nerve has led to a neuropathic pain state. The pain is usually long-term steady aching or burning, and the patient may in addition experience pains resembling electrical shocks.The most common causes of facial neuropathic pain include facial injuries, sequelae of surgical interventions (e.g supraorbital nerve injury in association with Beck's trepanation of the frontal sinus) and postherpetic neuralgia . The pain may also emerge after a disturbance of the cerebral circulation (so-called central post stroke pain). In these patients, the pain and the sensory disturbance do not necessarily limit to the facial area. Careful sensory testing of the face or neurophysiological investigations will reveal abnormal findings.If a patient is diagnosed with facial neuropathic pain of unclear origin, he/she is referred to a neurologist for further investigations. Other facial pain Acute facial pain is most commonly caused by sinusitis or by factors of dental origin. The aetiology may also be a disturbance of the masticatory system, or the pain may be referred from the anterior neck (e.g. thyroiditis) or from the back of the neck (e.g. tension neck).So-called atypical facial pain, also called persistent (or chronic) idiopathic facial pain (PIFP), is a much more common type of prolonged facial pain than trigeminal neuralgia. The pain is usually constant and dull. It is not restricted to one half of the face and is also otherwise independent of dermatomal borders. The pain may be triggered by an intervention directed at the paranasal sinuses or at the teeth (not, however, being a complication of the intervention), infection or stress.PIFP most commonly occurs in middle-aged women. The patients are often subjected to psychosocial stress. Clinical examination of a patient with facial pain includes teeth, masticatory muscles, temporomandibular joints, cervical spine and muscles of the neck and shoulders. It may also be advisable to examine the ears, nose and throat as well as the eyes and the anterior neck.If neuropathic pain is suspected, a neurological examination is important especially concerning the cranial nerves.A patient with severe or progressive facial pain is referred for further investigations to specialized care either to the department of oral diseases, neurology or ENT or to a special pain clinic, according to the local practice guidelines. See also cluster headache . TreatmentOther neuropathic pain in the facial area The treatment of other neuropathic pains in the facial area follows the same conventional principles as the treatment of any neuropathic pain .First-line drugs for neuropathic pain are gabapentin, pregabalin, tricyclic antidepressants and antidepressants of the SNRI group.Persistent idiopathic facial pain (PIFP)PIFP is treated primarily with antidepressants. Tricyclic antidepressants are used in small dosages, venlafaxine in similar dosage as in the treatment of depression.Other facial painTreatment is determined by the cause of the pain. If the pain is suspected to originate from dental occlusion or from the teeth, the patient is referred to a dentist for assessment.

Παράγοντες όπως η εθνικότητα, το χαμηλό εισόδημα, η κοινωνική απομόνωση, χρόνιες παθήσεις και υποκείμενα νοσήματα, καθώς επίσης και περιβαλλοντικοί παράγοντες αποτελούν το υπόβαθρο για την εκδήλωση και πρόοδο των κλινικών αυτών συνδρόμων. Με την πάροδο της ηλικίας αυξάνει και η επίπτωσή τους. Οι ασθενείς που πάσχουν από κίρρωση του ήπατος συχνά χαρακτηρίζονται ως ευπάθεις ή και σαρκοπενικοί, με αποτέλεσμα να επηρεάζεται αρνητικά η πρόγνωση της νόσου και κατά συνέπεια να αυξάνονται τα ποσοστά νοσηρότητας και θνητότητας. Μελέτες που να συσχετίζουν την κίρρωση με την ευπάθεια και σαρκοπενία μπορεί να βοηθήσουν στην έγκαιρη διάγνωση, πρόληψη και πιθανώς βελτίωση αυτών των κλινικών συνδρόμων. Στόχος της μελέτης αυτής είναι να διαγνωσθεί η ευπάθεια και η σαρκοπενία αντίστοιχα στους κιρρωτικούς ασθενείς και να μελετηθούν βιοδείκτες που πιθανά συσχετίζονται με τις παραπάνω συνθήκες. Ως αποτέλεσμα οι κλινικοί γιατροί θα μπορούν να αντιληφθούν σε πρώιμα στάδια τα προαναφερθέντα κλινικά σύνδρομα, σε κιρρωτικούς ασθενείς με ή χωρίς ρήξη της αντιρρόπησης.",

      "abstract": "The term 'masked depression' is not accepted in current psychiatric classification for three basic reasons: (1) It is not a unique type of a disease or a syndrome, but a state or a stage which is a part of the depressive syndromes. (2) No special list of symptoms which has enough specificity, reliability and validity can be drawn in order to describe this state. (3) The term 'masked' is vague, and is in contradiction to the basic necessity to describe what is observed in contrast to what is unobservable and masked. However, precise and scientific criteria may be unsuitable for diagnostic purposes in these cases which are quite common; thus an entity which has a deep meaning and begs recognition among general physicians may be ignored. In addition, diagnosis of such depression is very important to allow for suitable and adequate treatment procedures. Diagnostic problems, clarification of the term 'masked' and the procedures of diagnosis are discussed in the article.",

Depression can seriously impact a child’s academic achievement, social interactions and other aspects of their daily lives. [1] The reported prevalence of depression is 1 to 2% in prepubescent children, 3 to 8% in younger teenagers and 14% in teenagers aged 15 to 18; overall, it is estimated that 20% of the population will experience at least one episode of depression prior to the age of 18. [2] During childhood there is no significant gender difference in the prevalence of depression, but after puberty female rates of depression become higher than those for males. [3] The etiology of childhood depression remains unclear: it may be caused by the interaction of various risk factors and protective factors including genetic predisposition, abnormalities of the structure and function of the brain, psychological and physiological stressors, poor parental relationships, and so forth.

      "abstract": "Abstract This paper argues that the lack of strong prospective evidence linking occupational and social stress to chronic disease stems from the failure of research designs to attend sufficiently to the aetiological chronicity of such diseases. Studies of both supposedly acute stress (life events) and chronic stress in life or work must increasingly be designed to distinguish between stress which is sustained or chronic over a period of yean or even decades, and hence capable of causing a serious chronic disease, and brief or transient stress, which may produce transient or brief psychological or physiological disturbances but cannot generate major chronic disease. Prospective studies are needed which collect measures of both stress and health or disease at multiple points over an extended period of time. Measures of stress should focus more on affect (for example, feelings of pressure and tension) than on cognition (for example feelings of satisfaction). Limited existing evidence is consistent with these ideals.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although it is generally believed that a treatment that is more effective than its alternatives will be used, psychological treatments for schizophrenic and other psychotic reactions have been avoided despite the evidence of their effectiveness from the time of “moral treatment” to the present. Less effective (or even destructive) treatments have been seized upon, in part because they do not require understanding patients. Understanding them means facing facts about ourselves, our families, and our society that we do not want to know, or, in the case of repressed feelings and experiences, do not want to know again. This reluctance to understand is particularly tragic in the case of the acutely disturbed college student, whose crisis may lead either to reorganization at a higher level of functioning and growth or to a wasted life. The central role of terror in producing symptoms and the genesis and handling of symptoms, including delusions and hallucinations, are briefly discussed.",

While presentation of late-onset, post-service difficulties may explain some of the difference between veterans and those in service, delayed-onset post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) appears to be partly explained by prior subthreshold PTSD, as well as other mental health difficulties. In the longer term, veterans do not appear to suffer worse mental health than equivalent civilians. This overall lack of difference, despite increased mental health difficulties in those who have recently left, suggests that veterans are not at risk of worse mental health and/or that poor mental health is a cause, rather than a consequence, of leaving service.",

      "title": "Problemi di diagnostica differenziale nelle sindromi lombosciatalgiche",
      "abstract": "Gli Autori, in base alla loro esperienza pluriennale nella terapia delle sindromi lombo-sciatalgiche, distinguono tre gruppi principali di patologie: 1) Patologia delle radici o del nervo intervertebrale: Queste lesioni alte sono il regno della Neuroradiologia e raramente il paziente giunge al tavolo operatorio con una diagnosi dubbia. Le cause più frequenti di lesione a questo livello sono rappresentate dall'ernia discale, dalla stenosi del canale midollare (congenita o acquisita) e dalla stenosi del canale intervertebrale (continua o intermittente). Queste tre cause principali possono presentarsi isolate o variamente associate tra loro. 2) Patologia del plesso lombare o sacrale, patologia del tronco nervoso del nervo femorale o del nervo ischiatico: Le lesioni del plesso o del tronco nervoso rappresentano il regno della «elettro-diagnosi». Essa permette, infatti, la localizzazione del livello di lesione, agevolando quindi il ricorso ad altre indagini diagnostiche per individuare la causa. 3) Sindromi pseudo-sciatalgiche: Le sindromi pseudo-sciatalgiche rappresentano un gruppo di patologie caratterizzate da una sintomatologia algica lungo un'arto inferiore, in assenza di coinvolgimento diretto del nervo femorale o del nervo ischiatico. Esse possono riconoscere due meccanismi principali: a) Sindromi dolorose con meccanismo rifiesso: In questo gruppo di sindromi, la struttura sede di processo algico-infiammatorio è localizzata a livello lombare, ma essendo innervata da un ramo del plesso lombare o sacrale, il dolore viene falsamente avvertito nelle aree cutanee dal nervo femorale o ischiatico. Ciò si spiega col «fenomeno della convergenza». I principali quadri clinici sono rappresentati da: — Patologia delle articolazioni interapofisarie posteriori. Il meccanismo patogenetico dell'infiammazione articolare non è del tutto noto e probabilmente è complesso. — Patologia del legamento ileo-lombare. Tra le «legamentiti vertebrali» la patologia del legamento ileolombare su base meccano-degenerativa è certamente una delle forme più frequenti. — Patologia della articolazione coxo-femorale. L'articolazione coxo-femorale, per le sue caratteristiche di articolazione portante, è frequentemente coinvolta da patologie degenerative o infiammatorie. A causa della complessità della innervazione di tale articolazione, le zone di irradiazione del dolore possono essere molto varie. b) Sindromi dolorose da convolgimento delle strutture tendinee o fasciali dell'arto inferiore: In questo gruppo di sindromi il dolore lungo l'arto inferiore non è causato da una irradiazione, ma da un coinvolgimento patologico diretto di strutture muscolari, tendinee o fasciali dell'arto. In questo gruppo si possono includere le seguenti forme: — Sindrome fibro-mialgica primaria generalizzata. E caratterizzata da una dolorabilita alla presso-pal-pazione della cute, delle masse muscolari, delle inserzioni tendinee, da una sindrome ansiosa, da disturbi del sonno e della sfera affettiva e sessuale. — Patologia tendinea multidistrettuale dell'arto inferiore. — Patologia della fascia lata e della banderella ileo-tibiale",

The term rolling effect or rolling mechanism is used as well. The dissociation of tissue layers with other epiphenomenon occurs. The presented group of 152 décollement determined in 103 autopsy cases during the 4 years period comprises the observation of décollement of different etiology of the injuries (traffic accidents, falls from the high, compression of the torso); in the traffic accidents the occurrence in various participants of the traffic, not only in the case of the collision of the pedestrians with various traffic vehicles, but also in drivers of various traffic vehicles, and fellow-travelers as well. The topic, the localization, the content, the extent, and vital reaction and combination injuries were followed-up. According to the variability of the injury etiology, not restricted to the traditional conception of the décollement mechanism, it is obvious that the passed on rule by far is not covering the whole content of this concept. We didn't find any alternative interpretation of until now presented mechanism in the literature. The medical literature focuses mostly on the clinical aspect of this injury. In this paper, the biomechanics of the décollement origin also in case of the tissue compression by the pressure applied perpendicularly to the body surface, the dependences on physical properties of the actively or passively affecting object, the relevance of the ratio of the tissue structures compression in one direction and transversal dilation in other two directions according to the Poisson's constant, the question of tangential factor of the force in case of vertical falling on the horizontal plane, and biomechanical relations in case of body landing on an oblique surface are discussed. The mechanism of décollement is more complex as presented until now. The forensic interpretation of findings should reflex the above-mentioned facts.",

      "abstract": "In clinical practice, patients can present with many different diseases, often both somatic and mental. Holistic medicine will try to see the diseases as a whole, as symptoms of a more fundamental imbalance in the state of being. The holistic physician must help the patient to recover existence and a good relationship with self. According to the life mission theory, theory of character, and holistic process theory of healing, recovering the purpose of life (the life mission) is essential for the patient to regain life, love, and trust in order to find happiness and realize the true purpose of life. We illustrate the power of the holistic medical approach with a case study of an invalidated female artist, aged 42 years, who suffered from multiple severe health problems, many of which had been chronic for years. She had a combination of neurological disturbances (tinnitus, migraine, minor hallucinations), immunological disturbances (recurrent herpes simplex, phlegm in the throat, fungal infection in the crotch), hormonal disturbances (14 days of menstruation in each cycle), muscle disturbances (neck tensions), mental disturbances (tendency to cry, inferiority feeling, mild depression, desolation, anxiety), abdominal complaints, hemorrhoids, and more. The treatment was a combined strategy of improving the general quality of life, recovering her human character and purpose of life (“renewing the patients life energy”, “balancing her global information system”), and processing the local blockages, thus healing most of her many different diseases in a treatment using 30 h of intense holistic therapy over a period of 18 months.",

Tumor location, treatment effects, and medications contribute to these deficits. Motor dysfunction has been associated with significant deterioration in health-related quality of life in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors. Significant decrease in median overall survival has been reported in patients with motor deficits, although the reasons for this are unclear. Motor deficits, particularly gait impairment, contribute to significant symptom burden at end of life, and are the most common reasons for initiation of hospice care. Interventions must focus on prevention and amelioration of motor dysfunction throughout the disease course in order to preserve quality of life. The impact of exercise in prolonging survival and improving quality of life requires further study.",

      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

Une des raisons est probablement la confusion sur ce qui peut être attribué à l’âge ou aux effets de l’alcool. De plus, ces derniers imitent certains symptômes d’autres maladies et troubles, par exemple les troubles anxieux, la dépression ou la démence. La plupart des outils de dépistage sont insuffisamment adaptés aux personnes âgées et l’estimation de l’abus d’alcool chez celles-ci varie largement selon les méthodes utilisées. La vieillesse devient également un facteur de fragilisation face à la consommation d’alcool surtout si la personne âgée présente des problèmes de santé. Les alcoolisations sont souvent une réponse à la solitude, à l’isolement ou à la perte de soutien social et à l’anxiété, à la dépression et au stress. L’efficacité des interventions brèves dans le cas d’abus d’alcool chez les adultes âgés a été soulignée par ses résultats. L’approche clinique cognitive sur les addictions met l’accent sur l’importance des croyances concernant le produit d’alcoolisation. Certaines trouvent leur source dans l’âge de la personne.",

This results in impaired writing and abnormal posturing of the hand, forearm, or upper arm. In simple writer's cramp these features are present in isolation, whereas in dystonic writer's cramp dystonic posturing of the limb occurs at other times, particularly when using it to perform manual tasks. Sometimes simple writer's cramp develops into dystonic writer's cramp and this transition has been called progressive writer's cramp (Sheehy and Marsden 1982). Writer's cramp may occur as part of generalized dystonia and may either proceed or follow other dystonic features. It may just spread to involve the neck or opposite upper limb and thus become a segmental dystonia. The former is more likely with childhood onset, whereas the latter is more frequent with adult onset.",

      "title": "Types of tinnitus (literature overview)",
      "abstract": "Tinnitus affects up to 40 % of the population in Western countries. One to three percent of the general populations report a significant reduction in their quality of life due to tinnitus through its effect on sleep and mood. Tinnitus presents a burden to the health care system that has been rising in recent years. Population-based studies provide crucial underpinning evidence, highlighting the need for further research to address issues around effective diagnosis and clinical management of this heterogeneous condition. The discussion is done on the basis of Claussen and Shulman classification of the four main groups of tinnitus types: type I — bruit (objective), type II — endogenous tinnitus (subjective maskable), type III — exogenous tinnitus (subjective non-maskable), type IV — slow brainstem degeneration syndrome. Type I: a) pulsatile tinnitus. It can have many causes; aneurism is the most dangerous condition. Mitral insufficiency, temporomandibular joint sounds may be associated with pulsatile tinnitus; b) non-pulsatile (or periodical): vessel sclerosis. Non-pulsatile, or periodical, otosclerosis (otospongiosis) is an idiopathic infiltrative process of the petrous temporal bone that may present with tinnitus. The most common type is fenestral otosclerosis (85 %), which is associated with conductive hearing loss. In a preliminary study, etidronate appeared to be an effective treatment for the neurootologic symptoms of otosclerosis. Type II, subjective maskable. Sensory neural hearing decrease (peripheral) might have several causes: disorder of the inner hair cells, outer hair cells (OHCs), acoustic neuritis, acoustic neurinoma. Discovering the roles of inner hair cells, OHCs, and auditory neurons in speech understanding in quiet and in the presence of background noise is currently a hot topic in the scientific community. Previous studies have suggested that the auditory nerve (AN) may play a role in speech understanding in the presence of background noise. S.G. Kujawa, M.C. Liberman (2009) have shown that noise exposure causes temporary damage to OHCs (as measured by distortion product otoacoustic emissions) and permanent damage to the AN (measured by a decrease in the wave I amplitude of the auditory brainstem response). These preliminary results suggest that both OHCs and the AN contribute to speech recognition in the presence of background noise. However, OHC damage may play a primary role in hearing difficulties in this complex listening situation. Type III, subjective non-maskable (with hyperacusis), mostly central. Many people with tinnitus also suffer from hyperacusis. Both clinical and basic scientific data indicate an overlap in pathophysiologic mechanisms. In a study, 935 (55 %) out of 1713 people were characterized as hyperacusis patients. Hyperacusis in tinnitus was associated with younger age, higher tinnitus-related, mental and general distress, and higher rates of pain disorders and vertigo. Blockers of H1 histaminic receptors, Ca channels and muscarinic blockers seem to be effective. Type IV, slow brainstem degeneration syndrome. Etiology: old age, severe head trauma, poisoning, neural infections. Manifestations: dizziness, emotional disturbances, cognitive impairment, tinnitus and headaches.",

Objective To review and update the clinical characteristics, etiologies, pathophysiology and management of these headaches related to exertion. Methods In depth review of the publications, both in PubMed and in the main textbooks, of the different headaches induced by physical exercise. Results Cough, exercise and sexual headaches can be primary or secondary; therefore, complementary studies are mandatory to rule out structural lesions. However, clinical characteristics, such as an old age and response to indomethacin for cough headache or being a young male and response to beta-blockers for exercise and sexual headaches, plus a normal examination are suggestive of a primary etiology. Etiology for secondary varieties, as posterior fossa lesions for cough headache or vascular malformations for exercise and sexual headaches, are also different. Finally, headache as a distant manifestation of myocardial ischemia, also known as “cardiac cephalalgia”, appears at exertion in around two-thirds of cases and typically lasts less than 30 minutes and is relieved by nitroglycerine. Conclusions Primary and secondary cough headache can usually be suspected based on clinical characteristics and separated from exercise and sexual headaches, which share many aspects. Cardiac cephalalgia is not necessarily an exertional headache and should be considered in adult patients with short lasting headaches and patent vascular risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Until not too long ago, psychogenic trance was considered to be a 'conversion hysteria'. But clinical syndromes and personality disorders are now seen as separate entities; therefore, psychogenic trance is part of the so-called 'dissociative disorders'. Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

It refers to the consequence of the failure of an organism human or animal to respond appropriately to emotional or physical threats, whether actual or imagined.Signs of stress may be cognitive, emotional, physical or behavioral. Signs include poor judgment, a general negative outlook, excessive worrying, moodiness, irritability, agitation, inability to relax, feeling lonely, isolated or depressed, aches and pains, diarrhea or constipation, nausea, dizziness, chest pain, rapid heartbeat, eating too much or not enough, sleeping too much or not enough, social withdrawal, procrastination or neglect of responsibilities, increased alcohal, nicotine or drug consumption, and nervous habits such as pacing about, nail-biting and neck pains.Occupational stress stress involving work. According to the current World Health Organization's (WHO) definition, occupational or work-related stress is the response people may have when presented with work demands and pressures that are not matched to their knowledge and abilities and which challenge their ability to cope.Job satisfactionThe job satisfaction the end feeling of a person after performing a task.

The feeling will be positive or negative depending upon whether need satisfied or not.The job satisfaction of professional women as important as the organizational climate of any organization. Organization climate a leading indicator of organizational performance. Organizational climate may be thought of as the summary perception, which people have about an organization. It a global expression of what an organization is. Organization climate manifestation of attitudes of organizational members towards the organizational itself. Motivation and behaviour of organizational members are significantly influenced by organizational climate.

      "abstract": "Backache is a common cause of disability, and it is usually associated with structural weakness in the lumbosacral region and with faulty use of the back. Backache is often persistent or recurrent. It is an indication for careful diagnostic history, physical examination, and adequate roentgenograms. Obesity and poor posture may be contributing causes. Other causes of backache should be considered in differential diagnosis. Backache of mechanical origin can be relieved in the vast majority of cases by suitable protective measures, by correction of obesity or faulty posture, by appropriate trunk-muscle exercises, and by training in good posture. Backache unrelieved by these treatments, especially if there is a severe structural defect, for example, spondylolysis, may be relieved by spine fusion. Sciatica is also a common cause of disability. Severe persistent sciatica is commonly due to protrusion or extrusion of the nucleus pulposus with pressure against the adjacent nerve root, and it may be associated with neurological signs of nerve-root pressure. Tumor of the cauda equina is considered in differential diagnosis. Partial or temporary relief may be obtained by bed rest for two or three weeks if sciatica is due to mild nerve-root pressure. Severe or persistent sciatica due to extrusion of a nucleus pulposus is best relieved by careful surgical removal of the material causing the pressure. The best permanent results are obtained by removal of the entire nucleus pulposus. Spine fusion at the same time will relieve the backache that usually precedes and accompanies disc rupture and will correct structural weakness in the lumbosacral region. Careful evaluation of the patient, meticulous surgical technique, adequate postoperative care, and an appropriate convalescent regimen are essential for a high percentage of good or excellent results.",

      "title": "Transient Ischemic Attacks",
      "abstract": "FigureDiagnosing transient ischemic attack is not always simple or straightforward. History may help, as with many entities, but then again, it might not. A patient whose arm was numb, swollen, limp, or “dead” earlier might have actually had a motor problem. Onset of neurologic deficit is generally sudden, and deficits are typically of short duration (less than 30 minutes). Involvement of different body parts affected in succession is more characteristic of migraine or seizure. Preceding seizure may cause a post-ictal (Todd's) paralysis. One paper listed signs and symptoms likely not due to TIA: loss of consciousness, vague weakness or dizziness, mental confusion, and incontinence of urine and feces. (Lancet 1992;339:402.) Similarly, vertigo, diplopia, loss of balance, tinnitus, sensory symptoms confined to part of one limb or the face, drop attacks, and amnesia, all in isolation, are unlikely to be caused by TIA. Symptoms from multiple sclerosis typically last longer, and may be characterized by different neurologic manifestations at different times. (Ann Emerg Med 2004;43:592.) How Much Work-up is Necessary? A few remarks on definitions for a moment: The classic definition of a transient ischemic attack entails a focal neurologic symptom lasting less than 24 hours, resulting from a transient decrease in blood supply making the brain ischemic in the area producing the symptom. With advances in neuroimaging, however, especially diffusion-weighted imaging on magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible to identify ischemic brain injury very early. The classic TIA implies restoration of blood flow in a timely enough way to avoid infarction. Transient neurologic symptoms lasting for more than an hour usually imply that some sort of infarction has set in, and these events should not be considered TIAs. Switching from the classic definition to a tissue-based definition would decrease the annual incidence of TIA by approximately 33 percent and increase the annual incidence of stroke by approximately seven percent. (Stroke 2003;34:919.) Diffusion-weighted imaging has the advantage of distinguishing acute infarction from chronic lesions. Some of these are very small; the mean infarct volume detected in TIA patients was less than 1 mL in one report. In fact, this has led some to distinguish transient symptoms with infarction (TSI) from transient symptoms without infarction. (Ann Neurol 2005;57:679.) Clinical TIA duration may not correlate with signal changes on diffusion-weighted imaging. Back to Basics: Why the Hurry? It doesn't make sense to perform expensive tests for an entity that has no emergency treatment and that depends on the results of these tests. (“My back has been killing me for three years. I want an MRI to see what it is once and for all.”) Certainly, it makes sense to put patients on warfarin who have atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke, and an EKG is not a time-consuming or expensive test. Symptomatic patients with greater than 70 percent carotid stenosis, on the other hand, may well derive benefit from endarterectomy. Should all patients be admitted? This is probably the question of the hour for the emergency physician. A debate on this topic appeared in Stroke. (2006;37:1137.) As noted last month, the risk of stroke may be 10 percent to 20 percent in the 90 days after TIA. Perhaps half of the risk of early stroke accrues in the first two days after TIA, however. This is hardly enough time to expect a timely outpatient work-up by a neurologist or a patient's primary care provider. Potential benefits for hospitalization include expedited work-up, opportunity for risk factor modification, monitoring patients for deterioration and possible thrombolysis and especially facilitation of early carotid artery revascularization. Carotid surgery has been shown to be most effective when performed within two weeks of the index ischemic event. (Lancet 2004;363:915.) As for medical therapy with antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) or a statin, studies to be published soon may shed some light on their efficacy in the hyperacute state after TIA or minor stroke. For patients with atrial fibrillation and TIA, the rate of stroke appears to be approximately five percent in the first two to four weeks, a figure that may not be affected by anticoagulation. (Stroke 2002;33:2722.) There is some evidence that patients with motor or speech deficits of less than 10 minutes' duration, who are over 60, or who have diabetes are at higher risk for early stroke. Clinical risk stratification models for TIA have been developed and are used in some settings. (Stroke 2006;37:1137.) Sending Some Patients Home As with other disease entities, it is useful to confirm the diagnosis of TIA, identify and treat the cause, and especially prevent a disabling or fatal vascular event. Disposition from the emergency department often will be contingent on whether the patient is stable in other ways and prompt follow-up is available. This all presupposes that the emergency physician has made an accurate diagnosis, so that the neurologist isn't trashing the EP for tying up a precious hospital bed for someone with hypoglycemia, Todd's paralysis that resolves by the time the admitting physician comes in, or some benign vestibular disorder. Some experts say brain imaging for the most part can be performed on an outpatient basis, as can carotid scanning and echocardiography, perhaps even in a timely way. (Stroke 2006;37:1139.) Patients do not need to be in the hospital to be taught the value of exercise and cessation of smoking. They can certainly be started on any statin, diuretic, or ACE inhibitor without being hospitalized. Then there are the dangers of being in the hospital at all for anyone: exposure to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, risk of deep venous thrombosis, and deconditioning from being confined to a hospital bed. At any rate, many patients with TIA and normal imaging on diffusion-weighted imaging do well. One study of 83 consecutive patients listed th incidence of recurrent cerebral ischemic event after approximately 13 months at 30 percent if infarction was present, but only 14 percent if no infarction was present on diffusion-weighted imaging. (Stroke 2004;35:2313.) More convincingly, in a case series of 57 patients presenting with TIA, the rate of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients who had TIA with infarction during their hospital stay (3 to 5 days) was 14.8 percent, while no recurrent or new stroke occurred in patients with TIA and normal imaging. (Cerebrovasc Dis 2002;14:177.) The Bottom Lines There will be ongoing debate about how TIA should be defined and what technology is needed to determine whether a TIA actually occurred. From our perspective, there are some therapies which may prevent stroke and enough science to justify testing. It certainly adds more value to prevent neurologic deficit than to hospitalize someone after a CVA for rehabilitation purposes. There is a dearth of evidence on exactly what to do with the TIA patient in the emergency department. Patients with clear neurologic deficits such as aphasia or hemiparesis may be at higher risk than those with sensory events or vertigo. TIA work-up clearly lends itself to a brief hospital observation stay. Because the persistent concern is for tight carotid stenosis requiring revascularization, the case could be made for sending TIA patients home as long as their carotid arteries have been evaluated. Clearly, the last word has not been issued about whether all TIAs should be admitted. The fact that there has been a debate published this year (pro and con) in the stroke literature attests to this. In fact, the con position in the debate over hospitalization for TIAs was held by a geriatrician who works in a national health service country (Australia). If he thinks he can get a timely work-up there, surely we might be able to do so in the U.S. EMN on the Web Looking for Dr. James Roberts' article on kidney stones?

      "title": "“What an Affliction”: Mary Todd Lincoln’s Fatal Pernicious Anemia",
      "abstract": "To date, no single diagnosis has unified the psychiatric illness and the numerous poorly defined physical complaints that Mary Lincoln (née Todd, 1818–1882) suffered in adulthood. Here, I show that her physical ailments spanned 30 years and included sore mouth, pallor, paresthesias, the Lhermitte symptom, fever, headaches, fatigue, resting tachycardia, edema, episodic weight loss, progressive weakness, ataxia, and visual impairment. Long thought hypochondriacal, these findings, plus their time course and her psychopathology (irritability, delusions, hallucinations, with preserved clarity), are all consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. Pernicious anemia most probably caused this deficiency: she lacked risk factors for other causes, and her consanguineous parents both derived from a region of Scotland having a high incidence of pernicious anemia. A diagnosis of chronic multisystem pernicious anemia would clarify the conduct of Mary Lincoln as First Lady and widow, and illuminate challenges faced by her husband, President Abraham Lincoln. Her case highlights many forgotten features of the natural history of untreated pernicious anemia and is unique in the medical literature in demonstrating such a course extending over a lifetime.",

Additionally, OT can accompany other medical or neurodegenerative disorders. In this article, we report an unusual case of OT after trauma in an 18-year-old male patient whose symptoms of OT have been resolved after a multimodal therapeutic approach, including botulinum toxin injection. Surface electromyography, including a tremor recording, was used for the diagnosis of OT. The patient completely recovered after the rehabilitation. A comprehensive rehabilitative treatment is required in the management of OT as the patient's quality of life is greatly affected.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Both physical and mental health is intimately linked. People who have a significant mental illness are more prone to suffer from a variety of chronic physical diseases. People who have long-term medical issues, on the other hand are more than twice as likely to be depressed and anxiety as the general population. The goal of the research is to better understand the impact of mental illness on the body. This disease has social consequences in terms of diminished efficiency and increased health-care utilization. The first step is to comprehend the relationship between the mind and the body in devising treatments to reduce the occurrence of co-existing diseases and treat those who do have mental illnesses and chronic physical difficulties and . Depression can be accompanied by practically any other mental or physical ailment. Physical illness increases the likelihood of developing a major type of depression. At work, there are two separate processes. The one that stands out the most is based on psychological or cognitive issues. As a result, due to a life event or persistent struggle, the disease might be the spark for a depressive episode in a handicapped person. Second, there are more complicated relationships between depression and certain health disorders. In terms of etiology, they might be very intriguing. Stroke and coronary disease are perhaps the best examples. Finally, severe depression, but particularly minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms, which patients present to their physicians, merge with other signs of human distress. Such somatic manifestations put the traditional distinction between physical and mental illness to the test, and they are a perennial subject of debate.

      "title": "Post Traumatic Stress Disorder – An Overview",
      "abstract": "IntroductionPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to any event that result in psychological trauma.This event may involve the threat of death to oneself or to someone else, or to one's own or someone else's physical, sexual, or psychological integrity, overwhelming the individual's ability to cope.As an effect of psychological trauma, PTSD is less frequent but more enduring than the more commonly seen acute stress response.Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a persistent and sometimes crippling condition and develops in a significant proportion of individuals exposed to trauma, and untreated, can continue for years.Its symptoms can affect every life domain -physiological, psychological, occupational, and social.Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was first introduced into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1980, making it one of the more recently accepted psychiatric disorders.PTSD is one of the few DSM diagnoses to have a recognizable etiologic agent, in that it must develop in direct response to a severe (sudden, terrifying, or shocking) life event (American Psychiatric Association 2000).Since the introduction of PTSD into DSM-III (American Psychiatric Association 1980), the disorder has been documented in children exposed to traumas such as domestic violence, natural disasters, medical trauma (such as hospitalization or medical procedures performed on children), war, terrorism, and community violence.According to the American Psychological Association, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as \"an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave physical harm occurred or was threatened.Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused disasters, such as terrorist attacks, motor vehicle accidents, rape, physical and sexual abuse, and other crimes, or military combat [1].\"PTSD is a problem in which the human brain continues to react with nervousness after the horrific trauma even though the original trauma is over.Brain can react by staying in \"overdrive\" and being hyperalert in preparation for the next possible trauma.Sometimes the brain continues to \"remember\" the trauma by having \"flashbacks\" about the event or nightmares even though the trauma was in the past. Historical backgroundReports of battle-associated stress reactions appeared as early as the 6th century BC.One of the first descriptions of PTSD was made by the Greek historian Herodotus.In 490 BC www.intechopen.comPost Traumatic Stress Disorders in a Global Context 4 Herodotus described, during the Battle of Marathon, an Athenian soldier who suffered no injury from war but became permanently blind after witnessing the death of a fellow soldier.In the early 19th century military medical doctors started diagnosing soldiers with \"exhaustion\" after the stress of battle.This \"exhaustion\" was characterized by mental shutdown due to individual or group trauma.Soldiers during the 19th century were not supposed to be scared or show any fear in the midst of battle.The only treatment for this \"exhaustion\" was to bring the afflicted back for a bit for a short term therapy and then send them back into battle.During the intense and frequently repeated stress, the soldiers became fatigued as a part of their body's natural shock reaction.According to Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau and Annette Becker, \"One-tenth of mobilized American men were hospitalized for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.\"Previous diagnoses now considered historical equivalents of PTSD include railway spine, stress syndrome, shell shock, battle fatigue, or traumatic war neurosis.Although PTSD-like symptoms have also been recognized in combat veterans of many military conflicts, the modern understanding of PTSD dates from the 1970s, largely as a result of the problems that were still being experienced by US military veterans of the war in Vietnam.In its initial DSM-III (formulation 1980), a traumatic event was conceptualized as a catastrophic stressor that was outside the range of usual human experience.The framers of the original PTSD diagnosis had in mind events such as war, torture, rape, the Nazi Holocaust, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and volcano eruptions) and human-made disasters (such as factory explosions, airplane crashes, and automobile accidents).They considered traumatic events as clearly different from the very painful stressors that constitute the normal vicissitudes of life such as divorce, failure, rejection, serious illness and financial reverses.(By this logic adverse psychological responses to such \"ordinary stressors\" would, in DSM-III terms, be characterized as Adjustment Disorders rather than PTSD.)This dichotomization between traumatic and other stressors was based on the assumption that although most individuals have the ability to cope with ordinary stress, their adaptive capacities are likely to be overwhelmed when confronted by a traumatic stressor.The DSM-III diagnostic criteria for PTSD were revised in DSM-III-R (1987) and DSM-IV (1994) [2].A very similar syndrome is classified in .Since 1980 there has been a great deal of attention devoted to the development of instruments for assessing PTSD.Although an optimal evaluation of a patient for PTSD consists of a face-to-face interview by a mental health professional trained in diagnosing psychiatric disorders, several instruments are available to facilitate the diagnosis and assessment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).These include screening tools, diagnostic instruments, and trauma and symptom severity scales.For example, there are brief screening tools, such as the 4-item Primary Care PTSD Screen, developed by the Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; self-report screening instruments, such as the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale; and structured or semi-structured interviews, such as the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (DIS-IV), and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), Acute Stress Disorder Interview (ASDI), www.intechopen.comPost Traumatic Stress Disorders in a Global Context 6 Country PTSD DALY rate, overall PTSD DALY rate, females PTSD DALY rate, males Thailand 59 86 30 Indonesia",

      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "abstract": "The musicians are seen in daily neurological practice facing various problems sometimes simple such as skeletal or tendon pain or even compression of a nerve trunk and sometimes more complicated such as focal dystonia. Dystonia often has a dramatic impact on the career of a musician given the complexity of the clinical and therapeutic approach and the results are often disappointing. The history of the German Romantic composer Robert Schumann illustrates this reality; through his story a discussion of both the different pathophysiological hypotheses responsible for focal dystonia, a disorder of brain plasticity, and of the multimodal therapeutic approaches, revisited in the light of neurophysiological findings will be described.",

      "title": "The whole horse approach to equine physical rehabilitation: the biomechanical view",
      "abstract": "When the biomechanics of movement of the whole horse is evaluated during rehabilitation, the chance of a successful outcome increases. Faulty movement can be caused by conformation, injury and/or imbalanced work. Faulty movement induces pain and pain induces faulty movement. These related issues result in weakness of the tissues associated with the pain and incorrect movement. As weakness is the symptom of the inciting problem, strengthening alone only treats the symptom. Locating and treating the cause, especially the mechanical cause of pain, is an important part of a rehabilitation protocol. Strengthening of muscles, tendons and ligaments is a common goal of a rehabilitation program. However, too much strength can be as detrimental to healing and injury prevention as too little strength, and can disrupt the biomechanical balance of the body. Flexibility is necessary to keep joint movement smooth and to retain range of motion. However, hypermobility can be a major cause of injury and is a typical outcome when hypomobility has produced limited range of motion in one area of the body. The excessive movement of hypermobility can cause degenerative joint disease leading to compensatory movement and further pain. Diagnostic ultrasound is a quick, safe, economical and effective means of diagnosing a variety of issues in equine medicine and is the optimal method for monitoring the progression of healing in these injuries. Physical rehabilitation takes time, but simply allowing more time for the rehabilitation process is not the answer.",

The prevalence of clinically significant demoralization in patients with cancer is 15%. Demoralization can be diagnosed when a poor sense of coping is associated with low morale, reduced hope, and a sense of feeling stuck, with related symptoms of feeling helpless, pointless or purposeless, and with doubts about the value of continued life. Meaning-based coping may need to be evoked to reduce the accompanying distress and social and functional impairment that can develop. Diagnoses like demoralization syndrome, adjustment disorder with demoralization, and major depression with demoralization help to guide the optimal choice of treatment. Cognitively informed and existentially oriented therapies can help to restore morale and sustain engagement with the living.",

On the other hand, in menstrual psychosis (MP), a distinctly psychiatric disorder, the etiology is not necessarily psychogenic, but rather is hormonal–biological. We present 4 cases, one each of primary and secondary amenorrhea, MMR, and MP, respectively. In the first 3 cases (2 amenorrhea and 1 MMR), we found psychogenic factors: an insult to feminine development after rape (case 1) or marriage problems (cases 2 and 3). In the case of a recurrent MP, no relevant psychological etiology was found. Furthermore, some of the patient's relatives had menstrual or peripartum psychiatric disorders. Menstrual disorders' etiology can be psychogenic or hormonal. The correct etiology is the guide for the adequate therapeutic way: psychotherapy based in psychogenic disorders and neuroleptic or antiovulatory drugs in those of biological etiology.",

The distinctive features and the legal complications of these various types of amnesia are discussed. The electroencephalogram ram seems to provide evidence which in many cases may assist in distinguishing pathological amnesia from the other forms. In those cases in which an illegal act is the result of a period of amnesia which in turn is accompanied by a disorder of the electrical waves of the brain, treatment by means of medicine instead of by incarceration seems reasonable. Intensive research on this point is urgently needed.",

      "title": "Prevention and treatment",
      "abstract": "Preventive activity in the field of the biopsychosocial disorders of childhood can, like other forms of medical prevention, be classified as follows.♦ Primary prevention: action taken to prevent the development of the disorder in the first place, usually by removing the cause.♦ Secondary prevention: action taken to identify the disorder at its onset, or as early as possible thereafter, so as to prevent extension and to minimise duration.♦ Tertiary prevention: action taken to limit further avoidable disability arising from an established condition.Rational prevention is made easier if there is good understanding of the factors that may be related to the development of disorders. The presence of a risk factor implies that the individual has an increased likelihood of developing a disorder. Protective factors are those that reduce an individual’s likelihood of developing the disorder in the presence of a risk factor (or conversely those that enhance resilience), and vulnerability factors are those that increase likelihood of disorder. Thus, for example, the presence of parental marital disharmony is a risk factor for conduct disorder. If a child at risk for this reason has a good relationship with an adult outside the family, this can act as a protective factor, and if the child is educationally delayed, this may increase the child’s vulnerability to develop such a disorder. Therefore action to reduce risk and vulnerability factors, and to enhance protective factors and resilience, may result in successful prevention. Although perhaps the major responsibility for prevention lies in social and educational policy areas, as far as health professionals are concerned the onus for prevention in this field is largely, although not entirely, on those working in primary health care, such as general practitioners, community health doctors, and health visitors. Therefore emphasis in this section will be on activities that these professionals can undertake. However, those involved in secondary care, such as paediatricians, psychologists, and psychiatrists can also undertake activities of major preventive significance, particularly if there is a focus on high-risk groups (Boyle and Offord 1990). Social policy measures of potential preventive significance will be discussed first.Treatment methods in child and family psychiatry are scientifically less well established than in some, but by no means all, other branches of medicine. In particular, knowledge concerning the effectiveness of different types of treatment for particular disorders is often uncertain. Consequently, it is not surprising that treatment practice still varies quite widely from centre to centre. Nevertheless, much useful knowledge is available and the evidence base is increasing steadily (Hoagwood et al. 2001). This is as true for what does not work, as for what does (Turk 2005b). Further, although there is a need for far more evaluation of treatment methods in this field, there is already a substantial amount of evidence available concerning the effectiveness of different psychotherapy techniques for specific disorders (Fonagy et al., 2002a; Target and Fonagy, 2005; Weisz and Jensen 2001). In the following sections a number of methods of treatment are described, although it must be appreciated that many practitioners often use different forms of therapy in combination. In each case an attempt has been made to describe the form the treatment takes, the principles underlying it, indications and contraindications for its use, and evidence for its effectiveness. Some examples are given of its application in different types of facility: primary care, paediatric and psychiatric. For brevity, the case examples do not contain all relevant information. Names of children described, and some identifying data, have been altered to preserve anonymity.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia - An Ayurvedic Management",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental condition that can cause significant disability in which people interpret reality abnormally. If neglected, it leads to serious issues that impact all facets of life. It affects about one percent of the world’s population. According to World Health Organization (WHO) schizophrenia affects approximately 24 million people worldwide, which is equivalent to 1 in 300 people (0.32%). It involves a range of problems with cognition, behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The pathomechanism of schizophrenia is not fully understood and current antipsychotics are characterized by many limitations. A 30 year old male presented with the symptoms of increased anger, impulsivity, irritability, feeling that others are talking about him and trying to harm him, somebody is following him and controlling all his actions. Others are able to access to his thoughts through mobile phone, unable to concentrate on his works, beating mother since 8 months. Paittika unmada symptoms such as Amarsha (keeping rivalry), Krodha (anger), Swesham paresham va abhidravana (harming self and others), and Kaphaja unmada symptoms such as Rahaskamata (likes sitting alone), Thushnibaava (reduced speech) were the presenting symptoms, so the condition was diagnosed as schizophrenia as per ICD 11 (Paittika unmada with Kaphanubanda) and treatment protocol was selected according to the predominant Dosha level. The assessment tool used was PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale). After Shirodhara, Snehapana, Virechana, Nasya and Samana PANSS Score reduced from 66 to 34. In the current Ayurvedic protocol showed better outcome in the management of Schizophrenia. Future research should focus on the potential of the Ayurvedic protocol for better management and an enhanced quality of life.",

Con este fin, se citan las dificultades diagnosticas que surgen en el estudio de ciertas desviaciones verticales asociadas, que frecuentemente son interpretadas como de origen paralitico; tales como las esotropias y exotropias con doble elevacion o depresion en la aduccion, y que a veces se acompanan de hiperforia alternante. Se acepta que tales desviaciones verticales puedan ser debidas a la disociacion de la mirada por el estrabismo horizontal, como sugiere Urist, o a una perturbacion en el desarrollo de los reflejos optomotores, como llama la atencion Crone. Se destaca, ademas, que el torticolis ocular no siempre es la consecuencia de una paralisis. Las perturbaciones motoras secundarias a una paralisis, tales como las hiperfunciones o contracturas de los sinergistas contralaterales y antagonistas homolaterales y las paralisis inhibicionales, no solo dificultan el diagnostico de la paralisis en si, sino que lo enmascaran. Las perturbaciones sensoriales secundarias a una desviacion de los ejes oculares (ambliopia, correspondencia anomala, diplopiafobia, etcetera) son tambien escollos para el diagnostico, que merecen considerarse. Se aconseja un metodo de examen a seguir en el estudio de estos enfermos y, finalmente, se adjuntan dos ejemplos demostrativos. Palabra clave: Articulo",

PSH is thought to result from a loss of cortical inhibition of sympathetic outflow centers in the brainstem and diencephalon after a brain injury. PSH is associated with increased risks of morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospital stay. It can occur in up to a third of patients with severe acquired brain injury. Treatment is based on eliminating triggers for sympathetic response, attenuating the sympathetic hyperactivation, and preventing future paroxysms.",

The term ‘acute confusional state’ is often used synonymously with ‘delirium’. Delirium may be associated with a range of associated clinical features including increased or decreased psychomotor activity (hyperactive and hypoactive variants), hallucinations and delusions, and efferent sympathetic hyperactivity. Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause. In some patients, however, delirium may be followed by long-term cognitive impairment, suggesting that the pathophysiology of delirium overlaps with that of dementia.",

It is classified in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder Fifth edition under the \"obsessive compulsive and related disorders\" section. Often associated with other psychiatric conditions like autism, alcohol abuse, obsessive compulsive, body dysmorphic, mood, anxiety and borderline personality disorders, it is a disorder that is quite often underreported. The patient in this case report is a 58-year-old male with a diagnosis of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) who reported severe anxiety and skin picking episodes over several years. He presented to the emergency room with an extensive wound on distal left foot with exposure of the underlying muscle tissue, that resulted from the excessive picking of skin from the left foot. This compulsive behavior started off with picking the skin around his nail beds and slowly got worse. The skin picking would get worse whenever he gets nervous or anxious. The wound was treated with topical wound care and antibiotics. At the time of discharge, he was prescribed oral antibiotics to complete his course of treatment and was referred to the hospital's cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program that specializes in treatment of OCD and anxiety disorders. Treatment of dermatillomania is a multipronged approach and should include treatment of the underlying psychiatric illness, the treatment for pruritus and topical treatment of the lesions. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have proved to be the most effective in treating the psychiatric component of dermatillomania. Non-pharmacological treatments such as behavioral therapy, habit reversal exercises and support groups have also proved to be helpful and are well tolerated amongst patients suffering from dermatillomania.",

      "abstract": "Primary headaches can be considered simultane- ously as symptom and disease itself, while secondary headaches are expressions of a pathological process that can be systemic or locoregional. Because of its subjective features, headache is often difficult to assess and quantify by severity, frequency and invalidity rate, and for these reasons it has often been implicated in legal controversies. Headache has seldom been considered in the criminal law, except when it represents a typical symptom of a disease whose existence can be objectively assessed (i.e. raised intracranial pressure). Therefore, in civil legislation it is not yet coded to start claiming for invalidity compensation. In particular, one of the most debated medical-legal ques- tions is represented by headaches occurring after head injury. Headache is often the principal symptom at the beginning of several toxic chronic syndromes, with many implications, especially in working claims, and, more recently, it may be referred to as one of the most frequent symptoms by victims of mobbing (i.e. psychological harassment in the workplace). The National Institute for Industrial Accident Insurance (INAIL) scales (instituted by the law 38/2000) mention the Subjective cranial trauma syndrome and give an invalidity rate evaluation. With ref- erence to other headache forms, no legislation really exists at the present time, and headache is only considered as a symptom of a certain coded disease. Requests for invalid- ity social pension and the question of off-label prescrip- tions (drug prescription for a disease, without formal indi- cation for it) are other controversial matters.",

It affects 35% of the general population, according to the 1984 report of the National Institutes of Mental Health (1). Insomnia is not defined by total sleep time but by the inability to obtain sleep of sufficient length or quality to produce refreshment the following morning. For example, a person who needs only 4 hours of sleep does not have insomnia if he or she is refreshed in the morning after having 4 hours of sleep, whereas someone who needs 10 hours of sleep may have insomnia if he or she does not feel refreshed even after 8 hours of sleep. Contrary to popular lore, psychiatric or psychological factors are not the most frequent causes of insomnia. Insomnias can be divided into two major categories: the primary insomnias and the secondary insomnias. As discussed elsewhere in this volume, primary insomnias are conditions in which the insomnia is the main pathophysiological process, whereas secondary insomnias are conditions where the insomnia is a symptom of another disorder.",

But as its features become more widely known it is likely to be increasingly recognized. It occurs in children of Jewish parentage, the majority of cases being reported from the U.S.A., with one from South America (Tyndel, 1955), and some from Montreal (Riley, 1955). The constant symptoms comprise: defective lachrymation (“crying without tears”); symmetrical, blotchy erythema following emotional disturbances or eating; excessive sweating; sialorrhoea; emotional lability; poor motor coordination; relative indifference to pain; and hypo- or areflexia. Inconstant symptoms are: intermittent hypertension; periodic vomiting which may threaten life; liability to respiratory diseases; frequent unexplained bouts of pyrexia; attacks of apnoea during the first year of life; corneal ulceration; orthopaedic changes (scoliosis, pes cavus); and epileptiform convulsions (Riley, 1952). The condition is familial, apparently being inherited as a simple recessive trait (Riley et al. , 1954), though an irregular dominant is a possibility (St. Martin, 1953).",

      "title": "Persistent post-traumatic headache: a migrainous loop or not? The preclinical evidence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3, post-traumatic headache (PTH) attributed to traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a secondary headache reported to have developed within 7 days from head injury, regaining consciousness following the head injury, or discontinuation of medication(s) impairing the ability to sense or report headache following the head injury. It is one of the most common secondary headache disorders, and it is defined as persistent when it lasts more than 3 months. Main body Currently, due to the high prevalence of this disorder, several preclinical studies have been conducted using different animal models of mild TBI to reproduce conditions that engender PTH. Despite representing a simplification of a complex disorder and displaying different limitations concerning the human condition, animal models are still a mainstay to study in vivo the mechanisms of PTH and have provided valuable insight into the pathophysiology and possible treatment strategies. Different models reproduce different types of trauma and have been ideated in order to ensure maximal proximity to the human condition and optimal experimental reproducibility. Conclusion At present, despite its high prevalence, PTH is not entirely understood, and the differential contribution of pathophysiological mechanisms, also observed in other conditions like migraine, has to be clarified. Although facing limitations, animal models are needed to improve understanding of PTH. The knowledge of currently available models is necessary to all researchers who want to investigate PTH and contribute to unravel its mechanisms.",

      "title": "Travel, trauma, and phobia: Treating the survivors of transport-related trauma",
      "abstract": "Travelling by public and personal transport is an important part of modern life. Travel phobia is a common and disabling problem characterized by strong fear and avoidance of travel. It can interfere severely with the individual's occupational and social functioning. In clinical settings, fear of travel may present either as the main problem (i.e., as a specific phobia) or as part of another anxiety disorder (e.g., agoraphobia, claustrophobia). It may also develop as a response to experiencing a traumatic event when travelling (e.g., assault, terrorist attack, or severe accident). Whereas the phenomenology of travel fears shares many features among these subgroups of patients (Blanchard & Hickling, 1997; Ehlers, Hofmann, Herda, & Roth, 1994), the concerns that lead people to be afraid of travel may be quite different. Travelling can activate social concerns, such as concerns about behaving in a way that would be embarrassing, thus overlapping in relevant concerns with social phobia. Cognitive behavioural therapy of travel phobia will thus need to be informed about the idiosyncratic cognitions that drive a patient's avoidance behaviour. As this chapter will show, treatment techniques that were developed for the treatment of panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder are often helpful in addressing the patient's relevant concerns. This is especially relevant for patients whose travel phobia was triggered by a traumatic event. In order to treat travel phobias after traumatic events, the therapist will need to map the patient's concerns in order to choose the appropriate methods of challenging them and may need to draw on recent advances in treating trauma memories. We will illustrate how a cognitive formulation that takes into account cognitive elements of panic disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) helps direct treatment of travel phobia after traumatic events, drawing on cases from the tragic events in London on 7 July 2005. Mindful of the potential overlap in PTSD and specific phobia symptoms in the context of this large-scale trauma, the authors sought to develop a treatment protocol for individuals presenting with travel fear and avoidance based on existing specific phobia (Davey, 1997) and PTSD treatments. This chapter describes the treatment of two survivors of the London bombings from within a series of patients referred for treatment of fear and avoidance of transport situations; one with a primary diagnosis of travel phobia, the other with a primary diagnosis of PTSD. Both exhibited fear and avoidance of transport situations. Both exhibited some symptoms of re-experiencing and arousal. However, the differential diagnoses, formulations, and treatment protocols illustrate the importance of a range of interventions to treat both PTSD and phobias following trauma.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We summarize popular and pre-scientific conceptions of the relationship between crying, well-being and health, and we review the scientific literature on this topic. First, the focus is on whether crying brings relief and facilitates emotional recovery. Next, we discuss the evidence addressing whether crying or its chronic inhibition is associated with an increased risk of developing health problems. Finally, we address crying as a signal or symptom of disease. It is concluded that the question regarding whether crying brings relief has yielded seemingly contrasting findings, dependent on the design of the study. Concerning the second and third issues, there is a lack of sound studies. Little is known about the nature of the association between depression and crying. The evidence for a relationship between neurological disorders (in particular, stroke and multiple sclerosis) appears more convincing. There is also mainly anecdotal evidence of increased crying in a wide variety of health problems, which may reflect symptoms of disease, co-morbid depression, adjustment problems, or side effects of treatment. Some recent studies further suggest a positive effect of crying on health status in certain patient groups. More systematic and well-designed studies are needed to clarify the relationship between crying and health.",

Nevertheless, a number of neurological adverse effects from use of medical cannabis on the short- and on the longterm have been reported, in addition to other adverse health events.It has been noticed that the use of medical cannabis can lead to a paradoxical effects depending on the amount of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) -like cannabinoids the preparation contain. Accordingly, some neurological disorders or symptoms (e.g. multiple sclerosis, seizures, epilepsy, headache) may be caused or exacerbated by the same treatment supposed to cure them.

      "title": "Reviewof trisomy X (47,XXX)",
      "abstract": "Trisomy X is a sex chromosome anomaly with a variable phenotype caused by the presence of an extra X chromosome in females (47,XXX instead of 46,XX). It is the most common female chromosomal abnormality, occurring in approximately 1 in 1,000 female births. As some individuals are only mildly affected or asymptomatic, it is estimated that only 10% of individuals with trisomy X are actually diagnosed. The most common physical features include tall stature, epicanthal folds, hypotonia and clinodactyly. Seizures, renal and genitourinary abnormalities, and premature ovarian failure (POF) can also be associated findings. Children with trisomy X have higher rates of motor and speech delays, with an increased risk of cognitive deficits and learning disabilities in the school-age years. Psychological features including attention deficits, mood disorders (anxiety and depression), and other psychological disorders are also more common than in the general population. Trisomy X most commonly occurs as a result of nondisjunction during meiosis, although postzygotic nondisjunction occurs in approximately 20% of cases. The risk of trisomy X increases with advanced maternal age. The phenotype in trisomy X is hypothesized to result from overexpression of genes that escape X-inactivation, but genotype-phenotype relationships remain to be defined. Diagnosis during the prenatal period by amniocentesis or chorionic villi sampling is common. Indications for postnatal diagnoses most commonly include developmental delays or hypotonia, learning disabilities, emotional or behavioral difficulties, or POF. Differential diagnosis prior to definitive karyotype results includes fragile X, tetrasomy X, pentasomy X, and Turner syndrome mosaicism. Genetic counseling is recommended. Patients diagnosed in the prenatal period should be followed closely for developmental delays so that early intervention therapies can be implemented as needed. Schoolage children and adolescents benefit from a psychological evaluation with an emphasis on identifying and developing an intervention plan for problems in cognitive/academic skills, language, and/or social-emotional development. Adolescents and adult women presenting with late menarche, menstrual irregularities, or fertility problems should be evaluated for POF. Patients should be referred to support organizations to receive individual and family support. The prognosis is variable, depending on the severity of the manifestations and on the quality and timing of treatment.",

An increasing number of healthy individuals make use of ‘lifestyle’ drugs, such as nootropics, psychopharmaca, hormones and ecodrugs. In this respect, the fact that many people try to improve their outer appearance, to solve their ‘cosmetic problems’, to influence their rate of hair growth and to altogether delay, halt or even reverse the natural aging process has become a relevant matter for the practising doctor. Lifestyle drugs are taken in an attempt to increase personal life quality by means of attaining a certain psychosocially defined medical or beauty ideal, rather than to manage a medically identifiable, well-defined disease. Often, patients suffering from somatoform disorders such as hypochondriac disorders, body dysmorphic disorders, somatization disorders or persistent somatoform pain disorders may spontaneously ask physicians to prescribe them lifestyle drugs. Also, when ‘healthy’ people demand a lifestyle drug, possible side effects and contraindications must be taken into consideration and ruled out.",

Stress is usually viewed as a mediator, that is, an unobservable inferred construct which is hypothesized to account for a certain observable behaviour such as health or illness differences between individuals. The early research on stress clearly documented the importance of biological bases of the stress process. The research on stress has renewed the interest in the significant influence of psychological factors in health and illness. Chronic stressors can cause neural and endocrine change that alters the normal functioning of the organism. The physiological response to stress is also accompanied by behavioural responses. Stress has direct physiological effects on the body, and the cumulative wear and tear on the system caused by recurring stress can eventually cause damage to the system.",

Cerebral palsy affects two to three children per 1,000 live-born. Typological characteristics of the clinical image of cerebral palsy are the modified muscle tone characterized by muscular tension, altered body posture and disturbed motion. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life. Methods used, based on clinical kinesiology, and appropriate exercise and modification, kinesitherapy has positive effects in treating the condition of people with cerebral palsy",

      "title": "The Impact Of Menopause On The Musculoskeletal System: A Practical Overview",
      "abstract": "Key Points • Menopause is associated with a rapid decline in estrogen, which significantly affects bone, joint, and muscle health. • Bone loss accelerates during the menopause transition, with up to a 10% reduction in spine bone density within the first five years after the final menstrual period. • Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) has been shown to be effective in preserving bone density and reducing fracture risk. • Musculoskeletal symptoms, such as pain, stiffness, and joint discomfort are common and often underrecognized during the menopause transition, sometimes leading to misdiagnosis. • Foundational strategies for preserving musculoskeletal health during and after menopause include lifestyle interventions such as strength training, balance exercises, and adequate protein and vitamin D intake. Menopause represents an important phase in a woman's reproductive life, marked by the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, signalling the end of the reproductive years. In North America, the average age of onset is 50.5 years, generally occurring between the ages of 45 and 55. Hormonal fluctuations and symptoms of hypoestrogenism—such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood and cognitive changes—can begin up to 10 years before menopause, during the perimenopausal or menopause transition. These symptoms stem from fluctuations in sex hormones, primarily estrogen, which has receptors distributed throughout the body and impacts nearly every organ system, including the bones, joints, and muscles. In this review, we will summarize the effects of hypoestrogenism on bone, joint, and muscle health during and beyond the menopause transition.",

Patients with TMD have a heterogeneous clinical presentation that can include facial pain, ear discomfort, headache and/or temporomandibular joint dysfunction. Causes of TMD include structural malalignment, joint trauma, psychiatric illness, head and cervical posture. TMD affects between 5-10% of the adult population and is associated with pain and dysfunction that can impact quality of life and reduce individual work productivity., Treatment approaches have included medications (analgesics, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), physiotherapy (exercises, massage), laser, psychological interventions, occlusal appliances, surgery and trigger point injections (local anaesthetics, corticosteroids, botulinum toxin).Botulinum toxin type A is a neurotoxin that inhibits the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction with a goal to reduce excessive contraction of the target muscle. Botulinum toxin type A is currently available in Canada under several names (e.g. Botox, Dysport, Xeomin) and is indicated for both cosmetic and therapeutic purposes. No botulinum toxin product has received approval from Health Canada for the management of TMD.Evidence to support coverage decisions for botulinum toxin in Canadian jurisdictions is required.

      "abstract": "People die daily in the hospital. Mostly, they die because their illnesses were no longer treatable (natural death). Unfortunately, some people die an unnatural death, in particular, as the result of euthanasia. In contrast to the situation in most countries, in the Netherlands euthanasia is accepted by the courts under strict conditions. It can be very difficult for the legal authorities to establish whether a person has died from natural causes or from suicide, euthanasia, or murder. In addition to the pathologist and the lawyer, the toxicologist also has a number of problems in showing whether euthanasia has been carried out. These can consist of the following analytical problems: (a) interactions--the patients involved have frequently been receiving a large number of toxic and nontoxic drugs simultaneously; (b) identification--not all drugs administered are included in general screening procedures; (c) metabolites--a large number of metabolites may have accumulated toward the end of a long therapeutic regimen; and (d) determination--determination of quaternary muscle relaxants and their various metabolites, as well as other drugs, can be problematic. There are also toxicokinetic problems; because of poor kidney and liver function, low serum albumen, general malaise, and interactions between these factors and other drugs, the kinetics of a given drug can differ from normal. This makes it all the more difficult to determine whether the patient died from an accumulation of medication or from a so-called \"euthanetic\" drug mixture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY There is a debate on whether Geriatric Psychiatry stands for itself as a discrete specialty or whether it is an extension of clinical Geriatrics, Neurology, and Psychiatry. This review aims to outline some recent data and possible approaches to define peculiarities of Geriatric Psychiatry, focusing on certain characteristics that define the aging brain. Geriatric depression is discussed taking into consideration some data from translational research. The brain aging process is not uniform. Frontal areas show marked impairment in inhibiting irrelevant information in working memory as they age, and the recruitment of these areas occur differently than in young subjects. Executive functions also change in normal elderly. Geriatric depression is a general definition of a multidimensional disorder with multiple risk factors. Dysexecutive syndrome is considered as a key to the neuropsychology of geriatric depression, correlated with functional impairment in late life. Late‐onset depression has a higher load of comordibity, of cerebrovascular disease, and of some genetic factors that may be different from early onset depression. Also, there are at least four clusters of treatment outcomes that are common in geriatric depression, which mirror the neuropsychological and clinical profiles. Research and practice in Geriatric Psychiatry should focus on the interaction of various dimensions and risk factors rather than on attempting to find a single cause to the disorders. Some answers may be found in comorbidity issues, in white matter lesions, which are more common in the elderly, and in genetic factors that impact on the aging process.",

      "title": "Cell-based therapies for neural replacement strategies in stroke-related neurodegeneration: neurophysiological insights into stem progenitor cell neurogenesis within a host environment",
      "abstract": "The restricted neurogenesis limits the brain ability to overcome neuronal cell death following ischemic lesion: Failure of the damaged brain to regenerate following cerebral ischemia results in functional deficits those are most often irreversible and can further deteriorate, causing mortality and severe disability, progressive memory loss and cognitive impairments, known as dementia. This is caused by massive neuronal cell death and neurotoxicity following limited blood supply to the brain. Ischemic death of brain neurons (acute or delayed after lesion) has been the etiology of vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Multiple types of vascular dementia exist, common in cognitive decline that gradually worsens and variable in where strokes happen (subcortical dementia) or how severe lesions are (e.g., major stroke, series of small strokes or brief transient ischemic attacks). It has emerged a synergistic combination of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease that often comes (mixed dementia). For over the last three decades after the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death had been discovered, intense research has been focused on withdrawing or, at least, attenuating neurodegeneration to improve restoring function in experimental models of post-stroke cognitive impairments while mimicking focal ischemia, permanent or transient brain lesions, hypertension or reproducing Alzheimer's disease combined with vascular pathology [for review (Hainsworth et al., 2017)]. Long-standing perspectives that ischemic neuronal death might be potentially suspended through activation of endogenous neuroprotection stay with genomic reprogramming and/or gene activation for de novo protein synthesis, relied on the hypoxia-activated signaling pathways (Dirnagl et al., 2009). On the other hands, pre-clinical studies, including our own works (Kopach et al., 2016; Rybachuk et al., 2017), have reported functional impairments at the later times (weeks) post-ischemia (as in principal neurons as within network), with controversial effectiveness of pharmacological therapeutics utilized after lesion. Unfulfilled regeneration convinces experimental neuroscientists to focus on cell-based therapies for neuronal replacement strategies used to overcome massive neuronal loss in the brain tissue subjected to ischemia. The major issue, however, remains how this therapy should be utilized in order to promote beneficial effects timely, namely via engraftment of neural stem progenitor cells (NSPCs) or already differentiated stem cell-derived neurons into the damaged brain. From that, the other conceptual question arises regarding the regulatory role of a host environment in either NSPC neurogenesis or functional integration of the grafted stem cell-derived cells. If choose the latter, what 'proper' proportion of the entirely different phenotypes needs to be grafted to possibly succeed? More insights into this are essential when considering cell therapy while aiming at remodeling of the damaged post-stroke brain from mixed stem cell-derived cells for restoring the broken functionality of such a complex tissue as the brain. NSPC grafts mature neuronal phenotype within a host tissue in a weeks' time: The survival rate of differentiated stem cell-derived cells grafted into the organized brain tissue has been routinely low – this suggests a strong regulatory role of the host environment in the viability of stem cells. As an alternative, grafting NSPCs could potentially promote the multipotent stem cell differentiation and subsequent maturation of the entirely different phenotypes, regulated by endogenous environment, to pave the way towards 'self-repair' of damaged tissue while engaging the endogenous mechanisms of self-renewal. However, discoveries in this field are hampered by technical challenges and controversy in clinically translatable advances. Eventually, the enormous potential of stem cell therapy has been evidenced for post-stroke recovery (Tornero et al., 2017) while its neurophysiological basis has been much less learned thus far. Repeatedly reported common patterns of firing and synaptic activity have been recorded from the stem cell-derived neurons at the very end time-points – typically few months after transplantation – that fosters underestimation of the time-dependent neurophysiological integration of differentiated cells into the host tissue. In our recent study, we have traced the time courses of maturation and integration of the NSPC-derived neurons into the host circuits, demonstrating their matured excitability and synaptogenesis (to the level of endogenous principal neurons – CA1 pyramidal neurons) within 3 weeks or less in situ (Kopach et al., 2018). To neurophysiological point of view, biophysical properties (Na+/K+ conductance, capability for high-frequency firing, characteristic excitatory transmission) make these cells physiologically credible those are capable to constitute specified relationships with other cells, providing functional impact. This also points out the accelerated rate of neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts in situ when compared with much longer time required to achieve similar patterns of activity by stem cell-derived neurons in vitro (Morgan et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2012; Telezhkin et al., 2016). For restorative neuroscience, a query remains to precisely define the timing of NSPC-derived phenotypes mature and set the appropriate activity within the damaged, pathophysiological environment. Establishing this is primary to enabling the assessment of timing for emerging beneficial effects, to design and rationale further reaching perspectives for accelerating stem cell neurogenesis while considering replacement strategies for various post-stroke brain regions (subpopulations of neurons, other neural cell types). Post-ischemic environment regulates neurogenesis of NSPC grafts: An in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia provides technological advantages for feasibly exploring the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death together with managing therapeutic approaches for targeted interventions in the organized brain tissue. In translational neuroscience, this methodology benefits with a meaningful consideration of variable experimental modifications utilized to mimic ischemic insult and onset of cell therapy (depending on how severe and complex the ischemic impairments are, diverse stem cell origin, etc.). In our study of an in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia optimized for a delayed death of principal neurons [within 2 weeks instead of acute CA1 neuronal death (Rybachuk et al., 2017)], we have traced the functional properties of NSPC grafts over the time in the hippocampal tissue subjected to ischemia (Figure 1; Kopach et al., 2018). The post-ischemic environment influenced neurogenesis of NSPC grafts in different ways. Neuronal maturation has been delayed, both excitability and synaptogenesis, at each time points tested (for over 3 weeks in total; Figure 1). Instead, multipotent NSPC differentiation has been prompted towards the non-neuronal phenotype – we have identified the NSPC-derived glial cells as fast as within a week in the post-ischemic tissue. Such principal difference in the stem cell fate between control and post-ischemic environments implies the determinant, yet underestimated, regulatory role of the host tissue in neurogenesis of NSPCs, both differentiation profile (neuronal vs. non-neuronal) and neurophysiological maturation.Figure 1: The experimental scheme of neural stem progenitor cell (NSPC) administration in an in situ model of stroke.A carton shows the time course for functional assessment of the NSPC-derived neural maturation in a host tissue (organotypic hippocampal tissue subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation of 10 minutes duration, with onset of the therapy after 2 hours (h) of re-oxygenation). W: Week(s).Endogenous facilitators of stem cell fate: Ischemic cell damage results in the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity followed by massive neuronal death and overwhelmed neurotoxicity. Ultimately, different signaling molecules and mediators are released those levels became dramatically heightened, overloading the extracellular matrix and activating a vast majority of signaling pathways, with an immense variety of molecular mechanisms being involved. Moreover, during neuronal cell death, necrotic, pro-apoptotic factors and mediators of inflammation activate pro-inflammatory signaling, including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and others, pertinent to overactivated astrocytic response featuring the post-ischemic brain. Numerous signaling cascades can, thus, contribute to how the ischemia-subjected environment governs the fate of NSPC grafts. The notable regulatory roles in stem cell differentiation have been evidenced for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), Ca2+-dependent Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), and Wnt signaling pathways in in vitro and in vivo studies, among the involved cAMP, protein kinase C (PKC) and CaMK pathways, and phospholipase C and D signaling activation (Le Belle et al., 2011; Telezhkin et al., 2016). Therefore, pharmacological or genetic manipulations modulating presently dissecting signaling pathways, providing multiple growth facilitators, such as neurotrophins, to support intrinsic growth capacity of differentiating neurons, neutralizing high levels of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the post-ischemic tissue can accelerate neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts. Further, the supposed beneficial effects may include neurogenesis of the resident neural stem cells of the brain for activating endogenous self-renewal. By contrast, the non-neural (glial) NSPC differentiation, prompted up in the post-ischemic tissue, assumes the ROS-mediated regulation of NSPCs. The activated Notch signaling eliciting the latent neurogenic program in astrocytes after stoke (Magnusson et al., 2014) may have a synergistic effect on the post-ischemic NSPC differentiation to astrocytes. Functional restoration via multipotent NSPC function: Outcome after cell therapy is mediated by diverse mechanisms underlying functional improvements in the post-stroke recovery. Our study implies that NSPC therapy comprised primarily of promoted neurogenesis to a glial lineage that emerges shortly after initiating the therapy in the ischemia-subjected brain tissue (Kopach et al., 2018). This initial stage includes supplying the damaged tissue with the NSPC-derived astrocytes and oligodendrocytes – the output assuming the glia-related neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. The stem cell-derived astrocytes enhance the viability of brain cells by secreting various neurotrophic factors and supporting cell regeneration, evidenced for improving neurological function of post-stroke brain (Jiang et al., 2013), whereas oligodendrocytes' role has been proven in re-myelination and axon regeneration, both essential to synaptic networking (Figure 2). Such glial-directed differentiation of NSPC grafts, driven by overactivated master regulators that heavily burden the post-ischemic tissue, may mirror endogenous mechanism of boosting the glia-mediated tissue clearance following ischemic neuronal cell death. As the cellular debris became cleared and pro-apoptotic and inflammatory mediators recede, multipotent NSPC neurogenesis towards neuronal maturation takes place, which is the longer lasting process. Indeed, the ability of multipotent stem cells to mature with higher efficacy to neurons in astrocyte co-cultures had been evidenced. Other roles of glial cells have included the active astrocytic contribution to synapse formation, plasticity and remodeling that should facilitate network remodeling in the post-stroke tissue.Figure 2: The current concept of NSPC-therapy in stroke-related neurodegeneration encompasses the multipotent differentiation of NSPC grafts in a host tissue for replacement of various neural phenotypes after ischemia-induced cell loss for restoring the function in multiple ways.Conclusions and future perspectives: Ischemia-induced neuronal cell death is one of the leading causes of the brain damage that results in high rate of mortality and severe disability in patients after stroke (series of strokes). The stroke-related neurodegeneration gives rise to numerous neurological disorders, including cognitive decline (vascular dementia), motor disability (paralysis), and others associated with a wide range of impairments. Massive neuronal death after stroke could be barely overcame only by pharmacological interventions, but requires also implementation of cell therapies for replacement strategies. Although the long history of stem cell research had provided conceptual advances and clinical relevance of cell-based therapy, it has been less understood the neurophysiological basis of such tremendous effects of stem cells on the post-stroke recovery of brain function. Because recovery of the brain is not a single process, it is essential to clearly define the precise timing required for maturing of neurophysiological activity, ranging from intrinsic excitability to network function, for the entirely different stem cell-derived phenotypes. Dissecting this will expand the knowledge about stem cell therapy to find how best to use multiple routes of the therapy (induced pluripotent or embryonic stem cells) for the stroke-related neurodegeneration. More work is needed on defining the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell neurogenesis to provide the field with a meaningful consideration of cell therapy in context of promoting 'self-repair' of the post-stroke brain by engaging endogenous brain recovery mechanisms to power self-renewal. The perspective remains in accelerating neurophysiological maturation of neuronal phenotypes in the post-ischemic tissue tailored to enhancing the functional influence and, thereby, maximizing beneficial effects. Understanding the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell grafts will foster cell therapy use to augment therapeutic interventions in stroke-related neurodegeneration and to improve ultimate outcome.",

      "abstract": "Neurologists often pride themselves on their diagnostic skills (figure 1). Indeed, we often assume that having made a firm diagnosis, the flow of initial treatment and longer-term management will follow almost automatically. But with long-term review of patients, neurologists are perhaps better than most at challenging the so-called ‘established diagnoses’; not infrequently they question a previously assigned diagnostic label, or even find it necessary to remove a diagnosis from a patient. Removing a diagnosis lacks a descriptive verb; euphemisms might include ‘maturation of the diagnosis’, ‘diagnostic refinement’ and so on. We suggest that the more robust term ‘undiagnosis’. Stone et al 1 have discussed the different degrees of diagnostic shift. Here we address specifically the process of dealing with previous diagnostic errors, imparting a new diagnosis and removing a previous one.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 \nUndiagnosing sometimes requires the skills of Sherlock Holmes.\n\n\n\nThe process of ‘undiagnosing’ has not been studied in any detail; some might argue that it does not merit detailed study. Yet, the impact of the removal of a long-held diagnosis—not just on the patient, but also on their family, carers and other health professionals—may be substantial. Some might assume that removing an erroneous diagnosis could only be a positive event for a patient, but our experience suggests otherwise. We have witnessed the creation of considerable distress, anger and frustration in individuals who may have shaped their lifestyle, work pattern and home life according to a neurological label attached in years gone by.\n\nAdvances in diagnostic techniques seem likely to increase the need for neurological undiagnosis. Experienced practitioners will recognise the scenario of the patient with presumed Parkinson's disease whose dopamine transporter scan remains steadfastly normal, or the patient whose diagnosis of multiple sclerosis stretches back over several decades but whose first MRI scan is pristine in its normality.

      "title": "Psychobiology of fatigue during endurance exercise",
      "abstract": "Traditionally it has been assumed that highly motivated people terminate endurance exercise because of muscle fatigue or, more recently, because of the subconscious action of a central governor that forces humans to stop before exercise can cause serious bodily damage. This chapter described an alternative psychobiological model that integrates exercise physiology with motivation psychology and cognitive neuroscience to provide a single and testable theoretical explanation for the effects of both physiological and psychological manipulations on endurance performance. This psychobiological model also provides a novel explanation as to why perception of effort increases over time and how this fatigue interacts with motivational factors to determine for how long an individual can sustain endurance exercise.",

The psychological consequences of having a wound may include stress, sleep disturbances, negative mood and social isolation. These outcomes may be a result of the physical effects of the wound, such as pain or high levels of exudate. Wound management problems, mobility issues and malodour will also have an impact on the patient’s psychological well-being. These consequences may, in turn, have a profound impact on the healing of a chronic wound and therefore affect an individual’s quality of life.",

In the remaining ten patients there were no manifestation of any additive progressive disease or polyneuropathy. Unilateral trigeminal neuropathy is a benign disorder. The symptoms can persist, regress or even completely disappear. The significant delay in the reflex response of the blink reflex many years after onset of the disease probably signifies a very extensive involvement in the trigeminal nerve. In this disorder there seems to be no relationship to trigeminal neuralgia. In the examined cases viral etiology of the unilateral trigeminal neuropathy could be postulated.

D’abord, les diagnostics syndromiques sont modifiés. La définition de l’épisode dépressif caractérisé est simplifiée avec la suppression du critère d’exclusion lié au deuil. Ce choix, qui a pour but de mieux prendre en charge les dépressions post-deuil, a fait l’objet de nombreuses discussions et controverses. La définition de l’épisode maniaque ou hypomaniaque est également modifiée avec l’adjonction du symptôme modification de l’activité et de l’énergie [1]. Et les épisodes mixtes sont supprimés des diagnostics syndromiques et ré-intégrés comme caractéristiques spécifiques des troubles dépressifs ou bipolaires. Ce choix est secondaire aux excès antérieurs de diagnostics d’épisodes mixtes. Pour les chapitres troubles dépressifs [1] et troubles bipolaires [1], de nouvelles caractéristiques spécifiques apparaissent : les caractéristiques mixtes [1] (définies pour les épisodes dépressifs majeurs par la présence de 3 symptômes maniaques), les symptômes anxieux [1], et les caractéristiques spécifiques de risque suicidaire. Par ailleurs, de nouvelles entités sont introduites dans le chapitre troubles dépressifs [1]. Il s’agit du trouble dysphorique pré-menstruel, qui figurait auparavant dans l’appendice, et d’un nouveau trouble de l’enfant, le disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [1]. Enfin, dans le chapitre entités nécessitant de nouvelles études [1], apparaissent Ies épisodes dépressifs avec hypomanie de courte durée, le deuil pathologique complexe et persistant et les comportements suicidaires pathologiques. Ces différentes modifications devraient permettre, via leur remboursement, une meilleure prise en charge, aux États-Unis, du deuil pathologique, du risque suicidaire et du syndrome pré-menstruel pathologique.",

      "abstract": "Psychological outcomes of aesthetic surgical procedures like hair transplantation are mostly positive including decreased anxiety, depression and social phobia and increased general well-being, self-efficacy and self-esteem. However, some patients may suffer from post-surgical depression and post-surgical increased suicide rates have been reported for breast augmentation patients. Difficulty adapting to the new image, unfulfilled psychological needs expected to be met by the surgery, side effects of the surgery like tissue swelling or bruising, uncontrolled pain, presence of body dysmorphic disorder and previous history of mood disorder may be some of the risk factors for post-surgical depression.Here, we present a case without prior psychiatric history who developed major depressive disorder after hair transplantation and died of suicide.He started experiencing religious struggle related to his decision about the hair transplant which he interpreted as acting against God's will. While religious involvement has been reported to be a protective factor against depression, spiritual struggle, which includes religious guilt, has been described as an important risk factor for depression, hopelessness and suicidality which might explain the severity of depression in our patient.This case highlights the importance of a detailed psychiatric evaluation and exploration of religious concerns of any patient before any type of aesthetic surgery. Major depressive disorder is a treatable condition; however, mild depression can go unnoticed. Religious belief and related religious practices affect an individual's personal health attitudes; therefore, we think that every physician is needed to explore the religious concerns of any patient during any medical examination or surgical procedure. Relevant religious authorities should be consulted when necessary.",

Only reluctantly do some physicians attend to and express personal needs.

Too often, depression remains unrecognized or untreated until the physician's self-destructive pattern compromises his capacity to care for his patients.

This means that in the course of their individual life people have not found satisfying solutions for conflicts and identity endangering stress. The result of such a process often means an advancement of diseases in old age. This is the reason why it is very important-especially for aged and/or care-needing people-that concepts are developed in the field of geriatric nursing that provide solutions for life that has been \"misunderstood\". But the old-peoples-care, which is oriented one-sidedly on physical deficiency, prevents the process of reconciling with lived and not lived life. The consequence is that certain forms of diseases in correspondence with changes in behavior leading to aggression, apathy, depression etc. are supposedly (medically) \"cured\" or \"stagnated\" by the use of neuroleptica. The possibility of a self-responsible, positive life-mastering is suppressed. The questions for the causes of psychological changes at old age remain unasked, and they are simply called \"mental and physical stagnation caused by old-age\". In practice, this means that the geriatric system rather supports illness than health and self-determination at old age.",

Because there is no obvious organic cause, it is considered a nonspecific pain. This Focus Article proposes a hypothesis based on the following pathophysiological cascade: chronic anxiety or posttraumatic stress leads to a dysregulation of the adrenal production of steroids. One consequence is a decreased or a modified production of some major precursors for the neuroactive steroid synthesis occurring in the skin, mucosa, and nervous system. At menopause, the drastic fall of the other main precursor supply, the gonadal steroids, leads to a brisk alteration of the production of neuroactive steroids. This results in neurodegenerative alterations of small nerve fibers of the oral mucosa and/or some brain areas involved in oral somatic sensations. These neuropathic changes become irreversible and precipitate the burning pain, dysgeusia, and xerostomia associated with stomatodynia, which all involve thin nerve fibers.",

      "title": "An Undervalued Diagnosis: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in the Perinatal Period: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perinatal Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a disorder that occurs around childbirth, typically after a traumatic birth experience, where women may feel violated due to traumatic childbirth interventions they cannot control. Traumatic birth is defined as an event in which the mother perceives a real or perceived threat to herself or her baby, causing intense fear, helplessness, and horror. This can be considered an obstetric sequel. It is relevant to note that among pregnant women, perinatal PTSD is the third most common psychiatric disorder, with a prevalence ranging from 0.8% to 43% worldwide. Despite its significance, it is little-known, underdiagnosed, and often confused with other conditions such as depression or anxiety. Furthermore, it results in serious family, social, and occupational dysfunctions and is associated with other pathologies. Clinically, women with perinatal PTSD experience symptoms such as re-experiencing the event, detachment from the newborn, nightmares, irritability, and rejection of motherhood. This can lead to consequences for the mother, ranging from a desire not to become pregnant again to severe symptoms such as dissociation, stress, anxiety, and depression. It also affects those close to the mother, such as the partner and family. The aim of this work is to describe perinatal PTSD and emphasize the importance of early identification and appropriate treatment by medical professionals for the benefit of mothers and their children THE CASE: We describe a 35-year-old patient with a history of mixed depressive and anxiety disorder since 2018 experiences perinatal post-traumatic stress disorder. This is related to physical and verbal abuse during her second childbirth, resulting in a traumatic experience. Her childhood was marked by the feeling that her mother favored her younger sister and subjected her to physical and emotional abuse. The first pregnancy was unplanned, and she faced humiliation and abandonment by her partner. Despite the circumstances, the birth was a positive experience. The second pregnancy was planned and desired, but during childbirth in a different clinic from the first, she experienced inadequate care conditions, a lack of privacy, and physical abuse by medical staff. She also received inappropriate comments from the attending gynecologist. During the postpartum period, she shared a room with a cancer patient, complicating her experience. After childbirth, she experienced a hypertensive disorder in the postpartum and chose not to return to the hospital where she gave birth due to her traumatic experiences. Overall, her story reveals a series of challenging experiences related to motherhood that have contributed to her current mental health state. CONCLUSION: Perinatal PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that affects a significant number of pregnant and postpartum women. Its prevalence varies widely, reflecting the need for increased awareness and early detection. Despite its considerable impact on maternal mental health and well-being, perinatal PTSD is often overlooked or confused with other conditions such as depression and anxiety. It's important to raise awareness among medical staff about this disorder and provide a comprehensive and empathetic approach to enhance care for mothers during childbirth and the postpartum period.",

      "title": "Review of Delusional Jealousy and Its Association with Sexual Dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "Introduction Mental state changes can affect one’s sexual life, while sexual dysfunction can lead to relationship challenges. Delusional jealousy, also called Othello syndrome, involves a paranoid belief in a partner’s infidelity, leading to controlling and violent behaviors. It can manifest as a paranoid disorder, as a delusional symptom of psychiatric, neurological or other medical conditions, or as side effect of dopaminergic medication. Although its exact prevalence remains uncertain, it has been identified in 0.5-1.4% of psychiatry inpatients. Objectives To describe sexual dysfunctions associated with delusional jealousy and to explore strategies for addressing these dysfunction. Methods A non-systematic review of the literature available at PubMed was conducted using the keywords “Sexual Dysfunction” AND “Delusional Jealousy OR Othello Syndrome”. Results A number of factors, including sexual dysfunction, can trigger or exacerbate delusional jealousy. This is especially true for middle-aged men who have a history of alcohol consumption, neurological or personality disorders. Individuals with sexual dysfunction experience feelings of insecurity, projecting these concerns onto their partners and suspecting extramarital relationships. On the other hand, sexual dysfunctions such as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, Female Sexual Arousal and Orgasmic Disorders, Erectile Dysfunction and Ejaculation Disturbance may occur as consequence of Othello Syndrome. Multiple factors contribute to these dysfunctions, including increased testosterone and cortisol levels, chronic alcohol use, comorbid psychiatric conditions and antipsychotics. There are reports of increased sexual desire, especially in cases of dementia. Conclusions Although the evidence is limited and dated, it points to a bidirectional association between delusional jealousy and sexual dysfunction. Further studies are essential to determine the prevalence and types of sexual dysfunctions in Othello syndrome, and the causal relationship between them. Additionally, investigating gender differences is crucial, given the male-centric focus of existing studies. This research can contribute to clinical care by promoting the screening for sexual issues and their integration into delusional jealousy management. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Depression is associated with abnormalities of the thyroid axis, but the role of thyroid hormone therapy is controversial. In patients presenting with depression, the thyroid status should be carefully evaluated since hypothyroidism can cause depression. Frank hypothyroidism should be treated in the usual fashion with L-thyroxine, which may reverse the depressive state. If subclinical hypothyroidism and/or autoimmune thyroiditis are present, T3 adjuvant administration (25 αg/day) should be seriously considered in patients resistant to tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) (and probably also) serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication. The possible efficacy of adjuvant T4 in reversing the depression of such subjects appears less than T3. In depressed patients with TCA or SSRI resistance and no evidence of hypothyroidism, the data available do not establish the therapeutic role of T3 in this situation. Multicenter controlled studies of T3 adjuvant therapy are required. The possible mechanisms through which T3 adjuvant therapy might be efficacious are discussed.",

      "title": "Cerebellar dysfunction in cervical dystonia",
      "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by abnormal, involuntary, and excessive co-contractions of agonist and antagonist muscles. It can affect one or several parts of the body and manifest itself as twisting movements, tremors or abnormal postures (1). When focal, it can affect the upper limb, the eye or the neck, resulting in writer’s cramp, blepharospasm and cervical dystonia, respectively.\nDystonia can be classified based on its clinical features or its underlying causes (2). A distinction is often made between two clinical phenotypes: an organic form of cervical dystonia (CD) and a functional form of it (f-CD) – also called psychogenic. The term organic refers to various entities where a neurological substrate is suspected or demonstrated to explain the physiopathology. By extension, it refers sometimes to idiopathic dystonia with typical clinical presentation. The term organic is mainly used in opposition to psychiatric entities such as psychogenic dystonia that is considered to be a functional movement disorder (FMD). Nowadays, both are regarded as clinical forms with different positive signs and diagnosis (2–4). Nonetheless, because of partly overlapping features, the distinction varies between experts giving the diagnosis (5,6); making the distinction between the two diagnoses a key challenge.\nDiagnosis of functional dystonia is mainly based on clinical criteria (3,4). However, a clinical study showed that about 37 of 87 idiopathic cervical dystonia patients were initially misdiagnosed as psychogenic (7). According to Dauer et al., (1998) “The only way to make the diagnosis with relative certainty is by finding persistent disappearance of the movements with psychiatric therapy” – when speaking about functional dystonia (8). Furthermore, the misdiagnosed patients receive the same chronical palliative treatment as the other dystonic patients yet without long-lasting improvement.\nMore in line with present nomenclature, our study includes idiopathic, adult-onset, focal, isolated cervical dystonia (CD) and functional cervical dystonia (f-CD). However, for the sake of simplicity, we will be referring to them as organic (CD) and functional (f-CD).",

A patient reacts to his disease, to his treatment, and to his physician with manifest psychological, cultural, and—for want of a better term—physiological regression. Where the regression is not manifest there are obvious pathological efforts of the patient to obscure it. 4. By means of iatrogenically induced regression it is possible to bring about new affects or mood states. 5.

      "title": "Behavior therapy of the sexual disorders",
      "abstract": "The behavioral therapies are bringing with them a new and interestingly effective approach to the treatment of sexual disorders based upon theories of learning. The two basic means used are: (1) reciprocal inhibition, as shown in J. Wolpe's (1958, 1961) systematic desensitization, wherein anxietyprovoking situations are overcome by the presentation of graduated fear stimuli in the presence of relaxation, and (2) aversive techniques, wherein pleasureful sexual sensations are converted to painful ones by chemical or electrical means. Systematic desensitization is what its name implies, a systematic or gradual desensitization to a noxious agent, through the use of the patient's visual imagination. It is most successful when employed against anxiety-provoking situations such as impotence, premature ejaculation, and frigidity. Also against the nonsexual aspects of homosexuality, exhibitionism, and other sexual deviations. The pleasureful aspects of the sexual deviations present another problem. It is no easy task to induce a person to give up what to him is exquisite pleasure. Consequently, aversive therapy is used to convert the pleasure into pain. More of this later. Systematic desensitization is preceded by the taking of a detailed history as in any good medical examination. The history is of particular importance; it is used to determine the fear elements which enter into a disorder. As an instance, a woman who feared snakes was given a realistic synthetic snake to handle. She did so without compunction. Asked why it had not disturbed her, she replied that it was not the snake itself that bothered her, but the eyes and the forked tongue. Any list of fears must include these items separately. For another example, Eysenck (1960) recorded the history of a man with impotence which was present only when attempting intercourse with his wife at home; he did not experience it anywhere else. It appeared that as a young man he had been surprised by an irate husband in the process of seducing his wife. The husband thrashed the patient within an inch of his life. It happened that the wall",

      "abstract": "Dystonia is the third most common movement disorder. Cervical dystonia is the most common form of dystonia, a subtype of Primary Focal Dystonia due to the phasic and/or tonic involuntary contractions of different combinations of neck muscles, generally treated with good clinical results with botulin toxin type A or B injection. The etiology of cervical dystonia is still unknown. It was recently proposed that the cervical dystonia is due to malfunctioning of the head neural integrator, that result of impairment in cerebellar, basal ganglia, or proprioceptive feedback. The hypothesis of the existence of an electrical circuit that connects the basal ganglia with the cerebellum and the proprioception feedback, participating in the neural integrator of the head, explains that the damage at any point of the network can lead to motor deficits. Although dystonia is often associated with abnormal dopamine neurotransmission, dopaminergic drugs are not currently used to treat dystonia because there is a general view that they are ineffective. The results from the clinical trials and tests in mice suggest that the coactivation of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors may be an effective therapeutic strategy in some patients. These results support the assumption that dopamine receptors could be considered as targets for treating dystonia. Furthermore, a dopamine agonist-response dystonia in patients with an autosomal recessive L-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency, has been described in the scientific literature. We report a case of focal cervical dystonia successful treated with a dopamine agonist (D3>D2>D1) Rotigotine, a transdermal drug that induces a continuous dopaminergic stimulation.",

The stimuli are called stressors and physiological and behavioral changes in response to exposure to stressors constitute the stress response. A stress response is mediated by a complex interplay of nervous, endocrine, and immune mechanisms that involves activation of the sympathetic-adreno-medullar (SAM) axis, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and immune system. The stress response is adaptive, to begin with, that prepares the body to handle the challenges presented by an internal or external environmental challenge (stressor) e.g., the body's physiologic responses to trauma and invasive surgery serve to attenuate further tissue damage. But if the exposure to a stressor is actually or perceived as intense, repetitive (repeated acute stress), or prolonged (chronic stress), the stress response becomes maladaptive and detrimental to physiology e.g., exposure to chronic stressors can cause maladaptive reactions including depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and heart disease.",

      "title": "Action myoclonus, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and other cerebellar myoclonic syndromes.",
      "abstract": "Action myoclonus, reviewed in this chapter, is the term applied to arrhythmic muscular jerking induced by voluntary movement. It is made worse by attempts at precise or coordinated movement (intention myoclonus) and may also be provoked by certain sensory stimuli. The effective stimuli for action myoclonus is probably feedback from muscle afferents, although it may be initiated by corollary discharge from motor cortex to reticular formation before or at the onset of voluntary movement. The condition is usually associated with diffuse neuronal disease such as post-hypoxic encephalopathy, uremia, and the various forms of PME, although action myoclonus may be limited to one limb in some cases of focal cerebral damage. It is caused by hyperexcitability of the sensorimotor cortex (cortical reflex myoclonus) or reticular formation (reticular reflex myoclonus), or both. No consistent pathological change has been reported in autopsied cases of action myoclonus. The underlying disorder appears to be a loss of inhibitory mechanisms involving serotonin and possibly GABA as transmitter agents. The term PME is used for the association of myoclonus with degenerative changes in the nervous system which are commonly diffuse but may predominate in certain systems. There may or may not be associated tonic-clonic seizures, other manifestations of epilepsy, or dementia. Those cases of PME associated with Lafora inclusion bodies and cerebral storage diseases can be distinguished from the system degenerations. Systems which may be involved in the latter group include cerebellodentatorubral, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, optic, auditory, posterior columns and gracile and cuneate nuclei, spinocerebellar pathways, motor neurons of cranial nerves and anterior horns, and muscle fibers. Confronted with this diversity of pathological change, it seems unnecessary to make any clinical distinction between Ramsay Hunt syndrome and Unverricht-Lundborg syndrome (Baltic myoclonus) because cerebellar signs are found in patients described under both headings. Additional systems may be involved in individuals or families who are otherwise typical. All three names could well be joined in an eponymous title (Unverricht-Lundborg-Hunt disease) or the condition simply known as the systems degeneration type of PME, as Halliday (43) suggested. The cause of the condition (or spectrum of conditions) is at present unknown. Action myoclonus usually responds to sodium valproate or clonazepam, and some individuals, particularly those with posthypoxic myoclonus, improve with the administration of serotonin precursors.",

      "title": "Headache and Psychological Functioning in Children and Adolescents",
      "abstract": "Headache can affect all aspects of a child's functioning, leading to negative affective states (eg, anxiety, depression, anger) and increased psychosocial problems (for instance, school absences, problematic social interactions). For children and adolescents who experience frequent headache problems, comorbid psychological issues are a well‐recognized, but poorly understood, clinical phenomenon. The confusion surrounding the relationship between pediatric headache and psychopathology exists for several reasons. First, in some cases, headache has been inappropriately attributed to psychological or personality features based on anecdotal observations or interpretations that go beyond the available data. Additionally, measures of psychopathology have not always adhered to the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic criteria, thus reducing the reliability of diagnostic judgments. Furthermore, the diagnosis of headache has not always followed standard criteria, and has been complicated by the emergence of new terms and evolving measures. Finally, methodological shortcomings, such as incomplete descriptions of the procedures and criteria used for the study, inadequate descriptions of headache severity, lack of a control group for comparison with individuals without headaches, reliance primarily on cross‐sectional research designs that are often discussed with inferences to causal hypotheses, and the use of unstandardized assessment measures, have significantly limited the validity of research findings. The goal of the current review is to examine the extant literature to provide the most up‐to‐date picture on what the research has made available about the magnitude, specificity, and causes of psychopathology in children and adolescents with headache, in an effort to further elucidate their relationship and prompt a more methodologically rigorous study of these issues.",

Neurootologists clinically deal with many different disorders of the human cranial senses, of which tinnitus is a very frequent type. With respect to neurootological clinical work, we delineate at least three groups of tinnitus. In bruits, patients complain of noise within the head (e.g., bubbling, hissing, pulsating); the bruit can be recorded as a physically existing sound in the human skull and is heard by patients. Endogenous tinnitus can be treated by external masking to suppress noise within the ears, whereas in exogenous tinnitus, patients seek to avoid any outside noise or sounds; they report that tinnitus decreases as soon as they go, for instance, into the cellar of a house or other soundproof place.",

      "title": "Caroline: treating post-traumatic stress disorder after traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "Most people who suffer serious traumatic brain injury (TBI) have a period of loss of consciousness and post-traumatic amnesia that typically means that they do not recall the moment of injury itself. They may also have a gap in memory stretching from some time prior to injury to some time after the injury. Therefore despite going through the traumatic experience of a motor vehicle accident or assault or fall the individual may have no recollection of the incident itself. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mood disorder characterized by re-experiencing (flashbacks, nightmares), avoidance and arousal symptoms (e.g. hypervigilance) in relation to having experienced, witnessed or been confronted by an event involving death or serious injury that results in feelings of fear, helplessness or horror (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). In the context of amnesia for the traumatic event, the question as to whether PTSD can occur after TBI, has been the subject of some debate (Sbordone and Liter 1995; Bryant et al. 2000; Williams et al. 2002; Sumpter and McMillan 2006). However, it is generally accepted now that, through various different mechanisms, PTSD can occur after TBI (Bryant, 2001). Some people who suffer a closed head injury have partial recall of the incident (Creamer et al. 2005) with some experiencing specific ‘islands’ of memory for traumatic events (King, 1997).",

      "abstract": "• Summary: Somatoform disorders and functional somatic syndromes are defined as the presence of physical symptoms in the absence of sufficient tissue or organ damage to account for the degree of pain or dysfunction. Many people who suffer from these disorders have a history of childhood abuse. Because these individuals may also have a number of other difficulties in living, social workers encounter such clients in diverse fields of practice. Clients who fall into the category of adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder may experience certain interventions by doctors, therapists, and other helping professionals (including social workers) as repeating interactions they had with their abusers. • Findings: Adult survivors of abuse who have a somatoform disorder often have parallel experiences in terms of their abuse and their somatic symptoms: important others communicate that the abuse and the symptoms are not real, are the client’s fault, and/or that the client is over-reacting to the abuse and symptoms. Furthermore, adult survivors of abuse may experience helping professionals as distinctly non-nurturing and as engaging in distancing behaviours. These interactions may stand in the way of helping members of this population, or even add to the client’s distress. There are specific practices in which the social worker may engage to help avoid these kinds of relations. • Applications: Social workers in a number of fields of practice may be alerted to dynamics common among adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder. In the event that a client falls into this category, the informed social worker can avoid recapitulating abuse dynamics as well as help clients understand their diagnosis and why interactions with helping professionals may have been upsetting.",

Its etiology is still unclear, and the clinical presentation is quite heterogeneous, manifesting itself through obsessions and/or compulsions that are associated with high levels of anxiety and time consumption. Case Report A 40-year-old female, working as an administrative assistant in a hospital, with a history of almost 20 years of obsessive doubt and verification rituals. Due to the worsening of symptoms, and their high impact on work capacity, she started a psychiatry follow-up. Then, according to the employee’s expectations and limitations, she was transferred to a different workstation, with less social interactions and different responsibilities. Subsequently, after both interventions, significant clinical improvement was shown. Discussion The close relationship between Occupational Medicine and Psychiatry, unequivocally contributes to manage mental illness in the workplace, either identifying reasonable adjustments to meet the needs of workers with mental illness, or attending the ones noticed during their regular activities. Conclusion It is essential to implement strategies for effective communication between both medical specialities, and aim to prevent occupational risks, by protecting and promoting healthy workplaces.

Although the spasticity and dystonia symptoms are caused by different pathophysiological mechanisms, both of them may cause functional impairment that contributes to a poor quality of life. Spasticity is characterised by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex. It mostly occurs in disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) affecting the upper motor neurons, such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebrovascular diseases, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Therapeutic options may combine, in various proportions, physical therapy, occupational therapy, self-rehabilitation, the use of orthoses and assistive devices, drug treatment, orthopaedic surgery, and neurosurgery. Dystonia is defined as a syndrome of involuntary movement that manifests as excessive muscle contractions that frequently cause twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. It is often intensified or exacerbated by physical activity, and symptoms may progress into adjacent muscles. Dystonia has many different manifestations and causes, and many different treatment options are available. These options include physical and occupational therapy, oral medications, intramuscular injection of botulinum toxins, and neurosurgical interventions.",

      "title": "Are You Sure It’s Really Fibromyalgia?",
      "abstract": "A week doesn’t go by without a patient wanting my reassurance that he or she is not seriously ill or making it all up. “Are you just telling me it’s fibromyalgia because you don’t want me to be upset?” “A friend of mine told me that fibromyalgia is a ‘garbage can’ diagnosis that doctors give when they don’t know what you have.” These are frequent remarks or queries. How is your doctor really sure that something is not being missed? This chapter reviews some diseases with features that can overlap with or be mistaken for fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia can seem to be working in concert with other diseases. For example, untreated inflammation associated with an autoimmune disease (such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus), other forms of inflammatory arthritis (such as ankylosing spondylitis), or a chest disease known as sarcoidosis are associated with coexisting fibromyalgia. Withdrawal from or tapering of medications such as corticosteroids typically precipitates or aggravates fibromyalgia. Many disorders interact with or can be mistaken for fibromyalgia. They are reviewed here, as well as in other parts of this book, and listed in Table 11. Linda was not herself. Over a period of several months, she found it increasingly difficult to make it through the day. Her muscles started to ache, she gained 15 pounds while on the same diet, found it difficult to tolerate cold weather, and her voice became husky. Dr. Bridges did a complete blood count and a blood panel that was normal. He was impressed with her muscle aches and diagnosed her as having fibromyalgia. When Dr. White saw Linda in a rheumatology consultation, certain things did not fit. Weight gain, a hoarse voice, and cold intolerance of recent onset are not typical features of fibromyalgia, so she obtained additional tests that included a complete thyroid pel (triiodothyronine [T3], thyroxine [T4], thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]). Although the T3 and T4 levels were normal (as they had been with Dr. Bridges), the TSH (which was not part of Dr. Bridges’s panel) was quite high, indicating hypothyroidism. Linda was started on thyroid replacement therapy and was back to herself within a few weeks.",

Compared with placebo, treatment with imipramine hydrochloride in a multiple crossover design using threeweek treatment periods led to improved performance on the memory task without either clinically apparent improvement in depression or significantly improved performance on the other tasks. These results may reflect the relative complexity of the memory task rather than a specific impairment of short-term memory, but the data do support the presence of cognitive dysfunction in depression, even in ambulatory patients without substantial impairments of attention or motor functioning. The results also indicate that antidepressant drugs can produce improvement in cognitive function, possibly as a forerunner of clinical improvement.",

Headaches may occur at any time during pregnancy, but they tend to be most common during the first and third trimesters.The aim of this study is to review of headache in pregnancy. Etiology: An increase in headaches during the first trimester is believed to be caused by the surge of hormones along with an increase in the blood volume. These headaches may be further aggravated by stress, poor posture or changes in vision. Other causes of headaches during pregnancy may involve by Lack of sleep ,Low blood sugar , Dehydration ,Caffeine withdrawal ,Stress .Women who have regular migraine headaches may discover that they experience fewer migraines during pregnancy; however, some women may encounter the same number or even more migraine headaches. Headaches during the third trimester tend to be related more to poor posture and tension from carrying extra weight. Headaches during the third trimester may also be caused by preeclampsia. Treatment: Drugs are commonly used during pregnancy despite insufficient knowledge about their effects on the growing fetus. Most drugs are not teratogenic but Nonpharmacologic treatment is the ideal solution; however, analgesics such as acetaminophen and opioids can be used on a limited basis. Discussion: Most headaches follow a benign course during pregnancy, although migraine is associated with increased risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and stroke. Management of primary headaches during pregnancy is essentially similar to management in the nonpregnant state, with a few exceptions.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Koro syndrome is a culturally related disorder characterized by intense anxiety that the penis (vulva or nipples in females) is shrinking or retracting and will recede into the body. Usually it occurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, being extremely rare in western countries. The condition is more common in males and is classified within Obsessive Compulsive and Related Disorders. Case report A 27-year-old single man was referred to the psychiatric department. By the age of 23, he began worrying that his penis was shrinking and retracting into the abdomen. He described these thoughts as intrusive, ridiculous and repetitive. During the first months the thoughts were not very disturbing but he progressively developed an urge to verify the length of his penis several times a day. To diminish the anxiety provoked by the obsessive doubts on penis length, he started to have repetitive thoughts and mental images about sexual acts, to consume pornography compulsively and to increase his masturbatory behaviors (from some times a week to several times a day). He described those thoughts and behaviors as unpleasant and uniquely driven to reduce anxiety provoked by obsessions. He was prescribed fluvoxamine 200 mg/day and initiated cognitive behavioral therapy with good response. Y-BOCS score decreased from 30 at initial evaluation to 18 after 3 months of treatment. Conclusions Koro syndrome is a very rare condition in psychiatry in western countries, usually presenting secondarily to other psychiatric disorders. Awareness of this diagnosis and knowledge on its management are critical to provide optimal care to patients.

This includes a good vary of psychological or psychiatrically disorders and infrequently needs psych iatrical intervention. Conditions will be caused by either a biological origin like genetic, chemical, and anatomical; or a psychological origin like trauma or conflict. Extraordinary advances are created within the treatment of psychological state. Associate degree understanding of what causes some psychological state disorders has crystal rectifier to larger sophistication in trade treatment to the underlying basis of every disorder. As a result, several psychological state disorders will currently be treated nearly as with success as physical disorders. Most treatment ways for psychological state disorders will be classified as either bodily or psychotherapeutic. Bodily treatments embody drug medical care and electroshock therapy. Psychotherapeutic treatments embody individual, group, or family and matrimonial psychotherapy; psychotherapy techniques (such as relaxation coaching or exposure therapy); and psychotherapy. Most studies recommend that for major psychological state disorders, a treatment approach involving each medication and psychotherapy is more practical than either treatment technique used alone. The psychotherapeutic drug trade continues to go through a quad of problems that square measure directly or indirectly poignant competition. Some hurdles recently faced by competitors during this market embody advertising restrictions, label changes, and a few general negative views regarding psychological state treatments. However, there are respectable strides in several areas of the market as well as advanced delivery techniques, increased education and awareness efforts, and improved effectiveness.",

      "title": "Unusual manifestations of hypothyroidism",
      "abstract": "• Thyroid hormone exerts direct effects on essentially all of the organ systems of the body. Hypothyroidism is a frequently diagnosed endocrine disorder that has characteristic clinical signs and symptoms. In addition to these common manifestations, however, there are many additional manifestations of hypothyroidism that are less commonly acknowledged and Include involvement of the hematologic, muscular, cardiac, and rheumatologic systems. It is important to recognize that these other organ systems may be involved and that the resulting disease states can dominate the clinical picture. As with the classic manifestations of hypothyroidism, these unusual manifestations respond to thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Thus, the importance of recognizing these signs and symptoms, as a result of hypothyroidism, is evident. This article emphasizes these less common manifestations of the patient with hypothyroidism, and, in addition, discusses the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms by which thyroid hormone deficiency can lead to organ system dysfunction.

      "abstract": "Degenerative cervical myelopathy is a chronic, nontraumatic compression and progressive disease of the cervical spinal cord. Osteoarthritic degeneration (spondylosis, facet hypertrophy, degenerative disc disease), ligament changes (ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum) and ischemia (secondary ischemic injury) may lead to spinal cord compression and result in neurological deficits. Clinically, the appendicular function is mainly affected, as well as gait and urinary function. Duration and degrees of compression are negatively correlated with prognosis. Non-operative treatment can be performed in mild symptomatic cases; however, surgical treatment may possibly improve the natural course of cervical myelopathy disease by stopping progression or avoiding deterioration and, in some cases, restoring some neurological function.",

The first essential difference is that the emotional involvement of the care staff is not as intensive as those of other cancer patients. Other differences concern some illness- and therapy related effects such as family problems or monotony problems resulting from the longterm therapy. These specific problems are described in detail.",

      "title": "Prolonged delirium misdiagnosed as a mood disorder",
      "abstract": "Delirium can be conceptualized as an acute decline in cognitive function that typically lasts from hours to a few days. Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes. Na prática clínica, o delírio prolongado é muitas vezes não reconhecido, e pode ser diagnosticado como outros transtornos psiquiátricos. Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",
